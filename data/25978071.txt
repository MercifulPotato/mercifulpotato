We (society) have had this computer in our pockets for a while, seems to be making things less equal, as per the report.<p>It (your clothes, car, food, phone) is at the expense of slave labor around the world.<p>I&#x27;m not pessimistic. Health, hunger, literacy, longevity, are on the up. But Wealth Inequality, the OP topic, is also on the up. To view things otherwise is turning your back on the plight of others. Such issues are not conquered, there is no final victory. Each generation must fight the same battles to maintain their voices and remain relevant.')
