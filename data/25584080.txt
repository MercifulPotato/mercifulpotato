Like, classical music theory has to bend over backwards describing very common and pleasant groupings of chords (think Debussy), but in BH stuff, by adding an extra note to the major scale, now all of that stuff is not only easy to explain it’s in fact very natural. What I like especially about it is how all the very diatonic stuff ends up being slight outliers (ie “borrowing” notes from neighboring diminished chords), while the combination of maj6 + dim is the standard.  It creates very pleasing sounds.')
