If anyone has gotten this to work with the latest builds, I&#x27;d be happy to try out their configs.<p>I&#x27;ve also tried out the alternatives of krohnkite (hi esjeon!) but what really breaks KDE is that you can&#x27;t assign a workspace to each monitor. I have 3 monitors and I can independently assign each workspace to each monitor in i3wm and you can switch between them really easily. Its a massive productivity boost which keeps me sticking to i3wm even though KDE is more fully featured (blue-tooth, OSD etc...)')
