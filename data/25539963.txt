Item(by='majewsky', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608938888, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25528691, text='&gt; Most of the music in BoTW is quiet and subdued, unlike previous entries in the series.  This is good for setting a certain tone, but it&#x27;s less effective unless there&#x27;s some flashier music to contrast with.  To me, the lack of music made the game feel even emptier.<p>Hilariously, I had the opposite experience. BotW was the first Zelda game I played extensively (I have some memories from OoT and MM because a friend had an N64 back in the day, but never played it myself for anything more than 10 minutes).<p>After finishing BotW, I wanted to play the Link&#x27;s Awakening remake. But I had to walk away from it after about an hour because the endless barrage of music was annoying me to no end. (I have since adjusted to it.) I&#x27;m currently playing Age of Calamity, where the soundtrack does not feel as obnoxious because there&#x27;s actual action going on all the time. After that, I might be able to go back to Link&#x27;s Awakening.<p>Also:<p>&gt; it&#x27;s less effective unless there&#x27;s some flashier music to contrast with<p>IMO there is tons of flashy music in this game. The cities&#x27; motifs, the champion&#x27;s motifs, the castle music, the Divine Beast tracks, the fight tracks in general. I have hours-long playlists of all of that as my go-to background music for work.')
