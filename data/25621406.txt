Item(by='fishtacos', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609677221, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25620625, text='Unraid provides real time data protection, whereas Snapraid with mergerfs provide disk pooling and scheduled snapshots. That&#x27;s its greatest feature IMO - expandability and data protection without rigid expansion requirements.<p>AFAIK, it&#x27;s one of a kind. Flexraid on Windows was the closest I  had found (a product I still use on an old install - software and owner disappeared - although I did manage to track down the patent and the developer once, seems to have moved on to other interests&#x2F;employment)')
