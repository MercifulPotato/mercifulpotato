Also, the kind of thing that doesn&#x27;t show up in the totally-informal &quot;how many of my post-hoc tests pass the first time I get them to compile&quot; metric.<p>Another point, which to your credit you didn&#x27;t make but which is nonetheless true, is that I am not a good Rust programmer!<p>I don&#x27;t think Rust is less reliable than Go in the large. I do think there are more things you have to get right in a Rust program than in a Go program, so it&#x27;s &quot;less reliable&quot; in that weird twilight state when you&#x27;re first bringing up your program.<p>I do agree that Go punishes practitioners for abstraction. If you&#x27;re, like, you, that&#x27;s a very bad thing. If you&#x27;re working with a team of people for whom the project is a means to an end and not a brilliant-cut gemstone, putting the brakes on abstraction can be a good thing, which I think a lot of Rust programmers will quickly learn after the nth time they&#x27;ve had to do an edit-compile cycle just to `let () = something` to figure out a type.')
