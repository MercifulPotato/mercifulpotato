Donning the suit is a little more complicated than just strapping on a skydiving rig and you need a fair amount of experience to successfully fly one to begin with. Your parachute system threads through the wingsuit, you still need to tighten leg straps inside the suit before zipping up, tighten a chest strap after zipping up, then zip the arm and leg wings and exit the aircraft with a correct body position and delay to avoid slamming into the tail depending on what type of aircraft it is. It takes a few minutes to put everything on while on the ground, I can&#x27;t imagine trying to put everything on while a plane is out of control and get it all adjusted properly during an aircraft emergency. Wingsuiters suit up on the ground before boarding so all that&#x27;s left is to zip up your arm wings and leave the aircraft.')
