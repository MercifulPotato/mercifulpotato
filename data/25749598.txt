The point is - we spend $X&#x2F;year on infrastructure, but people only seem to think that infrastructure is worth &lt;$X&#x2F;year, so there will forever be a deficit.<p>The Strong Town books also discusses what happened with a lack of regulation throughout almost all of human history: everyone lived in rural areas to work a farm, or else lived and worked in dense urban areas. American suburbia happened in large part not due to a lack of regulation at the top, but federal money being spent on roads, highways and infrastructure at the top.')
