It has &quot;falsifiable claims&quot; in the sense that, if existing theories of e.g. general relativity and quantum mechanics were proven false, it would <i>also</i> be proven false. Generally when people refer to &quot;falsifiable claims&quot; they&#x27;re referring to falsifiable claims that are not already made by a more parsimonious theory. As far as I understand the field, string theory has made no such claims.<p>And yes, that&#x27;s what I meant by LQG being a less mature theoretical space. Either LQG will fail to find a solution for 3D space (so sad), or it will and its solution will make falsifiable predictions that are not part of existing theory (yay!), or it will propose a set of solutions that make no new falsifiable predictions (in which case it enters the same state as string theory). Both of those first two possibilities would be forward progress.')
