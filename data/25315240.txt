My point is that researchers (as well as everyone!) have <i>biases</i>, which may manifest in the end as racism or other forms of discriminations. To prevent these biases from manifesting, (AI) ethics experts are needed as oversight.<p>&gt; the company that employs them is racist<p>To take the example of the &quot;racist soap dispenser&quot; again: while the individual people who have developed it may not have been racist, they <i>have</i> failed to think outside their biases and ask themselves &quot;can people with non-white skin use the product?&quot;. Also, management has failed here, because more diverse staff would have resulted in at least one internal test candidate of color noticing &quot;hey, I can&#x27;t get soap!&quot;.<p>The result of this lack of diversity and out-of-the-ordinary thinking was that a person of color was rightfully offended at not being dispensed soap. Therefore, <i>the company acted racist</i> even if it never intended to do so.<p>&gt; the whole country is racist<p>Just short of half of the country recently elected a President who openly spouted white-supremacist conspiracy theories. For half the people in the US racism is not a dealbreaker for the highest office it has to offer!')
