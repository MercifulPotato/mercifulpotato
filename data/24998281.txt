We will call to verify your employment days before closing. You&#x27;d be surprised how many people decide to make stupid career decisions in the middle of loan financing. One guy I had quit his flooring job to become his own contractor. Another lost her job cause their restaurant burned down. I also had one lady get laid off literally the week of our closing (which was awful cause their employer didn&#x27;t even mention anything to us when we requested her pay information weeks earlier).<p>What we&#x27;d always tell the borrowers is &quot;don&#x27;t make any life changing decisions while your in this process. Do it AFTER we give you the money!&quot;')
