The former focuses on meeting your own needs through using &#x27;the skill of empathy&#x27; to create a bond of kinship and be more likely to execute a sale. The latter focuses on understanding the needs of others, even if — <i>especially</i> if — doing so does not advance your own needs.<p>I am courteous to those around me on phone support calls and in businesses because I can understand — I can empathize — what they&#x27;ve been through with other people yelling at them, mistreating them, and gaslighting them. I may not be friendly, I may not be effusive, I may not be agreeable — I certainly am <i>not</i> known for being agreeable — but I will do my very best to keep it together, because I&#x27;ve been yelled at before, and I would consider that a grievous harm committed upon another.<p>I think one time I was grinding my teeth I was so angry that they could hear it on the phone, and my voice was flat, tense, and cold to the bone, and I made specifically sure — even amidst my rage at the harm committed by their employer — to thank them and say goodbye politely. It wasn&#x27;t a warm goodbye, but it was definitely courtesy, and I don&#x27;t think they expected it.<p>The comments up and down this post fail to distinguish these two definitions. In both cases, you&#x27;re &quot;understanding how the other person feels&quot; — literally, empathizing — but it&#x27;s how you <i>use</i> that information, and to <i>whose</i> benefit your use serves, that is causing such confusion in the replies.<p>If someone walks into your store purposefully and doesn&#x27;t want to make eye contact, empathy suggests that you should let them be <i>and</i> keep an eye on them. This is a great example because they clearly don&#x27;t want to be hassled by you, and you clearly shouldn&#x27;t allow yourself to be shoplifted from.<p>If you use empathy to persuade people to buy things that they&#x27;ll regret buying once they&#x27;ve left your store, that&#x27;s generally considered a variation of &#x27;evil&#x27; and is the subject of fables and fiction, not the least of which being an absolutely terrifying rated-R book called &#x27;Needful Things&#x27; by Stephen King. People will leave some of the angriest Yelp reviews you&#x27;ve ever seen for a business that uses this tactic, not just because they feel taken advantage of themselves, but specifically to protect <i>others</i> from feeling that way. They literally empathize with your future customers and will do their best to warn them away.<p>So, when someone says &quot;show a little empathy&quot;, they&#x27;re telling you that you&#x27;ve prioritized your needs higher than those they think you&#x27;re disregarding as irrelevant. They may or may not be right, but that&#x27;s a <i>very</i> common context for negative comments about your skills at empathy.<p>It&#x27;s also common for kindly people to have absolutely no clue what&#x27;s going on in other people&#x27;s minds. You&#x27;ll see them hold the door for someone who&#x27;s about to drop three bags of groceries — missing the forest for the trees, so to speak, but still genuinely making an effort to care at no benefit to themselves. They&#x27;ll be confused and sad when you drop your groceries, because they would have helped if they&#x27;d realized.<p>To restate this all in dry terms for nerds like me — The default context for &quot;show more empathy&quot; is a request that you <i>increase</i> the priority of donating your energy and time to social support of others without expectation of reward to yourself. In specific contexts like Sales and Marketing, it means not only &quot;listen more closely to the customer&#x27;s needs&quot; but also &quot;understand that sometimes the customer&#x27;s needs may prevent the sale&quot;. And you can flip this around, too — if someone says &quot;you have to put up some shields&quot;, they&#x27;re usually telling you that you&#x27;re going too far with your concern for social support of others, and need to back it down a notch and worry a bit less and take care of your own self.<p>I hope this will help you and others align your definition and uses and contexts of the word &quot;empathy&quot; more closely with the world&#x27;s.')
