Especially compared to the somewhat neglected suite of native inference tools for TensorFlow. Just recently I was trying to get a TensorFlow 2 model to work nicely in C++. Basically, the external API for TensorFlow is the C API, but it does not have proper support for `SavedModel` yet. Linking to the C++ library is a pain, and both of them cannot do eager execution at all if you have a model trained in Python code :(<p>PyTorch will happily let you export your model, even with Python code in it, and run it in C++ :)')
