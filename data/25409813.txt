Except that some of the measures they used may have been unconstitutional in the US, and Australia is an island. The US has 4500 miles of porous borders with other countries.<p>And covid spreads asymptomatically, so the only way to get to where Australia is now is to get the number of cases down to basically zero. Which you can&#x27;t do if you get 40 more from Mexico every week.<p>Notice that Australia is basically the only country that has managed to succeed with this; western Europe is doing little better than the US.<p>&gt; Cutting funding to certain CDC programs may also have been detrimental.<p>This is fake news. The budget cuts were proposed (as a starting point for budget negotiations with Congress) but never actually enacted:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factcheck.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;democrats-misleading-coronavirus-claims&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factcheck.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;democrats-misleading-coron...</a><p>&gt; Disparaging mask use is also generally considered to be harmful.<p>That you can put directly at the feet of CNN. They were writing a national story every time Trump would appear on camera without a mask, even if he was giving a speech to a camera with no audience or was in a room with entirely people being covid tested every day. Trump supporters started defending him which predictably turned it into a partisan issue.<p>It also didn&#x27;t help that the <i>CDC</i> was disparaging mask use early on, ostensibly in order to preserve PPE for medical professionals, which gave everybody plenty of ammunition to fight about it.')
