Unions aren&#x27;t optimizing for company productivity, but for the conditions and pay of the workers. And conversely, a company can abuse its employees to a large degree while reaping productivity gains from it.<p>&gt; <i>However Amazon is barely profitable as it currently stands. Since there&#x27;s essentially no room for lower profitability.</i><p>Amazon is &quot;barely profitable&quot; because of clever accounting. They rake in tons of money, and reinvest it into growth. There is plenty of buffer to eat the unionization costs. But of course Amazon may opt to pass these costs to customers instead.')
