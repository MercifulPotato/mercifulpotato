Which is the federal budged you mentioned (it&#x27;s not million btw).<p>The bottom 50% of the us population have 2 Trillion.<p>Those 4+ trillion federal budget include that ridiculous amount of defense spending, that&#x27;s essentially welfare for the rich.<p>Now imagine if you could increase the federal budget by 25% for 4 years, just for science and education, and as a side effect you get a continued plus through the reduced negative effects of massive political influence by a small elite of 600 people.<p>There would probably a positive societal impact if you took those 4 trillion and burned them. Getting to spend them means, moon colonies, mars missions, broadband internet everywhere, proper healthcare for all, and maybe a shot at surviving the climate and biosphere collapse...')
