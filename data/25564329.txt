We can do things now that were downright impossible when A&amp;S recorded their Lisp lectures simply because we can think differently about what&#x27;s reasonable with regards to time and space complexity. And, of course, Abelson himself jokes about everyone wanting a faster computer in a later lecture.<p>Perhaps we&#x27;re simply confusing CS with software development, which I suppose could be likened to confusing mathematics with accounting.')
