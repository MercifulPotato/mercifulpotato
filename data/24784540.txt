Item(by='fao_', descendants=None, kids=[24784759], score=None, time=1602731911, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24784500, text='&gt; How much does Zoom&#x27;s software differ from Cisco&#x2F;Webex?<p>It&#x27;s been 9 years, so I would guess quite a lot.<p>&gt; Should Cisco&#x2F;Webex sue Zoom for IP theft?<p>I mean they probably <i>could</i>, but this is more of an employee retention problem. If Cisco had not mismanaged the engineering department (And if they had not mismanaged the engineering department, then why did Â±1000 engineers decide to leave for a competitor within a week), they would have been able to build the software in the way they seemed to feel they could at Zoom. This is Cisco&#x27;s fault.<p>What&#x27;s the point of having intellectual property if it is very clearly inferior to that of a brand new startup with a lot of the same engineers? How much is that IP worth if a significant number of your employees decide to leave to work on a product in the same space, because <i>you can&#x27;t do it right?</i>')
