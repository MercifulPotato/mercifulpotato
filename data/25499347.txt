Item(by='andrewjl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608583515, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25496402, text='&gt; The language I&#x27;m about to use pains me, but this is an extremely privileged take, or at least naive take<p>I think the take outlined later in the post is the privileged take. Sure those who are lucky enough to be accepted into a school with an alumni network, name recognition, can leverage those connections. But at what cost? Paying off debts until mid to late 40s? It&#x27;s certainly life changing as you say, but more of an &quot;out of the frying pan and into the fire&quot; type of change. Worse still is many of these students have no warning of this (legalese in promissory notes isn&#x27;t a fair warning) and once they sign the dotted line, no recourse. They won&#x27;t be buying home, won&#x27;t be starting families, and will be restricted in any type of career growth that doesn&#x27;t translate into higher incomes. But yes, they will enjoy great informational interviews.<p>Finally this post completely leaves out those who attended for-profit schools who provide none of the benefits listed and really have no business signing their students up for a lifetime of debt peonage.')
