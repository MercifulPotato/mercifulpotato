Textures are memory mapped but stored in nvme storage. When GPU reads a texture, it first looks in the ram, if not found in the ram, the controller talks to nvme controllers to load from storage.<p>If you think about it, gen4 pce nvme can reach 5GB&#x2F;s doing 16k ramdom reads. The bandwidth is getting close to ddr2&#x2F;3 territory.\nAnd new storage tech like 3dxpoint will have ram like access latency to improve small io perf.<p>You will always still need ram, but you can be more efficient at how to use the ram.')
