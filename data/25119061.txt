This is revenue. Revenue is taxed at 21% in the US as of the 2019 tax year. Now, if you screw up, and the IRS catches you, you owe penalties. And you owe interest on the money you didn’t pay. And these can add up, especially, like the S-1 filing says, if you have irregularities dating back 7 years.<p>I’m sure they will have to make a more detailed explanation of this at some point, and it should make for a good read whenever the release it. And they may take their accounting firm to court, because this is large enough to at least suspect negligence or fraud. But until something else happens, all we have is speculation.')
