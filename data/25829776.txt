It would have cost something like $25 billion, which is basically free compared to everything else going on right now.<p>Working out the logistics might have been a problem, but not an unsolvable one.<p>In general it&#x27;s really difficult to reconcile how unambitious &quot;Project Warp Speed&quot; has been. Small orders, minimal funds for states to build out vaccination programs, etc, etc.')
