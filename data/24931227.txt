For the stock market is a social construct: The decisions of buyers and sellers at every instant construct the market. Widespread fear can cause a crash.<p>Coincidentally, Nobel prize winner Robert Shiller wrote a piece about this just last week: &quot;People Fear a Market Crash More Than They Have in Years&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;23&#x2F;business&#x2F;people-fear-a-market-crash-more-than-they-have-in-years.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;23&#x2F;business&#x2F;people-fear-a-ma...</a>). Quoting Shiller:<p><i>&gt; Consider what my Crash Confidence Index[a] is telling us. That measurement of sentiment about the safety of the stock market is based on this question: “What do you think is the probability of a catastrophic stock market crash in the U.S., like that of Oct. 28, 1929, or Oct. 19, 1987, in the next six months, including the case that a crash occurred in the other countries and spreads to the U. S.?”<p>The index is a rolling six-month average of the percentage of monthly respondents who think that the probability of such a major crash is less than 10 percent. In August, the percentage of individual investors with that level of confidence in the market hit a record low, 13 percent. The most recent reading in September, 15 percent, was still extremely low.</i><p>[a] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;som.yale.edu&#x2F;faculty-research-centers&#x2F;centers-initiatives&#x2F;international-center-for-finance&#x2F;data&#x2F;stock-market-confidence-indices&#x2F;united-states-stock-market-confidence-indices" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;som.yale.edu&#x2F;faculty-research-centers&#x2F;centers-initia...</a>')
