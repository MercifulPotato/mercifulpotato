It&#x27;s just not that easy with other devices.<p>Not sure how apple devices &quot;just switch&quot;, it might be that they have multi-device bluetooth; or they have custom hardware.<p>But other devices are very &quot;sticky&quot; with their BT connections. My approach is mostly to turn off bluetooth one one device when I want to switch to another.')
