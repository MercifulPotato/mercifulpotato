I use it with the gates centertrack belt drive instead of a chain.<p>The rohloff system is quite heavy though, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s &quot;more efficient&quot; than a traditional high end sprocket-and-chain system. The rohloff also shifts the weight to the rear of the bike. Maybe the pinion gear box system might be better since its weight is low and towards the center of the bike.')
