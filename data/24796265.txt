Please, you need to take a sabbatical — at least six weeks”. He, and other board members, tried so hard to do the right thing and convince me to take care of myself.&quot;<p>Further, on LinkedIn, Dan still lists himself as a current member of the Board of Directors. CircleUp is still listed as a current investment on Canaan&#x27;s site.<p>I have not worked with Dan but I have worked with Canaan. They have always struck me as founder-friendly. Indeed, they have several notable repeat entrepreneur relationships. It seems unlikely they would tolerate the sort of behavior Ryan described.<p>---<p>Conversely, Collaborative Fund led the Series C in November 2015. Note that, in Ryan&#x27;s letter, he cites board issues from 2016 to 2019. Further, Collaborative Fund no longer lists CircleUp anywhere on its site.<p>Per Crunchbase, Jungju (Jay) Kim was the board partner for Collaborative&#x27;s Series C investment in CircleUp.<p>Note that, per his LinkedIn, Jay became a VC at Collaborative in 2014.')
