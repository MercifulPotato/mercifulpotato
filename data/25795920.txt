The American labor movement secured a lot of those protections in the early and mid-20th century, and they were strong for several decades. It was a hard, violent fight. People died at strikes for those protections.<p>As we entered the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s with the rise of Reaganism and then neoliberalism, however, US businesses as well as the federal and state governments started chipping away at them. Now, between insufficient oversight, &quot;right-to-work (spare me)&quot; laws, lack of NLRB enforcement, and a robust cottage industry of private-sector union-busters, labor has less power in America than it&#x27;s had in a long time.<p>It&#x27;s good to see it start to change.')
