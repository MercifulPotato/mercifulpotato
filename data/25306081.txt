Item(by='doitLP', descendants=None, kids=[25306700], score=None, time=1607107651, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25305779, text='You&#x27;re being downvoted without comment, the implication being that calling the safety into question is heresy and that all vaccines are 100% free of side effects.<p>I am NOT an anti-vaxxer by any means so hold your fire, you who downvote.<p>When we don&#x27;t admit of nuance it makes us just as dogmatically blind as the anti-vaxxers. I think the framing here is really: &quot;<i>who cares what the side effects are, anything in service of a cure</i>&quot;. That&#x27;s fine and all things considered I agree with it. But that&#x27;s what it is. There very well <i>could be</i> some long-term ill effects. To deny it is ignorant at best, dishonest at worst.<p>There&#x27;s a reason why <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vaers.hhs.gov" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vaers.hhs.gov</a> exists for example. Have some intellectual honesty and we&#x27;ll make greater strides in getting more people vaccinated in the long run.')
