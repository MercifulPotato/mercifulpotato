I can&#x27;t stand pile-on emails where every leader has to reply all with &quot;great job&quot; for minor things. I work to provide positive feedback for specific and great work because people see-through false positivity and in the long run you can see that the folks doing the work are very clear with thinking these &quot;ra ra&quot; displays show a disconnect from reality rather then a positive reinforcement. They remind me of the (pardon the language) &quot;shit sandwich&quot; way of providing feedback that some people feel they have to do: give a (many times false and vague) positive not then say your true feelings and end with a positive note. If they aren&#x27;t specific, it just feels fake and people are just waiting for the true feedback in the middle.')
