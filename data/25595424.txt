If you have limited needs, you can try GitHub or GitLab Issues. But for a team which may end up growing, JIRA will work. It has good integration with GitHub&#x2F;GitLab, and with Smart Commits enabled, most of workflows can be baked into it. It&#x27;s slow, but judging by this thread, I suspect Atlassian customers are complaining about it too, so hopefully it&#x27;ll be heard.')
