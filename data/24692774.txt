You say that I, and other like-minded people, are just &quot;average techies&quot; despite literally just explaining that some of us too had our own challenges.<p>I think it&#x27;s okay to admit that nearly everybody has had their share of challenging backgrounds. Some people&#x27;s privileges are the other&#x27;s disadvantages and so on. That much is obvious.<p>But aside from that. Backgrounds aside.<p>Driving when you know you have a constant issue of falling asleep, getting drowsy, all of the above is unsafe. Even if you have priorities that you place above your own health&#x2F;well-being, the problem with having those issues and still choosing to drive is that you are now deciding how others will be affected by your decision.<p>The moment you begin endangering other people&#x27;s lives is the same moment that backgrounds, poorly-disadvantaged or not, become meaningless.<p>Because I highly doubt some victim&#x27;s family is going to be impressed that you or someone else knowingly chose to drive repeatedly while acknowledging they would not be fully aware of what they were doing just because of working conditions.')
