Such a restriction is not allowed in both the Free Software Definition and the Open Source Definition.<p>&gt; A free program must offer the four freedoms to any user that obtains a copy of the software, provided the user has complied thus far with the conditions of the free license covering the software.

The commercial distribution of the software would be nonfree, but it would fund development of the free software.')
