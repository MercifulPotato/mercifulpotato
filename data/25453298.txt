Operating some mixed-use buildings in New York, and casinos in Atlantic City purchased through extensive family loans\n2. Owning and operating a few golf courses\n3. Licensing their name to some adult learning courses that were later revealed to be scams\n4. Being the star of a reality TV show<p>Without passing any sort of judgement on this person, they were completely unqualified to orchestrate anything anywhere near the complexity of the Manhattan Project or Space Race.<p>They were unable to even prioritize and orchestrate the allocation of adequate PPE to healthcare facilities, as well as adequate testing capacity for 50% of Americans to be tested on a <i>monthly</i> basis let-alone daily.<p>Again, no judgement on this individual, but they were totally unprepared and unwilling to manage the crisis and their failure to act likely hamstrung any meaningful attempt to coordinate the type of effort you are describing, which would have required federal buy-in.')
