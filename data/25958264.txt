In a riot, there are organizers and instigators, and then there is a mob who follows them. Here, I&#x27;m not really sure that the organizers exist: the closest thing I can see is the Reddit user DeepFuckingValue, and all they do is post screenshots of their position in GME without futher comment. And have been doing so for the best part of a year.<p>The mob seems to have largely formed itself.')
