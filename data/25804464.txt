For example, Chicago and San Francisco have not fully opened their economy. I&#x27;m skeptical that the resolution to this problem looks anything like &quot;information control&quot;, but it seems terribly naive to expect the problem will resolve itself when it&#x27;s so easy to be ensnared by it.')
