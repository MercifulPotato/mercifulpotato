I&#x27;ve had a few action sequences in the story now and they all went smooth. Sometime quality notably drops, but not pace&#x2F;framerate. The one time I had an issue with frames dropping was because a local computer downloading files and causing bandwith spikes. But I think with some Qos on the router that should be fixed. Average bandwith usage of the game is between 10-20Mbit.')
