I remember looking at a practice exam for AP computer science _principles_ exam back in highschool and laughing my ass off because they were so stupid. The questions were about things like &quot;applications of virtual reality&quot; and &quot;benefits of 3d printing.&quot;<p>Their statistics that it somehow helps minorities smells like bullshit to me. I don&#x27;t think any kids get inspired to enter STEM by a course where you have to write essays about &quot;digital video&quot; or whatever. It seems like they are quick to applaud themselves for doing something that has a plausible PC justification behind it without really thinking critically about the effects.')
