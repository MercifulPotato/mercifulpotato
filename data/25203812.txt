Then built it with React Native, super easy and quick, it looked &amp; felt great to me.<p>So for the actual estimate, what I did was store how long it took to run the task for my users, and then select the 95th percentile from actual runs to get an estimate.  Then when they loaded the app, I would send over the estimates (along with their account info and what not).  I figured if it ended sooner than what it was projecting, the user would be happy, or at least I was.<p>I used my own app, and kept tweaking it until it felt right, and it felt really good.
