I’d argue it’s also a double edged sword: Java libraries tend to be very mature and capable, and Clojure programmers, especially the senior ones, tend to be very comfortable in Java, so often the native libraries just don’t get written.<p>I went to look for a CSS selector library the other day, the accepted solution seems to be to just call into Jsoup. I did find a native xpath library but it was such a thin wrapper around Java stuff that I ended up needing to learn those APIs to get something done the wrapper author hadn’t considered.<p>The thing about relying on Java libraries is the users, who came because they like lisp and Clojure, spend an inordinate amount of time trying to wrap their heads around Java apis (if they don’t know them already). Which is not fun.')
