You seem to think the world works only by mathematical formulas but in fact if the crypto market is run by a shady stable coin, I&#x27;m sure there will be a huge panic sell with hundreds of news sites stating crypto market was run by fraud and bunch of blogs mentioning &quot;told you so&quot; further upsetting all investors.<p>I wish other legitimate stable coins gain more market cap to replace tether before it explodes in the face of traders.')
