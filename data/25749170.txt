Can you provide any evidence at all that Parler had more “hate” than Twitter, etc.?<p>The problem isn&#x27;t just that they had more, though logic would suggest they did; after all, their user base are refugees from other platforms that pushed them out for extremist language, advocating for violence, conspiracy theories, etc.<p>It&#x27;s that Parler refused to remove it.<p>So even if the rate of introduction of this content was the same on Parler (which I don&#x27;t buy for a second, see argument above), the total concentration and visibility of it is higher because it&#x27;s not taken down.')
