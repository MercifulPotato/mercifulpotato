They might indeed never rise to our level of technology again.<p>knowledge is the key. Even Ancient Greeks could have built a wind electricity generator if they knew how - ie. if they knew about copper wire and electrical charge movement in it. And you can collect sun light and focus it on a  boiler while still being in Ancient Greeks situation - that gives you <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Aeolipile" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Aeolipile</a>  which can be used to generate  electricity too. And they could have possibly have that too <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Voltaic_pile" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Voltaic_pile</a> or even <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Crystal_detector#Cat_whisker_detector" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Crystal_detector#Cat_whisker_d...</a> - piece of crystal and a wire making a diode - and you can have primitive radio.<p>So, the newly built civilization bypassing fossil fuels would even be better :)')
