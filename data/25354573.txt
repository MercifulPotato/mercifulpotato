The first in the very early 2000s when I was creating a large and mostly static website for a magazine with a lot of content, and mostly just hacked it together. It was ok but mostly I was using it as a simple templating language. The second time was about five years ago, as a module in my MSc, by which time I was well-versed in functional programming â€” this time it was easy to do all sorts of weird and wonderful stuff, including a TAP-outputting assertion library for templates written in XSLT itself and a library for doing depth-first searches over graphs of nodes.')
