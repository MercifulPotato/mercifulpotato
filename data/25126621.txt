Item(by='earthboundkid', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605634342, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25117118, text='The level of information we are talking about is not comparable.<p>First of all, tax information in the United States was in fact abused by Richard Nixon, so it&#x27;s not just a hypothetical possibility. It&#x27;s a thing that already happened and requires safeguarding to prevent recurring. If there were a way of collecting taxes without the possibility of abuse, we would use it, but there&#x27;s not, so we do what we can to balance things. FWIW, I think actually a lot of government records should be <i>stored on paper and not in computers</i> because hackers can steal 300m records overnight, but even very enterprising thieves can only steal one or two truckloads of physical records per hour.<p>Second of all, this information is just on another level. My tax information is basically not interesting to anyone except that it has my SSN on it, and SSNs are only interesting because the US has bad laws around &quot;identity theft&quot; and we don&#x27;t properly punish corporations for giving out loans based on nothing but an unverified SSN. Could someone embarrass me by releasing my tax info? I guess if they really dug into my charitable deductions and found an embarrassing cause (a la Brendan Eich?) or that I was giving too little? For me, an average American, there is little or no reason to fear having my taxes used against me.<p>Email is just not like that. There are certainly emails I have send and received which I hope no one else will see. It&#x27;s just not comparable at all. It&#x27;s the difference between having $100 in your wallet (might be stolen but probably not) and $6m in your wallet (will absolutely be stolen if people know about it).<p>Should the government be able to investigate me? Of course! But investigations have happened for centuries before emails existed. Investigation does not require pre-surveillance of emails or covert surveillance. The simplest thing the government can do is arrest me on suspicion of X charges and then go through all my computers. That is 100% the government should be able to do! If they catch me destroying evidence, I should be charged with destruction of evidence. But that is different from empowering the government to secretly look at email. The part where the government collects my email should be <i>public</i> action that I am well aware, not a secret action done passively by breaking encryption.')
