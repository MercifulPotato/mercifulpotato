Transparency shouldn&#x27;t matter for people bidding for conversions. The only transparency you need is to know where the visitors are coming from.<p>If anything fraud (really misclicks for FB and Google search since there is no fraud incentive) is also bad for them as well as it provides false signal of intent to their algorithms.')
