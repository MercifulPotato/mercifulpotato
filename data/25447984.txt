Think GTK2 ~= WinForms, GTK3 ~= WPF, GTK4 ~= UWP. The &quot;versions&quot; are parallel installable, you don&#x27;t have to migrate every app to the newest toolkit ASAP. But unlike with Windows, old versions do get phased out and abandoned, because there&#x27;s no super-rich corporate force sponsoring their perpetual maintenance.')
