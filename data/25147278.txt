A lot of autoimmune diseases are caused by vaccines. Antibodies mutate and not always in your favor. I&#x27;m certain that mRNA vaccines will be even more dangerous because they introduce more layers where things can go wrong.<p>Viruses have been around for a long time. Coronaviruses predate humans or hominids. They&#x27;re as old as mammals. Biology has had hundreds of millions of years to figure it out. If there was an easy solution (like produce more Vitamin D or create an antigen), it would have done so. The only reason it hasn&#x27;t is because the solution is worse than the problem.')
