Elected judges are a horrible idea and any jurisdiction with elected judges is immediately suspect as far as criminal sentencing. Every time I visit a state&#x2F;county which elects its judges, I see billboards for &quot;Re-elect Judge So-and-so - tough on crime!&quot; and wonder how anyone could possibly think the justice system there is working correctly and fairly.<p>Even sheriffs shouldn&#x27;t be elected, never mind judges.
