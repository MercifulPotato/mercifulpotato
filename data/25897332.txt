Generalizing it to a theory of post-internet globalized class seems straight forward, with the caveat that it can only be as useful as any theory of class. It&#x27;s the Marxist ceiling, like how classical Newtonian physics is fantastic for modelling coarse engineering problems, and loses coherence when applied to the nature of reality, and doesnt provide much more than some metaphors for things as normal as economics. Reading through it, I don&#x27;t think this was written so much as an explanatory piece for an HN audience as it was to find others thinking about these problems.')
