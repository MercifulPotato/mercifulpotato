A cursory Google search says 1MB will hold about 500 pages of text (ignoring compression). So 36GB would be something like 18 million pages? Let&#x27;s say a 1000 page book is 10cm wide, so 18M pages wind up as 1800 meters of books, or 180 meter-wide bookshelves with 10 shelves each, which is maybe a large library? It seems like a lot of that must be external sources. I wonder what percentage was actually written by Wikipedia editors?')
