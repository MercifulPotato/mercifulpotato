This means that at each location on the display, 2&#x2F;3 of the light is reflected even when CMY channels are all at their maximum.<p>I think E-ink is neither an additive nor a subtractive colour model: it can only produce colours that exist somewhere between the extreme primary colours, ie. it&#x27;s more of an &quot;interpolating&quot; colour model.<p>The inks probably come in pairs: black&#x2F;white, red&#x2F;cyan, green&#x2F;magenta, blue&#x2F;yellow. This gives the expected eight primary colours. For each pair, you would be able to pick any mix, eg. 30% black, 70% white.<p>For the darkest black you would have 100% black, red, green and blue. For lightest white you would have 100% white, cyan, magenta and yellow.<p>(This would reflect (1&#x2F;3) * 3&#x2F;4 + 0&#x2F;4 = 25%, and (2&#x2F;3) * 3&#x2F;4 + 1&#x2F;4 = 75% of the light respectively assuming perfect inks and equal coverage for the channels, which is pretty decent contrast)')
