You can always discuss what options are available with your doctor and then reach out to your insurance to see what and why they will do about it. You may not get the answer you want, and it will use up a lot of your time, but it is an option.<p>Note: I&#x27;ve spent on the order of 30 hours on the phone over the past couple months trying to get things sorted out between my doctor, my insurance, and the provider of the drug that I need for my vision. The folks at the insurance can&#x27;t always help, but they&#x27;ve always been willing to discuss things and see what they _can_ do.')
