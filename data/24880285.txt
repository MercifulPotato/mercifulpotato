Terrorism is the use of violence, harm and killings to promote an ideological agenda.<p>You&#x27;re 100% percent correct. What China is doing fits the definition of &quot;terrorism.&quot; My question is:<p>Is is using terrorism itself as a means to an end to end terrorism worth it?<p>Keep in mind that the US reaction to 9&#x2F;11 can in itself be defined as terrorism for what it did to the other countries. War is a form of terrorism. Perhaps it is much worse than terrorism as terrorism uses small acts of violence to produce a big effect while in war the big effect is the violence itself.<p>My own personal reaction to what happened with the US is that the war definitely went on for too long and the extension to Iraq was unnecessary. But whether a war was needed in the first place is something I&#x27;m unsure about.<p>Imagine you were there on the day of 9&#x2F;11. How could you not go to war? The American sentiment was the same at the time... it had to be done. What other course of action is there to take?<p>What was going on through the minds of the Chinese everytime they saw slaughter after slaughter occur by terrorism on their soil? How could you not? What other course of action is there to take? This is a serious question. What in your mind should have been done instead?')
