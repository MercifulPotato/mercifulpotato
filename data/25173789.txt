There are certainly frameworks within which some taxation is justifiable.<p>You&#x27;re right in that there are multiple ethical systems that could justify the arbitrary nature of taxation. That doesn&#x27;t mean those ethical systems can survive the scrutiny of philosophical razors.<p>Being specific, from the perspective of the ethics of private property (derived from the concept of self ownership), you can&#x27;t justify taking away someone&#x27;s property by force (eg. taxation). You can&#x27;t fight the self ownership premise without contradicting yourself: if you can argue, it means you are not me, therefore you &quot;own&quot; yourself.<p>If your ethical system agrees with the idea of taxation &quot;to serve some social benefit&quot; it necessarily doesn&#x27;t agree with the the premise of self-ownership, as it would imply that &quot;society&quot; has an existence of its own, therefore it can have property, which would extend to the ability of &quot;owning&quot; individuals and their property. However, the &quot;society&quot; is an abstraction, it doesn&#x27;t really exist (only individuals exist), so that ethical system would fail under Hume&#x27;s razor.')
