Item(by='jessriedel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605199912, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25071106, text='&quot;At any time&quot; is not the same as &quot;at a moment&#x27;s notice&quot;. If the system is robust enough such that the human is always given, say, 5 seconds warning before they need to intervene, they can safely read&#x2F;write (but not sleep), which would be a huge benefit.<p>Elsewhere in this thread, someone gave examples where a human takeover is needed but there is significant warning time: (1) exiting a highway to an unimproved road and (2) coming upon construction work with human-directed traffic control.<p>Driver attention is monitored with cameras in essentially all Level-2-and-above autonomous cars, I believe. The machine vision is good enough to detect sleeping.')
