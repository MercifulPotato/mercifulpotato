Bitcoin settles every 10mins with revocation possible up to 1 hour out.<p>To keep the comparison accurate, you can transact many times within an “accounting block”. Bitcoin has the shorter accounting block and tier 2 systems laid on top of it seem to scale Bitcoin well beyond any accounting block maximum transaction cap.<p>The GP is probably not referring to speed of settlement though. Bitcoin solves KYC and trust and allows frictionless micro-payment.')
