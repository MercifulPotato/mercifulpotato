Oh and make it easy to open and close it an replace&#x2F;add stuff. Sure add some room for a 2.5&quot; sata drive. Like you, I don&#x27;t really get the race to the thinnest. Perhaps it pushes tech in other aspects to limits that allow for better batteries in my thicker laptop... in that case, I&#x27;m ok with it ;)')
