Too bad that&#x27;s not how humans work.  Instead, they tend to choose whichever truth they like best based on how it makes them feel; politicians know this, which is why they don&#x27;t bother crafting logically sound arguments backed with evidence.  They play on peoples&#x27; emotions.<p>Moreover, the university is not a public square.  You attend as a student, which means you are there to learn, not to share your thoughts like it&#x27;s a real-life HN thread.  Don&#x27;t want to learn the material?  That&#x27;s completely fine.  The solution is to not sign up for the class, not to whine about how &quot;discourse is gone&quot; just because the teacher doesn&#x27;t want to waste time on every edgy kid&#x27;s opinions.  People didn&#x27;t pay massive sums of money to hear you talk.  They paid to learn from experts.')
