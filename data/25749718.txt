And that makes sense:  US law is shaped by the constitution, which is meant to restrict the <i>government&#x27;s</i> ability to limit speech.  And we should absolutely want the rules regarding government censorship to be as narrow as possible.<p>But private services are free to operate by different rules.<p>For example, if I walk into a McDonalds and start swearing at all the customers, I&#x27;ll get kicked out even if I&#x27;m not breaking the letter of the law.<p>So, did they have a moderation policy?  Yes, technically.  But did that policy allow extremist and violent language to persist on their site at a level above and beyond what&#x27;s seen on any competing platform outside of, say, 8chan?  Absolutely.<p>&gt; As a side note, I&#x27;ve heard that the people who actually stormed the Capitol Building (not just holding signs outside of it, which is perfectly fine) used Facebook to coordinate and not Parler.<p>And Facebook would pull that content down if they found it.<p>Parler won&#x27;t.<p>That&#x27;s what got them pulled from AWS, and the Google and Apple app stores.')
