I do not use an autocomplete plugin at all, but rather use Vim’s native ins-completion. Combined with a language server and a lightweight LSP client (I use vim-lsc) this works beautifully.<p>I am excited for some of the upcoming changes in neovim however. I think the introduction of treesitter for syntax highlighting and a native LSP client will both be huge')
