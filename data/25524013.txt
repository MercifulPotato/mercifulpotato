Some types of sophistication won’t make you enjoy the object more, they’ll make you enjoy it less. For example, wine snobs don’t enjoy wine twice as much as you, they’re more keenly aware of how most wine isn’t good enough. Avoid sophistication that diminishes your enjoyment.</i><p>I agree with the conclusion of this one, though I think it oversimplifies the problem.<p>Cultivating taste in something (be it food or drink, music, literature) is absolutely a valuable thing, and one of life&#x27;s great pleasures. With it comes that awareness that some examples of the thing you have learned to appreciate are much better than others. The challenge is to not let your appreciation for the best dampen your enjoyment of the common.<p>I may be no cicerone, but I&#x27;ve developed a relatively discerning palate for beer. What I&#x27;ve had to learn, though, is how to still enjoy a mass-market beer when that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s available. I&#x27;ve found that reframing, thinking &quot;I&#x27;m not drinking this Miller Lite because it&#x27;s great beer; I&#x27;m drinking it because I&#x27;m here with people I like spending time with&quot; allows me to let go of the beer-snobbery for the totality of the experience.
