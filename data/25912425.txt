One youtube talk I watched listed that as a sure sign democracy is under attack in a country.<p>I don&#x27;t understand your response to this. A democracy is the will of the people. In general it is not ok when politicians collude to marginalize or silence the free speech of the people they are supposed to represent. This is what totalitarian regimes do.<p>It would be better to talk to people and attempt to really understand them rather than demonize them.')
