It was introduced for political censorship, to suppress information detrimental to Biden. This is mainly the content of Hunter Biden&#x27;s laptop hard drive, which wasn&#x27;t even hacked. (he abandoned it, subject to state law and a computer repair contract) There was also a GMail account of a former business partner that was voluntarily turned over to reporters.<p>Stories about the laptop occasionally show up on HN, quickly flagged into oblivion.
