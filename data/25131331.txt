A few years ago, I launched Min on HN [1], and got lots of useful feedback. Since then, Min has expanded significantly, and gained a ton of new features and design improvements, along with an active community contributing to it. Even as we&#x27;ve added more features, we&#x27;ve kept the core idea the same - a browser with a fast UI that&#x27;s as simple as possible, and works to prevent you from getting distracted. Finally, Min helps keep your browsing activity private - it blocks tracking scripts automatically, and we don&#x27;t collect any of your browsing data.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11484770" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11484770</a>')
