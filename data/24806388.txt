It makes primitive types usable as if they are classes with copy constructors.<p>That being said, it can certainly be ugly. A lot of the ugliness comes from trying to maintain itself as a mostly superset of C. Technically it no longer is strictly that, but most C code will compile fine in a C++ source file.')
