There, one can expect most goods be delivered next day, across hundreds of city hubs. That efficiency allows factories to have far more choices of their locations that can achieve the same overall efficiency as the centralized factories decades ago.<p>I thought about it for a while, one conclusion I got is that, unless US significantly curb the capitalism freedom in business activities, there is no chance that one can revert the centralization of the global manufacturing inside mainland China. Simply put, the logistic networks for both goods and people, and many other investment, makes mainland China the best manufacturing hub. That&#x27;s a straightforward economy outcome.')
