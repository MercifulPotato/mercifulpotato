They thought that everyone on the 25k org should code their way. It was weird, I thought they were joking, but they were serious. They said with a straight face that no one should ever need to write in Ruby, JavaScript, or Python. When I pointed out that most major ML packages were in Python (they were into “AI” and whatnot) they said that PowerBI and Azure could do that for them.<p>I kind of wish I was so certain about things in life. This was also a few years before Microsoft bought GitHub and they talked about how no one needed to use Git and that Visual Studio had built in version control that supported git, but no one liked it.<p>I kind of wonder what they’re up to now as Microsoft is shifting over to GitHub. That was part of my worry with the acquisition is whatever cult-like mindset from Microsoft will bleed over.')
