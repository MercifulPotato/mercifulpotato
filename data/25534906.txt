Item(by='tkgally', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608881274, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25528921, text='&gt; I think most people are more than mature enough to make their own decisions about what works for them and what doesn&#x27;t.<p>Nice point.<p>As a teenager, I took piano lessons for several years from two good teachers. Nearly fifty years later, I still enjoy playing the piano every day, so lessons obviously worked for me.<p>But if I were starting out to learn to play the piano now, I probably wouldn&#x27;t go the teacher route at first. Rather, I would sample various apps, method books, websites, and, especially, YouTube videos and see what I could learn from each of them. I expect some would be too hard, some too easy, and some focused on styles of music I&#x27;m not interested in. But in the process of sampling various approaches, I would be able to find out what benefits and motivates me and what doesn&#x27;t. I suspect that I would end up at least as satisfied with the results as I am now.')
