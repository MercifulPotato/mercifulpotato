Capitalism is about maximizing outcomes within the context of a system. It&#x27;s not about the rules that govern the system itself. It doesn&#x27;t actually matter what goal you are optimizing for. There is also no such thing as having no policies. Not having a policy is a policy in itself.<p>The producer of an externality is actively using the laws of physics to extract value from all other individuals. That&#x27;s not capitalism either. It&#x27;s just someone abusing their power. It&#x27;s like using a gun to rob someone except the harm is spread over more people.<p>If nothing is done against the externality then the government is implicitly accepting the externality and is effectively subsidizing the producers of the externality.<p>Now that we have established that government policies can be compatible with capitalism lets talk about the most extreme capitalist policies possible. Well, a capitalist policy would be based around aligning profit incentives with policy goals. Basically what you want is that companies and people that do the right thing make a load of money and those who don&#x27;t, make a loss.<p>So what is an extreme example of a non capitalist policy? Rent control. You&#x27;ve just destroyed the ability for &quot;greedy&quot; landlords to make money off of doing the right thing, namely providing housing. Another non capitalist policy? Prop 13. The policy encourages hoarding housing instead of rebuilding and providing more housing. It&#x27;s even self reinforcing because it lures normal people in and turns them into hoarders. Again, it&#x27;s because you have destroyed the ability for greedy people to do the right thing.<p>Now carbon taxes are the extreme opposite, they are so extremely capitalist that they should bring tears to your eyes. The greediest business owner is the one that produces the least CO2 (or any other externality). It&#x27;s a system for doing the right thing. The only flaw is that carbon taxes have to be global but since they can be enforced through CO2 tariffs an easy fix is available. There are extreme domestic growth opportunities available in green technologies but without the right incentives nobody will do it. It&#x27;s absurd that we even have to have this discussion. People are begging for profitable domestic investments because the central banks are flooding the markets. It&#x27;s not like we end up sacrificing anything if we put underemployed people to work.')
