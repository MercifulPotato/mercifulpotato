And what is it?<p>If you truly have a distributed system, then you have to pick from a number of not-ideal options.<p>But, there are certainly many systems where the developers and architects have a choice as to whether to create a microservices or a monolith. If you&#x27;re facing that sort of choice, the &quot;better option&quot; (in terms of being a solution to distributed transactions) is to use a monolith, and not have to deal with distributed transactions at all. You get the facility to just rollback the entire transaction.')
