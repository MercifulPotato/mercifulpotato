Didn&#x27;t really get mentioned here, but that was a lot of websites.<p>Instead of stressing about getting his sites back up, he was stressing that he&#x27;d never get any of his data or code back and that he couldn&#x27;t contact his 100,000s of users because he didn&#x27;t even have a recent backup of the database with all of the emails.<p>Even his DNS settings went down as those sort of sites push you to making them the nameservers.<p>I ended up telling him about wayback machine just so he could get a homepage set up.<p>He&#x27;d relied on their claims that they managed his backups for him, but when they went down, it took down his ability to even access the backups, and they wouldn&#x27;t do anything, I assume in case those backups were infected too.<p>So in fact if you&#x27;re blindly relying on an external provider, it&#x27;s even more risky than hosting yourself. At least the stuff you self host you are almost pushed to back up to something like S3, and both won&#x27;t go down.')
