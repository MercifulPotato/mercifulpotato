If a union walks into every negotiation with just an ultimatum, then very quickly the otherside is going to get fed up of their bullshit.<p>You must have not met the publicly employed unions we have in other countries. Teachers, nurses unions in my country for ex. threaten (and sometimes they do) all the time to down their tools to relative success.
