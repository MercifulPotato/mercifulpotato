It would be easy to do something like the toilet-tank model where you get X number of base-fee offenses per time period, and then the price increases significantly. Lots of parking regimes do this kind of thing to discourage people from treating the fine as a fee.<p>(And the idea with the &quot;swift&quot; part of the philosophy is that you don&#x27;t have to wait until the end of the month to get an itemized list of offenses— it texts you or something right away, so you get that immediate feedback about what you did and what the penalty was.)<p>&gt; The issue of course is how does such a system know who is driving without also combining facial recognition?<p>Some existing systems have a camera positioned such that it can read the plate and also snap a picture of the driver through the windshield, so your ticket comes with a picture. In other places, the law has been amended so that the the person to whom the vehicle is licensed is liable for automated fines associated with it regardless of who is driving— Toronto started rolling out speed cams under that framework just this past summer (it&#x27;s fines only, no demerits, so there should be no insurance impact).')
