In particular, for Cobalt, one particularly concerning conflict mineral, Apple has over the last couple of years established complete auditing, while Fairphone is not even reporting numbers for that mineral yet.<p>To be sure, they did not do that out of the kindness of their hearts (particularly not in the Steve Jobs era). Pressure from NGOs and maybe also competitors like Fairphone helped.<p>[Disclaimer: I work for Apple, but don&#x27;t speak for them, nor do I have firsthand knowledge of their supply chain]')
