There’s no way he would’ve came out ahead on Super Tuesday without Obama putting his hand in the scales on this manner.<p>&gt; If Bernie was chosen as the candidate, Trump would have won a second term.<p>And yet centrist candidates lost across the country, Biden won by slimmer margins than Hillary in many places, progressives won a slate of seats, as well as measures they sponsored like drug decriminalization and minimum wage increases. There’s not much use arguing a hypothetical, but the circumstances of Biden’s victory don’t jive with this sentiment.')
