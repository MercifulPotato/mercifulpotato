If you are using that version of Nextcloud, you need to know the following:<p>1- It uses SQLite, you can&#x27;t change this easily as the same SQLite is also accessed by MIAB to sync contacts and calendar functionality. The Nextcloud devs don&#x27;t recommend SQLite for multi user servers. [1]<p>2- MIAB supports using Nextcloud for managing contacts and calendar but file management is not officially supported so if you want to use that same installation of Nextcloud for storing your files, you won&#x27;t get support from the MIAB devs in relation to any issue related to files storage [2] (in that case you will have to seek help from the Nexcloud community).<p>3- As a result of the 2 points above, for multiuser installations you may want to have a second instance of Nextcloud, backed by Postgres or MariaDB, just for your files storage, while you can keep using the version included in MIAB for contacts and calendar. However, for a single user installation, you would be fine using the version of Nextcloud that comes in MIAB (I have been doing that for a long time and I&#x27;m fine, mine is a single-user system).<p>4- The version of Nextcloud that is included in MIAB by default locks access to the admin interface, this can be unlocked using the provided script [3]<p>5- The automated backups that MIAB creates, will also include all your Nextcloud flies, not just email, calendar and contacts. So if you have a lot of files it&#x27;s a good idea to use the S3 backup functionality instead of the default on-disk backup method (otherwise backups files will soon eat up all your storage). In my case I use the MIAB S3 backups feature, and I save my data in Digitalocean Spaces which is S3-compatible [4]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.nextcloud.com&#x2F;server&#x2F;stable&#x2F;admin_manual&#x2F;configuration_database&#x2F;db_conversion.html?highlight=convert%20sqlite" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.nextcloud.com&#x2F;server&#x2F;stable&#x2F;admin_manual&#x2F;config...</a><p>[2] See par. &quot;Whatâ€™s inside the box?&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailinabox.email&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailinabox.email&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mail-in-a-box&#x2F;mailinabox&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;tools&#x2F;owncloud-unlockadmin.sh" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mail-in-a-box&#x2F;mailinabox&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;tool...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.digitalocean.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;spaces&#x2F;resources&#x2F;s3-sdk-examples&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.digitalocean.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;spaces&#x2F;resources&#x2F;s3-sdk-ex...</a>')
