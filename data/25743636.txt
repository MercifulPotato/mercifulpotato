Just because statistically there is no racism in your area doesn&#x27;t mean you won&#x27;t get discriminated and deprived of opportunities.<p>Because the when certain metrics are used to compile a formula that leads to any ranking, then those parameters are subject to gaming in order to meet an expected result so those statistics are meaningless at the end of the day when you can&#x27;t move past a certain wage&#x2F;social class due to the artificial barriers set by a feudal leadership.<p>Statistically, the unemployment rate in my country should be about 2% while realistically it&#x27;s much higher since the government doesn&#x27;t count certain classes of people in odder to make the numbers look god in statistics for the EU.<p>Anecdotally, my acquaintances who emigrated from the former soviet bloc to North Ameriac and Australia ended up with much more wealth to their name including their own houses vs the ones who moved to Western Europe who basically ended up as serfs to be renters for life.<p>Do you see the problem with statistics as evidence? They don&#x27;t tell the whole story.')
