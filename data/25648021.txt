(I say this as someone who is actively developing an editor for my own app.)<p>It&#x27;s a drastic shift from how Wordpress has traditionally worked, but that doesn&#x27;t make it bad.<p>Most WP visual editors &#x2F; page builders are terrible. They produce bloated code, huge page sizes, poor SEO. Gutenberg does all this stuff right. But it doesn&#x27;t try to be a full-fledged design environment either.<p>The shift is painful, of course. It&#x27;s incompatible with many existing sites. But I compare this to Apple&#x27;s shift to OS X, or Microsoft&#x27;s move away from Windows XP, or any major tech company that has had to shift away from a wildly successful product lest they become irrelevant. The transition sucks at the time, but looking back it always becomes obvious how necessary the shift was.')
