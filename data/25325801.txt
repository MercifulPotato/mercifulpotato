You asked for this:<p>&gt; If you are so well read, then provide some convincing evidence for your claims. None of the three links you provided tell us anything about the cause of homelessness.<p>I gave you five articles listing the causes of homelessness. Now you&#x27;re claiming the articles aren&#x27;t enough.<p>&gt; If you could give everybody a free house, there would probably be less homeless people.<p>In many cities they have in fact done this and it works pretty well. It&#x27;s significantly cheaper than the hospital visits and the extra burden on the police force.<p>You want to keep inventing theories out of your own imagination, while I have actual experience working with homeless people, in several major cities around the world. If you don&#x27;t want to believe that gentrification in general and specifically rents going from $1000 to $2300 in a few years causes homelessness for those who were barely able to afford rent in the first place, that&#x27;s certainly your choice. You can have the last word as I don&#x27;t see this going in a useful direction.')
