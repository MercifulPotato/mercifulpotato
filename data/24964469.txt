Have I misunderstood? If SLAAC and NDP specifically require the full &#x2F;64 that&#x27;s fine, I just don&#x27;t understand what the upsides to such a design choice would be. (But I&#x27;m obviously not a networking expert!)<p>&gt; &gt; perhaps your ISP is abusive<p>&gt; If you want multiple subnets, ask your ISP to give you a larger block than a &#x2F;64.<p>Long ago, I recall an ISP that charged extra for more than one active device. Their supplied router was perfectly capable of NAT but you had to pay extra if you wanted to use it (and there were multiple service tiers depending on how many devices you had). Obviously, the only reasonable way to proceed was to NAT everything using your own router behind theirs.<p>That particular practice seems unlikely to fly these days, but the point is that if an artificial restriction is possible to implement or information is freely available such capabilities will almost inevitably be abused by bad actors (see browser fingerprinting for a concrete example).<p>&gt; NDP is just ICMP messages. It doesn&#x27;t scale with the number of devices<p>Sorry, it seems I&#x27;m really bad at articulating this particular question about scaling. I was specifically wondering about a much smaller subnet, say 2^16. Once a significant fraction (say 90%) of the address space is being utilized, any attempt to select a new address at random should result in a proportional number of collisions. So if you were regularly cycling addresses, it seems there would be a _lot_ of overhead in that case.<p>&gt; Every device on the subnet is getting every NDP packet anyway, because that&#x27;s how subnets work.<p>That seems like it would break down at some point. Which is (one of the reasons, I thought) why subnets and VLANs and all that other stuff existed. If the answer is just &quot;put that stuff in a block larger than &#x2F;64&quot; that&#x27;s fine, I&#x27;d just never heard that before and don&#x27;t understand the reasoning behind it. (It&#x27;s not as though a single subnet is ever expected to exceed 2^32 active addresses?! So why insist on having 2^48?)')
