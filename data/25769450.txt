Even if not in the US, whatever jurisdiction they are under can enforce US rulings or court orders if allied or under treaty. If the FBI&#x2F;etc follow the process to get a judge&#x27;s signature saying the entity is holding illegally obtained or fraudulent assets of any kind, the entity can be liable if they do not cooperate.<p>Same thing as any order to seize or freeze financial assets but perhaps with more scrutiny given the pseudo-anonymity of digital currency. Same for acts by Congress that route through the Treasury to freeze assets like the Magnitsky Act.')
