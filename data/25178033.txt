The code is very readable and i&#x27;m certain its complexity has been greatly exaggerated. A large part of it is driver&#x2F;ddx code (that you can generally ignore) and i&#x27;ve worked with much bigger codebases even if we include the driver code.<p>And at the end of the day, it is code, not magic.
