Surprise, surprise: the cable went bust after a couple of weeks of mild use. I posted a one-star review stating that the cable broke, and called it a day.<p>After a couple of days, I started being contacted by the seller. He was proposing that if I recanted on my review they would send another free of charge. I guess I had no use for a USB cable that went bust after a couple of weeks, thus I rejected the offer. After a while, the same seller contacted me again offering 20$ to remove my review. That just felt completely dishonest. I rejected the offer and continued with my life. In spite of that I continued to receive the same offer over and over again from multiple user accounts and with what I then noticed was little variations of the same templated response: 20$ to recant the negative review, attached to the same robo-generated copy&#x2F;paste sob story.<p>So yeah reviews are unreliable. Not only are there fake reviews but dishonest sellers who use fraud as their business model will do their best to play their victims to do their bidding.')
