Here in the UK we have an unelected consultant to the Prime Minister who is pushing for a loosening of data privacy laws. The right to privacy is politicised to suit the agendas of politicians and big tech alike.<p>Long term, I do hope laws and regulation will catch up. I know some incredible people in the space and their work and commitment is inspiring. It&#x27;s unsatisfying though to think that the effects will only be reactive and recourse provided after years of ongoing privacy invasion at mass scale. To me, that&#x27;s where technology comes in and we should advocate and use products and solutions that respect our privacy (e.g. Qwant).<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m one of the developers of Peergos - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peergos.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;peergos.org</a> - a secure storage solution that puts user privacy and control of data first. We&#x27;re currently in alpha and looking for users to test it out and give feedback. If it interests you at all, I would really appreciate your views on the product and what we&#x27;re trying to create.')
