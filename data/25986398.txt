(This is essentially true of all hedge funds.)<p>What appears to be the case is they were edging the QQQ until they incinerated half their capital in a week on a bad bet and poor risk controls. So we now know they are uncorrelated with the S&amp;P, but unfortunately we only know they are uncorrelated to the downside. (We don&#x27;t know if their outperformance has been a result of real alpha or a strong market plus leverage.)<p>We saw a lot of these funds in the strong bull market of the 90s and the takeaway I remember was that it&#x27;s impossible to know ahead of time who&#x27;s going to blow up and lose all&#x2F;most of your money.')
