Everyone&#x27;s got their own take on everything from basic stuff like kernels, shells, userland, and directory structures to bigger stuff like desktop environments.<p>Except X. X is X and everybody agrees that X is X. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s there, and it mostly just works, and all the programs are written for it. Instead of trying to fix the one thing we&#x27;ve all managed to agree upon, we&#x27;re going to replace it with something completely different.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this is a good idea.')
