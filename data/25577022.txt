I&#x27;d like to see the homicide and suicide numbers brought out separately, since (in most states) any decrease in homicides is completely shadowed by the huge increase in suicides.  With coastal California having a much lower gun-ownership rate, I assume people committing suicide choose other means (nobody I know who killed themselves in California used a gun, while 2&#x2F;3 of those I know who killed themselves in the midwest did, the third being a woman, who is much less statistically likely to choose a gun).')
