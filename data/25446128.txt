Deflation means when prices are dropping. The price of computers has fallen over time predictably and exponentially, and yet that hasn&#x27;t stopped people from buying them. The Keynesian argument against deflation is that it disincentivizes people from spending money as they expect prices to drop. This disincentive hasn&#x27;t prevented the computer industry from being a huge success. The fact that you know that if you wait some time you can get a faster and cheaper computer doesn&#x27;t prevent you ad infinitum from buying computers.')
