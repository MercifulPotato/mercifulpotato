It&#x27;s an argument to say we should subsidize those that care for their own parents and children (and there are numerous government programs and tax breaks that already do), but you are undercutting your thesis with this bizarre assertion.<p>Many old people never had kids, and don&#x27;t have any family. They need paid workers to take care of them. Many readers of this comment are perhaps planning on not having kids, or even not getting married. Just imagine yourselves in 40 to 60 years - this will be you!')
