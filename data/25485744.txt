I think that is the point being made when people talk about abolishing work and offering all the basics for free. I believe its a correct premise aswell. We are not talking about luxury.<p>&gt; Access to those things are provided conditionally upon their satisfactory performance. What conditions are you proposing that governments require to be met?<p>As soon as we hire people we provide them with all these basic perks, they are not conditional, because we believe if we are sending soldiers to fight we better provide them with the best chances of succeeding. Its the same idea society-wide. If you mean you fire the employees that don&#x27;t perform you&#x27;d be right, but governments could create brackets. The point is, in this day and age there&#x27;s no reason why we couldn&#x27;t provide every citizen of a developed society all these basic things. You could argue shelter is the most expensive but there are examples like Singapore solving the issue society-wide.')
