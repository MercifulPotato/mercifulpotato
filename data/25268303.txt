There will be a forced reboot soon...<p>* I&#x27;m watching out in case something pops up while I&#x27;m typing and whatever key I was about to press causes the &#x27;reboot&#x27; question to be answered - and I wait several minutes and lose flow entirely.<p>* I log in.<p>* I start setting things up again as they were so I can start work again.<p>* There are more critical updates...<p>Turning off auto-update is not an option, because there are so many security holes and I don&#x27;t want to end up a victim. I also don&#x27;t like having to fight to try and keep the OS from doing something it will push against, so trying to creep around letting it do updates when I&#x27;m not busy and reboots when I want it to but not asking me - waiting to be told - it&#x27;s hard work and stressful.<p>Windows is an amazing piece of tech and gets better all the time, but  I find myself much more able to stay in the &#x27;flow&#x27; and avoid stress in MacOS or Linux.')
