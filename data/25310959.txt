Actually, I think that would be pretty bad. Ironically, least of all for Jeff Bezos. How good would it be for you if your 401k dropped by that much?<p>Or maybe you&#x27;re thinking we could just confiscate the stock, or force him to sell it. Sell it to whom? Other billionaires? And do you think this wouldn&#x27;t have an effect on the stock prices (i.e. people&#x27;s retirement funds) and availability of capital (i.e. money to pay people&#x27;s salaries)?')
