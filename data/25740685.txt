Even before he was president he was threatening violence if he didn&#x27;t win the nomination.

Was widely and unfortunately misinterpreted by an angry crowd he just happened find himself in front of with kindness and good will to all men in his heart?<p>None of that is even remotely plausible.<p>Twitter, Amazon, Facebook, etc are perfectly justified in shutting him up, for the safety of all Americans, and very possibly the rest of the world.<p>Once we&#x27;ve dealt with this threat, we can come back and have a debate about media control in all of its forms. And when we do that we can include the trad media too, because they have a lot to answer for.<p>But for now there are more pressing problems. Whether or not Twitter did the right thing isn&#x27;t anywhere close to the top of the list.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2016-election&#x2F;trump-warns-supporters-may-riot-fears-violence-escalate-n540516" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2016-election&#x2F;trump-warns-s...</a>')
