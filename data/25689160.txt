International sex trafficking is inherently violent. Modern slavery most often occurs in areas with widespread, violent conflict. Why should we be worried about &quot;benevolent AI overlords&quot; going rogue when historically civilizations with high percentages of unfree people were <i>extremely</i> violent?')
