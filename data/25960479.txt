The main thing I&#x27;m getting from your response is the standard retort whenever anybody complains about the problems arising from corporate scale - &quot;but anyone can start a corporation&quot;. This is technically true, but completely dodges that issue of <i>scale</i>. If there were non-incorporated groups of thousands of people coming together and doing similar things we would need different criteria, but there are not.<p>As for the encryption topic, then perhaps the scope of anti-lobbying should include government agencies as well. I certainly don&#x27;t trust big tech to defend my personal digital rights, and the fact that we&#x27;re looking to them to be our saviors is itself a major problem. They seem to be aligned with us at the moment, but ultimately mandated communications escrow would be another competitive moat for them. I expect that to shift if there is a serious move (back) to p2p apps.<p>I agree on the congressional process, but not to the exclusion of other approaches.')
