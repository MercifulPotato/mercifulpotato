The stereotype is of two millennials sitting at a restaurant and both spending the entire meal staring at their phones. While that does happen, I think it&#x27;s actually a lot more common now for older people to behave like this, maybe because they&#x27;ve had less time to develop any form of social or psychological resistance.<p>I think we need an evolution of social etiquette to account for this brave new world of self-absorption and rudeness. Pulling out your phone while in the middle of a conversation is incredibly rude, but people do it constantly, without a second thought, in both personal and professional contexts. It should be acceptable to kindly but firmly shame people for this kind of anti-social behavior, just like we&#x27;d shame people (perhaps not so kindly) if they started spitting in everyone&#x27;s drinks or being blatantly cruel to others. I&#x27;m not trying to claim moral superiority, as I&#x27;m as guilty as anyone of doing it on occasion, but I&#x27;d honestly be <i>happy</i> if the person I&#x27;m with would say &quot;put that thing away and pay attention to what I&#x27;m saying you dick!&quot;.')
