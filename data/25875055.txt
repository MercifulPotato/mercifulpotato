The DFA is not deliberately constructed, it&#x27;s more a &quot;happy accident&quot;. A renaming&#x2F;reframing of the `seen` variable would make it obvious that what is constructed is a manually conceived DFA. As presented, `seen` is &quot;how many characters have we seen of the target string?&quot;. Reframing it as &quot;There exists a state for each character in the target, `seen` represents which of these states we are presently in&quot; makes it clear that it <i>is</i> a DFA. But as constructed it&#x27;s an accidental DFA, rather than a deliberate one.')
