Apple only changed it for people making under $1m a year after people got mad and they got sued by Epic Games or they knew Epic Games was coming for their asses. But they know that majority of their revenue comes from pubs making over $1m a year which they still tax at 30%.<p>Then the fact that they hold Safari backwards to cripple the adoption of PWA&#x27;s (Modern Web Apps). They don&#x27;t allow real competitors to Safari either. The competitors that exist like Chrome or Firefox are just Safari under the hood on iOS.<p>iOS and Apple have single handedly crippled the innovation on mobile web. Safari is the modern Internet Explorer but Apple forcing people to use it directly or indirectly and not allowing real competition on iOS.<p>This is straight up anti trust material and they should face scrutiny for it. Sleepy lawmakers should wake up.<p>Not only does it harm American businesses, but also businesses across the world.')
