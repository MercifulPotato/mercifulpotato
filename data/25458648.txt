That the list of ingredients is long?<p>Most of the list is regular food ingredients or vitamins&#x2F;minerals added to the &quot;enriched flour&quot;. The stabilizers and emulsifiers with scary chemical names are present in tiny amounts regulated by various health departments.<p>If hot pockets are unhealthy, it&#x27;s because of the qualities they might share with a homemade meat pie; too much or too little of some nutrients. Not because of some magical consequence of being too processed or having too many ingredients.')
