If you fall out of the habit,  prints get very expensive.<p>So I challenged myself to print something every day and that expanded in scope to mean &quot;print&quot; in the widest possible sense. I learned pretty fast that the Ansel Adams &quot;Zone System&quot; helps you print anime characters on a receipt printer.  I&#x27;ve cleared out my backlog of photos and mailed them to my family, trying many different service bureaus to see which ones tell you it is matte when it is a semi-gloss print.  I even print my CSS grid information graphics on 4x6 cards, etc.  Now,  I break printers like Jimmy Page broke guitars.  I just got an industrial printer from a drop shipper in Flushing, NY that came with a drivers-and-docs disk that didn&#x27;t have working software but seems to have good enough documentation to get started.<p>It is good for my mental health because it grounds the world of digital images that I work and play in with the world of physical objects.')
