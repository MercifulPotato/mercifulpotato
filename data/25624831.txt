I&#x27;ve long wanted something like that but it&#x27;s hard to find the right metrics.<p>When I&#x27;m contributing to a project, the thing I care most about is response time. If I submit a PR and the maintainer accepts it a year later, that&#x27;s not very inviting. But if the maintainer gets back to me in a day and explains why they&#x27;re rejecting my PR, that&#x27;s actually a much better outcome.<p>I tried plugging in my own project (mtlynch&#x2F;tinypilot), and I score a disappointing 60%. But I think what happens is that external contributors often aren&#x27;t very familiar with git, so they&#x27;ll try to fix merge conflicts by merging instead of rebasing, leading to PRs that are 10x larger due to merge noise.<p>In those cases, I cherry pick their commits into a new PR, but I&#x27;m guessing that counts as a rejected PR, even though their commits are getting merged in.')
