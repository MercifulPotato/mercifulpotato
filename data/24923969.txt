They could end up _promoting_ themselves to being ICs again or stick to being managers. Some managers at big tech co.&#x27;s have come via acquisitions. Some others are ones who&#x27;ve been around long enough at places like Google or Apple and are capable of venturing out on their own. Examples abound: Tailscale, Humane etc etc.')
