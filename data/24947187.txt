Item(by='spoondan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604094420, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24945671, text='I appreciate that they decided to apologize, but I find this statement lackluster at best. A better, more earnest apology would properly address the major concerns Jeremy raised. This touches on just two of the issues and then only superficially. I don&#x27;t expect them to lay everything bare and pay public penance. I&#x27;m not interested in assigning blame. But apologies ring hollow when you don&#x27;t even discuss what, if anything, you feel you did wrong.<p>In fact, in committing only to &quot;improve our process to avoid this from happening,&quot; it reads as if they take no meaningful responsibility for how they handled informing Jeremy. It feels as if they are sorry Jeremy was stressed out for a week but unapologetic for any of the numerous and hard-to-defend actions they took to cause that stress. They blame the process, as if it required them to inform Jeremy of a complaint they weren&#x27;t ready and willing to discuss with him, to assure him they&#x27;d give him details the following day and then renege on that, to not give him adequate time to understand the accusation and formulate a response. And it is apparent, from the story as both sides tell it, that far from a &quot;crucial miscommunication,&quot; the Committee was accurately communicating what they thought. Their error was in prematurely drawing conclusions and not giving Jeremy the benefit of the doubt.<p>They also don&#x27;t address the confusion around having two differing codes; the serious and counterproductive issues with Codes of Conduct prescribing acceptable behaviors (instead of <i>proscribing</i> unacceptable ones), especially when such prescriptions are vague; or Jeremy&#x27;s accusation that the Committee, itself, failed to follow their own Code(s) of Conduct and Enforcement Guide. And while I would not want or expect them to discuss the specifics of Jeremy&#x27;s case (unless they have his consent to do so), I do think it&#x27;s necessary to discuss the issue of whether they believe merely making someone uncomfortable through disagreement on relevant topics can (let alone should) be the sole&#x2F;primary basis for a finding of misconduct, especially when the people made uncomfortable are not even the person that is being disagreed with.<p>Perhaps they&#x27;ve given Jeremy a more in-depth and sincere apology and explanation in private. But I don&#x27;t think that suffices. Like Jeremy, I believe that Codes of Conduct can (and often do) play an important role in improving our communities and events. I&#x27;m sure the Enforcement Committee would claim to believe this as well. But the numerous mistakes they&#x27;ve made in this matter do serious harm, not just to Jeremy, but to the larger cause. The way to mitigate (if not remedy) those harms is by honestly admitting to mistakes')
