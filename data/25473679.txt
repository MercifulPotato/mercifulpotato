Item(by='elcritch', descendants=None, kids=[25473915], score=None, time=1608336837, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25473261, text='&gt; While this is true, DeepFoldâ€™s algorithm is only applicable to extant proteins having enough evolutionary information,<p>Didn&#x27;t the challenge include predicting previously unseen&#x2F;unsolved proteins? Based on that, I would wager that what DeepFold learned is an evolutionary &quot;language&quot; that maps out a large useful subset of the entire possibility space. Natural evolution tends build upon previous successes so it seems probable evolution has mapped out a fairly useful &quot;language&quot; of patterns for useful protein shapes. Especially given only a portion of the shape is critical to function for many proteins.<p>But agreed, <i>de novo</i> protein design based on DeepFold&#x27;s successes probably will outperform a naive approach by orders of magnitude. But why wait if even a naive approach is already orders of magnitude better than current methods?<p>Either way, I&#x27;m excited to see who comes up with the first custom protein(s) to catalyze industrial processes! Get some yeast&#x2F;bacteria to mass produce a protein based alternative to platinum catalyzer&#x27;s for fuel cells using an active site with organically available (and cheap) metals. Design half of it to stick to a polymer so it coats nicely. Bam, no more trying to get some weird polymer&#x2F;perovskite with the right properties. Not sure mRNA is needed at that point versus CRISPR, but maybe it&#x27;s more effective.')
