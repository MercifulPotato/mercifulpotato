Second thing is sell a service that ties into the open source code.  Third is have the core product open source, with paid add-ins.  The paid add-ins is even more attractive if there is a third-party requirement that prevents the additional functionality from being open source (i.e., if you want to add Oracle database support to your backup code, you need to license [under NDA] a development kit from Oracle; or things like patented plugins for specific video streaming formats on a media app).')
