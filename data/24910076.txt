So the GUI interaction is a separate issue from the storage format and representation.<p>The way Quanta works is that every sentence or paragraph can have an entire conversation thread underneath it, which is light-years ahead of the &quot;Revision Marks&quot; feature of MS Office&#x2F;365 for example. The model Quanta is using for team collaboration on documents means for example you can post a big long question about a single sentence in a doc, and it doesn&#x27;t get in the way of the main doc, or become visible unless expanded.<p>They way Quanta works is definitely the future, even if it&#x27;s some other platform other than Quanta where this takes off.')
