It is by definition true that all natives speakers who do not have intellectual disability are masters of their mother tongue and are idiomatic, except for idiosyncratic (personal&#x2F;creative) phrases. However, the issue is, languages live as a complex cloud of many mutually intelligible dialects and argo. The language you learn in school can really not be the language you learned from your parent; <i>that does not</i> mean you&#x27;re an imperfect native speaker. It is just the case that over the 19th century many nation states (such as Italy, Germany etc...) had to standardize their languages so that there is a way for all citizens understand each other; like a lingua franca except easier to learn.<p>Following this thought, it is possible for a non-native speaker to absorb the &quot;formal&quot; grammar of a language, however learning idiomatic speech and tiniest differences in connotation is a completely different deal. It is very plausible that a non-native speaker cannot master non-formal, &quot;human&quot; aspect of grammar.<p>Languages are formalized by people, so that we can teach them to other people. The assumption is that, although English is not a universal language, human brain has certain universal concepts, such as logic, that can be understood by everyone. Then we exploit this feature of this brain, we construct human languages as formal languages, so that we can study them. Purely speaking, languages are not formal objects, they&#x27;re just whatever native speakers use to communicate.<p>We can use physics as an analogy. Surely the universe does not operate with mathematical formulas and calculations. Humans observe the nature, then build models that predict nature. And the more predictive a model is, the more useful it is. If you&#x27;re designing a car Newtononian physics can be a very useful tool to understand the nature, but that doesn&#x27;t mean nature, intrinsically, uses Newtonian physics to &quot;behave&quot;. Similarly, we can observe human languages and construct imperfect models of them (grammar) after the fact. This is only good enough to explain 99% of the spoken language (good enough for all citizens to communicate).')
