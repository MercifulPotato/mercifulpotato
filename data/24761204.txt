Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602550221, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24760652, text='&gt; Not sure how much we&#x27;re paying for the voter guides, but I do know they are effectively useless. You get like a paragraph summary of the measure that offers no nuance, and maybe a sentence or two of hyper-biased For and Against statements.<p>That&#x27;s just the “Quick Reference” section at the front. In the main body, the summary of, for example, prop. 14 is page 16 through about the midpoint of page 20, considerably more detail than a paragraph. The for-and-against arguments are about a page and a half. And, of course, the full text of the measure is also included.')
