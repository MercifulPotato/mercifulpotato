Apparently, almost two centuries of doing that have lead us to some very clever and pragmatic efficiency tweaks, probably because the effort-motion feedback loop is so extremely compelling to the human mind (evolution has made us brains on an endurance locomotion machine, everything else is rather unimpressive compared to peer mammals).')
