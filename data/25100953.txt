And, usually, has done it quite well.<p>This happened to me while starting on Bike Gear Database - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bikegeardatabase.com (aka BGDB). I convinced myself I had stumbled onto a unique value prop for the bike industry. I started building out the stack and MVP like a madman. About a month in, a friend told me about the wonderful site called 99spokes which was everything that I had in my head for BGDB, and more.<p>At work, I was learning how to assess the value of websites using various SEO tools. A search at Ahrefs showed me that 99spokes had ranked for almost 75,000 keywords and were generating about 64k organic visitors a month.<p>I was crushed. How do you compete against that sort of traction? I ended up stopping work on BGDB because of it.\nA month or so later, I met a new friend named Alex, that had raised two companies from zero to acquisition. He understood BGDBs value. When I showed him 99spokes in Ahrefs he said, &quot;this is a very good thing&quot;.<p>The moment he said it, my entire mind clicked! Of course, it was a good thing! This meant that the idea was validated and there was a business in it. Also, there was only one other company working on the problem. This got me very excited and I got back to work. I am super thankful for Alex helping me see that.\nNow the question is - how do I scale to compete? Is there a possibility for us to even work together? Etc etc. Momentum is picking up and I am having a ton of fun making BGDB.<p>How about you? Have you ever let discovering a competitor stop you? Motivate you?')
