If anyone was lacking in the caring department, it&#x27;s actually the individual who could have cared, but didn&#x27;t. In Youtube&#x27;s case, there is literally nobody there that &quot;should have cared&quot; about this from an individual standpoint. That is, until they are made aware of the issue, which may take some work from those who do actually care about the outcome.<p>So, if this is perceived as Youtube&#x27;s problem, then how exactly would they (groups of individuals at Youtube) have realized this was occurring over a long period of time?')
