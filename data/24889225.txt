You can’t say that this revenue here goes to this cost, or that revenue there goes to another cost, and some other revenue is special because that’s the profit.<p>Apple made this deal with Google before the iPhone was even launched and arguably among the first revenue sources they ever had, and the revenue from it has risen as the value of that search bar has risen, along with their other revenue. It’s plausible to argue it’s enabled them to invest more in developing the phones and iOS, so without it their expenses might have been lower.<p>Another thing to consider is if Apple didn’t sell this deal to Google, they’d probably be making a deal with Microsoft to replace it with Bing, or Yandex in Russia, or whatever. It doesn’t only have value to Google, they might make less but still it would be a lot, so really the revenue that’s uniquely ‘Googly’ from an Apple perspective is just the delta of the extra they make from Google.')
