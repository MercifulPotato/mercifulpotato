Luckily the iPhone 6 was still getting security updates as of this year. It doesn&#x27;t have ios 13+ but it does have security updates on 12.<p>As a 6 user for another month or so, my biggest complaint isn&#x27;t slowness, it&#x27;s the lack of ram that causes apps to be closed readily whenever you switch, compounded by the apps having to boot&#x2F;reload again.<p>Most of the apps I use aren&#x27;t IOS apps, they&#x27;re things like chrome.<p>This is nothing like using a 3g or a 4 until they stopped getting updates, those were downright painful to use. This is merely frustrating.<p>I don&#x27;t know what people expect from their phones, but 5-6 years of updates and the phone still running well is incredible. I hope my next iPhone gets me another 6 years. It seems likely.<p>I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like in Android land, but I expect that the number people using a phone at all for 6 years is even less than those using old iPhones. At least they had way more ram for a same era phone.')
