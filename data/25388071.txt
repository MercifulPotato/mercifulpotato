An old CPU just supporting the base x86 instructions probably doesn&#x27;t have a hardware solution. Is it unfair to compare them?<p>YES! Unless you&#x27;re specifically searching for the fastest AES cpu.<p>If you want to compare general performance this benchmark is flawed. E.g.: I could have the fastest CPU in existence, but since it happens to be lacking hardware AES circuitry, your benchmark will always show another CPU as the &#x27;fastest&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s not &#x27;unfair&#x27; or whatever. It just makes it so that you need to think better about your benchmark, what you want to measure, and what you&#x27;re actually measuring. Or you need to adjust your conclusion: &quot;this is the fastest cpu&quot; -&gt; &quot;this cpu performs best on this specific task&quot;')
