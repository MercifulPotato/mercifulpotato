These congressmen are just clueless about tech entirely and apparently aren&#x27;t seeking expert help in advance of these hearings.<p>As a big tech employee myself, I absolutely believe that a lot of these big tech companies should be broken up and I can clearly see things that we are doing that aren&#x27;t good for the consumer. Congress just isn&#x27;t asking the right questions and isn&#x27;t asking for the right information.')
