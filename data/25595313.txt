Are you suggesting a completely unstyled web or something? Maybe if you fleshed out that idea you would be met with less criticism.<p>There is a good lesson here though, native browser controls should ALWAYS be your first consideration when building UI for the web. Try everything under the sun to stick as close to these as possible before you give up. You will thank yourself for having less code in which something can break. Your users will thank you for already knowing how to use the controls.<p>An example that drives me crazy is when dropdowns that could have been a select&#x2F;option group of controls are not. Because most of the time the subtle but insanely helpful keyboard controls are completely missing. Being able to type with the menu selected to jump to items is insanely helpful when the creator insists on jamming too many options into it. Think about that, it’s not exactly trivial to implement, and by the time you have the dozens of lines of JavaScript to implement it correctly... pretty hard not to ask yourself “what the hell am I doing...”')
