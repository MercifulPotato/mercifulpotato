That is, would Robinhood (and Reddit) be concerned that allowing users to execute a market manipulation attempt expose the platform to legal trouble, or are they protected by Section 230 (up to the point where the SEC asks them to do something specifically)?<p>This feels like another example of, &quot;Their house, their rules.&quot;  You don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to use Robinhood to trade on the NYSE, so the question becomes, &quot;Couldn&#x27;t these users execute these trades elsewhere?&quot;')
