It&#x27;s the same thing you&#x27;d expect from someone solving Leetcode problems; you don&#x27;t attack the general case immediately unless you&#x27;ve memorized the problem before, you usually try to play around with concrete examples until you&#x27;ve got enough of a handle on it to try and code up something a little more general.')
