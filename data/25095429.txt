Is dummy cell an official term? It&#x27;s perfectly fine but I thought it might be better described as a reference cell. I enjoy seeing self correcting designs like this. My question would be - if you were to contrast to modern DRAM is it quite similar or what are the differences? (I saw your chart at the end but I&#x27;m guessing that there is more similar than different in a modern DRAM?)')
