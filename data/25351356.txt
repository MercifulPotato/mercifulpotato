Because once a day the service went down was in the middle of the night with no one on call, pure availability was 80-90%. Given that it was a single country app with no one trying to do any business during the night, meaningful availability was ~99%. Knowing that gave us peace of mind and made tackling the problem a much more relaxed ordeal than the crunch time for a few weeks I&#x27;ve seen at other companies in similar situations.')
