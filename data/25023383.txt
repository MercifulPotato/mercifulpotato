Then he spent the last few months ginning up distrust of mail in ballots and instead of offering help to states to scale up their voting infrastructure he instead appointed DeJoy to head USPS who destroys sorting machines and slows down the mail.<p>Now he throws as many lawsuits as he can about the voting process with zero evidence. His suits are being thrown out because they are frivolous and lack credibility.<p>Doubt with regards to the voting process is being sown by a single person and we shouldn&#x27;t doubt our institutions just because someone is screaming loudly with no evidence.')
