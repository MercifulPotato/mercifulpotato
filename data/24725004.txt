This makes it much more similar to a weather forecast (e.g. the virus is approaching your vicinity through people in your network). This makes it a much more effective way to systematically identify, isolate, and contain further spread.<p>The idea is so simple and effective, I can&#x27;t believe this isn&#x27;t front and center over the news as a way to effectively contain the spread of COVID (beyond the existing measures of wearing masks, social distancing, etc).')
