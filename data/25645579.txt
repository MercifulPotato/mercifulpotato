We lack evidence in every direction. Although our prior is that it&#x27;s zoonotic, other experts I know acknowledge the possibility that we are looking at a lab leak. We simply don&#x27;t have enough information to say.<p>However, there is very strong pressure to reassure the public that it&#x27;s not lab-based, which would look bad for scientists and our generally pro-social efforts to help the world. I think this is misguided, because people are not stupid. They also can also observe the profound lack of evidence for zoonotic transfer, which frankly makes these assertions look like a coverup. It would be helpful if the scientific community were more honest and scientific about this issue. We should not jump to conclusions without evidence.')
