Slavery, civil war, post war confederate politics, etc. Poland, and europe generally, has different historical anchors.<p>Poland is a prime example, in fact. Consider what Poland was before 1938 and what it is now, demographically, ethnically, culturally, etc. Those things inform the present.<p>In some sense, interest in US politics may be useful (even if it is often irrational). It&#x27;s easier to see these things about other countries... like a fable or morality tale. By eventual analogy, it may come around.')
