Perhaps there is a robust process, but I haven&#x27;t heard it.<p>We&#x27;re a bit in the weeds though. To summarize top-level findings, for GA at least:<p>- The 2016 mail-in ballot rejection rate was 6.42% †<p>- The 2020 mail-in ballot rejection rate was 0.37%<p>That&#x27;s a huge, surprising difference that deserves an explanation. The GA secretary of state has refused to audit those signatures.<p>One of the arguments against the need to do an audit is that observers from both parties had a chance to challenge the signatures when the ballots were opened. But, per reports (I believe in sworn affidavits), republican observers were often unable to do so. So why not allow an audit of the signatures?<p>One could argue, as you and several other commentators have, that signature verification does not matter.<p>But that is not following (for GA) at least the written law; it also, I would say, remains unconvincing.<p>Finally, I don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s unreasonable about asking a signature to match. That does not seem like an unfair burden to place on legitmate voters.<p>If GA wanted to build confidence in these results, I would recommend at least uploading a copy of all accepted ballot envelope signatures along with the on-file registration signature. I think it would then become obvious one way or the other if it was reasonable to accept the ballots.<p>† These are taken from the state of TX lawsuit, which I assume are correct')
