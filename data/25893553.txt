I acknowledge the nay-sayers and the history of them on this topic<p>But to your point of ML being a solution. Honestly, I have a difficult time seeing how ML will give the manufacturing engineers enough tangible&#x2F;actionable steps to take to make this happen. We need a new physical framework to be able implement an engineered solution. But maybe it&#x27;s like eating an elephant (one bite at a time).<p>I will concede this though. <i>IF</i> it were to happen, ML will most likely bring it about. I appreciate you optimism grounded in the technology.')
