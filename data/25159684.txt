I&#x27;ve been playing video games for my entire life and the only Hispanic main character I can think of is that guy from Shadows of the Damned, which had potential to be great since it was made by my two favorite directors, but it&#x27;s just awful. The character (along with every other) is terribly written and their qualities, like his origins, only come up to be played for cheap laughs. Horrendous.<p>That said, I really enjoy Lucio from Overwatch in every way I can think of.')
