Item(by='avaldeso', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610815232, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25793395, text='&gt;educating and empowering women across the globe, including giving them control over family planning.<p>What a strange point, backed by a TED talk. While I agree with it (empowering women), I don&#x27;t see how it fits in the context of the article. I don&#x27;t know if research support the (implicit) claim that women are better (for some definition of better, valid in the context of ecological disruption) than men at family planning.')
