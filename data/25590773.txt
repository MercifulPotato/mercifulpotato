More exotic is nowadays, when quitting a Lisp system always writes all the changes to a new image, which then will be started next time.<p>ECL does not support images, but has live programming,<p>MOCL does not support images, nor full live programming. There are&#x2F;were a bunch of CL compilers which work similar. They support then only a subset of CL - a subset without some runtime support for things like EVAL or COMPILE.<p>Typically non-image based and non-live Lisp compilers were written for the compilation of Lisp to C, with the purpose of generating small static executables, MOCL does that. MOCL is based on the earlier CLICC compiler.')
