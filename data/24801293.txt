I played trumpet when I was in MS&#x2F;HS. Sure, you can play simple songs at your first concert after 3 months of playing - but it takes 3-5 <i>years</i> to get competent, not an expert mind you, but competent.<p>I started playing guitar as an older adult. Same story. You can start playing songs starting with lesson 1. This is great! Look at all the progress I&#x27;m making! I&#x27;m on year 7 now and I&#x27;m just starting to get to the point where I&#x27;d say yeah, I&#x27;m good. Not great, but good.<p>To your point, it takes a <i>long time</i> to master an instrument and no one has discovered a short cut. It&#x27;s hard work.<p>On another note, once you appreciate the work it takes to not just become good but become <i>great</i> at playing an instrument then support those who&#x27;ve dedicated their lives to becoming great. Otherwise it&#x27;s a skill humanity is going to lose over time and that would be really sad.')
