Microsoft owns them. Github is Microsoft. This article is asking Microsoft to start an App Store, which they have already done. It&#x27;s called Windows Phone Store. The article should be asking Microsoft to rebrand Windows Phone Store, not asking Github to make a new app store altogether.<p>I see the same thing happen with Twitch and Amazon. It feels like people don&#x27;t understand how much influence and control is exerted on  even the most independent subsidiaries, and how that control only increases year-over-year. Especially when it comes to something that generates money.')
