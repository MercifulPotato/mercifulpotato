Contrary to humans, wolves can thrive on lean meat for months. We present here data showing that all the Pleistocene archeological sites with dog or incipient dog remains are from areas that were analogous to subarctic and arctic environments. Our calculations show that during harsh winters, when game is lean and devoid of fat, Late Pleistocene hunters-gatherers in Eurasia would have a surplus of animal derived protein that could have been shared with incipient dogs.<p>This is based on reference [2] <i>A review of issues of dietary protein intake in humans</i>:<p>&gt; A suggested maximum protein intake based on bodily needs, weight control evidence, and avoiding protein toxicity would be approx. of 25% of energy requirements at approx. 2 to 2.5 g .cntdot. kg-1 .cntdot. d-1, corresponding to 176 g protein per day for an 80 kg individual on a 12,000kJ&#x2F;d diet [~2800 Cal]. This is well below the theor. maximum safe intake range for an 80 kg person (285 to 365 g&#x2F;d).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-020-78214-4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-020-78214-4</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chemport.cas.org&#x2F;cgi-bin&#x2F;sdcgi?APP=ftslink&amp;action=reflink&amp;origin=npg&amp;version=1.0&amp;coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD28XksFSru7s%253D&amp;md5=903b349d78332aeaecec077b07762d38" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chemport.cas.org&#x2F;cgi-bin&#x2F;sdcgi?APP=ftslink&amp;action=re...</a>')
