A container port won’t be prepared to handle anything heavier or even, in practice, the 10 tonne version.   These constraints apply to the rest of the system (roads, trucks etc — they are “intermodal” after all) so anything outside these constraints (wind turbine planes, major ship engine blocks etc) isn’t containerized anyway.<p>In other words the point of containerization is to be able to ignore these distinctions.  If you care, you ship as if it weren’t in a container')
