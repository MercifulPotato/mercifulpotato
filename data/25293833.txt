The audience responded to it. Audience noises added to the tension, and we all felt it. People tried to be quiet.<p>I can&#x27;t wait for theaters to be back. I just worry that they&#x27;ll be bought up by the tech giants and studios for a bargain and turned into some stupid membership scheme that only plays a given studio&#x27;s films. (This is my nightmare scenario, because I can&#x27;t even conceive of a world without theaters. That&#x27;s like a world without sports or restaurants.)<p>I&#x27;ve started going to the local drive in theater and it&#x27;s actually an amazing experience. It&#x27;s not the same sound system or crystal clear image, but the bigness is there and movies feel epic again. Tenet was really fun.')
