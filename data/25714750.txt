Each table is usually a team, and the winners split some small prize. It&#x27;s the best.<p>So one night at the Edinburgh University pub, the quizmaster asked a really obscure and weird question, like what was the name of the dog of some character that appeared twice on TV show off the air for twenty years.<p>Naturally, the answer was on Wikipedia. Naturally, the host had changed the answer the day before. And any team that gave his wrong answer lost half their points and were publicly mocked.<p>It was a great night.')
