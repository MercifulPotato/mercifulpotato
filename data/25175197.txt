In fact, finding the area under a curve the geometric way (finding quadratures) naturally leads to many series and in this case Newton himself is predated by many contemporaries and some ancients.<p>It arguably goes as far back as Eudoxus and his method of exhaustion. Archimedes basically reasoned about limits using synthetic geometry only.')
