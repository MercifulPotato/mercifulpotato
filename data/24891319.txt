While at work at GCHQ on 31 January 2003, Gun read an email from Frank Koza, the chief of staff at the &quot;regional targets&quot; division of the American signals intelligence agency, the National Security Agency.<p>&gt; Koza&#x27;s email requested aid in a secret operation to bug the United Nations offices of six nations: Angola, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Chile, Guinea, and Pakistan. These were the six &quot;swing nations&quot; on the UN Security Council that could determine whether the UN approved the invasion of Iraq. The plan might have contravened Articles 22 and 27 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which regulates global diplomacy.')
