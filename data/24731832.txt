This even goes for both iOS and Android phones. Digital display ads are major vectors of crime and the websites and the ad networks that serve them should be held liable for the damages that they cause to victims by facilitating the crimes. They are basically driving the cars for the burglars and helping them literally target victims like the elderly. Then they just say &#x27;oops lol we&#x27;re not liable.&#x27; It&#x27;s a joke. The government should go after them like it dismantled the Japanese empire in the 1940s. Take everything they have and put the executives in prison for decades.')
