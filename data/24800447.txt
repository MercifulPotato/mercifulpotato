This incredible effort has led to the creation of 7,500 routes that collectively stretch for over 110,000km.&quot;<p>The map visible is from the first draft. I don&#x27;t know why they haven&#x27;t released the first draft, but it could be that they don&#x27;t want to release potentially unsafe routes.
