But that implies that someone has to maintain the flatpak packge.<p>While the most popular themes are available, more &quot;niece&quot; themes are missing. Do a `flatpak remote-ls flathub | grep --color &quot;org.gtk.Gtk3theme&quot;` to see all available themes.<p>Note: I&#x27;m maintaining a theme on flathub.')
