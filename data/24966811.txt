It is not only Europe and USA, but also India, South America, Middle East, Russia, etc that fail at it for the same reason. The only continental country that managed to control the virus is China, but they can do it mainly because they have no problem banning immigration (which is not feasible for EU countries for example) and because they can use the centralized government to make decisions that would not fly elsewhere. Effectively, China can function as a really big island.')
