This is not an exceptional case of CDPR that&#x27;s under radar. It happens tons of times: Misleading labels, incorrect ingredients on some food, something is overpriced etc. And this is wonderful, as it is one of organization that can actually force a positive change.<p>But, 10% is a maximum penalty posted. For the instance [1] shows that in 2018 maximum penalty was 931k PLN (~300k $).\nAnother case [2] shows that penalty can be easily deceased if subject is cooperating (-50%) and further more decreased if subject takes penalty without court.<p>At the moment CDPR has done something extraordinary that is: extended refund policy for the title. Forcing that also on PlayStation (and taking ricochet by pulling title from the store). Providing a few hot fixes for very very fresh product and stating future work in next couple of months.<p>I do understand that players on base PS4 and XBOX are mad. And in my opinion UOKiK can help taking their side. But with such a complicated case, where lots of players do play and enjoy the game (even on these consoles). The 10% penalty is simply impossible. Also I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s is at all, as there is the refund policy in place.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uokik.gov.pl&#x2F;download.php?plik=24030" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uokik.gov.pl&#x2F;download.php?plik=24030</a><p>[2] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wiadomoscihandlowe.pl&#x2F;artykul&#x2F;uokik-pol-miliona-zl-kary-za-zawyzone-ceny-sprzetu-muzycznego" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wiadomoscihandlowe.pl&#x2F;artykul&#x2F;uokik-pol-miliona-...</a><p>TL;DR; UOKiK does that as requested and expected from them, but is very unlikely that 10% penalty will take place.')
