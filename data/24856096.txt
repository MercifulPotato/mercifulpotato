I could not find any English language article on any reliable&#x2F;reputable media reporting on this matter after searching extensively. Therefore I decided it was best to submit this reputable AFP one in German that could be translated easily using Google translate or whatever.<p>I thought it was quite important to report on it despite the absence of English media coverage.<p>I apologize for the title being wrong in this case but some other German media press articles have used the word backdoor instead of Trojan. I should have used the word Trojan instead of Backdoor in relation to this particular article and apologize for the mistake. But I&#x27;m not really sure which is worse to be honest... and I also suppose they don&#x27;t want the suspects aware of the Trojan being on their phone. Which leaves many wondering if they don&#x27;t mean that they want the Trojans at tech companies instead (which then would become backdoors).')
