There is no way I&#x27;d attempt to access services on random IP&#x27;s to test if they use no password with common usernames for those services. Any semi compotent prosecutor could argue I accessed a computer without permission and they&#x27;d be 100% correct.<p>The only way I can see myself accessing a computer and not breaking a law is through a genuine mistake i.e. mistyping an IP&#x2F;url and somehow having the right username + password.<p>I prefer to stay 100% on the legal side. The only way I&#x27;ll touch a computer is with a signed document from the owner giving me permission and with clear instruction on what I can and cannot do.')
