Right now the government&#x2F;fed essentially &quot;rolls&quot; their debt. They sell $30,000 in treasuries for $29,999, and in 3 months time sell $30,001 in treasuries for $30,000 to buy back the old one. (numbers not to scale, for illustration purposes) This is how the debt increases via the interest rate on treasuries.<p>The more likely &quot;disaster&quot; scenario is instead of &quot;rolling&quot; they just print, buy and don&#x27;t issue a replacement treasury.')
