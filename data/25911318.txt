For example,\n&quot;AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS=foreign&quot; should be the default; otherwise automake\nrefuses to finish if required files aren&#x27;t found in the project.\nThere&#x27;s a political problem here to persuade people of this. The\ndocumentation could also be improved. I remember somebody was\ncomplaining about this page:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;software&#x2F;automake&#x2F;manual&#x2F;html_node&#x2F;Program-and-Library-Variables.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;software&#x2F;automake&#x2F;manual&#x2F;html_node&#x2F;Progr...</a>\nand asking what &quot;maude&quot; meant - it turned out it was the name of the\ndog or something of the person who first wrote the program, who didn&#x27;t\nwant it to change. So think getting consensus is impossible for\nchanges that are needed to make the program simpler, easier and\nbetter. There&#x27;s a vacuum of responsibility where nobody wants to step\non others&#x27; feet. Forking the project would go nowhere as nobody would\nuse the fork.')
