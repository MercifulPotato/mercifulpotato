Different people should champion different issues, and it makes a lot more sense for the people directly affected by issues to champion solutions which make sense for them.<p>I as an affluent white male do not understand, and likely can never perfectly understand, the issues of racism that harm people of color living just a few minutes away from me. While I want my neighbors to be free of those problems, I can&#x27;t possibly evaluate which solutions work for them and which do not, and I would have no way of knowing if my efforts to help were doing more harm than good.<p>On the other hand, as an engineer who works on automation, I am extremely well qualified to evaluate the effects of economic policies on changes to the labor environment due to automation. Living in the rust belt, I feel I can do a lot to help rejuvenate my community as well as the larger nation, but that process looks very different. It&#x27;s still political involvement though.<p>In a democratic society, getting large numbers of people to understand issues and support candidates who advocate for those issues is a key step towards any systemic change. Political discussion is an effective tactic towards this end. It&#x27;s certainly not the only tool out there, and in many cases its not the right tool, but it&#x27;s vital all the same.')
