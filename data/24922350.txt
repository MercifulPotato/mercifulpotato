I mailed in my registration (naturalized citizen, this is my first election that I am eligible to vote in) about two weeks before the original deadline in my state (AZ), ...and nothing. I tried using the online registration service, didn&#x27;t work. Called support, got told to mail in a form. Great. Now, my only option is to go to a polling station and risk severe health complications for the rest of my life. Is my vote worth that much to me? Hell no.')
