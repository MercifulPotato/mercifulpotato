Vertical farming, solar, fission, fusion, astroid belt mining... The list goes on. If there&#x27;s a glass ceiling it&#x27;s not in sight or maybe it&#x27;s after we strip the solar system. If I ask myself what the meaning of life is, it seems to me that we are it. Yees - We should use our resources efficiently but we shouldn&#x27;t be afraid to see where this thing goes.<p>Also, people said that about the internet, electricity, whatever. &#x27;Only the rich are going to have it, why would they givee it to the poor?&#x27; Cause competition creates pressure to lower costs and sell more people on immortality. However, that argument falls apart if some nuclear powered government monopolizes the technology for the reasons you said above.')
