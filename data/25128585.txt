This is a concept that most beginners don’t really want or need.<p>Ideally git should evolve so that beginners can learn say 5 standard commands without args, and that’s enough to get on with their work.<p>Working should be as simple as:<p>git save, git amend, git tag, git push<p>Make everyday use simple and easy.')
