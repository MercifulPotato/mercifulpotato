There are some huge gainers on this list including companies like Overstock.com (+1055%), Tesla (+429%), Peloton (+348%) and Moderna (+285%).<p>But there are also plenty of big losers of these money-losing firms. More than one-quarter of these stocks are down 10% or more this year while almost 50 names have fallen 30% or more in 2020.&quot;<p>So that explains it pretty well.  You&#x27;re basically making a VC shotgun portfolio out of the stocks with the exact same dynamics - the big winners pull the average way up and offset the large number of middling and poor performers.  For a meaningful analysis, you would need to dig into the winning stocks specifically and ask why they&#x27;re up so much.')
