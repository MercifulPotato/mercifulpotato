And since my insurance covered it, in the end my employer (and the taxpayer) paid for it.<p>That was the most roundabout way to waste 5 people&#x27;s time (the HR person who came up with the policy, the employee, the doctor, someone greenlighting the charge at the insurance company, and the HR person greenlighting the doctor&#x27;s note).<p>All to &quot;save&quot; money by buying normal desks instead of flexible ones.<p>Which now meant that whenever I moved, I had to label my desk specially and have it moved separately, instead of just switching to the desk that was already there, causing me downtime, and the company extra moving cost.<p>And I&#x27;m sure someone somewhere was proud of their idea.')
