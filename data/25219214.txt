This is a sociological phenomenon first noticed in the 1940s. The bourgeoisie capitalist class largely turned over the reins to managers and set themselves on other pursuits.<p>Even in large organizations where the owners still do play a semi-active role, most of the day-to-day decision making is (necessarily) is made by the managers. And frequently, even when there is an active disagreement between management and ownership, management wins out.<p>As a suggestive example, who benefits from mergers? Upper management usually becomes much wealthier, but 50-80% of mergers fail to add value to the company. [1] That is, <i>capitalists</i> lose out 50-80% of the time, but they still happen anyway. Consider the increasing complaints about skyrocketing executive management pay divorced from company performance, golden parachutes, or companies being almost seemingly deliberately run into the ground while the people responsible walk off richer and with a new job.<p>The power of the managerial class does not just extend to the corporate world either - government has been largely infiltrated by managerialists. Conservatives talk about the Deep State, liberals talk about the revolving door. Both are talking about the same phenomenon.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu&#x2F;article&#x2F;why-do-so-many-mergers-fail&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu&#x2F;article&#x2F;why-do-so-many-m...</a>')
