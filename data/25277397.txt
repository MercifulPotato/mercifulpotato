You don&#x27;t need the ones with a different base.<p>Maybe I misunderstood your comment but it really sounds like you&#x27;re saying that only the natural logarithm has this property, but in fact it&#x27;s true with every base:<p>log(x^y; b) = log(x^y)&#x2F;log(b) = y log(x) &#x2F; log(b) = y log(x; b)')
