If you have &quot;a + b&quot;, and a and b are Employees, what does that even mean?  Does it commute?  Who knows?<p>But &quot;adding&quot; strings specifically, that idiom is I think sufficiently well established that it&#x27;s in the category of &quot;know the language - you&#x27;re not in C anymore&quot;.<p>I want operator overloading.  I want to be able to use + for adding, say, quaternions with integer components modulo n.  (I also like my operators.)  I want to be able to use | for or of fuzzy booleans defined as reals on the closed interval [0, 1].<p>I don&#x27;t want + for Employees.  But given what I <i>do</i> want, I don&#x27;t see how anything other than good taste can allow the one and prohibit the other.')
