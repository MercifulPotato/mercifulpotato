Goods that cause CO2 emissions in China and Europe are imported, amounting to about 7% of the US domestic total emissions in 2017 (edit: while China is a net exporter, about 14% of its emissions are for goods that leave the country). So reducing emissions only matters if they&#x27;re not moved to somewhere else. [0]<p>Also, China emitted about half as much CO2 per capita as the US in 2018, still ofc more in total, with about 4 times as large a population than the US.[1]<p>Edit 2: If you calculate in the trade, the US ends up with almost 3 times the emissions per capita of China.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carbonbrief.org&#x2F;mapped-worlds-largest-co2-importers-exporters" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carbonbrief.org&#x2F;mapped-worlds-largest-co2-import...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions_per_capita#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File%3A2018_Worldwide_CO2_Emissions_(by_region%2C_per_capita)%2C_variwide_chart.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_carbon_...</a>')
