I didn&#x27;t see the journalist as taking a perspective about whether any of the exodus is good or bad, just that it is happening.<p>I assume the anecdotal evidence you&#x27;re referring to is the interviews with various people who have left, are leaving, or are in the communities where Californians are moving. What would you have preferred instead of interviews? There was also evidence offered in terms of rising home prices in Idaho. What would have been more convincing to you, and is that evidence currently available?')
