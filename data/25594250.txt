It&#x27;s been a great tool to keep me working towards a goal (I originally joined as a way to keep myself honest in a personal commitment to &quot;create something every day&quot;).  500+ days later and I&#x27;ve seen huge improvements in my creative output.  The FL team has been making steady improvements since the beginning and it has become a much more generalized &quot;creative journaling&quot; tool.  It&#x27;s really cool to see the variety of projects, large and small, that the FL community is involved in.')
