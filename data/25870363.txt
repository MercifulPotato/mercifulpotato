If the rate isn&#x27;t openly advertised, get in touch with the recruiter and pretend to apply for the position, whatever rate they suggest, add 10-20% (that&#x27;s their markup) and use that for your rate.<p>If it&#x27;s a more specialized position, search for more common roles which require your skills and look at those rates, and potentially go back to the above approach to figure out the rate.')
