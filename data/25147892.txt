They could be VOC meters that make up a projected CO2 reading based on the presence of other chemicals in the air. You need to make sure the sensor is NDIR-based and actually measures CO2.<p>If you want accuracy, don&#x27;t buy retail sensors that don&#x27;t come with spec sheets. I&#x27;d find the sensor you want first then find or build a meter based on it. For example the SCD30 can be connected to an ESP32 and connected to WiFi using ESPHome [2], which can be set up with some YAML files.<p>&gt; self-calibration<p>Just by the way, self-calibration is what you want. Real CO2 sensors drift over time and you definitely want them recalibrated at least once a year. Auto-calibration takes away that pain and when implemented in a suitable way, really works. Many calibration routines are not suitable for residential environments as they&#x27;re based on the assumption that they will see pure fresh air at least once a day. This is a safe assumption in a business environment because most AC systems have an overnight fresh air purge. In a residential environment though, someone might not open the window once a day.<p>Again referencing Sensirion, their auto-calibration cycle looks for two, hour-long valleys in the CO2 readings over the previous two weeks that are within a few percent of each other and uses those as a fresh air reference. In my experience, this works well at home.<p>&gt; Another downside to this difficulty in testing is that it&#x27;s hard to truly evaluate a particular meter&#x27;s performance. Which seriously limits side-by-side comparisons of different models, and makes it harder to hold manufacturers &#x2F; retailers accountable for poor performance.<p>You &quot;just&quot; need a reference to compare to. If you have a look at academic literature, they typically use a lab-grade setup to compare. You&#x27;re right though, it&#x27;s difficult for a regular home user to evaluate a sensor like this.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sensirion.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;environmental-sensors&#x2F;carbon-dioxide-sensors&#x2F;carbon-dioxide-sensors-co2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sensirion.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;environmental-sensors&#x2F;carbon-di...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sensirion.com&#x2F;fileadmin&#x2F;user_upload&#x2F;customers&#x2F;sensirion&#x2F;Dokumente&#x2F;9.5_CO2&#x2F;Sensirion_CO2_Sensors_SCD30_Interface_Description.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sensirion.com&#x2F;fileadmin&#x2F;user_upload&#x2F;customers&#x2F;se...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esphome.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esphome.io&#x2F;</a>')
