Even if both the client connects via https, AND the server supports https, cloudflare uses an unencrypted http connection.<p>Even the encryption: &quot;full&quot; setting is useless, since it doesn&#x27;t verify certificates in any way, so an MITM attacker can just sign their own cert in your name.<p>I suspect CF does this so they can have their &quot;one-click&quot; on boarding for panicking under-attack companies. It really shows that despite all the blog posts about lava lamps and how important security is for them, in the end sales and the shareholder&#x27;s interest (profit) is king. The very least they should do is have huge warnings about switching to &quot;full (strict)&quot; asap, but really the other two shouldn&#x27;t be an option at all.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of this whenever I add a new site to CF, since when port 80 is not open, CF just does not work at all, it just shows &quot;backend server down&quot;, even when TLS&#x2F;443 is set up correctly.<p>And arguing that &quot;it&#x27;s fine because it protects the connection between the user and the CF server which is the most vulnerable point&quot; is ridiculous. Your nearest CF server is probably in a neighboring city, so the whole path between that city and the other side of the world is readable and modifiable by whoever.')
