However, they cannot run this stack without managing a database, as the database and REST API are run in the same container. My point is that another way to lower a project’s required effort is to offload database management.<p>Sure, OP now only has two layers in the stack instead of three. But now they are locked into managing the database entirely, including updates, backups, and scaling.')
