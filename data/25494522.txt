Sometimes mediocre developer masking himself as a great developer is able to create a distortion field when he never finishes anything and relies on help from others to achieve his perceived fantastic output.<p>No, we are not talking about that kind of person.<p>What I mean is a person that is truly great developer. The organizations will frequently try to make good use of this person.<p>One strategy is to get that developer to work on green-field projects only. He will design&#x2F;write the code but once it is in prod it is going to be outsourced to another team and the star developer moves to another exciting project.<p>Another strategy is to offload as much non-critical work as possible. Junior developers to write to spec? Testers? &quot;Devops&quot; engineers (as much as I hate that term)? These are all possible way to keep the perceived star developer with only hardest problems.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t say it is a good practice -- it is just something I have noticed over the years. Good developers have much more say in what they are going to be working on and in what capacity and this means taking interesting tasks and leaving mundane to more junior members.')
