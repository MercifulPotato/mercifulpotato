Five? Ten? It&#x27;s simply not sustainable for 95% of people. And it&#x27;s unrealistic to hold everyone else to the standard of that 5% who are 1) naturally hyper-productive or 2) have little else going on in their lives.<p>The cynic in me wonders if the attempt to turn overwork into a virtue is just to keep people busy enough that they don&#x27;t stop to wonder what it&#x27;s all for in the end.
