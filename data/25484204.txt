I use sendowl which is as cheap as $9 a month + Stripe fees (2.9% + 30 cents).<p>I used to use gumroad, but had issues. I think they&#x27;ve gotten a bit complacent (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@atrigol&#x2F;gumroad-review-things-they-need-to-fix-in-2018-cb3c8a338bbc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@atrigol&#x2F;gumroad-review-things-they-need-...</a>) so prob room in the space. Good luck!')
