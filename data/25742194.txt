You clearly believe you can discern truth from lies, as do I.  So why should the solution to misinformation be to trust a small group (who we didn&#x27;t elect) to parse truth from fiction?  I&#x27;d rather have access to all the information, and be better at discernment.  And I reject the idea that we represent a minority of the United States. I think <i>most</i> people are way better at detecting lies than we give them credit for. The problem is, both sides lie. So it&#x27;s too easy for us to view those who hold opposing views as ignorant fools, because they are on the side of a lie, regardless of if they believe that falsehood or not.')
