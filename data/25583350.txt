So I used Google to search for the disease to get to its Wikipedia page. Then I almost forgot about it.<p>For months after that, Google bombarded me with the links to the disease and cures and remedies and whatnot.<p>I remember even seeing that at my kid&#x27;s gaming PC, and I don&#x27;t remember ever logging in to my Google account there. We only shared the same IP in the household.<p>That&#x27;s pretty anecdotal, I know, but that&#x27;s what there is.')
