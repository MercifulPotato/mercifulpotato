Item(by='alxlaz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608019827, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25427328, text='&gt;  You start to think about what you design and build in a different way. You start to remember that the people using your web site aren&#x27;t on the latest whiz-bank iPhone 16. They&#x27;re on a craptastic pre-paid piece of garbage that they bought at 7-Eleven and share with other members of their family.<p>Your realization is spot-on, but what&#x27;s disturbing is that this is done by having developers work front desk-ish and hoping they learn the lessons, instead of being imposed, top-down, from a higher level.<p>&quot;We should write software for the kind of devices our users are using&quot; isn&#x27;t a story from the trenches, it&#x27;s product and software development management 101. &quot;We should target devices with these baseline specs&quot; isn&#x27;t something you get by having developers eyeball what phones their users are on, you get them by having Marketing put those fancy analytics tools that cost an arm and a leg every month to good use, and then by having those smart-ass program managers come up with a product definition that includes them, instead of the same generic &quot;engaging, easy-to-use software that enables our customers to yadda yadda yadda&quot; that gets cranked out each year.<p>This way everyone&#x27;s writing against the same specs. Otherwise the two developers who ended up in the VIP clinic and have seen nothing but iPhones all day will keep cranking out the code that turns the phones everyone uses into egg frying machines, while the other guys will write lean, mean software that the UX lead and the CTO will laugh at and then they&#x27;ll go berserk about how premature optimization is the root of all evil because they&#x27;re on iPhones, too, and the whole thing work just fine.')
