Item(by='watwut', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606308082, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25208133, text='&gt; But this claim is basically not defended, and my point is that it&#x27;s very easy to come up with cases in which it&#x27;s not only morally acceptable for a doctor to lie to you, but in fact might be morally obligatory. This means that the argument fails.<p>I don&#x27;t find that easy at all. That is the thing, all those doctors examples are either super unlikely to ever happen or happen due to non-medical reason. I mean, ok, if I am SS man and it is WWII and doctor is saving someone ... but I don&#x27;t live in country with current genocide and the core issue is not doctor specific.<p>The doctors in fact used to routinely lie to patient and family to &quot;protect&quot; their feelings. In generation of my parents&#x2F;grandparents, the doctor would not tell you about bad prognosis. And that generation do not trust doctors when they tell them it is going to be ok.<p>Current doctors (at least here) are routinely acting more confident then they should when they are more of guessing. Or they just don&#x27;t explain. And result is predictable - people turn to internet and word of mount from friends to fill the gaps.')
