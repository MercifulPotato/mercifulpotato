Bob creating more wealth than Fred does not mean that Bob took it from Fred. There&#x27;s nothing unfair about Bob creating more than Fred.</i><p>Sure, I think this is pretty much universally recognized. But if Bob creates 10x the wealth but receives 100x the income, that <i>is</i> unfair. And that is the situation that many believe we find ourselves in, where the wealthy are being systematically over-rewarded by the system we have in place to distribute the wealth that is being created.')
