And they don&#x27;t require sending a sample back to the lab, you just poke a few holes in a turd with something that looks like a mascara brush, put it in a test tube and wait around for a bit. It&#x27;s super simple. No lab required. If the result is positive, you talk to your doc and possibly have a colonoscopy scheduled.<p>Not sure why this article talks about sending samples back to a lab. Maybe the 100% at home self test isn&#x27;t approved in the US or something?')
