Cars aren’t just necessary in American culture due to our car centric infrastructure, we have car clubs, car enthusiasts, and hobbiest. People race them for fun. There are art cars, and cars used as status symbols. Cars take lead rolls in our films, art, and music. Car culture is alive, well, obvious, and huge. If you want cleaner electric cars, you gotta build them with respect to the culture. Tesla is doing a good job of that. Just look at the Cyber truck. It’s a big ass overpowered truck, just how truck owners like their trucks.<p>*Added: I can imagine a conversation in my old home town of a Cyber truck owner saying, “yeah my truck is quite, but the glass is bulletproof!”')
