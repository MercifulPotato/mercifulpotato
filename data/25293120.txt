Gold can be destroyed, increasing its scarcity. Plus we already have the technology to create gold out of other elements in a particle accelerator, decreasing its scarcity. That process happens to be prohibitively expensive, but there is no guarantee it remains so. The scarcity of cryptocurrencies and gold both depend on the actions of other people.')
