What we don&#x27;t do, however, is support multiple execution environments -- we&#x27;re tightly coupled to Kubernetes.<p>The fact that it&#x27;s OSS makes it a compelling starting point for other organizations who are beginning their own in-house PAAS efforts (or restarting them). If I were starting over I&#x27;d definitely dig into this before deciding to roll my own.<p>I know I&#x27;m certainly going to need to make some time to learn more about Waypoint. It might be too much pain to migrate to, as our in-house system is pretty mature -- but it&#x27;ll at the very least serve as a source of inspiration. NIce work!<p>Do you know how you plan to monetize this in the long-run? I assume it&#x27;s via a managed offering, where the end-user isn&#x27;t responsible for hosting the software themselves and instead pays a monthly rate (or pays per use). Knowing what that trajectory looks like we help me feel more comfortable using it, as it&#x27;d clarify how it will &#x2F; will not change.')
