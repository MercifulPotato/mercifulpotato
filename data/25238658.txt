It’s not a matter of “can they figure it out,” it’s a matter of doing that in ten places and still somehow hold the other three bits of critical data in short term memory. If this path isn’t fruitful then there are five other theories to try so it’s not particularly amenable to writing it down.  It’s flow state depth first search, and the crappy non-idiomatic code is ruining the flow.<p>People always try to deflect based on some intelligence argument. I’m not trying to understand your code, I’m trying to understand <i>something you missed</i>.  This isn’t about intelligence, it’s about wisdom.')
