The good ones make a serious effort to get at least a vague understanding of how the product works and are hungry to hear ideas on how to deliver more value.<p>However most PMs will not be this way. Their primary instinct is to interface with the product hierarchy and explain to engineers what the “higher ups” want. They exercise this power by vetoing ideas that don’t fit into this narrative, even if these ideas would improve the product. Engineers then mostly don’t really share everything that they’re working on with the apathetic PM; the motivated ones build things anyways risking rebukes while others will do just what product asks for.<p>The only scalable solution really, is to create processes and career paths for engineers who are inclined to product design to become PMs, or at least spend part of their time as PMs.<p>At Service Oriented B2B companies, there is another class of people who become excellent PMs: the Customer Service Managers, who have dealt with Customers and their issues, and have a deep understanding of the problems and frustrations faced by users of these systems.')
