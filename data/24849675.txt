Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603299340, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24849479, text='&gt; Another important distinction: this is Francis voicing his opinion in a documentary, and not an official communiqué such as an apostolic constitution<p>Apostolic constitutions are <i>legislation</i>, not <i>communiqués</i>. And (outside of the State of Vatican City), the papal legislative authority doesn&#x27;t extend to the content of civil law, which is the subject matter here.<p>An exhortation on a matter like civil law which is prudential on its face but on which the moral teaching of the Church has important impacts would probably be addressed, in a more formal context, in a papal encyclical or apostolic exhortation.<p>EDIT [1] here&#x27;s a very different perspective on its significance:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;JamesMartinSJ&#x2F;status&#x2F;1318970487242956801" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;JamesMartinSJ&#x2F;status&#x2F;1318970487242956801</a><p>EDIT [2] to merge a separate response:<p>&gt; If the Catholic church moves on this issue, will she lose the support of evangelical voters?<p>While the politically activist Christian Right has made tactical alliance with conservative Catholics on many issues, anti-Catholicism is historically very strong among American evangelicals and fundamentalists, so, and neither politically liberal nor politically conservative Catholics in the electorate seem to move, and certainly not rapidly if they do at all, in response to policy shifts by the Church heirarchy, so I expect to have very little impact on the Barret confirmation, either the Senate process or public support one way or another for it.')
