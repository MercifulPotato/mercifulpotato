If enough people are fed up by Google&#x27;s cut, they will probably build an open alternative soon...<p>But we can see a pattern: if you rely on companies (either as a paying customer or as a user of their open free APIs or source offering), you may be let down. Can&#x27;t happen to open community projects like Wikipedia (happy birthday, btw!).<p>So a major reason (for anyone, certainly for me) to use open projects is continuity! Anythink proprietary can go anytime.')
