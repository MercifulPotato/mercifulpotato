The best I could come up with is PG.<p>Both benefitted greatly from and became masters of social media BUT:<p>- DT contributed nothing to Twitter<p>- PG invented&#x2F;funded&#x2F;advised Reddit and HN (and even coded the latter)<p>Both billionaires BUT:<p>- DT inherited his wealth and barely kept it via screwing over other people<p>- PG accumulated his wealth through making things and helping others<p>Both intelligent BUT:<p>- DT lies prolifically and avoids thinking about people or issues more than skin deep<p>- PG spends months critically trying to write true essays<p>Both hugely successful BUT:<p>- DT has an insatiable desire for fame and adoration<p>- PG leaves YC to go live quietly in the countryside')
