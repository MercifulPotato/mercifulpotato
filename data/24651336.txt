A USB &quot;SS&quot; imprint meant something. Current cables have no imprint, so it&#x27;s going to be impossible to tell whether something&#x27;s a USB 2.0 or 3.0 or 4.0 or 3.2 2x2 cable or what capabilities it supports without plugging it in -- and the capability matrix is simply too complex to currently imprint, so that also needs to be solved, with only a few available capabilities listed (even if this means your 3m cable for computer-&gt;speakers costs $30 for capabilities you don&#x27;t need). It&#x27;s the only way to solve this mess while holding the connector constant.')
