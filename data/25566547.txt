To be safe you need the ability to stay silent for 24h while still asserting your rights, possibly longer depending on the jurisdiction, and that&#x27;s all before youre even charged with anything.<p>Someone being held for 10 days as a suspect for a crime they didn&#x27;t commit is unfortunately a benign occurrence for the American legal system. People regularly lose months of their life, held in captivity, awaiting trial.')
