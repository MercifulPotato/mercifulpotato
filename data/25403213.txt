But I&#x27;m not telling you what it is!&quot; but Facebook is beset constantly by bogus bounty claims and they will blow you off.<p>You can give them a hint as to what it is, to vouch for the legitimacy of your finding, but Facebook has one of the better-resourced security teams in the industry, and they&#x27;re just going to find it themselves and shut it down without paying you anything.<p>Part of being a good &quot;agent&quot; is understanding the market you&#x27;re working in.<p>† <i>Especially because to even try to put a valuation on the bug --- which, again, ~nobody wants to buy --- you&#x27;d have to actively exploit it to see what&#x27;s on the target system, which is straightforwardly a felony.</i>')
