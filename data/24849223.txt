Getting some good statistics but not exposing to visitors they are tracked (even in a friendly mode) would be nice...<p>I&#x27;m in the same boat.  About a year ago i migrated over to Matomo (fka Piwik) and away from google analytics for all my (and family, friend) web sites that i manage. While i really don&#x27;t have many big complaints of Matomo, i really wish i didn&#x27;t have to use javascript for this.  I started looking at - but did NOT implement - GoAccess [<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;goaccess.io]...but" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;goaccess.io]...but</a> don&#x27;t think it fills what i need.  Honestly, for the websites that i manage - and in these days where i want to preserve both my privacy and the privacy of my web visitors - I&#x27;m wondering if i should just very well shut off all tracking on the front-end, and try using GoAccess or even AWStats, and process stuff offline. I&#x27;m not running any ecommerce site after all.  And, removing yet another little element (javascript) from websites helps with performance for visitors.  Sorry, not helping much, maybe give a look at GoAccess...?  Good luck!')
