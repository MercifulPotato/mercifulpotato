All we need to do is take away their access to personal information. That will strip advertising of the vast majority of its value and should largely have the same effect.<p>The important thing is to encourage mutual engagement and trust between sites and their users. Sites don’t currently need to do this because personal information stripping by the advertisers substitutes for it very well. Take that away and the relationship between authors and audience get pushed to the front, where they should be.')
