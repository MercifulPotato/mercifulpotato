You&#x27;re not allowed to combine their data with any other data, so you&#x27;re pretty much stuck with exercising just the features the API provides without any room for creativity. But you&#x27;re also not allowed to create anything that competes with Google&#x27;s own app offerings[0]. So it is very unclear just what exactly you&#x27;re expected to do with these APIs.<p>[0] Of course, not that they provide enough features through the APIs that you could. Things like StreetView photospheres are only available through a black box viewer widget or small, rectangular snapshots at configurable view angles. You can recreate the photosphere by combining several dozen of these shots, but each of them will have a very visible copyright watermark that you are contractually obligated to retain. You also don&#x27;t get any access to their LIDAR depth data, so you can&#x27;t do any sort of stereo reproduction. This all boils down to making the data source essentially useless for VR. Which would probably be considered as &quot;competing with Google Earth&quot; anyway.')
