This is also the team workflow&#x27;s fault to not accommodate time for validating design.<p>We suffer from this greatly. Our app is complicated by nature. The designs that come from our product team turn a blind eye on the complexity and try to &quot;make it simple&quot;. As a result, the product doesn&#x27;t really work (in some aspects).<p>Every time we try to &quot;validate&quot; those designs, we&#x27;re shut down &quot;because simplicity&quot;.<p>Honestly I think product designers should go through a database course or something to understand that if there&#x27;s a one-to-many relationship between to entities in real life, you cannot force it into a one-to-one relationship and ignore all potential corner cases. Suddenly 40% of cases are &quot;corner cases&quot; and the app doesn&#x27;t work.')
