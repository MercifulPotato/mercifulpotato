But isn’t this like persisted queries (the Relay kind and not Automatic kind) without the benefit of prototyping your queries as a front end dev as you’re working on the front end?<p>I’d say that’s completely fair still, just wondering. I’d also say I understand the carefulness and stance on “smart clients,” i.e. normalized caching, which is why this isn’t a default in urql, but without it I think the discussion here is much more nuanced.<p>It’s so to speak much easier to rely on an argument with a smarter client and the Apollo ecosystem, than the rest.
