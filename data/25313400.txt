Is git configured to so automatically? Or are you going to configure push hooks on one of those services?<p>What about your issue&#x2F;ticket and PR&#x2F;MR management? Where will that be? Are you going to use an in-git solution like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MichaelMure&#x2F;git-bug" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MichaelMure&#x2F;git-bug</a>, somehow sync everything using custom scripts or wait for <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forgefed.peers.community&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forgefed.peers.community&#x2F;</a> to be finalized and implemented by all code hosts?<p>How are you going to collaborate with others?<p>How are you going to introduce newcomers to all these options?<p>Do you know of a tool that solves most (or all) of those issues?')
