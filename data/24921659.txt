Still, overall with a few hacks here and there it works mostly very well. Basically I know that we&#x27;re 2nd class citizens within the unix desktop world but at least the X11 model gives us enough of preemption to get things working mostly correctly.<p>From what I see of Wayland I&#x27;m very concerned in the long run. Not being able to just beat a window into submission X-style seems like it would create a world of troubles.<p>And <i>because</i> tiling environment are fairly niche I don&#x27;t expect the ecosystem to organically evolve solutions to all of these problems.<p>And if you think &quot;well just stop using tiling WMs and use whatever else is using you weirdo&quot; please do note that these issues are also often the same that are encountered by people with disabilities who need to rig their UIs in certain ways to make them usable. Also you&#x27;ll have to pry my tiling WM from my cold dead hands, you heathen.')
