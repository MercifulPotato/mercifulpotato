I think your assumptions are wrong and definitely don&#x27;t match my use case. I know there is a cost of context switching, but even with adding all that I was getting much better performance. I work with 1024 buffer and use CPU heavy plugins. Let&#x27;s say that my CPU (i9 9900k @5GHz) can run 8 plugins maximum on one core. Now I have 4 tracks, and each track has 4 plugins. That sounds okay, but as soon as I use a send effect on three tracks, they are being processed in one thread and that expects one core to serve 12+1 plugins. Suddenly I get overload and I can&#x27;t play anything. If I use jBridge, the plugins on each track will run in parallel utilising all cores and playback is smooth. The cpu usage per plugin is higher because of the overhead of the wrapper, but I am able to much more plugins without breaking up. \nI think Ableton model does not take into account that you are bound by how many plugins one core can service and if you try to cram as many plugins into one thread you&#x27;ll have performance issue. The strategy should be the opposite - trying to spread the load onto as many cores as possible.')
