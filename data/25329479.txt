Red Hat employee makes a lot of sense. We burned significant time in the last 2 weeks because RHEL 8 intentionally makes it <i>very</i> hard to `dnf install docker-ce` (even though you are literally just installing the centos&#x2F;rhel 7 package), and insteadm RH docs + staff tell IT admins who don&#x27;t know better to `dnf install podman` as the only correct option and lie that is drop-in compatible. Then we get support tickets because, surprise, podman often doesn&#x27;t actually replace docker due to bugs, or in areas like `docker-compose`, because it isn&#x27;t even implemented.<p>Docker&#x27;s second death is very much IBM&#x2F; RHEL&#x27;s anti-competitive intent. An infrastructure provider should be neutral on how they present this kind of thing, especially a company selling enterprise reliability for running software on top. The 1984-esque double speak experience has been quite souring wrt ethics of doing business with them around cloud&#x2F;container-era technology and trusting them for enterprise reliability.<p>I do find the podman ecosystem <i>technically</i> interesting... but due to the unethical corporate stewardship we&#x27;re seeing, I&#x27;m uncomfortable seeing anyone use it.')
