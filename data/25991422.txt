There has been a shift in the last two years and people have started running away from them. Specifically the web-dev crowd adored them and I guess it&#x27;s easy to fetch a document in the exact structure you need it but sooner or later you inevitably reach the point where you have to analyze data. And here mongo(and all the similar alternatives) become the biggest pain in the a...neck you can think of. Couchbase tried to tackle this issue with n1ql to a certain degree but at large scale it is still not particularly useful. To my mind, having a relational database which has a good architecture can&#x27;t be matched by any document oriented database. But getting a large system&#x2F;database right does take more effort. There are numerous ways to make relational databases incredibly scalable but again, it takes a lot more effort.')
