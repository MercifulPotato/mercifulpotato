It is dire time to get rid of the App Stores, Google&#x27;s and Apple&#x27;s, they are a net negative for everyone except them.<p>If you are a small developer, you can get review bombed and your app download rate can take a drastic hit, while if you are cozy with the big players (<i>wink wink</i> RobbingHood) Google will take down your 100k negative reviews.<p>They keep reaping the rewards for doing absolutely nothing, except having the app be searchable.<p>You do your own marketing, you develop your own app, you design your own app, you have nothing from Apple except that you need to ask for their permission to push your product on their walled garden.<p>Of course I would love not to push it on the App Store, but they do not allow competition on iOS, which is the prime case for anti-trust.<p>iOS does not make the smartphone experience, the apps make the smartphone experience. The order of priority should not be forgotten.<p>If Spotify, Facebook, Google, Netflix and Amazon disappeared overnight from the App Store, I would love to see how willing would people be for their &quot;eco-system&quot; (walled garden)??')
