I myself am a science educator and a mother of twins girls 4 years old.and yes, I used YouTube so many.times to find something fun but educational that I can do with my young kids too, and I found the videos boring for my kids or requiring way to.many items for me to buy. So I created a series of videos with quick STEM educational activities for young kids and parents&#x2F;educators to watch and play together, in parallel to the video. I only use household items and aim for very very low cost &amp; quick preparation so you can do it together with your little ones avoiding long boring preparations! The videos are playfully designed encouraging kids to feel happy and excited for science activities so they can have fun and learn:) maybe it would be helpful for you too..\nFor example,this is a fun educational kids science activity with colors and paper towels - You can show kids how to do it a couple of times, and let them play independently for ages. It teaches them the basic elements of how water is transferred through paper towels just like a river. Also, when the washable colors are traveling with it, they are mixing and creating beautiful art pieces different every time, which is very engaging for young kids.You can also extend it by: \n1) Demonstrating the creation of secondary colors by using exclusively primary colors.\n2) Connect new pieces of kitchen paper towels to existing paper towels and monitor how the water and colors continue to flow.\n3) Try using normal paper and&#x2F;or toilet paper and monitor the colors and water flow. Watch how the colors do not travel the same way as with the kitchen paper towels because different materials allow water to flow from them in different quantities and speeds.<p>I hope you like it:) let me know your thoughts :) \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;U41HIDxertg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;U41HIDxertg</a>')
