They were reluctant to be open about the Walmart robots.<p>From what I heard&#x2F;saw I figured there was something more because what it seemed to be achieving was very low hanging fruit.<p>Walmart is notorious for cutting costs and keeping prices low for shoppers and a razor thin profit margin. Their real strength is their supply chain and I have tremendous respect for what Walmart does...and I don’t think anyone matches Walmart when it comes to supply chain management. I heard even amazon’s best are from Walmart.<p>Having said that..I could see no way Bossa Nova bots were compatible with Walmart principles. IMO, they should all pivot and work on autonomous Ag bots. Unlike warehouses, there are multiple environments and multiple problems to solve in Ag. And it’s under explored and under developed.<p>I remember thinking that this(walmart bots) is similar to Ag robotics. Robotics and automation companies coming up with a solution first and then hope that they can define the problem later. They are creating solutions for problems that don’t exist in the first place.')
