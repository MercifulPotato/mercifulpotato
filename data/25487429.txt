Scarfs don&#x27;t protect you or others. Neither do gaiters. This has been tested. They may work mildly for UV protection... But there you can be fooled as well.<p>They just don&#x27;t work. N95s provide a level of protection but they are not full proof. The further away you move from N95 the more useless they get. Cotton etc. don&#x27;t protect. They are overcome by physics.')
