Item(by='linguae', descendants=None, kids=[25407371], score=None, time=1607866571, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25406170, text='I also grew up with a TI-83, though in college I learned about HP calculators and RPN and ended up buying a HP-48S on eBay; those were the cheapest non-financial HP calculators I could find on eBay at the time.  I love RPN, but I liked my TI-83&#x27;s ease of use.<p>Another factor that could have led to the demise of HP calculators was Texas Instruments&#x27; partnerships with textbook companies.  When I was in high school, many textbooks had TI-83 examples and exercises.  My impression is that HP&#x27;s calculators were marketed to college students and engineers, while TI marketed its calculators to the much more lucrative middle and high school market.  Thus turned out to be a winning strategy for Texas Instruments.<p>As a computer scientist&#x2F;software engineer, I seldom use handheld calculators anymore.  I use the Unix dc command whenever I need to make quick calculations, and I have LibreOffice Calc, GNU Octane, and REPLs available (such as Python and Common Lisp) whenever I need to perform more complex calculations.  If I must calculate something away from my computer, I can use my iPhone&#x27;s calculator app.  I would imagine that this killed the traditional market for HP calculators; why spend the money on a bespoke handheld calculator when most engineers have access to computers and smartphones?<p>However, in a classroom setting I wouldn&#x27;t be allowed to use my iPhone.  Texas Instruments did a good job courting the classroom and standardized test markets.  HP might have figured that it didn&#x27;t want to compete against TI in this market.<p>With that being said, I wish I didn&#x27;t miss out on the HP-15c special edition that was on sale briefly in 2011; I didn&#x27;t hear any announcements until it was already sold out.')
