This would obviously add friction to the process of engagement, and not everybody would like it, but I found the thought interesting.<p>Another approach would be to allow different categories of upvotes, like slashcode-based sites have. Then users can set &quot;Informative&quot; comments to get precedence over &quot;Insightful&quot; ones in their personal browsing, since &quot;Informative&quot; typically means that a comment is related to the story and &quot;Insightful&quot; merely means that upvoters agreed with whatever was being expressed.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing that either of these options is right for HN, just throwing out a couple of possibilities that seemed relevant.')
