Sure, I stop what I&#x27;m doing and send an email. I get a reply back saying (summed up with the anger of watching the internet burn down around you) &quot;go to our support forum and grovel publicly but if you&#x27;re actually trying to reach someone send another email and we might take it seriously&quot;.<p>...is this really what awaits those of us who choose not to be with the largest email providers (Gmail&#x2F;Hotmail&#x2F;Yahoo) or refuse to use SSO (Google&#x2F;Github&#x2F;FB Login)?')
