You may be able to alter the perms on that subdirectory to avoid running as root, although I haven&#x27;t bothered. I only go to such trouble when it&#x27;s necessary to use something that hasn&#x27;t been packaged by OS maintainers. Like make, npm isn&#x27;t really intended to replace OS package management. npm is for using really &quot;fresh&quot; software. Of course we have to be more careful doing that, so we only do it when the benefits outweigh the costs.')
