Kind of wish IBM had won processor wars. Generally speaking whenever I look at their mainframe doodads, then look at the hot garbage being slung over at Amazon or whatever FAANG shit hole, it makes me sad. The company with the best engineers is an also-ran that mostly sells consultant hours. Maybe they&#x27;ll sell off the mainframe business independent of the rest of the horse shit and it will undergo a renaissance. Doubt it though.')
