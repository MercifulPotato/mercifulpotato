That same source lays out why worrying about this risk is not rational (in this case)<p>3. No-one is seriously calling for forced vaccination for corona<p>4. (my opinion) by over-emphasizing the &quot;personal choice&quot; angle we are letting anti-vaxxination pseudo science and conspiracy beliefs spread without being challenged. Some things are more wrong than others and the science for the harm of vaccines has oveerwhelmingly <i>failed</i> to arrive. So using the term &quot;without anti-vaccination beliefs&quot; is fair in this case, since I will argue the only reason why you&#x27;d reject a vaccine that is recommended by a physician is an irrational belief not grounded in evidence')
