Item(by='derekp7', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608591677, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25500282, text='&quot;Lead Developer&quot; is just as accurate to put on your resume, no reason to put the exact technology in the title (job titles are often internal to companies anyway -- at one place my title was Senior Associate).<p>For every time you were given additional responsibilities, list that as a separate section.
