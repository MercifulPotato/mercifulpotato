I did give an example of how the EF is spending their money on development of the ecosystem though, hoping that&#x27;d make it clear what I meant. I even chose a grant to a wallet as the example.<p>I personally prefer the role of the EF as a facilitator more than monolithic employer. And they can (and do) do facilitate in more ways than just handing out grants. It&#x27;s just they experience has shown that helping out this way for wallet development (or even more generically software development) works better.<p>To add, they did start out providing the software as you say. After a certain point though, their efforts were outpaced by community effort or business opportunities arising in the Ethereum ecosystem. At this point it took a while for them to figure out what new role to take on with their (&quot;our&quot;) funds, eventually settling on what they&#x27;re doing now.')
