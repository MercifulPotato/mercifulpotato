That means that you can&#x27;t just give me a fake Twitter page and then forward the creds&#x2F;token, it won&#x27;t be valid.<p>U2F mitigates this entire class of phishing attack.<p>Beyond that, we also only allow logins to sensitive services from employee laptops, validated by a TPM, and multiple other controls, but that&#x27;s not really the point.<p>&gt; Or &#x27;I&#x27;m on vacation and left my laptop, could you just run this command on the prod cluster for me so we can avoid downtime over the holidays?&#x27;<p>Right, so <i>this</i> would work, but it&#x27;s a huge gap between &quot;Hey run this command for me&quot; and the attacker being able to run arbitrary commands. It&#x27;s a reasonable thing for your security team to consider and attempt to mitigate in other ways.')
