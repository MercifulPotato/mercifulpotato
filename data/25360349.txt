It is much easier to find correlations as these are just properties of the data.&quot;<p>So I&#x27;m saying that correlation is often used (and misused) in an attempt to find good candidates for causation. This is how much science and engineering is practiced. If you disagree with this, you disagree with some fundamentals of how the scientific method is used (ie, hypothesis forming).<p>&gt; To me correlation is more a way to reinforce a hypothesis of causality that is already suspected<p>It certainly <i>can</i> be used in this way, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s the only scientifically-valid way to use it.')
