So the incidence of 0.00002% is somewhat informative.<p>Individual fraud, sure. But treating 0.00002% as some sort of tolerance on the election results strikes me as likely bullshit. That is nearly 7 9s levels of precision. The electoral system is fault tolerant, but it is not 7-9s accurate. Boxes of ballots will go missing, and it seems very likely that there are polling places out in the countryside that are compromised for whatever reason. There is going to be background error and it just isn&#x27;t being detected because of lax standards.<p>Furthermore an argument that boils down to &quot;we don&#x27;t need to secure this system because we aren&#x27;t detecting any breaches&quot; is farcical. That raises the same alarm bells as a company deriding GAAP standards and accounting because they are old and boring.<p>But in context of this election, Biden won the popular vote by &gt;4 million votes and it appears the overrides built in via the electoral college didn&#x27;t trigger. To get that overturned there would need to be very, very real evidence of systemic mass fraud.')
