Absolute free speech isn&#x27;t a problem in isolation by any means; but there are impacts to the ability of that to grow into self-reinforcing belief that doesn&#x27;t match reality. One appears harmless, like a single alpha particle; but the other is an impact akin to an alpha particle chain reaction, or nuclear explosion. Similar impact on society, I would argue.<p>Could we conceive of a way not to control speech, but to inform or educate or provide information in context--or do <i>something,</i> anything so that it doesn&#x27;t have the power to self-reinforce and create psychological weapons of mass destruction? What if it&#x27;s the design of our current social networks around instant engagement and addictive content that&#x27;s the root of the problem? Could we change the nature and design of that platform without restricting the speech on it whatsoever?<p>I have to believe it&#x27;s possible. I&#x27;m under no illusion that I know the answer, or that the answer is even something that we have a name for yet. This is not contradictory or incoherent, it&#x27;s just yet unknown.')
