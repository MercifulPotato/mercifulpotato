Item(by='zwaps', descendants=None, kids=[25842955], score=None, time=1611099131, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25835912, text='&gt; The elites of those countries benefit way more from the influx of euros, some breadcrumbs are given to the people and then everyone stays under the illusion they are better off. The central bank keeps pushing money, Brussels and Berlin get happy about it until some external crisis show that the periphery countries never actually changed their ways and now are even more fragile to external shocks and even more dependent on the EU.<p>Are you saying these countries would be better off outside of the EU? Like, say, Turkey?\nNot sure I get your point.<p>&gt; Sorry for the stereotyping, but this is such a German comment and so short-sighted that if I get into a long response to it my blood will boil a little. Instead, let me refer you to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nntaleb.medium.com&#x2F;lebanon-from-ponzi-to-antifragili" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nntaleb.medium.com&#x2F;lebanon-from-ponzi-to-antifragili</a>... who maybe can get the point across better than me.<p>Not sure if I am going to read a whole article about Lebanon from Taleb, but I take you&#x27;d prefer a Grexit early on instead of the drudgery that is occurring now?<p>You know, at the time this was often discussed. The honest truth is that no one really knows, but everyone is convinced they are right.<p>It&#x27;s really where two understandings of reality met.<p>On the one hand, you had people who believe (like you I&#x27;d take it) that economic systems can use reform and a collapsing exchange rate &#x2F; exports to improve their lot with separation from the Euro.<p>On the other hand, you had people saying that this would, at best, eliminate decades of economic growth, and at worst, lead to explicable suffering and a mass exodus. All the while cementing the country in a low-income periphery position by virtue of being dominated by the EU central bank actions.<p>People who actually remember the pre Euro times will remember this situation from countries dependent on the Deutsche Mark, and will also remember that the Euro was - for that reason - France&#x27;s condition to allow German reunification.<p>I guess I never resolved in which camp I fall.\nOn the one hand, no non-EU peripheral country really fills me with confidence that this is a good position. On the other hand, perhaps Brexit will eventually show that such a niche can be found.')
