The point of multiple chains is to test for convergence. If you start four chains at four random points in probability space and they all converge to same  distribution, you can be confident in the result, but many times that fails to occur. This is what the rhat diagnostic shows. If you calculate rhat with one big chain it will mislead you. This is terrible advice.')
