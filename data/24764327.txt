Colors and viewing angles are way better than the 120hz TN monitor i had in the past.<p>That said, even at 240hz, motion is still blurry. If i move a window and try to read text in it in motion it&#x27;s still not smooth like real life.<p>I wish i could experience a Trinitron CRT to compare the motion resolution! On Digital Foundry they make it sounds as you do: amazing. I wish i could judge for myself')
