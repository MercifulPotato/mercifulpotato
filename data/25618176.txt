Wind power is great, I suppose (the jury is still out on the sustainability of the hardware - but it&#x27;s not looking great at the moment - massive amounts of concrete needed causing kinda huge co2 emissions during the chemical manufacturing processes), but it&#x27;s no good as a baseline power for days when there&#x27;s no wind and the hydro power is running on low. The fallback for that scenario is burning coal or oil.')
