Sometimes the business is willing to pay:  something related to money or legal compliance, the serious stuff.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s cheaper to have things work, say, 90% of time, and maybe manually fix some stuff when badly needed, on a best-effort basis. Often it&#x27;s the only viable way. Usually, if there&#x27;s no written contract, best-effort is the only treatment you can expect.
