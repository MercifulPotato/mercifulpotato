And up to 255 devices can share the same twisted pair.<p>As you can read in Video Camera Control Jack just used two arduinos, 2km of wiring within his university&#x27;s network and a couple of pull-down resistors. The protocol works even when the human body is used as a conductor as shows the gif present in the article.<p>On social compare someone made this:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;socialcompare.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;comparison&#x2F;comparison-of-network-buses" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;socialcompare.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;comparison&#x2F;comparison-of-networ...</a><p>I think the comparison between PJON and LIN there is revealing. As you can see LIN handles up to 16 devices, it is master-slave and has a range of 40, with a complex front-end at a relatively high voltage.<p>PJON is free for use, it is all open-source. We do sell products to fund the development of the project.')
