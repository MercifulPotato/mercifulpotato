As far as I could tell, there was nothing sent to the new account (so e.g. they aren&#x27;t just checking for a bounce from a test email)<p>How can this work? This basically allows for user existence enumeration, which I would expect Google might frown upon. Reckon they are abusing some Google API in some way? (e.g. I&#x27;m having fuzzy thoughts about calendar invites, doc sharing, etc.)  I am working under the assumption that they have special-cased detection for Google accounts; I haven&#x27;t checked other email providers. Obviously their service could not possibly work in the general case.')
