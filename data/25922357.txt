It&#x27;s not hard to find a list of the most shorted stocks currently, and think that you can buy them &quot;earlier&quot; than GME. By Monday, several were already way up, although not as extreme.<p>I think the real world meaning of this, is that people shorted stocks that were perhaps in temporary distress, but many if not all of them could be saved if they got a lot of cash, which they can do, if they suddenly can sell stock at an inflated price. The short theses <i>could have</i> been self-fulfilling, but now things are going the other way. It&#x27;s not really a violation of objective facts if the market decides to give these companies more capital. Who&#x27;s to say they shouldn&#x27;t get it? Especially with all the money showered on IPOs lately?<p>I used to think short selling was honorable, misunderstood, etc. but if it really is a self-fulfilling thing, maybe it isn&#x27;t a social good, especially when the viability of a company is affected by the temporary situation with covid.<p>Maybe GME and similar should get a year&#x27;s lifeline, for the good of all their stakeholders, because a lot could and almost certainly will change.')
