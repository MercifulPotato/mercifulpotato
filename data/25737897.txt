It’s improving a market making strategy or taking offers that look like they will now be profitable.<p>&gt; And when people quite rightly observe that having a speed advantage over other traders obviously allows extractive behavior like frontrunning<p>HFTs do not front run for fucks sake. It’s illegal and this meme needs to die. Front running is literally putting your order in front of a client’s order.<p>Being the fastest to realize the bottom is falling out of the s&amp;p500 and selling the futures contracts on open bids is not front running.')
