We still have to walk along the same streets, send our children to the same schools, and spend afternoons in the same parks.<p>No we don&#x27;t. Kids are driven everywhere, meaning that there is a (locked) door between them and The Others, the richer the neighborhood the richer the schools and the less you have to put them together with poor kids.<p>With distance learning you don&#x27;t even have to worry about the other kids in the class, or the commute.')
