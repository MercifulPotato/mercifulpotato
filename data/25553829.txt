It has obvious benefits, and the only thing you have to figure out is to sacrifice some unknown other activity.<p>I wonder why &quot;Less than 5% of adults participate in 30 minutes of physical activity each day; only one in three adults receive the recommended amount of physical activity each week.&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hhs.gov&#x2F;fitness&#x2F;resource-center&#x2F;facts-and-statistics&#x2F;index.html#:~:text=Less%20than%205%25%20of%20adults,of%20physical%20activity%20each%20week.&amp;text=Only%2035%20%E2%80%93%2044%25%20of%20adults,65%2D74%20are%20physically%20active" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hhs.gov&#x2F;fitness&#x2F;resource-center&#x2F;facts-and-statis...</a>.) happens?<p>The answer is that there are so many other things that can stand between &quot;desire drives you&quot; and reality. Just to give you several examples: financial needs, physical or mental health issues, other priorities (kids, family, friendship, etc).<p>BTW. I am not saying that change is impossible.

Sacrificing (or even chipping away) from them is way harder than when you are a blank slate.')
