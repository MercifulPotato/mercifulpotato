Clickbait many times doesn&#x27;t even summarize the content. It&#x27;s just sensational and enticing nonsense.<p>I specifically said to focus on the points of interest of the target audience, just the people that would be interested in the story. Doing otherwise wouldn&#x27;t make for a good summary, which is what a title ultimately is.<p>As an aside,<p>&gt; So you wrote 3 paragraphs...<p>that type of language is really dismissive and rude. I wish you wouldn&#x27;t use it.')
