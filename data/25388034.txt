Item(by='segfaultbuserr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607706696, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25387913, text='Thanks for the comment, it&#x27;s a great suggestion. The Intel documentation is really comprehensive (too bad that it didn&#x27;t exist back when I was still using the tablet).<p>Yes, I knew s0ix. Unfortunately, the last time I&#x27;ve checked, s0ix had its own problems. Since then, I&#x27;ve given up and switched to a Thinkpad with coreboot. I just rechecked, it seems the s0ix bug is already resolved by a combination of BIOS update and a kernel parameter workaround, so suspend should finally be usable by now, hooray! Despite I&#x27;m not using it anymore, I&#x27;d still call it progress.')
