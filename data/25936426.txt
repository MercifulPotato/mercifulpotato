Emacs for example has a lot of effort put into supporting various different terminals and efficiently displaying text. Some xterm-specific support is for many colours, mouse support, and the control codes to ask xterm to send more precise key escape sequences so TAB and C-i aren’t confused for example. It also has a gui which doesn’t need to pile on layers of hacks and works great so long as you don’t need to go through a terminal (eg running over ssh.) And yet it is still straddled with backwards compatibility from those days (some users expect TAB and C-i to do the same thing.)<p>To me it feels silly to put a lot of effort into supporting things better in terminal emulators because they are not as flexible as actual user interfaces and I think the main reasons we still have them are historical.<p>Aside: I’d also like to see a command line shell which runs outside the terminal emulator rather than inside it.')
