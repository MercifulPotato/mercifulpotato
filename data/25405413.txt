That includes to some extent the US police as well. The notion that US police just go around slinging guns around like some gun toting cowboys (while it does happen) is propaganda.<p>The police in the UK can be just as corrupt and inept. However there is a need for armed police in the UK. Just go to live leak or any of the clip sites and you can find all the videos where there are 10 officers trying to take down one maniac with a machete on a council estate with harsh language and pepper spray.')
