No side file tree, though helm find files has a sweet UI I use hundreds of times a day. Magit is there in three key strokes and out when I&#x27;m done giting. My window navigation is sweet. Sometimes I have zero splits, sometimes I have a dozen, and it&#x27;s easy to navigate between each split, resize them, undo split modifications etc. My flycheck shows me errors in a great UI when I need it and doesn&#x27;t show when I don&#x27;t. Same with helm-imenu that that shows me classes, functions, methods and attributes when I need them and only then.<p>I&#x27;m sure you can do that with all the editors, but when I see peeps using VScode or myself using Xcode, everytime  close to 50% of the workspace is filled by stuff I only need temporarily.<p>Emacs let&#x27;s me see code most of the time, yet has all the classical IDE features one could dream of. &lt;3')
