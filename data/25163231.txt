But he was not aware of changes somebody else did in BOM file by hand.<p>* PCB assembly was performed by hand for prototype and contained an incorrectly placed part, but the assembled PCB ended up being shipped because of complete lack of production planning, somebody in sales selling stuff before it&#x27;s ready and this being the only option to avoid contract cancellation.<p>I have personally witnessed every one of these and then some.<p>Yes, product engineering sometimes really is that shoddy and people being people  stupid things.')
