Item(by='RHSeeger', descendants=None, kids=[24702401], score=None, time=1602016314, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24701602, text='&gt; insulin hasn&#x27;t changed in 50 years<p>That is false. The insulins sold today are MUCH better than the ones sold 50 years ago. They&#x27;re much better than the ones sold 25 years ago. Admittedly, the ones sold 25 years ago are effective, but it is much more convenient using an insulin that kicks in in 15-20 minutes and has a relatively short peak than one that kicks in in 30-60 minutes and has a long peak. It&#x27;s doable either way, but the quality of life is much different.')
