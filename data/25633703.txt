It was pretty easy to avoid just by having a separate water towers or pumps for your farms and city and make sure you didn&#x27;t connect the two systems.<p>The Network Addon Mod (NAM) addressed most of the transportation issues I have with SC4. I remember having a mod that had road&#x2F;bus and road&#x2F;subway combo stations but I&#x27;m not sure if it was part of NAM or not.<p>Mixed use zoning would be amazing, absolutely. Without it, it makes designing Main St and walkable cities nearly impossible. This kind of medium density zoning is something that SimCity has always been bad at. Somehow I think Cities Skylines is even worse at it.')
