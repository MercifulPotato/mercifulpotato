I started to notice (increasingly!) my inability to recall trivial things; for example, the action points from a Zoom call, or a quote from a book that I had read a couple of months ago. Surely this canâ€™t be normal?&quot;<p>Except it&#x27;s fairly normal under stress for people&#x27;s memory to function more poorly and since we&#x27;re experiencing a Global pandemic that has completely up ended our normal mode of living I would expect baseline stress for almost every one to be up considerably.<p>So that&#x27;s my hypothesis, which requires less assumptions than &quot;people are losing the ability to remember because of computers&quot; but doesn&#x27;t result in a blog post where I can talk about Anki or equivalents.')
