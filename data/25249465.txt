But every time I hear reference to this quote(except from overt trump supporters, who have their own issues interpreting events ), it is characterized as trump saying that all Mexicans are rapists. Literally every time I&#x27;ve ever heard it referenced, even from mainstream news articles.<p>How does one do distributed fact checking if there is a mass public delusion? At best, distributed fact checking can give you th concensus of fact checkers, which is not always the truth.')
