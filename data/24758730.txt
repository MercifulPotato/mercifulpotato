The office has invaded your home, so it&#x27;s like you are now sleeping at office.<p>Other concerns- such as not having downtime between meetings, or a commute to transition between work and home- are real problems. He actually states that the solution is to build time in to your day to regain downtime.<p>I didn&#x27;t get the feeling he is down on remote work at all, but pretty balanced.
