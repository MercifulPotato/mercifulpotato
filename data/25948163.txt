While he doesn&#x27;t speak quite that densely, the voice and technique remains pretty similar (and as much as I&#x27;m a fan, I must admit that his elocution isn&#x27;t particularly compelling, although perhaps I&#x27;m biased by the poor quality of many recordings).<p>I would humbly advocate pushing through regardless, as I found the material to be profound; I&#x27;d also suggest &quot;Synergetics&quot; [0], which employs a similar style, but is much more STEM-oriented than the &quot;Spaceship Earth&quot; quasi-narrative. But having said that, I don&#x27;t blame anyone who finds the style too tedious; I have a similar experience every time I try to read 18th&#x2F;19th-century political economy (Smith + Marx).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brainpickings.org&#x2F;2013&#x2F;03&#x2F;08&#x2F;buckminster-fuller-synergetics&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brainpickings.org&#x2F;2013&#x2F;03&#x2F;08&#x2F;buckminster-fuller-...</a>')
