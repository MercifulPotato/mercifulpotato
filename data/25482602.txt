I should add the total cost to the post. I mentioned I use the cheapest Linode server but didn&#x27;t actually say how much that is. I pay $5&#x2F;month (USD) for the server (except I got the first two months for free from some promo code I found on another blog), and $10&#x2F;year (CAD) for carbon offsets. I also paid $5&#x2F;year (USD) for the domain name I use.')
