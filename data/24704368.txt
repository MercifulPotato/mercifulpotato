DO App Platform makes the file page1&#x2F;index.html available both at &#x2F;page1 and at &#x2F;page1&#x2F;.  If the page contains any relative links or images, it is impossible for both URLs to reference these links correctly.  Most web servers handle this by redirecting &#x2F;page1 to &#x2F;page1&#x2F; before serving it.  Netlify does this as well.  Vercel works the same as DO in its default mode, but it allows the user to configure the trailing slash behavior to get the redirect.  Hugo, for one, assumes all files are served with a trailing slash.')
