Wondering exactly how far apple can push it, if this is what they can do in essentially a ~20TDP design.<p>On the other hand it&#x27;s quite funny that the title of this article is  &quot;16-inch MBP with i9 2x slower than M1 MacBook Air in a real world Rust compile&quot; and the comments are still saying &quot;yeah but this is entry level not pro&quot;.<p>Apparently Pros are more concerned about slotting into the right market segment than getting their work done quickly :)')
