What&#x27;s the point in retaining engineers if you&#x27;re just going to pay them to work on something without expected ROI?<p>(Short) story time!<p>Windows on ARM was a solo pet project of a high level engineer at Microsoft!<p>There are some engineers who are so valuable that letting them spend non-trivial amounts of time on whatever they want is a <i>very</i> good use of company resources.<p>Sometimes just not letting the competition have them is valuable!<p>I&#x27;ve worked with a few 10x-20x engineers, if someone is that productive, they can spend 2 years off on another non-ROI project, come back, and spend 2 years on a project with ROI, and the company still comes out ahead.<p>Most company&#x27;s aren&#x27;t smart enough to figure this out, then again determining who these people are is also a problem. That latter part is funny (ironic?), because on the ground floor everyone who encounters a world class engineer is pretty darn sure of it.')
