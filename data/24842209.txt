We then have a mechanism to throw an exception and signal it to the CPU to display it there. That&#x27;s obviously quite expensive, so you can disable it with that annotation (the Julia debug setting also controls the granularity, and thus how expensive the exception handling is). It&#x27;s fairly primitive, i.e. no full-featured exception handling (for now), but has proven very useful already.')
