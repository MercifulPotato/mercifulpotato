I, as a freelancer, am required to ask for a VAT tax but my clients can balance out the VAT tax for the services they buy from me with the VAT they ask from their clients.<p>Personal labour in the sense of employment is exempt from VAT tax if the person is employed but then other forms of taxes, like the income tax apply.<p>The amount of tax as well as the form in which they are collected vary from country to country.<p>My personal opinion is that the tax system is actually quite clear and progressive, at least for me as a freelancer.
