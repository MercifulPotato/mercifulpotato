If someone uses &quot;being called asshole&quot; as a reason to not even inform anyone, they would have found another excuse. Some people simply register it as strong language and otherwise focus on the content. At any rate, it&#x27;s very easy to judge what someone says in frustration when you yourself don&#x27;t even suffer from the situation and&#x2F;or don&#x27;t care about those who do.<p>&gt; But it&#x27;s not like everyone tries to annoy other, it&#x27;s more an issue of ignorance.<p>So she shed light on that, and instead of talking about the important bit, people think it&#x27;s super important to teach a random person to not be rude, ever?
