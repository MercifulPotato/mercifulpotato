I might even skim read the book.<p>Sounds like a more rigorous version of Alistair Cockburn&#x27;s post mortem on the non success of CASE tools. Forget the title, but the punch line is: Methodology, processes, and tooling are moot. Talented people are somehow able to make any given system work. He uses phrasing like &quot;people are the first order determinant for success&quot;.<p>The book I want to read compares the folk theories and fads of software development with other democratized fields. Like education reform. How noobs, wannabes, rejects, and grifters fight over cheddar, slak, and fame. Where any consideration of form, fit, function, and ROI is ruthlessly punished and expunged.<p>Said another way, the only consistent thread in my career is an ever increasing number of people, who are constitutionally incapable of ever shipping product, telling me with complete certainty how I should ship product.')
