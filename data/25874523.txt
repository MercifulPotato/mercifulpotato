Item(by='kitsunesoba', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611340249, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25872619, text='Kaleidoscope is by far the best implementation of system theming I&#x27;ve used. A single file was responsible for the appearance of window chrome, window controls, control and text colors, fonts, desktop icons, cursor, text selection color, etc.<p>Furthermore, the schemes were free to rearrange and reshape window chrome as the artist pleased, meaning it was possible to do things like have a titlebar on the <i>bottom</i> of the window or to make the titlebar into a vertical tab that hung off the left or right edges of the window. Heck, it was even possible to make windows take on odd, non-square shapes. The results weren&#x27;t always practical, but it was a great enabler of creativity, and made for probably the most true-to-the original OS themes on any platform.<p>The only thing that even comes close is probably WinXP&#x2F;Win7 msstyles, but even those have significant limitations compared to Kaleidoscope. Some arrangements of Linux desktops come close from a technical perspective, but suffer from the customizability being divided into 500 small pieces, making it a bit arduous to get everything to match up.<p>EDIT: One other thing â€” Kaleidoscope had something unique that I have yet to see replicated elsewhere: <i>there was no installation process for schemes</i>. You could keep your schemes wherever you pleased, and switching them was as simple as navigating to the desired scheme in Finder and double-clicking it. Boom, done. No obscure and&#x2F;or hidden directories to copy things to, no incantations to make them show up in a control panel. More things could use that classic Mac flavor of simplicity.')
