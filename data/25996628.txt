And all it took was playing on a friends PC with a 120hz display for half an hour. I think considering how great the push to &gt;120Hz has been in PC gaming, and that High-hertz are now being adopted in smartphones and tablets I’m not alone in this experience.<p>My point being here that a large part of why people choose to play competitive, reaction driven games, is <i>precisely because</i> they are competitive and <i>especially</i> because they are very fast paced. So fast paced that 8ms of output latency makes a significant difference to a large segment.')
