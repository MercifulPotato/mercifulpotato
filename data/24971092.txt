I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t check there. This website is so amazingly good, I keep referencing the interactive annual sunrise&#x2F;sunset charts at different locations, just didn&#x27;t think to check the world map. For some reason I feel like maybe the pastel colors and cartoony graphics make me frequently under-estimate how serious and thorough the charts and apps are here, but I am a big fan. Maybe time to donate.')
