Is it the fraction of work done or an indication of time left?<p>Progress bars don&#x27;t necessarily lie - they simply omit useful information. Estimating progress is hard if there&#x27;s variables involved that are outside the application&#x27;s control, e.g. network speed or task switches initiated by the OS.<p>Task-based progress bars suffer from being &quot;jumpy&quot; and terribly inconsistent, because some tasks take longer than others and the progress indication doesn&#x27;t allow to estimate the remaining the time.<p>Time-based progress bars are bad, because they are dynamic by nature of factors mentioned earlier, so ETA might suddenly jump from 1:23 min to 58:07 min or just as bad from 15 minutes to 3 seconds.<p>This is also the reason why &quot;this is how long it took for other users&quot; is not a great solution either: if your particular circumstances (network speed, server load, ...) are vastly different at the time, this would solve nothing and result in the same complaints.<p>Progress bars are just an estimation and a mixture of tasks left, ETA and a generic activity indicator (&quot;the app didn&#x27;t crash and still makes progress&quot;) might be more informative.<p>EDIT: for short tasks (e.g. 20 seconds or less), a simple progression of messages like &quot;working on it&quot;, &quot;just a moment&quot;, &quot;almost there&quot;, &quot;finished&quot; might be the best option.')
