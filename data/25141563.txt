If you think you are going to get 1k hosts just like that from AWS you will have an unpleasant experience.<p>I work at one of the decent size tech company and we are split between cloud and on prem. From our experience you have to inform AWS&#x2F;GCP in advance (sometime way early) if you are looking to meaningfully increase capacity in zone&#x2F;region.<p>Sure, auto scaling few hundreds of hosts may be possible but people who run a service which needs few hundreds of hosts run it directly on AWS, they will run it some kind of scheduler+resource manager which will have some kind of operational buffer anyway (as in you would already have those hosts so cloud elasticity is not a factor here).')
