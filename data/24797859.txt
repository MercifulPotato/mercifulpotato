When someone asks you a question they know the answer to, because you have answered it before, they’re not trying to enlighten themselves. They are accusing you of something. In the case of Trump, they’re accusing him of being a white supremacist. In fact, Chris Wallace asked Trump the exact same question during the 2016 election debate, and he condemned white supremacy in no uncertain terms.<p>A diplomatic person would break out the canned condemnation for the 50th time.
