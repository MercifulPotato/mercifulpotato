Given human history, and every other undeveloped country, this is working.<p>Sure, and in the context of any single country it might not be working. Is a train running at 3mph &quot;working&quot; because there were no trains on earth during all those years of human history before the invention of trains? I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a useful definition of &quot;working&quot;.<p>I do absolutely agree that advanced societies are miraculous, though I wouldn&#x27;t call them functioning smoothly (there&#x27;s <i>a lot</i> of overhead). Still, there&#x27;s plenty of things that aren&#x27;t working at all or aren&#x27;t working as well as they should (a thousand dollar burger should taste crazy delicious), and government (or more general: a large bureaucracy, of which government is the largest) is often involved.')
