You were completely right to call out my initial post, it was poorly worded.<p>Much as you said, regardless of the issue, we can often agree on what&#x27;s right or wrong from a moral standpoint, but still it&#x27;s intrinsically hard to view the core issue being fought for in the same light as we view the other side.<p>Generally speaking, I don&#x27;t believe folks on the left want an unfair election system, nor that folks on the right want violent or discriminatory policing, but we each start with an assumption of which problem is more pressing, and from there it becomes easy to make several leaps of judgement.<p>Conveying nuance is hard... not just on mobile :) but across the board.<p>What I&#x27;m struggling the most to sort out here, is how I can feel that we all as a nation still generally want the same things on paper, and yet it can feel so much like we have nothing in common at all. Somehow, there&#x27;s a large gap to be bridged there.')
