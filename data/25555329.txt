They admit other NPCs engage with extreme body modification that falls in line with the core Cyberpunk genre, but still argue that not being able to customise your own player-character&#x27;s hair style means CDPR have failed to understand the genre.<p>IMO, technical limitations of the game engine don&#x27;t invalidate the worldbuilding and concepts they&#x27;ve very clearly intentionally baked into the game.<p>And regarding the author&#x27;s implication that CDPR suggests the &#x27;meat-body&#x27; is sacred which is at odds with Cyberpunk genre, using the &#x27;Cyberpsychosis&#x27; illness as an example (being caused by people replacing too much of their meat-body with electronics), the actual storyline around this in-game illness is at complete odds with the author&#x27;s point (which I won&#x27;t spoil).')
