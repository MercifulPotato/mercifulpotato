It is only really useful for testing if there are differences, and in general a tube amp and a digital sim are not going to sound the same as each other. What I’ve seen as more common is that you’ll have someone playing blind through a selection of digital models and tube amps. If you’re lucky, the digital models and tube amps may be closely matched, but that’s not necessarily the only way you would want to run a test.<p>There are also an incredible number of different scenarios that need to be taken into account in a simulation, so you’d want to try different styles of amp. Various overdrive scenarios are harder to simulate, broadly speaking.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=k6AwTp4ZUm0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=k6AwTp4ZUm0</a><p>Note in this video, the speakers are being simulated for the tube amps. So it’s a bit of an unusual comparison, it’s just something I found.')
