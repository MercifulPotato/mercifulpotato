GraphQL just a message spec (like dare I say, SOAP). But if you use it with BFF then the value of the dynamic query aspects seems less valuable. With a BFF your App&#x2F;UI and endpoints can be tightly coupled. If a specific page&#x2F;component&#x2F;action needs data structured in a specific way then you just make the endpoint do <i>exactly</i> that. You can accomplish this over GraphQL but it seems like an unnecessary extra layer at that point.')
