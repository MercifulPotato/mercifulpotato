Item(by='thaumasiotes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608668313, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25509883, text='&gt; As can be seen, it’s true that Pelosi did utter these words: “We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it”. However, the article left out important context, including the next few words of Pelosi’s statement: “We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it, <i>away from the fog of the controversy</i>.”<p>This looks like a case of Snopes trying to make Nancy Pelosi look good without justification. Their &quot;important context&quot; doesn&#x27;t actually improve anything.')
