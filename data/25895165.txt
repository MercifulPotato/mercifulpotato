I’ve been a Mac user ever since I bought my Powerbook G4. I’ve owned pretty much every Mac model except for a MBP and a Mini and only had one lemon which was my Mac Pro trashcan. After that experience, where Apple refused to replace the model and denied the problems I was having, I’m somewhat embittered.<p>I’ve seen some inspiring stuff on r&#x2F;unixporn but I feel if switch to linux I’ll miss all my favorite apps. But on the other hand I’ve heard some surprise stories with the M1 which may or may not be resolved, like Docker not working.<p>Overall, I’m ambivalent and ignorant about what to buy as a developer and could use some advice; my price range is around $1200. Feel free to recommend a laptop that exceeded your expectations or to just to offer some guidance. Thanks!')
