Compare it to the System 4pi, or the value-based avionics of the Soviets. There were lots of other approaches, and this one was more sophisticated and yet less expensive.  It’s a great achievement!<p>However, it is not, in any way, a story about a microprocessor.<p>The only interesting thing about the Intel 4004 is that it fit general purpose computing into <i>a single chip package</i>.  Many people and companies did interesting things long before the 4004 with a relatively small number of components, but that number was not <i>one</i>.<p>The simple <i>existence</i> of a chip like the 4004, as a commercial product, altered an entire industry, globally. It gave rise to the Intel 8000 series, the Motorola 6800 series, and hundreds of clones.<p>Ultimately, the revolution kicked off by the microprocessor gave us microcomputers, the rise of CMOS, and, essentially, the end of all other architectures for computing.<p>This story is super cool but some editor fucked up real bad with the headline.  This wonderful early application of VLSI and software in avionics is amazing, but it isn’t connected to the story of the “microprocessor,” as a thing.<p>P.S. even if you accept the premise that an ALU on a chip is a cool advance, it didn’t go anywhere! No one could buy the damn chip.  Nothing ever came of it outside avionics contractors.')
