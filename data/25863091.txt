Even if we had started producing vaccine en-masse in March, it would still take many more months (several years) to inoculate everyone on the planet.  These novel strains would still have arisen within that time frame.<p>We would also have introduced additional problems that undertested therapies often suffer from and that the Chinese vaccine appears to have -- low efficacy.  If quickly approved vaccines were no more than 50% efficacious on large fraction of the planet&#x27;s peoples, herd immunity would take longer to accumulate and novel strains would still emerge.<p>Of course, toxicity is another likelier outcome from undertesting a new vaccine.  Others can assess that risk better than I.  In short, when it comes to combating pestilence, there&#x27;s no free lunch.')
