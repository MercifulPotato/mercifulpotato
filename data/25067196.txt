I work for a Fortune 100 company on a product that is very low on the totem pole. I&#x27;ve been working on it for nearly 20 years. The work is very stress free and they pay me way way more than I  need, especially considering the cost of living where I live. I&#x27;d happily stay here until retirement. Getting promoted would suck.')
