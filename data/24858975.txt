To me what makes a configuration format good is the simplicity of <i>reading</i> the configuration of a program, and almost all of these languages are optimizing for feature complexity over readability. I think that all of the popular config formats (yaml, json, toml, etc) have issues, but none of the major issues with them have to do with being unable to represent a fibonacci sequence in their language.<p>To draw a direct comparison, when I look at the examples in the github repository, all I can think is &quot;I would never want to have this be a source of truth in my codebase&quot;. While I get frustrated w&#x2F; whitespace in yaml and the difficulty of reading complex json configuration, if I need a way to programmatically load complex data I would almost always rather use those two as a base and write a &#x27;config-loader&#x27; in the language that I am <i></i>already<i></i> using for my project (instead of introducing another syntax into the mix)')
