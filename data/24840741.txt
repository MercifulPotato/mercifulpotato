Item(by='zmk_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603218391, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24823336, text='They have not decided whether e-krona would be a &#x27;account-based&#x27; (like you say) and a competing&#x2F;backup payment system. Or a &#x27;value-based&#x27; where it&#x27;s &#x27;stored on a card&#x27;. At the same time they do not want to impact lending facilities of banks so if they go with the first option they will most likely deemphasize it considerably to keep deposits in traditional banks. The 2nd option seems to me like a total fail, similar to what Chipknip was in the Netherlands. The main motivation for the ekrona seems to be the move away from cash, but Sweden has been cashless for a long time now (between Swish and cards).')
