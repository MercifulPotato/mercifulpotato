Elasticsearch and Kibana will be dual licensed under the Elastic License or the SSPL license, not <i>only</i> SSPL. The distributions that we provide will be licensed under the Elastic License, which does not have the copyleft requirements that are sometimes concerning to legal teams.<p>That is, if you download our distribution and run it in your infrastructure, you are subject to the Elastic License. The same license that most (90%+) of our users are already running under today, when they download our default distribution from elastic.co. This is why we say the vast majority of our users are not impacted by this change.<p>Note: we are considering making changes to the Elastic License to simplify it. Please see more on our [blog][0].<p>Disclaimer: I am on the Elasticsearch team and work for Elastic; I welcome any and all feedback.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elastic.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;license-change-clarification" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elastic.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;license-change-clarification</a>')
