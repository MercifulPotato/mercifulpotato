And they always do. So you end up running at 1&#x2F;10th of the speed your tool could move at to avoid that, and even then you&#x27;ll end up tossing workpieces because you lost synchronization somewhere along the line.<p>My experience has been roughly opposite of this. If you overload your motors, you&#x27;re going to lose positional accuracy and probably wreck your workpiece regardless of whether you use steppers or servos. If you don&#x27;t overload your motors then the difference is moot, and with steppers there&#x27;s less to go wrong.')
