As a reference point, you might compare to the 100m sprint [1], where the correlation is something like 0.9. If you believe that a timed run is a reliable way to determine speed, you should strongly believe an IQ test is a reliable way to determine mental ability.<p>&gt; I said significant impairment<p>This is basically a statement about statistical power: you claim IQ is subject to large measurement error, so given typical sample sizes, we&#x27;re not able to detect anything but the largest effects. But no part of this is true.<p>1. Good IQ proxies are reliable, i.e. they give consistent answers for a given individual.<p>2. Good IQ proxies are usually measurement-invariant (certainly for US samples), i.e. they measure the same thing for different groups [2]<p>3. Sample sizes are massive (the entire pool of SAT takers, AFQT takers, NLSY participants, etc).<p>&gt; in which contexts do you think IQ suffers from denialism?<p>Basically all of them! You yourself just denied its validity in all but a handful of narrow situations.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0960896616309798" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S09608...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tandfonline.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1080&#x2F;13854046.2016.1205136" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tandfonline.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1080&#x2F;13854046.2016.1...</a>')
