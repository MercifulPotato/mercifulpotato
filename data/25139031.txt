In today&#x27;s society, being isolated from social media is a &quot;weirdness point&quot; (whether we like it or not) and it&#x27;s up to each individual to determine whether it is worth for them to take the hit.<p>I have withdrawn from social media as an adult because I am at a stage in life where I don&#x27;t have to prove anything to anyone, don&#x27;t have to be &quot;cool&quot; kid and have other ways to play the &quot;status game&quot;. However for a typical teenager social media popularity and the &quot;cool&quot; factor is probably their biggest assets when it comes to status and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to be putting them at a disadvantage by denying them access to it.')
