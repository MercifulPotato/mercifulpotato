Fake reviews deteriorate customer trust and drive customers away in the long run.<p>The problem is there are two parties who have large incentives to create fake reviews: 1) Merchants 2) Executives whose compensation is tied to short-term results .<p>Right now these two parties with adverse incentives seem to be winning the battle, but it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if this changed in the near future.<p>Yelp&#x27;s battle against fake reviews and Google&#x27;s battle against SEO spam both come to mind as examples where the company was largely able to get things under control and aligned with their best interests.  There will always be an escalating cat and mouse game between the &quot;company&#x27;s police&quot; and the &quot;fakers&quot;, but Yelp and Google seem to stay one step ahead while Amazon is one step behind.')
