Apple knows very well that all the top tier games and graphics applications are going to be cross-platform. That&#x27;s just a fact. They really can&#x27;t afford to put significant road blocks in the way of getting those games and apps on to their platforms. That would be a massive foot gun.<p>Also you can&#x27;t with a straight face say on the one hand Metal makes is much easier to run an app or game across all Apple&#x27;s platforms, and on the other argue it imposes an excessive cost on porting apps to their platforms.<p>If I&#x27;m developing a top tier game and want to port it to MacOS and iOS, does Metal make it harder because it&#x27;s different from the system on other platforms, which in reality were different enough in the OpenGL ES days anyway, or does it make it easier because I get access to all Apple&#x27;s platforms in one go? It might make it harder in some very specific cases, but a lot easier in many others so it&#x27;s really a wash.')
