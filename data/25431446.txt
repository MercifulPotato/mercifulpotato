How does the advertiser know what the spot on the site is worth without traffic estimates?  See my response to chongli downthread: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25431138" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25431138</a><p><i>&gt; Is it fraud if a real user &quot;looks&quot; at the ad but actually looks away from their screen? If they mute the sound? If they don&#x27;t speak the language the ad is in?</i><p>None of these are fraud, because the ad is in front of a real user.<p>Fraud here doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;the ad doesn&#x27;t perform as well as the advertiser hoped for some reason&quot; it means &quot;the ad was not actually shown to real users on the site, contrary to the agreement between the publisher and the advertiser&quot;.')
