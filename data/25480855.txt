The MCAS system was an ugly hack and even the new solution is just an improved MCAS.<p>However the 737-MAX is Boeing’s answer to Airbus’ competitive threat in the biggest commercial airplane segment. Not approving the plane would leave this segment to Airbus and would cripple Boeing’s commercial airplane business as a whole.<p>The US considers this business strategic given past history of government incentives. Europe and other countries also consider this business strategic and likewise have provided massive government incentives.<p>This calculus alone almost forces the FAA to approve the plane for flying.<p>Furthermore, the 737-MAX not flying could bankrupt Boeing. All those hundreds of planes that they manufactured would be scrap. All the existing planes flown would become lawsuits.<p>But Boeing is a big defense contractor with a revolving door with the Defense Department. There is no way the US would let one of its biggest defense contractors go bankrupt. The gravy train for that military industrial complex would end.<p>That isn’t going to happen. Look at Biden’s nominees. They  are part of the revolving door between the military and defense contractors.<p>If we could peer through closed doors I bet we would see the US government pressuring other governments to approve the 737-MAX for flight. They also need to give approval for the plane to fly to their countries.')
