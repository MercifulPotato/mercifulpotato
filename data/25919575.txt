If you have any binary kernel modules that are not compatible, too bad. (For example, ZFS is still on 8.3).<p>Poppler is going to be rebased from from 0.66.0 to 20.11.0. If you have anything linked to it, it will break; you need new binaries linked against the new soname. There is a surprising number packages linked against it, and third-party ones too (e.g. GDAL, used by all geo apps out there).<p>Similar thing will happen with other rebased packages.<p>RHEL users will get that packaged in 8.4, with release notes. Stream users are getting these breakages randomly.')
