Even when running your program with only one thread, your OS will still schedule the 100s of threads that are running on your machine (from all applications you have open) onto the 8 cores on your machine. It constantly switches between these threads, and your Ruby thread won&#x27;t be put on the same core each time.<p>Furthermore, OSes spread load across cores on purpose to avoid unequal heating inside the processor. You can &#x27;pin&#x27; a process to a specific core but this is not recommended. (The advantage is maybe better caching, but the disadvantage is unequal heating.)')
