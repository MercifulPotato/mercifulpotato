That commercial baby food you mentioned seems to avoid salt entirely and make up for it with gobs of sugar.  Snacks for kids like <i>tamago boro</i> are little puffs of sugar and starch.<p>I&#x27;ll readily grant that the universal free school food is a huge improvement on the US swill, although this too has its share on unhealthy practices: mandating that <i>everything</i> served has to be eaten whether you&#x27;re hungry or not or you like it or not (kids are regularly told that <i>sukikirai</i>, liking&#x2F;hating foods, is not allowed), and the mandatory milk &amp; milk bun for that sugar kick.  At least whale meat has become too expensive to feature regularly anymore.')
