Aaronson is pointing out that removing the entrance exams will likely not achieve these goals, though it will remove any negative attention from the school.  I don&#x27;t think Aaronson is advocating that good schools should all have smaller white student populations, instead he is criticizing methods that don&#x27;t achieve their goals and have significant negative effects.')
