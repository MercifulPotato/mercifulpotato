It&#x27;s useful in places and the consequences aren&#x27;t too ridiculous in this case.<p>Following through figuring out the consequences of rule changes is a key thing mathematicians do.  E.g. do we need this rule?  What if this was weaker?  What if this was reversed?  What if we had this extra restriction?')
