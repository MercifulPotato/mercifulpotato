Goal is to have the program scrape through sub-reddit threads, detect stock tickers, and based on surrounding text, generate a sentiment rating. I would then compare these sentiment ratings to recent price&#x2F;stock volume shifts to see if I can identify potential momentum trades before they happen.<p>I am honestly not sure if there will be any correlation to stock price movements and sentiment ratings generated from my platform, but thought it was an interesting idea and intrigued to see if there are any trends.<p>I am also relatively new to programming, so if anyone in here finds this interesting and wants to help, would be more than happy to collaborate.')
