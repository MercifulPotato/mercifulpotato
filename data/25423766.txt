The workplace might be completely in the blue about this, but if a workplace uses a tool that offers convince in installing this tool to your personal devises (or off hour workstation usage):<p>a) Make it absolutely clear that this is not expected<p>b) Provide instructions for workers on how turn the tool off during non-work hours<p>c) Reprimand users that bother workers with this tool during non-work hours<p>Anything short of that is complacency in labor abuse.<p>The problem slack (and tools like it) offers is that there will be a point where installing and enabling it on personal devises or out side of work hours will be convenient, be it off site on a convention or when finishing up a tight deadline. After that time workers will probably not remove it from the devise (the power of defaults), and that opens up avenues for complacency in abuse. At no point does the workplace need to make a conscious choice of malice, however harm will happen if the tool is used without disclaimers.')
