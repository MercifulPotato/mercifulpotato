The eXo project has been using about 6 different branches of dosbox depending on the game for particular features.  Mostly they use the main branch but for some bits the game just does not work in all modes.  Now that PCem has VHD support I could see them ditching dosbox all together (unlikely).  But they will probably not use dosbox for 9x games due to size.')
