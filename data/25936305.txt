If you write `def foo(a, b)` inside a class, the lack of `self` should be sufficient to make `foo` a static method.<p>IMO it would make sense for Python to look at `a, b` and assume you wanted a static method with two parameters. Instead it assumes you&#x27;re using `a` instead of `self` and really wanted an instance method with one parameter.')
