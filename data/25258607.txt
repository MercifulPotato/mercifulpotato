Looks like they&#x27;re x16 and x32, as you said.<p>--------<p>Hmmm, I know that the M1 is specified as 128-bits on Anandtech&#x27;s site. If its 4-dies per chip, then 32-bits per die, 4-total dies of LPDDR4? I know Anandtech is claiming a 128-bit bus, so I&#x27;m reverse-engineering things from that tidbit of knowledge.<p>-----<p>Either way, these 128-bit or 64-bit numbers are all very much smaller than 1024-bit per stack HBM2 (high-bandwidth memory). Much, much, much much smaller. Its clear that the M1 isn&#x27;t using HBM at all, but some kind of LPDDR4x configuration.')
