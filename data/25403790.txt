A good essay is one that convinces you that what it&#x27;s saying is true, instead of just asserting it and relying on the reputation of the author.<p>If an essay doesn&#x27;t convince you directly, then:<p>a) the author just didn&#x27;t take the time to provide an explanation<p>b) the explanation is too complex, or too difficult to materialize, it&#x27;s something you just develop an intuition about<p>c) it can&#x27;t convince you directly because it&#x27;s not actually true<p>If you trust the author on the subject matter enough such that you&#x27;re in a&#x2F;b territory, then while I think an essay that explained more would be a better one, an essay that doesn&#x27;t is still valuable.<p>But I think at least one concern is that we&#x27;re actually in c territory. Especially with stuff like &quot;picking winning companies&quot;, I&#x27;m hesitant to take things at face-value. It&#x27;s such a complicated thing to predict, it&#x27;s easy to succumb to survivorship bias. I&#x27;m not convinced that PG is just <i>so</i> good at it that things should be taken at face-value.')
