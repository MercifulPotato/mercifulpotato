I tried to get what I thought were good quality appliances, and everything is still mostly working ok, but there have been teething problems with everything:<p>- Bosch Fridge Freeze - a couple of the shelves have broken and I have no idea where to get replacements.<p>- Bosch Fan Oven - sometimes cuts off if it is left on above 250c for more than 30 mins.<p>- Bosch Dishwasher - had to take it apart once to clean as some paper got stuck in the impeller.<p>- Bosch Condenser Dryer - no issues so far, other than not RTFM about the drain hose which needs to be elevated above the unit for some reason.<p>- Samsung Washing Machine - One day I came in and there was water all over the floor from the washing machine. Took it apart and I could see signs of leaking, but couldn&#x27;t see anything wrong, after that it worked fine. Recently it starting making a lot of noise on the spin cycle, turned out the feet needed leveling, now it&#x27;s good as new.<p>- Electrolux Induction Cooktop - There are some cosmetic issues (stains that won&#x27;t come off) on the glass.')
