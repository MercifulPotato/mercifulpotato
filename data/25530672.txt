Item(by='greggman3', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608838588, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25528791, text='I can give you my list as I&#x27;ve also been watching lots of &quot;old&quot; movies. Though &quot;old&quot; can mean almost anything depending on who you ask. Note: I&#x27;m picky so while I love movies if I check my ratings (I take notes because I forget what I watched), it turns out I only like about one out of 10 movies. Or maybe to put it in a slightly better light, only 1 of 10 or so is worth recommending. Some might be okay but not okay enough to tell someone &quot;you should seek out this movie&quot;<p>Anyway, here&#x27;s some from my list from the last year (the list of ones I didn&#x27;t like is MUCH longer and includes many that are highly rated on IMDB)<p>&quot;Now, Voyager&quot; (1942)<p>&quot;Boom Town&quot; (1940)<p>&quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (1947)<p>&quot;The Little Princess&quot; (1939)<p>&quot;Destry Rides Again&quot; (1939)<p>&quot;Baby Face&quot; (1933)<p>&quot;Adam&#x27;s Rib&quot; (1949)<p>&quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; (1950)<p>&quot;It Happened One Night&quot; (1934)<p>&quot;The Woman of the Year&quot; (1942)<p>&quot;The Awful Truth&quot; (1937)<p>&quot;Broken Arrow&quot; (1950)<p>&quot;The Lady Eve&quot; (1941)<p>&quot;His Girl Friday&quot; (1940)<p>&quot;12 O&#x27;Clock High&quot; (1949)<p>&quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It With You&quot; (1938)<p>&quot;The Far County&quot; (1954)<p>&quot;Random Harvest&quot; (1942)<p>&quot;The Bad and the Beautiful&quot; (1952)<p>&quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1940)<p>&quot;Cry Danger&quot; (1951)<p>&quot;This Gun For Hire&quot; (1942)<p>&quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942). I didn&#x27;t get it at 23 where as I shook from crying at 50. Basically I needed to truly feel Rick&#x27;s loss and what he was going through (Bogart&#x27;s character). At 23 I didn&#x27;t. At 50 I did. I suppose you could have similar experiences to Rick at a younger age or you could never have them and then not have it do anything for you.<p>I don&#x27;t think any of them are &quot;lesser known&quot;. Basically I just look up IMDB. If it&#x27;s rated &gt; 7 and sounds mildly interesting I&#x27;ll take a look. Tons of them don&#x27;t work for me. Those above did. As recent examples of ones that didn&#x27;t &quot;The Strange Love of Martha Ivers&quot; (1946), &quot;Dark Passage&quot; (1947), &quot;Waterloo Bridge&quot; (1940), &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1947), &quot;Spellbound&quot; (1945), &quot;Fort Apache&quot; (1948). Those are just from the last 2 weeks (^^;)')
