Item(by='throwaway19937', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608299491, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25460058, text='&gt; Just like any large audience a hive mind exists. There are more posts in favor of Snowden&#x2F;Assange on here than in favor of this google employee. In general, more come to their defense, than hers, despite doing similar things.<p>These cases are completely different.<p>Snowden and Assange exposed a global surveillance network that many are opposed to. I think of Snowden as the Kim Philby of the 21st century but that&#x27;s a different discussion.<p>Dr. Gebu disagreed with the peer reviews of a paper, threatened to resign, and Google accepted her resignation.<p>&gt; Those aren&#x27;t why you&#x27;re dismissive. You&#x27;ve made up your mind on her, and make those items &quot;dismissive&quot; to support your POV, because you can&#x27;t actually prove one way or the other. Perhaps some of the reviewers are racist. We&#x27;ve seen in the past 4 years that racism is alive and well in this country.<p>She may feel that her paper was rejected because the reviewers are racist; I think it&#x27;s more likely that they disagreed with the quality of the work. There was probably an administrative screw-up with its submission, though.<p>Neither of us can prove anything. It&#x27;s unlikely that all the facts will come out in any event; Google would settle the case if it went to court.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t see a problem with sending an internal email to colleagues. Should everyone just fall in line and do everything asked ever and never want change?<p>Have you read the email (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.platformer.news&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.platformer.news&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-withering-email-that-got-a...</a>) that she sent? Would you expect to keep your job if you sent a similar email at work? Diversity is the third rail of modern companies - criticize or discourage it and you&#x27;re gone.<p>&gt; If she is publicly publishing a paper, reviewers should publicly publish their reviews, especially if they&#x27;re negative. At this point, if we don&#x27;t know the reviewers, we can&#x27;t tell if they&#x27;re genuine reviews, or not.<p>Anonymous peer reviews are a standard practice in industry and academia. If you demand the names of reviewers and threaten to resign if they aren&#x27;t provided then don&#x27;t be surprised if your employment ends.')
