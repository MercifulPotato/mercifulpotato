Everyone I&#x27;ve talked to who has applied has not received a response from their application.<p>Even in my most recent experience I wrote a cover letter, reached out to multiple Stripe recruiters. Most of them either ignored me, or said that they were not working on that role and said my status is still &quot;pending&quot;.<p>I imagine that Stripe&#x27;s recruiting team is overwhelmed but it was unfortunate that they weren&#x27;t able to get back to me. I ended up accepting an engineering manager position over payments at another company.')
