I think it&#x27;s far more likely that browsers and other runtimes will natively support TS as a separate language rather than JS evolving to become TS.<p>It has already been tried with Dart. Dart was made because JS lacked a type system, preventing further optimisations.\nSupport for Dart was added in Chrome.<p>Another popular JS transpiler is CoffeeScript, most of it&#x27;s syntax is now in JavaScript.')
