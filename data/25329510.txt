I think there is a real desire by people to not have to live as rentiers in the digital marketplace, but there are not really products that cater to that.<p>IMO There&#x27;s a place for something that merges a NAS, with some sort of overlay over current IP that is encrypted and fully peer-to-peer.  But NASes are still too hard for many consumers to set up, and most techniques to overlay over IP are likewise too difficult, and basically impossible to correctly multi-tenant (you can&#x27;t share your network space with your aunt and your coworker without sharing with both).  Unlike IPFS, or bittorrent, availability is important, but not critical, and you don&#x27;t need to promiscuously replicate your information across the entire world, encrypted or otherwise.<p>I think there&#x27;s a market for something that is like &quot;plug in to your local network, do minimal configuration, you can set up shared folders a la dropbox, and you can access it over the net&quot;.  You can sync credentials with a username and a one-time PIN.  You should be able to <i>easily</i> set up rules for sharing with friends, with smart defaults.<p>I think what&#x27;s interesting from a consumer perspective is that there are things you can do on such a platform that many  (not all) people would think twice about letting facebook do, like tag and organize photos of your young kid and share them with relatives&#x2F;friends who have a PIN.<p>I also think that the time horizon for this is relatively short (5-years?) soon people will be so desensitized to advertisements&#x2F;being a digital rentier that the opportunity will have aged out.  20-somethings don&#x27;t know what a NAS is.<p>I haven&#x27;t started on this yet, but if anyone is interested, my info&#x27;s here.')
