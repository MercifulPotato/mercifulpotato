Item(by='jpster', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609086878, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25551025, text='&gt; I know of several friends who have caught it from young children in school settings<p>I guess there’s no way for them to be certain. But I’ve been wondering if we’ve been too quick to believe that kids are less susceptible to Covid or the virus that causes it.<p>Imagine that children <i>do</i> contract it as regularly as adults, but are usually asymptomatic. No symptoms = no suspicion = no reason for them to be tested.<p>Kids not being tested regularly could be the reason why we believe “they don’t get it”. I fear we’ve come to an unsound and dangerous conclusion on this. And I think it’s partly due to the way we confounded the variables when we shut schools in spring. Closed schools probably helped keep kid cases down at first. And from there we leaped to “kids don’t get it”.<p>Meanwhile, the CDC has published more data on that shows kids do transmit. But their updates seem to have a hard time breaking through the noise. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;mmwr&#x2F;volumes&#x2F;69&#x2F;wr&#x2F;mm6939e2.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;mmwr&#x2F;volumes&#x2F;69&#x2F;wr&#x2F;mm6939e2.htm</a><p>Same with their update last week to acknowledge that Covid is mainly airborne. How many are now aware of this? Checking air ventilation? Or still focused on surface wipedowns? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;first10em&#x2F;status&#x2F;1341121947682418691?s=21" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;first10em&#x2F;status&#x2F;1341121947682418691?s=2...</a>')
