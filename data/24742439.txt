Let&#x27;s add to that list of failures: the article has no discussion of reasonable policy ideas (despite quoting researchers whose life&#x27;s work is in producing them).<p>NB: don&#x27;t assume that there&#x27;s no downside to any given retailer unilaterally disclosing their return rates, because returns are a measurable factor in marginal cost &amp; revenue assessment and partially describe both the elasticity of demand and overall customer sentiment.  Every retailer of scale would be interested in obtaining the return statistics (especially segmented) of their competitors; and, as the tone of the article illustrates, there are any number of hacks poised to scribble out mendacious venom on the basis of such data, so no corporate PR lackey worth their communications degree will willingly start that conversation.')
