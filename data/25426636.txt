They dont normally shower or brush their teeth. There is a smell, but its not punch you in the face bad. Humans can smell really bad on all fronts, but noseblindness is a thing and probably for this reason. You really only smell exaggerated odor after a few minutes. When I was a student at Texas A&amp;M I worked for the on campus car rental agency. The worst place on campus was the chicken refuse area, and it smelled bad- like mile away bad. Even there, you would stop smelling it after a few minutes only to catch a wiff or two a few hours later. Point being, it probably smelled awful, but not for long.')
