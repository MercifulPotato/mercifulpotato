This is fine, but if they can do that why not sack everyone and just hire contractors and pay for the outputs?<p>Why not do that anyway? The same reasons apply.<p>&gt;If they are at work, and can&#x27;t slack off, then they will use this discretion to create value for the company in ways that the managers don&#x27;t always have time to exactly specify.<p>I&#x27;ve never been in a work environment where everyone is working at 100% all the time. Never. Have you?<p>Pure anecdote - while working remotely I&#x27;ve found that my team is bout the same productivity level, maybe slightly more productive; we&#x27;ve had people build internal tools in their spare time, people are focused on the task rather than wasting time and we&#x27;ve hired carefully and built a culture where people know they are trusted and needed to get the job done.<p>Yes, it doesn&#x27;t work the same way in-person works all the time. You have to allow for more asynchronicity, but you can counter that in part by having the opportunity for scheduled check-ins.<p>In your example, by the way, the staffer has gained no favor from the manager by directly going against what they said to do. They might solve this bug and be a hero but they&#x27;ll be likely to gain a reputation for not being able to listen to directions.')
