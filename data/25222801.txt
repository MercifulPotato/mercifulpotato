You&#x27;ve had unsound code in one language, now you have unsound code in other language, how come it&#x27;s suddenly worse other than having to type unsafe explicitly?<p>I&#x27;ve done my fair share of C++, including low latency stuff, and in the grand scheme of things I&#x27;d say &quot;expressiveness of C++&quot; is completely overshadowed by its complexity and occasional ambiguity, lack of proper type system and proper generics, lack of proper module system, lack of dependency tracking, lack of a unified build systems, etc. I&#x27;m not exactly sure what you mean by expressiveness though.')
