Until recently I felt was one of the guys helping the business and just happened to have a finger across several companies in non competing industries.<p>Now the growth is on and &#x27;corporate employees&#x27; are joining mid size success corp. As a consultant so many treat me as second tier as though signing that full time contract changes something. Is strange how that status changes peoples behaviour.<p>Also amazing how much meetings took over and people there for the sake of it are involved in everything. Changed incredibly in 18 months when the money was rolling in and headcount opened. A bunch for the better but also incredible how much bureaucracy came in so quickly.')
