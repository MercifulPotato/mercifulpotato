So the question is whether the data Facebook collects is unnecessary. The specific circumstances are key here. One argument is that what Facebook collects is necessary since it is the very business model here: you get access and in exchange Facebook shows you targeted ads, for which the data are necessary.<p>I have never been clear about the basis for claiming that consent is not freely given if it is linked to accessing the service. To me that negates the very nature of contracts, which is an exchange. People freely agree or they don&#x27;t.<p>Sometimes it seems that &#x27;freely&#x27; is interpreted as meaning &#x27;gratis&#x27;, but that would not be what is typical meant by &#x27;freely given&#x27; when discussing agreement or consent, which usually means &#x27;without being coerced or misled&#x27;.')
