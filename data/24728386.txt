There&#x27;s absolutely nothing that has been said in this thread that they aren&#x27;t keenly aware of.  There are people in Cupertino that are going to wake up in a few hours, grab some coffee and pore over the threat intel reports from last night.  They know who is buying and for how much and have a long detailed analysis of what happened with previous jailbreaks.  There is another team of people dedicated to staffing the bounty program, rifling through stacks of reports with a signal to noise ratio that&#x27;s approaching the Shannon limit, triaging findings, tracking down product and engineering teams to get a quick response so they can get back to the researcher in a timely fashion, handling rejections for out of scope and dupes.<p>These people are in it up to their eyeballs in this every day.  They live it, breathe it, love it and they&#x27;ll move the needle when moving the needle makes sense.  Until then anyone that participates in the bounty program and then cries foul when payouts are in line with the posted max and not with what could be had on the black market are going to get zero sympathy from me.')
