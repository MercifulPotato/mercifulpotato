When they&#x27;ve failed, it&#x27;s been because:<p>- I stalled the spindle and I&#x27;m trying to plow the no-longer-rotating endmill straight through my stock (and if steps weren&#x27;t skipped, the tool would break)<p>- I forgot to turn on the spindle and I&#x27;m trying to plow the endmill straight through my stock (and if steps weren&#x27;t skipped, the tool would break)<p>- I&#x27;ve somehow forced the machine to try to push through its limits and crashed an axis into the chassis (and if steps weren&#x27;t skipped, the machine would be seriously damaged)<p>Basically, the only time the steppers have failed is when not doing so would lead to much greater damage, so I&#x27;d go so far as to say that skipping steps are a feature, not a bug.<p>If your steppers are failing in the middle of a job where nothing has gone wrong, either your steppers or your drivers are messed up but it&#x27;s not because steppers are inherently bad.<p>I&#x27;d recommend servos for applications that are demanding on torque, power, speed and&#x2F;or accuracy. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for your first DIY machine because of the additional risk, expense and complexity they add.')
