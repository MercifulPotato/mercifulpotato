The long and short of it is that you need to find some way to prove to other identity servers that you properly verified a 3pid. That&#x27;s theoretically possible with e-mail and DKIM, except there are too many e-mail servers that don&#x27;t implement it correctly.<p>For phone numbers it&#x27;s even worse.<p>[edit]\nI forgot: There is a working implementation of federated identity servers for e-mail, but that requires you to run an identity server on the domain of the e-mail address that you&#x27;re trying to add as 3pid. That means it works fine if you host your own e-mail but it doesn&#x27;t work for the gmails and hotmails of this world.')
