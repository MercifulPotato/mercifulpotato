This is one of the reasons why dual (and even triple) SIM phones are so popular outside of North America.<p>In a lot of countries I don&#x27;t see number portability in the SS7&#x2F;PSTN system ever becoming a political reality, due to regulatory capture on the part of the national telecom regulator. At least not before pure IP based communications and apps make the concept of a PSTN phone number irrelevant entirely.')
