Vast majority of cost are in assets, and specifically Graphics Assets.<p>I am not sure I agree, because with the current trends I would have thought the incentive largely in flavours of moving to Unreal 5 over time. I think it is more of an economics, business, unit cost and TAM question more than a technical question.<p>( Stop putting stupid money &#x2F; budget in rendering pipelines or graphics asset and start paying attention to Physics, Game-Play, StoryLine, NPC interaction, player psychology, in-game economics and god damn bug fix. )')
