Item(by='redis_mlc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605603488, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25121037, text='&gt; But those things could absolutely impact someone&#x27;s earning potential as a worker.<p>There was an eye-opening article in a newspaper on a US chain like Chili&#x27;s or Olive Garden(?) waiters being rated by diners with a table device.<p>A waiter could bring out a meal from the kitchen, and if it was &quot;cold&quot; or &quot;not right&quot;, that waiter would get a 1 rating, which would result in loss of hours (from 30 or 40 hours down to 20), and eventually dismissal, by company policy.<p>Pretty horrible outcome since the kitchen is responsible for that.')
