Nothing is flipped at no axis at all. If what you see in the mirror would be another universe then it would have to me MIRRORED to look like we see things in a mirror. Every row of atoms right-angled towards the mirror would have to have the exact opposite order. Would the other universe be flipped? No it would not. The wrong assumption is that your universe and the one you see in the mirror is identical. But it would have to be mirrored it can not be identical and also not flipped. No matter how you would flip the other universe it would never look like what you see in a mirror.<p>Just use 2 identical but non-simple objects place them next to each other for example 2 coins.\nNo matter how you flip or rotate the coins it will never look like there is a mirror in between. You would need a mirrored coin for that.')
