But for UX, it&#x27;s not necessarily dark pattern. IMO, there is a bad smell, started by Google, particularly Chrome if I remembered correctly, which tends to hide menus&#x2F;actions by moving them under the burger&#x2F;3 dots menu. Such behavior saves a little bit screen estates but adds one extra click to finish one particular operation and the bigger problem is that it hides the available options from the user and in turn makes applications less intuitive.')
