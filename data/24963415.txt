Item(by='gist', descendants=None, kids=[24963675], score=None, time=1604272718, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24962232, text='The OP &#x27;studies what makes companies successful&#x27;.  The issue is you are only studying the lucky sperm ones (if we take that sentence at face value; maybe &#x27;they&#x27; do) as opposed to the complete set of companies. And also you&#x27;d never be sure anyway since people are connected to people and you&#x27;d never know how a connection resulted in success (vs. some other factor). It&#x27;s an art and luck it&#x27;s not (as a point was made) &#x27;science&#x27;.<p>Now that said some thing can work to insure success or make it more likely.<p>Take the author here. His firm has &#x27;feynman&#x27; in their name. On HN who from what I can tell worships Feynman (I didn&#x27;t even know who he was prior to HN) that will work. In another place it would have the same impact of using &#x27;warby&#x27; in &#x27;warby&#x27; parker. Meaning good but not stop the presses. (It&#x27;s clever but some might also say it&#x27;s annoying to use a cheap trick like that not the same either (it&#x27;s all nuance) as calling your bagel place &#x27;einstein bagels&#x27; (there is one or was one).<p>I have been &#x27;studying&#x27; (you could say) both successful and failed companies for probably longer than most HN readers have been around. Best I will say it&#x27;s hard work, luck, and of course timing as the major factors.  Separately they don&#x27;t teach any of that when I was in of those really good business schools that people would die to go to.')
