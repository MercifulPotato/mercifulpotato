I use Splunk at work and love it, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem like a product for solo developers (I can&#x27;t even find a pricing page on splunk.com), and the primary free alternative, the ELK stack, seems a bit complicated to set up.<p>I am sure that I&#x27;ll never be competitive with Splunk or Elastic in terms of features or scalability but I&#x27;m trying to build something that is at least useful for my own projects.<p>I built it in Go and use SQLite with the FTS (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sqlite.org&#x2F;fts3.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sqlite.org&#x2F;fts3.html</a>) extension to store the log events in a way where they can be searched quickly.')
