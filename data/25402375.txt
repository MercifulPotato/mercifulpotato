If it doesn&#x27;t, and you just need to figure out what the code does, fix a few lines of code, going back to a text editor, grepping and trusting the CI to run the tests itself is just less overhead.<p>If you work on the same project for a longer period of time, you can easily justify the upfront cost of configuring your environment properly (and have your class searches and &#x27;Run all tests&#x27; running).')
