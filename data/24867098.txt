(Was that Quark? not sure). Then X did something that pissed off a lot of their users, and within a few months everyone had pivoted to the newcomer, Adobe.<p>The moral here is that if you&#x27;ve got a monopoly or at least a comfortable majority in an area of software, you shouldn&#x27;t just be worried about someone else making a better product - switching is effort and people don&#x27;t like that - you should be very worried about doing something that annoys your existing customers enough that staying but adapting to the new UI &#x2F; pricing model &#x2F; etc. is perceived to be as much effort as switching.<p>(Whoever authorised the new UI for firefox on Android might want to think about this too.)<p>What I can find is Strategy Letter III, saying that in this situation the best thing for a challenger to do is make sure their product is &quot;backwards&quot; compatible: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2000&#x2F;06&#x2F;03&#x2F;strategy-letter-iii-let-me-go-back&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2000&#x2F;06&#x2F;03&#x2F;strategy-letter-ii...</a> Example: How Excel (that Joel was working on at the time) grabbed the market from Lotus 1-2-3.<p>When people like @prox below say things such as &quot;I switched to Affinity completely, and I also slowly see some people in the industry change.&quot;, I&#x27;m starting to think that Adobe might be ready for its Lotus 1-2-3 moment. Not letting people install their old Adobe software they&#x27;ve paid for is the best incentive to try out something new that I could think of.')
