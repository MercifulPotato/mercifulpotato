Item(by='ayyy', descendants=None, kids=[25120991], score=None, time=1605580879, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25118702, text='&gt; Honestly this seems entirely reasonable<p>I want to agree with your optimistic view of this, but I can&#x27;t, because I don&#x27;t think reason was used in making the decision.<p>I think the reality is probably closer to this:<p>Product: &quot;so we can&#x27;t let users block our own apps. it might break things in weird ways and also they implicitly trust us already because we make their OS&quot;.<p>Engineers on the application firewall team: &quot;ok cool, we&#x27;ll disable users from blocking Apple apps&quot;.<p>Any freedom you&#x27;re enjoying with PF isn&#x27;t there because Apple decided it was a good idea.  It&#x27;s there because Apple decided to build on BSD.<p>I&#x27;m actually surprised MacOS even has PF (apparently since 2015, enhanced from other BSD implementations).  I did a minimal amount of searching and found this now-relevant gem: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;manjusri.ucsc.edu&#x2F;2015&#x2F;03&#x2F;10&#x2F;PF-on-Mac-OS-X&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;manjusri.ucsc.edu&#x2F;2015&#x2F;03&#x2F;10&#x2F;PF-on-Mac-OS-X&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; If two firewalls, Application Firewall &amp; PF, are both running, you may wonder whose rules take precedence. Letâ€™s find out.<p>&gt; ...<p>&gt; So one can conclude that PF rules are applied first, then the rules for Application Firewall.')
