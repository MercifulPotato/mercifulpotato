I&#x27;ve read a lot of the lit, too, thank you.<p>&gt; This is a convenient, self-fulfilling narrative.<p>So is refusing to acknowledge the existence of norms because some people refuse to acknowledge them.  Ultimately, our social reality is something we pretend into existence together.<p>&gt; It is also pitting you into an adversarial position with someone. It&#x27;s highly risky to insist on a norm and accuse others of not honoring it - and then be viewed as someone who is inflexible. It&#x27;s your choice, though.<p>Whinging that someone broke norm A [e.g. seemed ungrateful] and thinking less of people&#x2F;entities that you&#x27;ve heard have done the same is pretty cheap and isn&#x27;t likely to earn you value judgments yourself.')
