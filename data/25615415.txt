The world isn&#x27;t flat, nor hollow. COVID isn&#x27;t part of a New World Order plot to harvest your adrenochrome, we <i>did</i> on the moon, Hillary Clinton doesn&#x27;t bathe in the blood of child sex slaves to maintain her human form, Sandy Hook was not a false flag, there are no FEMA death camps, no aliens at Area 51, HAARP doesn&#x27;t control the weather, CERN didn&#x27;t hack the Matrix, &quot;cultural marxism&quot; doesn&#x27;t really exist, and neither does the &quot;Deep State.&quot;<p>You can accept that the world is more complex than you understand, and that conspiracies exist, while still having a standard for obvious bullshit. Or at the very least, while being dubious of extraordinary claims presented without extraordinary proof.')
