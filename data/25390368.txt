You can customize it however you like, and it&#x27;s easy to add functionality on top of (or into) the core system. In practice, would standardization hinder this property? It seems like the cost of evolving org-mode would become <i>much</i> higher if there were a formal standard and a number of actively used implementations—we&#x27;d have to worry about backwards compatibility, inconsistencies between systems... etc.<p>As it happens, I absolutely <i>would</i> love better support for org-mode workflows in other systems, especially on mobile. (I use Orgzly on Android which is <i>fine</i> but also limited and inflexible.) I could also see a native org-mode implementation making core operations much faster, although the EmacsGCC work is making a real improvement on that front already.<p>But I worry that supporting that would sacrifice the very properties that let org-mode evolve into what it is and to <i>continue</i> evolving even now.')
