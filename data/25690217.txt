Item(by='brmgb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610138714, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25687957, text='&gt; This is simply a lie. All wolf packs are strictly hierarchical. Meaning there is no wolf pack without a hierarchy.<p>Tone it down a bit. You should inform yourself. I gave you the name of the author to read, Mech, in my previous post.<p>Wolf packs are not hierarchical. You have the parents leading because well they are the parents taking care of their offsprings and that&#x27;s it. The rest of the group has no fixed hierarchy.<p>&gt; complex&quot;, &quot;social dominance&quot;. Which is it? You say they don&#x27;t have complex hierarchy and then claim complex interactions involving social dominance.<p>Wolves have situational and individual dependants relationship some involving dominance. For example parents tend to harass their young when they approach the age of leaving. Some youngs situationaly fight other youngs but you can&#x27;t establish a ranking of individual in a wild pack. That wouldn&#x27;t make much sense.<p>I have complex relationships with my friends. They sometimes involve dominance. Yet we don&#x27;t have a hierarchy.<p>&gt; Wolf packs have hierarchy like human families have hierarchy.<p>Human families don&#x27;t have hierarchy. Young children are subordinate to their parents until they come of age, a bit like in a wolf pack actually.<p>I am starting to understand your confusion.')
