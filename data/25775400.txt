Item(by='claudiawerner', descendants=None, kids=[25775852], score=None, time=1610625941, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25775331, text='&gt; This piece takes as a given that speech is actively limited, and then begins to discuss when and how much.<p>It begins from the most influential theorist of liberal rights of all time, J.S. Mill, and his very permissive attitude as to what should be restricted - notably, what causes harm. You&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find any theorist who argues that we should <i>both</i> have a state, and that no speech (such as threats, child porn, calls to immediate violence, etc.) should be restricted. Once you admit that any restriction on speech (such as the examples I just mentioned) is available, as it is in the U.S. for instance, it becomes a question of where we draw the line.<p>It is decidedly <i>not</i> easy to widen the extent of those restrictions in the U.S. It takes a lot of agreement to change the constitution.')
