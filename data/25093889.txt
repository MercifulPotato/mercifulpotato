SeeLink allows its users to create boards to share links with individuals &#x2F; groups of people, allowing them to save and share human-readable links at the click of a button.<p>After 3 months of work, I have created a complete platform that simplifies link sharing and collaboration, allowing you to seamlessly share, save, and collaborate on links with groups of up to 50 people at a time. I&#x27;m super excited to finally launch SeeLink and get it out to the world! Let me know if you have any feedback, suggestions, or questions.')
