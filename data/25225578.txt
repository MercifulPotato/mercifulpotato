However as someone with few&#x2F;weak social connections, I feel like the calculus has been the exact opposite for me, as I&#x27;ve transitioned from broke college student to well-paid tech employee.  When my bank account was near zero, I jealously guarded it, not having any reason to believe that charity to strangers or even acquaintances would be repaid.  Now that I have plenty of savings, I don&#x27;t think twice about giving away money, because I have no particularly elevated social position to guard (nor am I desirous of obtaining such).')
