I highly recommend it to anyone interested in a macro perspective of our economic transition as it stands now and where it can go.<p>If you prefer more academic texts my favorite work of his is &quot;The Religion of the Future&quot; and I also enjoyed &quot;The Singular Universe &amp; the Reality of Time&quot; that he co-wrote with the physicist Lee Smolin. His earlier works are good but less digestible and can be picked up from his lectures.<p>About 4 years I founded a 501c3 non-profit that built a free election campaign platform for local candidates - the idea was to solve the problem of $20k campaigns for town council. Our beta went well, citizens loved it - but it was a bad product market fit. I have a rudimentary technical knowledge but if anyone is interested the git is here:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OurSociety&#x2F;OurSociety---Free-Local-Campaign-Platform" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OurSociety&#x2F;OurSociety---Free-Local-Campai...</a><p>During that time my wife introduce my to him haphazardly and he just sucked me in. I started by listening to his lectures and have since &quot;taken&quot; all of his courses at least twice.')
