Microsoft is by far the best at this, they&#x27;ve been at this game for what, 20, 30 years? That&#x27;s why Azure has bigger numbers than GCP and it&#x27;s the only one capable of confronting AWS head-on (AWS which is winning merely on technical merits, at least for now).<p>My gf works for a Microsoft cloud re-seller (among other things) and I&#x27;ve recently asked her if GCP has ever come into the conversation when it came to their  clients (clients among which are a few government entities), her answer was &quot;never&quot;, followed by a quick laugh, as in &quot;who would even ask such a thing?&quot; Google and its cloud offering is missing in action around here big time, and I have a feeling the same situation happens in other European countries. They still have this mistaken belief that people will come to them hat in hand just because they&#x27;re Google, but when it comes to the cloud market that has never been the case.')
