I see a lot of blogs, community meetups and conferences organized around leveraging JS and specifically the large frameworks, which is okay! However it only re-enforces that JavaScript first solutions are implicitly better, rather than an emphasis on leveraging the whole tech stack correctly. I have friends that I respect very much who have largely gotten by with just a <i>passing</i> knowledge of CSS, HTML and hasn’t yet gained a deep understanding when it’s more appropriate to leverage those technologies over JS, let alone the trend of pushing so much work to the client (such as, not even bothering to scope APIs correctly. How many times have you had to sort the results of an API request because it is not sent over the wire sorted for it’s use case, even though your team controls the API?) The industry does not enforce wholistic thinking when it comes to this. That is the real problem to me.<p>Web components are somewhat an exception to this, as API considerations go they do attempt to strike a balance between server side rendered content and dynamic client side content, our industry just isn’t heading in a direction where that balance was struck')
