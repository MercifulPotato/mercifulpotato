Buying in the bend is best. The difference between a $50 and $200 pair of headphones is staggering. From $200 to $500 is still significant. From $500 to $1000 is extremely slight. From $1000 to $5000 is basically unnoticeable.<p>Apple looks to be using plastic driver cones more at home in a $30 pair of headphones while selling something at the inflection point where headphones get really good.<p>I&#x27;d bet heavily that these $500 headphones get outperformed by the $100 Sennheiser HD 280 pros. A $400 Sennheiser 650 will no doubt blow them away while still being $150 cheaper.')
