And no sniff of this new framework.<p>The comment I replied to described that they searched for &quot;<i>prolog</i> web framework&quot;, which is NOT the name of this project. The name of this project is &quot;<i>prologue</i>&quot;.<p>&quot;prolog&quot; != &quot;prologue&quot;<p>Searching for &quot;prolog web framework&quot; <i>should not</i> return results about the &quot;Prologue&quot; web framework. What the commenter I replied to described is the <i>correct</i> behavior.<p>Edit: I understand that contrived searches might be constructed to fall victim to fuzzy matching, but what the comment I replied to confirmed is that it&#x27;s probably not an issue in this case.')
