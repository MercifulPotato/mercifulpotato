Now I experience the issue. First place I&#x27;m going to look is <i>open GitHub issues</i>. I find nothing, suffer more self-troubleshooting, maybe file an issue myself, because why would I look at closed issues... closed issues are generally resolved! I end up annoying you with an extra issue report, and wasting hours of my time. If I&#x27;m lucky enough I happen to run a search that shows me the other user&#x27;s report, I have no way to reopen the issue. I can maybe &quot;me too&quot; it, but given that you closed it already, I know you don&#x27;t care.<p>More than likely, after wasting a bunch of time with your project, I&#x27;m going to find someone else&#x27;s.<p>Even if, again, <i>even if</i>, your non-standard way of abusing GitHub works for you, it&#x27;s going to confuse, frustrate, and annoy everyone else you interact with. Which, if you don&#x27;t hate your users, you should consider a big problem.')
