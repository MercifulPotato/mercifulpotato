Thus most  homeowners don’t own the land their home is on, they just own a very long term lease from the actual landowner (not sure precisely what is customary these days, but imagine a 99-year lease) with N decades left on it. This is a leasehold.<p>Owning the land is called a freehold, and the owners are called freeholders instead of leaseholders.<p>Contrast the US where a lease of a home is typically paid monthly and contracted on a year to year basis.')
