Any company with good finances can apply for support for R&amp;D to develop new features or tech that they would otherwise not develop or invest in. This comes in the form of direct contributions to employees&#x27; salaries listed in the grant application.<p>I&#x27;ve written and defended these grants for multiple companies and I have been on the receiving end of them, too.<p>This isn&#x27;t even specific to this deal, this is just something you can always do, along with literally hundreds of EU and state level support programs.')
