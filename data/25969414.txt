This thread is a clear example of that, as your first post here is very misleading except to anyone who a) knows that you are using your own private language, and b) actually knows what you mean by your words. In that post, using your own private definition of the various terms under discussion is worse than useless, as anyone who does not know what the accepted meanings are will end up worse off for reading it.<p>“When I use a word,’ Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, ‘it means just what I choose it to mean — neither more nor less.’<p>’The question is,’ said Alice, ‘whether you can make words mean so many different things.’<p>’The question is,’ said Humpty Dumpty, ‘which is to be master — that’s all.”<p>― Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass')
