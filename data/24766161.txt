I would have been climbing the walls there.<p>Of course there are more factors in single-family home prices as well:  interest rates are directly tied to how much money people can afford to borrow, so the rate reductions this summer drive a surge in housing prices, and generally the fed injected a ton of money into the financial system that is sloshing around looking for safe places to park, and housing is a very safe place to do that.  There are a lot of properties being bought up by investment firms to rent out.')
