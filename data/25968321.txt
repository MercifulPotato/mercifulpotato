Ever since Firefox&#x27;s crusade against IE the majority of people seem to still know there are different ~programs~ apps to access the internet with. As long as Chrome is not the default in the overwhelming amount of the operating systems, this might even stay like this, which is why I&#x27;m extremely unhappy that Android ships with Chrome these days and not with a thin gui on top of the system webview, like it used to.<p>EDIT: this ties in to the conversation I had on different platform recently, that it&#x27;s getting arduous to make people understand that an app is not necessarily the same as the system behind it. Choosing an email client used to be a thing (Thunderbird, The Bat!, Outlook Express, mutt, etc; to name  some across contrasting needs) not even too long ago. I despise that we came to a world where even the tech moderation fails to understand an app != protocol.')
