That does not imply that it was actually fixed correctly.<p>If you want to fly alone on a 737 Max, fine. Don&#x27;t do it above my house. But allowing members of the general public do it is another matter. It&#x27;s the FAA&#x27;s job to ensure that the plane is safe, and it sure looks like they&#x27;re valuing Boeing&#x27;s profits above that.')
