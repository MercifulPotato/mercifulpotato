He was a project manager when we first worked together, and moved on to create his own consulting company.<p>It was an iOS app developer role, with lots of UI work (make the button blue) and other stuff I didn&#x27;t care much about.<p>But then something popped up, electronic signature with ID card. Nobody wanted to touch it. I wanted it badly. It was a lot of fun!<p>I guess the story here is: do your best, even if you don&#x27;t like what you work on. Eventually people will entrust you with better stuff.<p>I&#x27;d make an exception for some cases though: unethical work. My first job required me to work on things I didn&#x27;t approve of, morally speaking. I left, screw that.<p>Nowadays I still do things that I love but everyone else hates. Right now that revolves around data science&#x2F;engineering, but who knows where I&#x27;ll be in a few years time. I just follow the flow :)')
