Your comment is a great example. Tech developments, choices, trends and so on only really make sense in the context of history. And often we forget about history, start to reinvent things or even steer into a completely useless direction because we don&#x27;t apply temporal reasoning or simply don&#x27;t learn from the past.<p>Another benefit of this kind of approach is starting to learn about a challenging subject. Say you want to deepen your knowledge in a branch of mathematics that you find interesting and useful. The history of that branch will tell you so much more than a typical lecture-style conglomerate of concepts. It provides a great overview of important actors, their relationships, cause and effect of discoveries, the culture, the problems and so on. On top of that it is easier to remember and internalize concepts if you know the story behind them.')
