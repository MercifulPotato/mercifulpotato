They plan to manufacturer their batteries directly into the vehicle frames.  This saves a ton of weight and would be nearly impossible for a competing manufacturer who outsources everything.  That is just one example.<p>if Apple is serious about a car, they need to be vertically integrated to seriously compete with Tesla')
