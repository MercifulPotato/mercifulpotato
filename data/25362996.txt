Sure if suddenly all college students made aggressive financial choices we&#x27;d be better off, but really it&#x27;s the more expensive universities themselves.<p>They know what kinds and amounts of student loans are available and they raise their prices based on that. If they can sell getting even more expensive student loans (knowing they have no risk and that you can&#x27;t exactly get a refund on a degree..) then they&#x27;ll keep raising prices.<p>And if all of these costs were resulting in the greatest workers ever who were geniuses in mathematics, maybe it&#x27;d be worth it right. Except generally it&#x27;s not, these costs are going to administrators and fluff instead of things that help students or improve their outcomes.')
