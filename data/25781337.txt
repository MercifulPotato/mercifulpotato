The system is exceptionally stable and reliable, which I care about very much. It&#x27;s also simple, in that it does everything I ask it to, and nothing I don&#x27;t ask it to. I can fit the entire system in my head.<p>I use Vim as my editor, and yes, programmers who value bloated, un-Unixy tools like VSCode will not find the system accomodating.')
