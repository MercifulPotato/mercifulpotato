That business was sold to Microsoft in a very dubious deal, and Microsoft promptly ran it into the ground.<p>Nokia is one of the three main players in the cell phone infrastructure market. The others are Ericsson and Huawei. There are a couple of smaller players too like Samsung and ZTE.<p>Nokia seems like a very reasonable choice for this contract. The Chinese players were presumably out for (mostly) political reasons. So this was probably a 2 way race with Ericsson.<p>edited: fix typo.')
