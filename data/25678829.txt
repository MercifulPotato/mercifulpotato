For those not familiar with their value add, Simple is essentially &quot;envelope budgeting&quot; built into a banking application.  Sure, it&#x27;s a bank and does bank things.  What sets Simple apart is that I can allocate $n&#x2F;month for an expense and it takes it out of my paycheck and puts it into that expense &quot;envelope&quot;.  When a charge comes in for that expense, it pulls from the envelope.  Other budgeting tools like mvelopes.com and YNAB are great for visibility&#x2F;tracking, but they don&#x27;t move your money around.  The alternative I used prior to finding Simple was having about 10 different checking accounts and manually transferring money every few weeks.  I really don&#x27;t want to go back to that setup after tasting the good life.<p>My pitch to the Simple team, or anyone interested in taking this on, is to take the app and build it on top of Stripe Treasury (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;treasury" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;treasury</a>).')
