Coastal urbanized states will &quot;control the election&quot; only in the sense that they have the majority of population and their average preference will have greater influence than the rest, when you average the whole area.  In other words, they will control the election in the same way &quot;people living to the south of Minneapolis&quot; or &quot;people who ordered Chinese food in the past year&quot; will control the election.')
