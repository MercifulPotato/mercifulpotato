Capture: every interesting idea that I think up or read is immediately stored in Google Keep. It can be very rough at this point, the goal is simply to not forget.<p>2. Transcribe &amp; Organize: every weekend, I go through the notes I accumulated during the week. It tends to be between 10 and 30 notes. Sometimes the note is &quot;read this article&quot; or &quot;catch up on all newsletters&quot;, so <i>understanding</i> a single note can take over an hour. On some tough weekends the process takes an entire day, but that is invariably a day where I feel like I learned a _ton_. Once the note is cleaned up (transcribed), I feel like I understand it. At this point I rarely forget it - it has been absorbed into my brain. The final step here is &quot;categorizing&quot; the note. I classify it using OneNote with tabs like &quot;Clinical psychology&quot; (nested under &quot;Psychology&quot;) or &quot;Math&quot; or &quot;Physics&quot; or &quot;Investment management&quot;. This way, in the future, I don&#x27;t have a million notes scattered around, but one clear place I know where to look. On average, this process takes 2-4 hours per weekend.<p>3. Revisit: generally, people recommend you revisit your notes from time to time. I almost never do this. But if I ever am thinking about &quot;Marketing&quot; or &quot;Sociology&quot;, I have an immense, high SNR repository of everything I&#x27;ve ever found valuable on the topic. I&#x27;ve done this for software interviews and it&#x27;s been incredibly helpful.<p>Overall, I attribute this system to making me much smarter. It has been an invaluable investment.')
