He deals with rats and mice with a high powered air gun with a well calibrated scope and sufficient skill that he&#x27;s able to kill them quickly with one shot. He&#x27;s killed something like a hundred over the last couple of years.<p>If you are willing to kill the rats and mice instead of just drive them away somehow, then taking up shooting as an additional hobby might be worth considering.<p>I&#x27;ve ruled it out because I don&#x27;t really want to kill them, and also in my feeding area there is no good spot to take a shot from where a miss would not potentially go somewhere I really do not want it to go.')
