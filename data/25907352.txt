Yep.<p>I have been following the Pandora situation with the UK at the time, it the mess was directly linked to the second guy who supported the project and bailed out with the pre-order money (allegedly). EvilDragon, who is now leading the Pyra development efforts, has always been very transparent about what&#x27;s happening since day 1 on the development of the Pyra: explaining in details all technical issues found, and how long their suppliers would take to react with a new version of the board, the mold, or other parts.<p>Hardware development takes time and they have very few people working on that project, and most of that work is part time. So any issue resolution takes 10x longer than what you would expect in a typical project as well.')
