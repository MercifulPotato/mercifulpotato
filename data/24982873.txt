The willingness to rollback a claim you made, ambitious or mundane, is surprisingly difficult for people to do.  Most of science is about making claims based on the best evidence that you have with some level of confidence.<p>Where we run into problems, just look in the news, is when claims become invariant, regardless of new data, methods, theories.')
