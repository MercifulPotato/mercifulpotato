I guess perhaps you are talking about geographically distributed nodes that have slow pipes between them?<p>But in any case, yeah, there&#x27;s a bizarre tendency for humans to want to latch on to hard and fast rules. I&#x27;ve heard things like &quot;don&#x27;t join more than 3 tables together&quot;, and you encountered at your workplace a rule that sql updates should only affect a single row at a time. Many workplaces have such farcical restrictions, resulting in behaviours like the allegorical monkeys in the room (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;workingoutloud.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-five-monkeys-experiment-with-a-new-lesson" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;workingoutloud.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-five-monkeys-experiment-...</a>).<p>My theory - small children go through a phase where they love to know what the rules are and they love to set down rules for others. Some people never grow out of that, and they hold a worldview where everything would be OK as long as everyone followed the rules. And if for some reason that didn&#x27;t work, then all you have to do is to add some more rules. Such people may not be the most creative but they cling fiercely to their rule-based approach to life. Since it&#x27;s always easier to add rules rather than remove them, a poorly managed organisation can find itself trussed up tightly in these rules and an all around rubbish place to work where everything takes forever.<p>While that covers the prevalence of rules such as &quot;no SQL statement may update &gt;1 row&quot;, you also ask why people may tend not to use features such as referential integrity in avant garde databases such as Spanner et al. Personally, I would avoid using such features if only because they are so challenging to engineer and are likely to contain bugs for a few months or years as they are bedded in. That&#x27;s especially true once a system is under heavy usage and the impacts of any issues are enormous. It&#x27;s easier to just keep on doing whatever you are already doing.')
