To summarize, Freedom House metrics are completely qualitative and subjective. They have not published the &quot;raw data&quot; for the last two years of rankings. Raw data here means their subjective rankings for the various criteria which they then combine into one metric. Poppycock of the partisan kind being marketed as objective truth. Makes me cringe that I even used to believe in it. Freedom House raises $30,000,000 annually from Donors to create these metrics. Ask yourself what they are selling (alarmism: &quot;Freedom is in danger&quot;) and to whom (donors).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24577995" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24577995</a>')
