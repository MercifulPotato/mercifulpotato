Things like alt+arrow keys&#x2F;holding shift for selections, cmd+up&#x2F;down for start and end, and the rest. These combinations are often composable for selection, so cmd+shift+up should select to the beginning of the document. These work in my text editor, text fields in every app, Notes, TextEdit, etc, but they often fail in subtle ways in Notion.')
