It doesn&#x27;t work for non-programmers. The complexity of &quot;Z = X + Y&quot; is no more or less than &quot;ADD X TO Y GIVING Z&quot;, and bugs will happen at the same rate with either syntax. The added verbosity will only annoy you.<p>Another myth surrounding COBOL is that as its programmers age, there is a lack of them and therefore COBOL jobs are high-paying and you should learn it to make good money. The reality: I&#x27;ve never met a really wealthy COBOL programmer -- or rather, one who was wealthy <i>because</i> he&#x2F;she knew COBOL. That&#x27;s not where the money is. COBOL jobs are not particularly well-paying, and there are young people learning it, and no, they don&#x27;t get awesome paychecks.')
