It&#x27;s not like the &quot;majority&quot; vilified by the media is the army of clones. If you look closer, you&#x27;ll see that someone is shy, someone else can&#x27;t tolerate loud sounds, others get stage fright, or have a whiny voice, or an asymmetric face or whatever. It just used to be that people would focus on their strong sides, and find something useful they could bring to the table based on them, so others would respect them regardless of their weaknesses, and everyone was happy. But now we are celebrating the demise of merit, standardization of a human-hour billed at a minimum wage, and are spending most of our time fighting over who&#x27;s a bigger victim.')
