For some types of plant, a variety means a population that is a stable and has similar characteristics, and you can grow these from seed, and they will generally look like their parent plants.<p>Apples are not like that. Each plant grown from seed is vastly different from the mother plant, and you don&#x27;t even know what the father plant is, because it could be an apple, a crab apple, a quince, etc. Most of these random plants are useless for fruit. And so, for apples we use the name &quot;variety&quot; to mean clones of one single plant. So, all &quot;bramley&quot; apple trees are clones of the original bramley apple tree in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, UK. This is done by taking a cutting of the tree, and grafting it onto a specially grown root.<p>So when someone says they have found a new variety of apple, what they actually mean is that they found an apple tree that grew from seed, and it actually looks and tastes nice, and therefore might be worth cloning and spreading around the world.')
