But if the attack is targeted, then we&#x27;re back to SMS being vulnerable.<p>So, what it comes down to is 2nd email as 2FA is more secure and more efficient than SMS out of the gate... (and much cheaper)...<p>And, if I use a very obscure and otherwise not used email (with its own security + strong password), even a targeted attack has no better chance than a ToTP app on an offline device, like an iPod touch.<p>So:<p>- 1st.) ToTP on offline device (most secure, most expensive, most difficult to learn, hard to use),<p>- 2nd.) 2nd email (can be most secure, cheapest, easiest to learn, easiest to use), and<p>- 3rd.) SMS (least secure, mid-expensive, mid-learnability, mid-usability).<p>Why didn&#x27;t we all default to 2nd email then, instead of SMS as a paradigm? Actually, was used, and still used by Gmail from the beginning (even in conjunction with ToTP now)...')
