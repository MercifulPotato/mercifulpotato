Item(by='delecti', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606574554, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25234689, text='I didn&#x27;t mean to imply that the particular cultures of the various social media websites are &quot;toxic&quot;, they&#x27;re just all different. Each site has their own style of talking, peculiar grammar rules, appropriate topics, and memes, and all of those things exist on HN too, at least to some extent.<p>HN post topics are restricted, usually to technical stories or less controversial political topics. Comments tend to be precisely worded, and are often more pedantic. Because of how linking works (or rather doesn&#x27;t), citations often use a particular format. Comedy is generally discouraged, though is accepted more if (like in Traster&#x27;s top-level comment in this thread) there&#x27;s also &quot;legitimate&quot; point attached. If that comment hadn&#x27;t included the second paragraph, it would probably have been downvoted. All of that is part of the culture of HN, and I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily call any of it toxic. Some of it follows directly from the site rules and moderation, some follows from the technical limitations of the site, and some just emerges from the sorts of people who happen to use the site.')
