Rather than set rules for a level playing field it seeks to dictate outcomes. Telling payment providers that they can’t exceed 30% of total payments is as absurd as telling Apple or Samsung to not exceed 30% of the smartphone market.<p>They’re supposed to stop selling or rate limiting when they’re reaching their cap?<p>I’d love to get the input of the blind devotees of the supposedly pro business Prime Minister of India. There’s no shortage of you lot on HN. Could you please explain how making an app stop working in the best interests of Indian consumers?<p>But please don’t try “The central bank is independent” as an explanation. No one believes that, least of all you.')
