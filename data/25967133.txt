If we couldn&#x27;t tell them apart.<p>There must also be limits to perception or resolution. Are our eyes even able to tell the difference between FHD, 2K and 4K on a 15&quot; screen?<p>I tested FHD vs 4K on a 31&quot; screen and could not are a difference when watching a 10 minute video (I had 2 screens side by side for reference).<p>On a semi related note. I also tried watching 60fps videos at 60Hz vs 144Hz (again side by side) to test out my new screen. No difference. Even fast moving things.<p>I really feel like either I just don&#x27;t perceive these things and it&#x27;ll keep more money in my wallet, or that I&#x27;m not alone and everybody can save money. A chart of when differences actually become perceptible would be great. It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me I&#x27;d the threshold for 4K were 42&quot;, 10bit only in grays and fps at a certain pixel per second movement speed.')
