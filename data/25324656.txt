A black polyurethane couch could catch the rays of a H-Bomb fireball 100 kilometers array and within 15 seconds create a fireball in the room.  Details like that create a lot of uncertainty about causalities.<p>Closer to home your Fire Marshall could demonstrate for you why you should not smoke in bed or what happens to a car when you light the passenger seat with a Zippo.<p>Common natural materials have safety properties against fire.  For instance,  if I got too close to a fire,  a wool sweater would form a char,  &quot;ablating&quot; like the Apollo spacecraft heat shield.  An acrylic sweater would melt and probably transfer more heat to my skin and make it more likely that I get burned,  if it doesn&#x27;t ignite itself.')
