Who’s getting sacrificed for whom. Are we just going to tell thousands at a danish scale and millions at a global scale tough luck but at least you’ll have a shot at eeking out a subsistence level livelihood for your family. The smallest minority on earth is the individual and a civilisation that exists on the basis of overt human sacrifice isn’t one I and many others will abide by. This sounds a bit melodramatic but I’ve seen the toll it’s taken on family members this year who’ve lost a year of turnover in their small business. If the powers that be continue to throw these people under the bus they will have a fight on their hands and then we won’t even fix climate change probably the other way around.')
