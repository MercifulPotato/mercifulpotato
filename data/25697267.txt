Item(by='rangoon626', descendants=None, kids=[25697637], score=None, time=1610168387, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25697046, text='&gt; Nah, the right trusts everything the tv and radio hosts tell them.<p>I don&#x27;t agree. The media, as a whole, leans left. Except for comparatively far fewer right leaning news outlets. I don&#x27;t think I can name a single newspaper that doesn&#x27;t have a left slant. LA Times, NY Times, WashPo are the giants, plus any of your local city newspapers. People on the right are not likely to trust any of those entities.<p>For news stations there&#x27;s CNN, NBC, ABC, which all lean left. For the right, there&#x27;s Fox and a couple a low-key bum ones like OANN and NewsMax. Again, right leaning people are likely to view most of tv media sources as untrustworthy.')
