Nothing to me has demonstrated this more than the reaction to the pandemic. When you are so uneducated that you think a mask won’t help prevent a disease that is spread via respiratory droplets, that is a big problem and unfortunately those people are all sitting ducks. Of course many won’t believe the doctors when they don’t have the capacity to understand even the basic concept?<p>Maybe the problem is they spent too much time listening to the apparently sub-100 IQ public health establishment in March?')
