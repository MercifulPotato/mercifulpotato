Safari sucks ass. I use it only because it offers the best battery longevity, but that&#x27;s it.<p>The devtools are horrendous, the text selection is extremely bad (example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;qC7amU1.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;qC7amU1.png</a>), extension support is awful (I only use AdGuard and LastPass and both are bad, I needed to install apps just to use them, and they frequently don&#x27;t autostart).<p>It&#x27;s also the only remaining browser that sometimes has plain wrong rendering of elements.')
