It may look from the outside that a person have everything, but from that person&#x27;s point of view they have nothing.<p>Why? Here&#x27;s the story from a few years back. A guy has a nice banking career, lots of money (at least compared to most of his peers), wife, kid, nice house in addition to the apartments in the city.<p>One day the whole family (grandparents too) go to the said house for a weekend. At some point the guy walks away from his relatives, goes down the stairs to the basement and blows this head away with a gun.<p>Everyone starts asking one question - why? Dude had everything most people can dream of. Wealth, car, house etc.<p>But for some reason people can&#x27;t see on simple thing. He never really wanted this. He wanted to be a baker. He&#x27;d like to bake cakes for kids and play guitar in the evening or something. But he simply couldn&#x27;t escape his current life and he didn&#x27;t want any of this.')
