Six billion in green infrastructure over four years turned into five billion over five years. The revenue-neutral tax changes (lowered taxes for the poor, raised taxes for the rich) resulted in a small net decrease in taxes (The Tories, who hated that tax policy should be cheering for this - but instead, they are complaining that he didn&#x27;t raise taxes for the rich enough!)<p>On the other hand, things like &#x27;end subsidies for the fossil fuel industry&#x27; had zero work done on them.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t grouse too much about the first category of promises - especially when the CPC didn&#x27;t want to take <i>any</i> action on any of those items. A half-assed implementation that gets most of the way to the finish-line is one thing.<p>I would grouse quite heavily about the <i>second</i> category of promises. And about the mountain of corruption scandals that the Liberals are finding themselves in.<p>All things considered, though, I would not expect this <i>particular</i> pledge to be carried out successfully. Expect an avalanche of money to be dumped into the laps of Telus, Bell, and Shaw.')
