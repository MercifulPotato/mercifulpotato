Item(by='rhn_mk1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604216423, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24953739, text='&gt; Legal consequences are facts, morals are values, they are different things. There is no necessary connection between law and what is right, cf. nazi germany, ussr, aztec human sacrifice, etc.<p>But consequences come from judgements, and judgements reflect values. Therefore law, like morality, necessarily includes values.<p>&gt; There is no necessary connection between law and what is right<p>As a moral relativist, I would say that because law defines morality, it makes right by definition. But at the same time, there are many moralities, and so, many rights.<p>&gt; Iâ€™m not sure where your confusion lies.<p>It&#x27;s that the author decided to take a stance already, and I&#x27;m not finding a good justification for one over the other.<p>&gt; The author opposes licenses which seek to apply the rules of property to intangible items<p>Perhaps here lies the crux: nothing in the four freedoms seems to me like a license or rule of property, because none of them enforce scarcity. I got an impression that the author didn&#x27;t oppose them on those grounds, but I might be misreading.<p>&gt; Not all immoral behavior should be prohibited with the coercive power of the state.<p>But this is the value judgement I&#x27;m questioning. Apart from situations where it would be destabilizing due to different values of the people, why not? And since the article already lays out two fully destabilizing options, why not choose the option that aligns with their values better?')
