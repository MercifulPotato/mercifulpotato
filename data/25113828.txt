The RIAA was alleging that the purpose of youtube-dl is to circumvent DRM and they try to back this statement up by pointing out that copyrighted works are being downloaded in the test cases.<p>Here is a bit of a discussion about it by seemingly knowledgeable people:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;law.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;57421&#x2F;is-youtube-dl-takedown-due-to-their-tests-which-use-copyrighted-content" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;law.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;57421&#x2F;is-youtube-dl-...</a><p>&gt; &gt;     the source code expressly suggests its use to copy and&#x2F;or distribute the following copyrighted works owned by our member companies:\n&gt; &gt;     Icona Pop – I Love It (feat. Charli XCX) [Official Video], owned by Warner Music Group Justin Timberlake – Tunnel Vision (Explicit), owned by Sony Music Group Taylor Swift – Shake it Off, owned&#x2F;exclusively licensed by Universal Music Group<p>&gt; Complainants are &quot;confused&quot; about actual infringement (which is prohibited by copyright law), and creating a method for infringing copyright. Under DMCA and US copyright law, copying is infringing, programming is not infringing. The complaint does not clearly allege unauthorized copying of another person&#x27;s intellectual property, and their complaint is based on the theory that certain programming actions constitute copyright infringement. I don&#x27;t actually think they are confused, I think they are testing the boundaries.')
