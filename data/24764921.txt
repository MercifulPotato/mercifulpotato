I know from first-hand experience that a small organization doesn&#x27;t need the bureaucratic bloat that larger organizations rely upon to manage their sheer size and such bloat is actively harmful and counterproductive below a certain size.<p>I&#x27;ve already got a limited selection of free resources on the site that could be used today by small communities who think what I am doing is of interest to them. I hope to attract Patreon supporters who think this is simply a good idea. I plan to decide for myself what kinds of limited services to offer.<p>I have no plans to play by the current set of &quot;rules.&quot; I think they are broken on the face of it, which is why this market is so badly underserved.<p>It&#x27;s an experiment. It&#x27;s okay if it fails. I also do resume work for $50&#x2F;page (usually for tech professionals who found me via HN), freelance writing and already have some Patreon money for the assortment of homeless websites and the like that I already run which will be used to support this effort.<p>If this takes off, yay!
