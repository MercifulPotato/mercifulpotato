Item(by='nomel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608754207, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25521282, text='&gt; instagram drives a good percentage of camera upgrades, sadly.<p>How is that sad? People who enjoy a social networking site mostly about photos need cameras. Making a purchase based on real world examples of something that you find interesting&#x2F;enjoy is not a negative thing. The capabilities of the new phone cameras are often very noticeable and very different, especially recently with low light, wide angle, good HDR, and portrait modes, which could only be found in dedicated cameras, which these people are not interested in. That&#x27;s the progression and normalization of &quot;high tech&quot;. That&#x27;s fine.')
