That will include cookie-equivalents like local storage. In fact, because it covers &quot;reading&quot; separate from &quot;writing,&quot; it also includes reading browser settings like user-agent string or location&#x2F;language headers, and 99% of fingerprinting techniques.<p>Cookies require consent unless they are <i>essential to the service</i> that was requested by the user. The canonical example is using a cookie to manage a user&#x27;s shopping cart on an ecommerce site. Shopping is what the user has requested to do, a cookie (or moral equivalent) is basically necessary to do that, no consent required.<p>By extension, denying cookies is a positive action taken by the user directing the site to alter its behavior. If a cookie is needed to perform that task, it&#x27;s allowed even if cookie consent has otherwise been denied.')
