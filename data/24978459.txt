They are easy to catch, and the simplicity of the tax scheme allows collectors to focus on this one loophole.<p>- It&#x27;s simple to collect: Ask all the banks for everyone&#x27;s statement, and apply a percentage to their calendar year&#x27;s income. You could even deduct tax when people deposit money.<p>- It&#x27;s simple to forecast and calculate: Everyone knows how much tax they owe, and knows how much tax they will owe.<p>- It&#x27;s progressive: The more people make the more they pay. Property tax, sales tax, gas tax, etc. all disproportionately affect people with less money.')
