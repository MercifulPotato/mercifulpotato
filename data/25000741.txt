Having a RFC number doesn&#x27;t mean that a document is or isn&#x27;t standards track. IOW all IETF standards are RFCs, but not all RFCs are standards or proposed standards.<p>The &quot;request for comments&quot; title of the series does remind us of the collegial and unbureucratic roots of the IETF, vowing to reject kings, presidents and voting &amp; believing in rough consensus plus running code etc :) however in the standards track case there is no rfc number assigned to the doc in the draft phase, it&#x27;s instead published in the separate internet-drafts directory by the working group and goes through all kinds of process and iteration before getting published as a proposed standard RFC.<p>See eg <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Internet_Standard" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Internet_Standard</a>')
