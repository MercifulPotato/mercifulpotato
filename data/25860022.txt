At least the parts you mention Experimental XEPs let people experiment. The compliance suites provide a single spec controlled by a committee. And the differences don&#x27;t matter when the user experience is the same.<p>XEP-0027 OpenPGP has been officially obsolete for Matrix&#x27;s entire life. XEP-0374 OpenPGP never went past experimental. It was officially deferred 3 years ago. OMEMO is the only proposal active.<p>The compliance suites tell you what you need for file transfer. Core requires XEP-0363 for file upload. Advanced requires XEP-0234 and XEP-0261 for direct transfer. You can ignore the experiments.<p>Figuring out what features 2 clients share can be confusing with either protocol. Looking at Matrix&#x27;s clients matrix[1] is easier than finding a list of XEPs for each client. But you still have to figure out what the server supports and what it doesn&#x27;t have to.<p>The real difference is how 1 company dominates the Matrix ecosystem.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;clients-matrix&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;clients-matrix&#x2F;</a>')
