Rather than elevate their &quot;untermensch&quot;, their egos drive them to exercise control.<p>If you can&#x27;t educate people to separate fact from fiction, that is ultimately the fault of intellectuals.  It&#x27;s one thing to teach facts in school and leave out the nonsense, but deplatforming unpopular ideas is a form of control over individuals.  Where does it stop?  Do we create a standard where web hosts, ISPs, deplatform ideas outside the overton window?  What kind of precedent is that?')
