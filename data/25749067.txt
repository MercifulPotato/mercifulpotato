For my relatively small hobby-project (3Gbit&#x2F;s image gallery) we’re renting bare-metal servers for $800&#x2F;mo — cloud providers would be charging $50,000 just for bandwidth, let alone compute and storage…<p>(Incidentally if anybody knows good CDNs with prices in the same ballpark as bare-metal I’d love to hear it - looks like we’re too big for any of cloudflare’s entry-level plans, but their enterprise support doesn’t want to bother with any customer spending less than $3,000&#x2F;mo...)')
