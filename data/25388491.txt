My grandparents died around ~95 but life expectancy at that time was probably lower than ~40. My grandmother had 4 kids who died very young (around 1-2 years of age) and that skews the numbers significantly.<p>We are baby-sitting lots of adults that couldn&#x27;t make it past 1-3 years old of age before the medical revolution.
