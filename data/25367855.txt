Always wanted to move to the USA as well, but my life&#x27;s route took me elsewhere :)  (although I &#x2F;did&#x2F; once launch a rocket with the MARS team in Black Rock desert in 2001 in an attempt to break the UK amateur rocketry record!

The Belly Flop manoeuvre... wowsers!<p>I&#x27;m content now at 51 to watch you and the rest of the SpaceX team make history.<p>Do awesome stuff!')
