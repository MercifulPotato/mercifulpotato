It&#x27;s designed for storing the changes made to files over time.<p>But hey, if there&#x27;s a different kind of database that you think would be better here, I&#x27;d be fascinated to see it. Just make sure that it can<p>1. handle major structural changes to the files being tracked (e.g. JSON schema revisions)<p>2. store and retrieve these changes as efficiently as git<p>3. do the above with as little work required by the user<p>Good luck!')
