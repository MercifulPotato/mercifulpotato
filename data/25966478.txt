I was in high school at the time. It was designed for an Orthodontist who wanted to input (using a tablet with a cross-hair &quot;mouse&quot;) about 20 points from an X-ray of a patient&#x27;s head, then perform some calculations on the geometry to predict how the jaw bones and teeth were going to develop as the patient gets older.<p>To this day I think it&#x27;s the most interesting and satisfying thing I&#x27;ve ever done in terms of software. Despite getting a Ph.D. in computer science and working for Amazon, Microsoft, and Cray, nothing even comes close, with the exception of one project at Microsoft Research. These days I&#x27;ve given up completely any hope of working on something even remotely interesting or satisfying.')
