I broadly agree. I didn&#x27;t mean for my post to be a &quot;python is great really&quot;, It was more to illustrate that all programming languages have drawbacks.<p>The is a points that I think I&#x27;ve failed to get over:<p>&gt; Just as C isn&#x27;t the problem, it&#x27;s the programmer forgetting to check for the size of the buffer, and PHP isn&#x27;t the problem, it&#x27;s the programmer not using the correct function for random number generation<p>I don&#x27;t think I was arguing that point. of course all languages have their USP.  My point I wanted to get across is that large python projects are not inherently hard to manage. That kind of scaling is really not that much of an issue. I&#x27;ve worked on large repos for  C, C++, python, perl, node and as a punishment, php. The only language that had an issue with a large codebase was node, because it was impossible to build and manage security. The &quot;solution&quot; to that was to have thousands of repos hiding in github.<p>The biggest impediment to growth was people refusing to read code, followed swiftly by pointless abstractions. This lead to silly situations where there were 7-12(!) wrappers for s3 functions. none of them had documentation and only one had test coverage.')
