Item(by='chrismorgan', descendants=None, kids=[25526080, 25525291], score=None, time=1608787076, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25520655, text='The 48×48 recommendation is bogus. I can’t think of a single thing that actually uses it at that size any more, and it doesn’t scale evenly to 32×32, which is used much more. (<i>“I recommend sticking to a single 48×48 image, unless the one you have doesnt downscale well to 16×16 and 32×32 (becomes blurry, for instance)”</i>, quoth the article; 32×32 will become blurry from a 48×48 downscale <i>every single time</i>.) That recommendation from Microsoft to include a 48×48 icon is from about ten years ago. The current recommendation from Microsoft is not to use IE.<p>16×16 and 32×32 are far more important as they’re used far more—most notably, tab bars normally show icons at 16×16, which is commonly 32×32 on high-DPI displays (assuming a scaling factor of 2×). And those small sizes are also where you want to be the most careful about the rendering.<p>I like to craft precise 16×16 and 32×32 icons, and then generally jump straight up to 256×256 or 512×512 and let anything that wants larger than 32×32 downscale from that. (I used to go for &#x2F;favicon.ico containing 16, 32 and 256, even though that bloated the file size by a handful of kilobytes, but now I’m more likely to go for &#x2F;favicon.ico containing 16 and 32, and a PNG containing 256 or 512 or perhaps just shifting to SVG at this point.)<p>Fun fact: just as the ICO format lets you have completely distinct images for distinct sizes, an SVG file can contain multiple images for different sizes by the use of media queries; for example, you could show a tweaked icon at 16×16 and another at 32×32, and something else at all other sizes, while omitting some tiny detail below 64×64, and replacing the icon with icon-and-brand-name above 128×128. Just be aware that the media query will be matching <i>device</i> pixels rather than CSS pixels, which may or may not be what you’d like.<p>Caution should also be exercised with the prefers-color-scheme media query on SVG icons. It does <i>not</i> reflect whether the icon is being displayed on a light or dark background. (prefers-color-scheme: dark) hints that your icon is <i>probably</i> being displayed against a dark background, but it could easily still be being displayed against a light background; and with (prefers-color-scheme: light) it will be quite common for the icon to be being displayed against a dark background. You need to carefully design your icon so it works well against almost any background colour.')
