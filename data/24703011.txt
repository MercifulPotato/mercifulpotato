If this option is not enabled, much badness happens if you run 32 bit binaries, for instance, Steam and many 32 bit native linux games fail to run. (I ran into this problem a few weeks ago)<p>32 bit linux applications <i>can</i> use 64 bit time_t if they were configured to do so and glibc and the kernel are new enough. But enough closed source binaries don&#x27;t support 64 bit time_t that we&#x27;ll probably have problems in 2038.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cateee.net&#x2F;lkddb&#x2F;web-lkddb&#x2F;COMPAT_32BIT_TIME.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cateee.net&#x2F;lkddb&#x2F;web-lkddb&#x2F;COMPAT_32BIT_TIME.html</a>')
