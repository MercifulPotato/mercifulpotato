Joe Biden was conducting official business in China on behalf of the US government, his son, Hunter, followed him like a dog to China and was involved in business deals worth billions of dollars with the CCP. Also, Kamala Harris&#x27; husband is a lobbyist for the CCP.<p>Foreign governments, whether it&#x27;s the CCP and Hunter Biden, or Saudi Arabia and Hilary Clinton, know exactly what they&#x27;re paying for and what corrupt officials and family members are selling, since that&#x27;s their own MO.<p>Given the above, you have to be nuts to vote Democrat at the national level - they&#x27;re literally traitors.<p>(What people missed with the Trump&#x2F;Russia probe was that Trump was influenced by buyers of his condos who bought as part of US visa schemes. Not sure why that wasn&#x27;t highlighted, instead of the nebulous &quot;Russia helped win the election.&quot;, which doesn&#x27;t seem likely to be material.)')
