No-one was like &quot;OMG they stopped making super nintendo games.&quot; or &quot;OMG no more sega genesis games&quot; when those platforms were end of lifed.<p>This is the same thing. Your existing games continue to work. You existing console continues to work. You&#x27;re just not going to get an endless supply of new stuff for it.<p>I agree the lack of disk based games kills the ability to share and resell but that&#x27;s a separate issue, and i&#x27;d like to think that we can all agree at this point that physical media is &quot;a dead man walking&quot; regardless of how we feel about that.')
