Even if every single piece of tether out there was fraudulent, it would only have a tiny impact on bitcoin.<p>People downplay bitcoin because it can&#x27;t be used as cash.  It&#x27;s not supposed to be.  It&#x27;s a store of value.  And, in a world where fiat currency is being printed endlessly like monopoly money, there&#x27;s really only 2 asset classes left: Stocks and Bitcoin, and maybe gold.  Do you really want to put ALL your money in equities?  No, and neither does anyone else.  People want diversification.  And Bitcoin, is a great way to diversify your portfolio with a store of wealth.<p>People call it a ponzi scheme.  but, it&#x27;s just metcalf&#x27;s law.  the usefulness of a network is based on the size and amount of participants.  is facebook a ponzi scheme?  is the US dollar a ponzi scheme?  if no one believed in the dollar then it wouldn&#x27;t be worth anything either -&gt; Just ask all the countries with failed fiat currencies who underwent a period of hyper inflation.  I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s going to happen to the US dollar.  but, i&#x27;m saying, fiat money requires people to have faith in the US dollar, just as people are now gaining faith in bitcoin.  that&#x27;s not a ponzi scheme, that&#x27;s called Network effects.<p>This is not 2017.  2017 was a period when people in their underwear were speculating on bitcoin.  there&#x27;s 2 types of bitcoin investors: the hodlers (which know what bitcoin is for and hold it for almost forever), then there&#x27;s the speculators.  It just happened that in 2017 very few people understood bitcoin&#x27;s purpose and so 80% of it was speculators and 20% hodlers.  This year in 2020, the perentage of buy and hold investors is much greater, which means the drop from the top will be much less than last time.  there will always be some speculators, but as bitcoin ages, the percentage of hodlers to speculators increases and thus these large price spikes will also decrease.')
