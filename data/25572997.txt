One thing to point out though, is that under zero tolerance policies, some victims who do have the <i>ability</i> to defend themselves  are forced to work within a regulatory framework that would severely punish them for doing so, to the point that being the victim of a bully is less harmful or more tolerable than being a victim of the system. Likewise, those who don&#x27;t have the ability to defend themselves would be less motivated to learn those skills if they know the system would punish them (why learn it if you&#x27;re not allowed to use it?).')
