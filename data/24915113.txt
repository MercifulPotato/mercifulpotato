Like half of all YC companies are using it to build their marketing sites now.<p>I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s <i>much</i> faster to completely redesign your site over time with Webflow than with some custom built static site. In fact, I&#x27;d say things have flipped. I think whatever esoteric Node Package Mess, shit hot CSS framework and clunky headless CMS you&#x27;re using today will be the thing that ages poorly over time.')
