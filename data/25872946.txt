Your Windows PC was locked down with all kinds of proprietary file formats and restrictive licenses, and wide open to malware. <i>But hey, you could change the colors of your title bars and stuff.</i> Was that really &quot;empowerment?&quot;<p>I mean, yes, changing your window colors is orthogonal to licenses and security and such.
