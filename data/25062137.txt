The two issues I had - not everything runs on Arm (yet) and memory constraints were tough to work with.<p>My second cluster - 4 Atomic Pis. The (Intel Atom) quad cores were fine but the 2GB of memory was a real problem when I started playing with more interesting workloads.<p>The current &quot;production&quot; home cluster is 4 old laptops. They&#x27;re earlier gen i7s and I&#x27;ve dropped 16GB of memory and 1TB spinning disks in each one. I&#x27;ve never been happier with a cluster. I&#x27;ve been free to spin whatever I want up and it just works. Using RKE to setup Kubernetes takes about 5 minutes to build a cluster and I&#x27;m using Longhorn for replicated container native storage. I&#x27;ve run experiments for work and my own experience. Whether its Redis &#x2F; Cassandra cluster or a Kubernetes Operator I wrote, it can always handle it.')
