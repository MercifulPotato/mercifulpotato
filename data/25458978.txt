The vendor says &quot;The street price on this item is $100, but we can get them for $95. We can get it to your customer for $97 and give you $1, or $98 and give you $2&quot;. Robinhood takes the $2, other brokerages don&#x27;t, and Robinhood (crucially) lies about it, at which point the SEC gets mad.')
