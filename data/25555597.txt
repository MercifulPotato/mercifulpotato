Pu-238 is hot, that&#x27;s why it can be used for a RTG.  That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s frying you.<p>And it doesn&#x27;t release more radiation than a bomb.  Pu-238 is an alpha emitter--and alpha emitters can only hurt you if they get inside your body (or from simple heat--pick up one of those rods and you&#x27;ll get burnt just like if you picked up any other hot piece of metal.)  The decay product is U-234, also an alpha emitter and with a quarter of a million year half life.<p>Likewise, it&#x27;s Pu-239 contaminant is an alpha emitter and decays to U-235, likewise an alpha emitter, this time with a half life of three quarters of a billion years.<p>You also don&#x27;t understand about half lives--you get one decay per atom.  If one isotope has a half life a thousand times as long as another you get one thousandth as many decays per second and thus one thousandth the radioactivity per unit of time.<p>A bomb converts material with a long half life into material with short half lives and thus greatly increases the amount of radioactivity.')
