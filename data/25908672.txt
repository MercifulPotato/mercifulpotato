Item(by='DigiDigiorno', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611607859, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25907434, text='I can&#x27;t speak to the writer&#x27;s opinion, but there are plenty of us who prefer drivers who speak our language fluently, follow hyenic norms, and follow a dress code that is workplace appropriate. You do not need to be an immigrant to be deficient of these norms. In fact, as far as personal personnel anecdotes go, I do not see more inappropriate attire or a lack of hygiene from them compared to anyone else in other service industries.<p>When I lived in a smaller city in a different state, a large percent of the taxi drivers were from a specific country and did not know English very well. The details of a taxi trip are communicated orally, so this was quite inconvenient. A lack of hygiene and clean clothes isn&#x27;t a deal breaker or anything, but it certainly feels out of place in a service with an expected tip. (I think the hygiene&#x2F;dress issue is more based on the lack of standards in the taxi companies, especially when they have a monopoly on the service--even the cars were unkempt.)<p>I&#x27;m now in Florida with the option to Uber. I never have a problem with non-English speaking Uber drivers. 99% of the time, everything material is communicated through the app, 1% of the time, we have fun trying to communicate whatever small detail needs to be discussed.<p>TLDR: No idea if the writer is being nationalistic, but I feel the taxi industry I experienced was sub-standard and the workers were actually less hygienic, while Uber doesn&#x27;t have that problem and makes it easier to work with those who do not speak your preferred language.')
