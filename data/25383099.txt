Here, &#x27;thought of&#x27; is quite literal and is allowed to contradict facts. There is no need for real or even just virtual children to be involved.<p>So if you draw a hentai image of someone who is 18, or 20, or 25, but could also be seen as younger, that&#x27;s illegal. If you&#x27;ve seen hentai, you&#x27;ll know that virtually all of it belongs in this category.<p>Two 17yo vampires having consensual sex would be legal in Germany, but writing a fanfiction about them would be child porn.<p>If you think that&#x27;s batshit crazy, you are right.')
