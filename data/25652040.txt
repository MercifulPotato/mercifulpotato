QAnon and 8chan are connected to the internet through VanwaTech in Washington state.<p>2. VanwaTech&#x27;s sole connection to the internet is DDoS-Guard in Russia.<p>4. DDoS-Guard relies on CoreSite in Los Angeles to provide &quot;more reliable&quot; US access to its sites.<p>Second, how that availability is at risk:<p>1. DDoS-Guard is home to a large number of cybercrime-related sites, and also to Hamas&#x27; online presence.<p>2. Hamas is a Specially Designated Global Terrorist organization (SDGT).<p>3. In the US, it&#x27;s illegal to provide &quot;money, goods or services&quot; to SDGTs, even unknowingly. Penalties are severe.<p>4. Given the risks of being even peripherally involved with SGDTs, CoreSite may choose to stop providing services to DDoS-Guard.<p>5. If CoreSite stops providing services to DDoS-Guard, QAnon and 8chan &quot;may become more difficult to reach.&quot;<p>In other words, DDoS-Guard&#x27;s association with Hamas may cause DDoS-Guard&#x27;s US partner to stop doing business with them, which would make it difficult to access QAnon and 8chan websites.')
