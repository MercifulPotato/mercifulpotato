It is unusual for an investigation to have such an obvious partisan split, so much so that it is impossible not to conclude that the &quot;anti-trust&quot; case is a thin pretext for something else. It reeks of a type of partisan hackery we&#x27;ve seen every time a tech company is forced to testify before Congress. Baseless insinuation that tech companies are staffed by agenda driven liberals who tamper with search results and purge straight white male employees. This narrative is getting stale. Remember when Breitbart &quot;leaked&quot; that employee discussion from within Google the day after the election. Does anyone remember the grifter of the week who was &quot;fired for being right leaning&quot;? They find a new one for every hearing.<p>A major part of the Republican movement is a culture war on us (the median hn reader) and they are scratching around for ways to use the justice system as a cudgel with which to beat us. The obvious subtext is &quot;how dare those uppity elitist California liberals have any sway or economic success. We must drag then down by any means.&quot;<p>Of course a case built on partisan hackery would implode on itself. Sound bites don&#x27;t translate to sound arguments in court.')
