Item(by='Tainnor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610536205, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25753872, text='&gt; I have an interesting anecdote related to this.<p>Please don&#x27;t do that.<p>There is enough knowledge out there about the various kinds of tests (PCR, antibody, antigene) and what they&#x27;re good for and what they&#x27;re not. It&#x27;s perfectly understood that while rapid tests are, well, rapid, they&#x27;re much less precise than PCR testing. However, they are often better than nothing (you can&#x27;t give a PCR test to everyone who wants to visit relatives in a nursing home), so they serve to minimise risk, not to remove it. (They also have a tendency to be more likely to be positive while you&#x27;re actually infectious, which is not the same thing as having symptoms.)<p>I really don&#x27;t think we should be discussing personal anecdotes during a health crisis, when there&#x27;s enough data around that we can actually look at.')
