The strongest advocates for crypto tend to have a lot of wince factor.<p>* The most prominent actual merchants taking crypto first or only (as opposed to a novelty 13th choice between PayPal and money-order-in-an-envelope) are in it because no conventional financial platforms will touch them (Silk Road style stuff, ransomware, etc.).<p>* The &quot;irreversibility&quot; crowd.  The people who are convinced that all their profits are going out the window because of the cost of honouring refunds and chargebacks, and if only we used a payment method that didn&#x27;t support them... normal people tend to classify &quot;the system will make you whole if stolen from&quot; as a feature, not a bug.<p>* The &quot;it&#x27;s independent and self-governing&quot; crowd.  These are the same people who blame their gout on the Federal Reserve and 20 years ago were buying Liberty Dollars.  Money is a tool, and it makes sense to have the tool be bendable to public needs, not dogmatically hard-coded into economic rictus.<p>* The FOMO&#x2F;HODL crowd inherently keeps cryptocurrency from developing legitimacy.  What is a dollar, rouble, or yuan worth?  It&#x27;s how much goods and services you can get for it, and that being relatively stable and predictable allows people to build an economy around it.  Until we get a critical mass of actual commerce occurring in cryptocurrency, we can&#x27;t say &quot;what is a Bitcoin worth&quot; in the same way, and instead we have speculators tossing the value wildly up and down from day to day.')
