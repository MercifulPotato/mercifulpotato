If apps are designed to work primarily with touch, reaching up all the time will negate the value of keyboard and touch pad and <i>will</i> be needlessly fatiguing.<p>Apps need to be designed to accommodate both kinds of usage.<p>Windows gets away with this because most apps are designed as laptop first.<p>By delaying the introduction of the touch screen, Apple is pressuring developers to make their Apps work in both contexts.<p>When they introduce a touch screen they’ll say something like “Back in 2020 most touch apps weren’t designed for the kinds of uses laptop and desktop users expect.  Since then developers have done an amazing job of giving all our our users a great experience.  Thanks in part to their hard work, today we’re proud to introduce the first computer that truly combines what we have learned about how to build great touch apps, with the decades of understanding that has gone into making MacOS into the worlds most advanced desktop operating system.”')
