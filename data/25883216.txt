Good job on the FBI.<p>Remember it&#x27;s a good thing to have phones be pinging.<p>1. I want to be billed correctly<p>2. If my service drops often in a certain geo, I want engineers to be able to pinpoint exactly where the problem is and fix it.<p>3. If I get attacked by a shark, I want to provide breadcrumbs for rescuers to find me.<p>4. If my wife accuses me of going to the arcade, it is important that my dog running in the park with my cell phone in his harness is being properly tracked and creating an alibi for me.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to leave a trail of geo pings, don&#x27;t carry around a device that literally could not work if it didn&#x27;t leave a trail of pings.')
