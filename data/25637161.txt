I recently shifted mine to all a single color and like the look a lot more. It makes the open Thermaltake Core P3 case look quite striking.<p>In terms of the &quot;why&quot; for this kind of thing, I guess if I&#x27;m going to be staring at a computer screen and computer all day, I want it to look interesting.  The P3 case is open with a large glass plate on the front (look it up), and I&#x27;ve got it mounted directly on my wall.  It does nothing for my computer&#x27;s performance, but it makes my time at the computer more pleasant.')
