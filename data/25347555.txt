Just from my exp, I see more dark traits on successful people, albeit it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that people with dark traits are more likely to succeed. Can&#x27;t say if it&#x27;s universal though.<p>I&#x27;d also argue that dark traits linked to social success are more or less born, or heavily influenced by childhood exp (which is essentially &quot;born&quot;), so it&#x27;s kind of difficult to &quot;pick&quot; it up after reaching adulthood.')
