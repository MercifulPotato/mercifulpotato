I mean I&#x27;m sure there are people who find it useful, but to me it&#x27;s one of those &#x27;nice on paper&#x27; things. I think it&#x27;s mostly that you don&#x27;t know how much is hidden away, and you don&#x27;t get a feel for the balance of say the if then and the else part of a decision. I&#x27;ve been working on refactoring a 3000 line single function Fortran 95 program lately, with 6, 7, 8 levels deep loops and if&#x2F;then etc; you&#x27;d think this sort of work would be the prime candidate for folding. In my experience it hasn&#x27;t helped my understanding at all though. &#x27;jump to matching brace&#x27; and &#x27;search under cursor&#x27; along with keeping an eye on the scroll bar work much better for me.')
