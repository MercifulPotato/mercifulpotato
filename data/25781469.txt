Less than 200 ng&#x2F;dl free testosterone and another test to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a bigger issue. Once I started within a couple month I was amazed at how much better I felt than I ever had. Even my 20s. Like vitamin D people need more than you would think and guidelines are too conservative. I could have probably had fewer issue if they would have just juiced me up with this in highschool. Rather than just let me be chronically exhausted.')
