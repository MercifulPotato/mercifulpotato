If you look at Shannon and Wiener using Google&#x27;s ngram viewer, Wiener has always been more &#x27;popular&#x27;. They&#x27;ve been getting closer since the 90s, but it seems absurd to argue that Wiener has been erased in any sort of fashion. If anything, it seems that it&#x27;s in recent times people have started appreciating Shannon.<p>People have been writing more on Norbert Wiener than on Claude Shannon, and I can only assume that it&#x27;s mostly in the context of the information age.<p>To make another comparison: Alan Turing outpaced Shannon in 1976 and is now more than twice as &#x27;popular&#x27; as Wiener.')
