Bringing up the past is unavoidable if its an integral part of the story.<p>This situation is more like reporting on someone who transitioned long ago, didn&#x27;t do anything of note before then, doesn&#x27;t broadcast &quot;trans&quot; as part of their public identity, and yet NYT still felt the need to inform everyone that they used to be a man. We&#x27;d rightly question their motives for that unkindness.')
