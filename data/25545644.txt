Item(by='gravitas', descendants=None, kids=[25546617], score=None, time=1609010226, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25545625, text='I hit the 2000 HN post character limit pretty hard on this, had to delete all line items with &quot;NONE - $0&quot; in them and so forth to squeeze in all the data above.
