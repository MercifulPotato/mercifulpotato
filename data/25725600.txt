Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25725629], score=None, time=1610348252, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25725196, text='&gt; A coup attempt includes illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive.<p>That’s a rather incomplete definition:<p>—quote—<p>Threats to democracy involve officeholders’ abuse of the official powers given to—\nthem within a democracy through the unconstitutional extension of those powers\neither temporally or substantively. This abuse is most dramatic in a coup d’état. The\ntraditional coup occurs when one part of the state attempts to take over other organs\nof the state using force or the threat of force. Because the military represents that\npart of the state meant to control a monopoly of force,3 the military is the most\nfrequent – but not the only – culprit. Other kinds of coups could occur if a head of\ngovernment uses unconstitutional means to dismiss judges who deliver unwelcome\njudgments (what Dr. Mort Halperin calls an “auto-coup”), or to get rid of an\n“uncontrollable” legislature in order to rule by decree instead (another form of autocoup). A distinct but functionally similar threat is of the erosion of democracy, where\nofficials abuse their constitutional powers to take over gradually the powers of other\ninstitutions, as in Zimbabwe.<p>—end-quote—<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eprints.qut.edu.au&#x2F;42605&#x2F;1&#x2F;World_Politics_Review.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eprints.qut.edu.au&#x2F;42605&#x2F;1&#x2F;World_Politics_Review.pdf</a><p>&gt; There are two key components of this definition. The first is that it is illegal. […] But an even more critical aspect of Powell and Thyne’s definition is that it requires the involvement of elites<p>And the attack on the Capitol was both illegal violence and with the involvement of elites, who egged it on because they sought to benefit from it, so what’s your point?')
