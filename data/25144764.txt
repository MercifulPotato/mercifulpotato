More often you&#x27;re probably making a change in one single place in the app, in which case this is incredibly easy, you just make your change where you want. You&#x27;re not slowed down by digging through layers of abstraction cruft and indirection until you find the right place to make the change.<p>If you&#x27;re doing an entire site design refresh, then doing some find and replace isn&#x27;t really that crazy. For something you do relatively infrequently like this (maybe every couple of months or even every couple of years?) it&#x27;s not a big deal if it takes a little bit longer. And likely you&#x27;ll need to look through and test your changes on every page one by one anyway, to make sure you&#x27;re not breaking anything you didn&#x27;t mean to. You&#x27;ll need to do that whether you changed the definition of a css class, or you made a bunch of inline changes, at which point making the actual code edits inline probably isn&#x27;t even the bottleneck.<p>But again, that&#x27;s perhaps a bit extreme of a way to look at it. You will inevitably have some layer of abstraction anyway, something like components or templates or partials, in which to wrap your styles.')
