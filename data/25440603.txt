Once they go multinational, they lose their allegiance to their &quot;native&quot; countries. I don&#x27;t see any evidence of loyalty to their home countries, per se. Not even in the most basic sense of paying their fair due of taxes.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s shocking at all. Every market is free to regulate itself however it sees fit, regardless of what &quot;nationality&quot; players on it have. It&#x27;s interesting hardly anyone blinks an eye when that regulation allows &quot;American&quot; companies to save costs in developing countries but there <i>are</i> complaints when it disadvantages those companies, often for the same kinds of regulation: labour and environmental.')
