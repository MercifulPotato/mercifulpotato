He moved on to ESPN at some point but he has a few anthologies out.<p>In general, if you know what kind of articles to look for, there are some good stories out there by the major players. I really enjoyed the relatively recent (in the grand scheme of things; &quot;totally old&quot; as far as news goes) articles about the rise of wine&#x27;s popularity among NBA players ([1]) and a look into NHL dentists ([2]) on ESPN.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in writers who happen to be writing about sports, this year I got sidetracked from my original to-read list exploring the oeuvre of the late great David Foster Wallace, who has a handful of tennis essays that I thought were fantastic. He&#x27;s such a talented writer that I must recommend you seek out his essay collections individually (A Supposedly Fun Thing I&#x27;ll Never Do Again, Consider the Lobster, and Both Flesh and Not) but if you&#x27;re strictly interested in his tennis essays, they were taken from those three and reprinted in a collection called String Theory. As a taste, the title essay of Both Flesh and Not is readable online (as &quot;Roger Federer as Religious Experience&quot;, [3]).<p>EDIT: this was more directed at the grandparent comment than the parent, but well, hey, all of HN is free to take my recommendations (or not!)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.espn.com&#x2F;nba&#x2F;story&#x2F;_&#x2F;id&#x2F;29517070&#x2F;inside-nba-secret-wine-society" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.espn.com&#x2F;nba&#x2F;story&#x2F;_&#x2F;id&#x2F;29517070&#x2F;inside-nba-secr...</a><p>[2] \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.espn.com&#x2F;nhl&#x2F;story&#x2F;_&#x2F;id&#x2F;27851359&#x2F;the-ugly-gory-bloody-secret-life-nhl-dentists" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.espn.com&#x2F;nhl&#x2F;story&#x2F;_&#x2F;id&#x2F;27851359&#x2F;the-ugly-gory-b...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2006&#x2F;08&#x2F;20&#x2F;sports&#x2F;playmagazine&#x2F;20federer.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2006&#x2F;08&#x2F;20&#x2F;sports&#x2F;playmagazine&#x2F;20fed...</a>')
