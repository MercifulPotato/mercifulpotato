Thanks for pointing this out.<p>My general point still stands though. His initial Linux announcement E-Mail has this line:<p>&gt; It is NOT portable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that&#x27;s all I have :-(.<p>So it wasn&#x27;t very portable at the start. If you complained about it not being portable to different arches (idk which one was available at that time? SPARC? MIPS?), it would have been unfair. Everyone has to start somewhere.')
