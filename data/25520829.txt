When I travel by boat and my phone barely sees one notch of GSM service (not 3G, not even Edge) from the island on the horizon - Telegram is able to send and receive messages. Whatsapp and Slack can&#x27;t even connect for hours after that.<p>Another amazing thing is when I type a message on my phone - I see it on my PC the moment I press Send button. There&#x27;s no visible delay, a perfect Google search effect from 2000-s.')
