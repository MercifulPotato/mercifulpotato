A long time, anyway. It was written in Emacs. Everyone loved it.<p>&gt; People still love it. To this very day, I still have to listen to long stories from our non-technical folks about how much they miss Mailman. I&#x27;m not shitting you. Last Christmas I was at an Amazon party, some party I have no idea how I got invited to, filled with business people, all of them much prettier and more charming than me and the folks I work with here in the Furnace, the Boiler Room of Amazon. Four young women found out I was in Customer Service, cornered me, and talked for fifteen minutes about how much they missed Mailman and Emacs, and how Arizona (the JSP replacement we&#x27;d spent years developing) still just wasn&#x27;t doing it for them.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sites.google.com&#x2F;site&#x2F;steveyegge2&#x2F;tour-de-babel#TOC-Lisp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sites.google.com&#x2F;site&#x2F;steveyegge2&#x2F;tour-de-babel#TOC-...</a>')
