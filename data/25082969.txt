Instead, some are intently hunched over their phones trying to control the way things are perceived by citizens. I&#x27;m not going to even get into the issue with media companies being paid to exploit for them. Just see Brad Parscale as an example.<p>But, government&#x27;s function is to not just communicate with us, but communicate with themselves and work out differences. Instead, many squander that time and are insistent in over-communicating to us via available media channels! The only reason the press over-communicating to us (fake news?) is an issue is because the politicians are over-communicating to us as well. This is because of changes in media technology they are exploiting for profit.<p>Posting on Twitter has ZERO oversight (other than citizens posting to it), which means long term it can only degrade our assembled government and the functions it provides. It is in Twitter&#x27;s best interest for the government, and the hard working people it represents, to continue to over communicate.<p>And, to clarify slightly, I do not intend to communicate that government should not have oversight. Instead, I mean the <i>quality</i> of the public involvement needs to improve. That is not done with too much information. It is done with the right information.')
