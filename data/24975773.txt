It uses the driving force from the potential gradient (aka voltage) built by the proton pump in the first video to spin at ~21,000 rpm and crank out ATP.  I read that your body creates (and then consumes) about its own weight in ATP every day.<p>This channel has a ton of great videos:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;WEHImovies&#x2F;videos" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;WEHImovies&#x2F;videos</a><p>Here&#x27;s one on kinetichore and mitosis (which also shows kinesin and dynein which are comically odd) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IvJrDsRuWxQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IvJrDsRuWxQ</a><p>There&#x27;s a collection of their DNA ones here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7Hk9jct2ozY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7Hk9jct2ozY</a><p>Here&#x27;s another view of the ATP synthesis process that shows the chaos a bit more: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OT5AXGS1aL8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=OT5AXGS1aL8</a><p>When I think of these systematically I just wonder what the intermediate steps were.  The proton pump uses energy to create the potential gradient that ATP synthase runs on.  You can&#x27;t have a proton gradient without the proton pump, and without the proton gradient you don&#x27;t have ATP.  So these two exquisitely complex machines depend on each other and had to evolve together.  It boggles my mind.<p>Edit: Ah! Was looking for this one, sodium potassium pump - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZKE8qK9UCrU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZKE8qK9UCrU</a>  This is how our neurons propagate signals.  They are driven by ATP.')
