Burnout is a real thing but it&#x27;s ridiculously overblown. I get burned out often but it usually only lasts a few days. Successful people mitigate this by taking vacation days, not by deciding to coast through the year.<p>Some people are healthier, happier and thrive through the feeling of productivity - whether it be work, a hobby, or a side project. I&#x27;d say depression is more common with people who don&#x27;t have anything to do.')
