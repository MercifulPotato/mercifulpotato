I know FSF’s stand on “free” vs “open” software. That part is crystal clear to me.<p>This piece confuses me though.<p>It constantly seems to intermix and conflate “open source software” with “proprietary software”.<p>Is that intentional? Do they really mean that? That “open source” software is in no way better than a closed-source, proprietary equivalent? That closed source and permissively licensed software is equivalent?<p>They can’t possibly mean that, can they? Is it perhaps only badly written, and I’m reading too much into this?')
