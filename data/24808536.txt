In C++ it could a simple template used with a memory-mapped file.<p>This is only simpler if you don&#x27;t need to handle read failures. If you want to handle read failures, memory mapping can quickly become way more complicated. You have to install signal handlers and do a complicated dance to correctly handle not having data in some range.')
