In the app startup class there is a method that&#x27;s automatically called by the framework whereby it supplies a services container. In this method you &quot;wire up&quot; your interface-&gt;concrete mappings<p><pre><code>  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\n  {\n      services.AddScoped&lt;IMyDependency, MyDependency&gt;();\n  }\n</code></pre>\nLater on when for e.g. an APIController is instantiated, once you&#x27;ve declare a constructor dependency on IMyDependency, it gets resolved for you automatically and whatever concrete class is mapped to gets created and passed to the constructor.<p>Outside of ASP.Net (console app for example) you can either do this manually, or you can get a ServiceCollection object from the framework, or you ca nuse a 3rd party DI library, etc.<p>Generally speaking if you don&#x27;t configure this correctly you get a pretty simple message telling you that the container could not service the request for an IMyDependency or whatever and then it&#x27;s pretty simple to figure out what you missed in the wire-up.')
