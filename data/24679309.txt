That will of course never happen, but it would make sense to have a language that doesn’t advantage one country member over others given that we all have English as our secondary language.<p>In fact my personal wish would be the standardization on European English, at the same level as UK English, US English, Indian English, etc. and define it as our common EU language, bound to the pan-EU identity.<p>But I’m dreaming :)')
