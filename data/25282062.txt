But if I were doing any scientific programming with common lisp I&#x27;d try to use block compilation in a few select places during interactive development as well. I&#x27;d imagine that for some code this would get rid of a lot of boxing and unboxing as well as type checks, in addition to getting rid of indirection. I&#x27;d not be surprised if you could get an integer factor speed up if you got many small functions which mostly operate on doubles or double arrays. I should probably give it a try just to satisfy my curiosity.')
