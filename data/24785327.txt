I disagree, but set that aside for a moment.<p>We were talking about whether it&#x27;s appropriate to discuss one&#x27;s opinion on the pay gap -- among other things -- at work, despite its being political.  Seems like you&#x27;re saying it is appropriate?  Like, if a woman who reported to you came to you asking for more money to reach parity with a male colleague, I guess you&#x27;d say, &quot;I am a hiring manager etc etc and the emperor has no clothes, here&#x27;s why you make less&quot;?  If you think that&#x27;s OK, then we&#x27;re in agreement on this point that this is an acceptable topic for work.<p>As someone who has managed people myself, I think it would be <i>highly relevant</i> to my business function to know where my fellow managers stand on this issue.')
