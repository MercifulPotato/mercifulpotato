It belongs to your IT department. (Of course everyone knows this, but in the context of this conversation the relevant part is that it&#x27;ll do updates when your IT people dictate, regardless of how convenient it is or isn&#x27;t for you the user.)<p>I imagine there are good reasons in force to update, like security patches. But I&#x27;d be lying if I didn&#x27;t find it frustrating that my work laptop needs to update at what always feels like an inopportune time.<p>In general, when I am prompted about a software update I default to selecting &quot;not now&quot; (I&#x27;ve been refusing Google Photos&#x27; nagging for what feels like forever now).\nWhat does it say about our industry that users have developed an automatic aversion to updates?
