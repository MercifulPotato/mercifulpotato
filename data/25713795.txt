I guess we all know how that goes.<p>I know the problem is complex, but I think the solution to the problem was based on basic human impulses (And very American if I&#x27;d say so myself. Sorry), because simply deplatform the app will not actually convince it&#x27;s users to leave it, it does not educate those people about what&#x27;s right and wrong, and it opened a huge playground for the conspiracy theorist to play around.<p>All around, I think deplatforming is a bad solution to this problem.<p>EDIT: Clarify: I&#x27;m not here to support Parler (not even a bit), and I understand the deplatforming was for the immediate issue. However, I hope those who involved in the decision making could look for a better solution that would convince people to claim down and be rational. That&#x27;s all.')
