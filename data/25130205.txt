Look at this older copyright lawsuit from 2010 about copyright and video games (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MDY_Industries,_LLC_v._Blizzard_Entertainment,_Inc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MDY_Industries,_LLC_v._Blizzar...</a>.)<p>The court ruled that players of the game weren&#x27;t owners, merely license holders. By copying the game to ram, you were bound to the Terms of Use.<p>Replace game with website there and there is a pretty strong case for downloading, parsing (copying) and storing portions (or all of) said site, then displaying portions at a later date alongside advertisements constitutes a ToS violation, and willful infringement on Googles part.<p>In a parallel world where yahoo, lycos, etc rules until 2010 and google is getting started, I think they get into a lot of legal trouble.')
