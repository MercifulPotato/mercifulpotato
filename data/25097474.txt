If you want to develop for iOS you have to get a Mac even if you don&#x27;t want one.<p>Moreover, this behavior is objectionable regardless of market share, because a platform excluding alternative stores segregates that platform into a different market. If you&#x27;re a developer whose <i>customers</i> use a Mac, and Apple starts operating the Mac App Store the same as the iOS one, it doesn&#x27;t matter that they have 10% market share because that 10% of the PC market is 100% of your app customers and the relevant market isn&#x27;t PCs, it&#x27;s app distribution to a given customer base.')
