Driving back from Wilpena Pound recently, google play music stopped working, no  voice control for the drive home. Okay, can deal with that. However, I&#x27;m still yet to find a replacement that will work for me. I have yt music a shot, half an hour later I still couldn&#x27;t get a single correct song to play. Google&#x27;s advances are rapidly pushing me away from using Google products, or even taking higher advantage of ones I already use.')
