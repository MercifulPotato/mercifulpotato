Not a replacement for medication, but a useful tool with or without.<p>I also find bright, flashing lights useful for focus. Think those cheap led bulbs which a prism and motor. I think expensive night club versions would be better, but I’m not willing to drop $100s to find out.<p>I think I might just need stimulation in all forms - visual, audible, physical, chemical - to be at my best.<p>Anyone else experience that?')
