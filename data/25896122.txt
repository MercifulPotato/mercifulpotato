Item(by='voisin', descendants=None, kids=[25896290], score=None, time=1611522874, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25895588, text='&gt; is that how weak-willed the average person has become?<p>Anecdotally, yes. I am regularly surprised to learn that people I know are aware they are (a) wildly out of shape or (b) obviously overweight <i>and</i> know what they need to do and the consequences of not doing so, and <i>still</i> do not take the steps to avoid. I used to think maybe people just weren’t self aware, but the issue is more pernicious - they lack the willpower to change (or, alternatively perhaps they don’t care, but I have a hard time accepting that educated people that I know do not care about their health). Let them off the hook for $1.30&#x2F;meal and I suspect there will be demand from a large portion of the population that can afford it.<p>Side example: I have a family member currently contemplating buying a sauna for the cardiovascular benefits rather than simply going for daily walks for the same benefit.
