I used to make frequent trips by overnight coach between the north of England and Belgium. The coach would make several stops throughout the night, people would come and go, there was a pesky check at the UK&#x2F;France border, etc. It was a dreadful experience (sleep wise) the first couple of times. But after a while I got used to it and just slept through the whole thing. Even managed the pesky border check while half asleep.')
