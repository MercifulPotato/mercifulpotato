That&#x27;s a much larger group than &quot;anyone who reads a specific field&quot;. So the list of clients now is forced to include any and all middleware that may read your proto (imagine a routing layer or some kind of analytics system or whatnot).<p>(Note also that there&#x27;s lots of ways to make reading a field that is empty fallback to doing some reasonable non-catastrophic behavior, required doesn&#x27;t let you do those things).')
