Item(by='bitwize', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608928745, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25534257, text='The problem with &quot;Amiga Lagoon&quot; is that it&#x27;s too twee -- it&#x27;s kitsch. Like all kitsch it attempts to score points by appealing to our unconscious reaction to &quot;pretty&quot; things, as well as simplistic emotions like nostalgia or sentimentality. What&#x27;s the <i>theme</i> or concept being explored here? That the Amiga&#x27;s media fidelity is such that it can serve as a window onto another, paradisical world? There, I just solved the puzzle. You don&#x27;t really need to <i>think</i> when observing this piece. It&#x27;s all right there, spelled out for you.<p>By contrast, Suzanne Treister&#x27;s work raises more questions than it does answers. Looking at them makes you feel a certain way, and you have to sit down and puzzle out <i>why</i> it makes you feel that way -- and even then, answers may not be forthcoming. The piece exists in a limbo of different possible interpretations; exploring these, and finding contradictions between them, adds depth to the work and the audience&#x27;s appreciation of it.')
