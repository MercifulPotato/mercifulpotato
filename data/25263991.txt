The complexity of HTTP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and soon QUIC (in place of TCP) has grown to the point where only a handful of large, well-capitalized institutions (and really only Google, if you consider WebKit&#x27;s ubiquity) can develop and maintain a secure, efficient, modern web browser. Most alternative browsers, even forks of Firefox&#x2F;Mozilla, have either been abandoned, or fallen so far behind that they have no future.<p>This is almost certainly deliberate on Google&#x27;s part. They want to control the browser, because outside of apps, it&#x27;s through the browser that they deliver ads, and over 80% of their revenue comes from ads, and the more they control the browser, the harder they can make it to block ads. They don&#x27;t even have to prevent it fully; just make it so difficult that only a small minority of technically-inclined, and sufficiently motivated users will do it.')
