This removes a lot of of the impact on range... except if you use use heat in the cabin.<p>Due to them being so efficient, most electric cars can&#x27;t use waste heat like internal combustion cars, which means they need a separate electrical heater which of course has an impact on range.<p>This article: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marketwatch.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;cold-weather-saps-electric-car-batteries-2019-02-07" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marketwatch.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;cold-weather-saps-electric...</a><p>&gt; The automobile club tested the cars at 20 degrees and 95 degrees, comparing the range to when they were tested at 75 degrees Fahrenheit, according to a report on the study.<p>&gt; At 20 degrees, the average driving range fell by 12% when the carâ€™s cabin heater was not used. When the heater was turned on, the range dropped by 41%, AAA said.<p>&gt; At 95 degrees, range dropped 4% without use of air conditioning, and fell by 17% when the cabin was cooled, the study found.')
