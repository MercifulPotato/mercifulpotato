If I own a gas station and Bob owns the only other gas station in town across the street from mine, and we both agree to set the price to $4&#x2F;gallon, then that is price fixing.<p>But if I wake up one day and see Bob set his price to $4&#x2F;gallon while I&#x27;m selling for $2&#x2F;gallon, I may decide to bump my price up to $4&#x2F;gallon and that is <i>not</i> price fixing.<p>Realistically the 30% vig didn&#x27;t come out of thin air - Apple set the standard, the rest of the world saw apple getting away with it, and decided that they would set their rates the same. But that doesn&#x27;t mean price fixing resulted in all of us setting the percentage to 30.')
