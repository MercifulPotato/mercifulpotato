We use MLFlow to allow our users to track their experiments, etc. We work <i>around</i> MLflow to spare users complexity. Saving a model can lead you to figure out that you need the <i>exact same Python version</i> for it to be deserialized, not even talking about the protocol, as MLflow uses &quot;cloudpickle&quot;. It also relies on Conda, and it can make for a funny afternoon because installing Pytorch magically installs the latest version of Python without telling you. I had to wrap my head around that concept. That&#x27;s like installing Thunderbird and suddenly it upgrades Ubuntu. That&#x27;s not MLflow per se, but working with it users either have to deal with it, or we have to hide that complexity.<p>Deploying non trivial models expecting tensors doesn&#x27;t work. By non trivial I mean a model that expects something else than a 2 dimensional DataFrame[0]. They&#x27;re working on it, though.<p>- [0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mlflow&#x2F;mlflow&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3570" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mlflow&#x2F;mlflow&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3570</a>')
