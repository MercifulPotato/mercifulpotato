Usually, the first section (or &quot;the morning drill&quot;, as i call it) lasts till breakfast. After usual morning stuff, if i have time left, i browse social media, tunein to a ted talk, check mails. After Breakfast, second section goes as long as there are tasks left to be done. It may be just a couple of hours, or the whole day. Then there is section three, which is nothing much to plan about.\nBefore going to bed, I prefer writing a log&#x2F;diary and setting up tasks for the next day.')
