E.g., his interview with Michael Malice a few weeks ago, where he (Lex) confessed to pulling an all-nighter before the interview, and so wasn&#x27;t on his game. It showed. Hopefully the lesson he took from that experience is he shouldn&#x27;t pull all-nighters before an interview.<p>As the commenter above said, lots of &#x27;meaning of life&#x27; questions that just aren&#x27;t that interesting.')
