But then spacedcowboy comes in to basically say &quot;I don&#x27;t care about any of this or any of your arguments&quot;. Ok then, of course they are free to do so, but then why bother commenting? I only continued replying because I hoped we can have explore the topic a bit more but no, spacedcowboy just straight up says he doesn&#x27;t care about any of it, so I guess that&#x27;s really, as they put it, &quot;end of story&quot;.')
