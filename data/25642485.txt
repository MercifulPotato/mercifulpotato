First, the field is absolutely fascinating - the complexity is incredible, and I&#x27;m really enjoying learning about it. It&#x27;s also clearly &quot;What&#x27;s Next&quot; - the synbio space in particular has a real &quot;early computers&#x2F;early internet&quot; feel, in that the capabilities are becoming apparent, but the tooling &amp; infrastructure&#x27;s not quite there - it feels like it&#x27;s about to take off in a big way, and that&#x27;s exciting. On a broader level, I think climate change is an existential risk, and the biotech&#x2F;synbio toolkit is the best bet I can see for how we both mitigate and repair the damage and shift our energy consumption patterns, so I want to be part of building it.<p>Go Slugs! The UCSC campus is still the most beautiful place I&#x27;ve ever lived. I&#x27;m sad I wasn&#x27;t more of an outdoorsy person while I was there - it was just an incredible place.')
