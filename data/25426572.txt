Oracle is more expensive on most tiers, but offers a $100 support level (forum-only, with updates) that undercuts all rhel agreements.<p>Had you offered this support level, and advocated it (as I said) with gdm and CLI advertisements, you might have kept a great many in the fold.<p>You did not do this, and now Oracle updated their repo conversion for CentOS 8.<p>It is not too late. You should reconsider.')
