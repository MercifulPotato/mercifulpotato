Can a local newspaper even keep a journalist fed and housed on its revenue anymore in many of these smaller towns? I am not sure that many of them can, yet alone tech costs, editors, salespeople, etc.<p>In Canada, we have a massive local news conglomerate called Postmedia. They own probably 80% of newspaper readership in the country. They have consolidated and consolidated. They use the same web design across all properties. They have slashed salaries, outsourced printing, and sold the front page to advertisers. A lot of their staff are just a guy in their community.<p>They can&#x27;t seem to make it work. Unless readers are willing to pay, I just doubt there is enough money to have a human do a lot of the work anymore for local news.')
