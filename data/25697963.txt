An entirely reproducible power glitch in my early honda hybrid causes the power steering to steer at full power to the left...    End result is the wheel spins with so much force it broke my thumbs...   Lucky I was only doing 5mph at the time!<p>It&#x27;s 100% a design fault, and applies equally to any car of this model (I tested it on a friends, same result!).  There are simple reproduction steps which can totally happen by accident, yet there has been no recall or service bulletin issued.<p>I ended up pulling the power steering controller apart and adding my own safety circuit to the microcontroller output so my car is now the only car of this model which won&#x27;t break your thumbs or steer you into a ditch!')
