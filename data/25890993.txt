Pretty much a club house, pub, community center whose membership consisted of veterans.<p>The suburb was built within a decade of the end of WWII and during the Korean war. So it was a safe bet that most households had a member who was a Veteran or related to a Veteran who could wave them in.<p>As time progressed, less and less households in the neighborhood would probably qualify. So its no longer a community centerpiece.')
