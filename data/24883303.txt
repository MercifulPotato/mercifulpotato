When do we tell people they are just clumsy and need to own up to it? Many new york rooftops are closed for this reason because their insurance premium goes up, thanks to people like this author.<p>We definitely lived through times when not everyone was attached to a safety harness when going to a protection less terrace. I understand the absolute need for employee protection in a work environment, but as long as precautions are taken so that truly vulnerable populations (kids) can&#x27;t be harmed even when they are paying attention, communities need to grow up and not coddle everyone&#x27;s laziness to pay attention to their surroundings like this.<p>See for example rules done right in this regard - Amsterdam doesn&#x27;t mandate helmets for bikers.')
