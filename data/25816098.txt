I never suggested that the description was the problematic part. A person can bring up tons of factual things that just stir the political and emotional pot (current events, anniversary of a war or assassination, quoting a politician, quoting current law, bringing up niche holidays, quoting results of research papers, etc, etc). The fact of the matter is that a company chat channel is best served as not being a police blotter,a history book,a memorial site, Wikipedia, the news feed of media outlet, or many other things that are still in realm of descriptive facts.')
