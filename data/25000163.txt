The python code usually start out very good and readable but as it get extended and changed it tend to create a massive mess that is hard to navigate. The C code in comparison don&#x27;t generally get extended or changed at all since the initial work to even add the simplest change tend to require a large initial dive into the design, custom types and design details, that such code tend to mostly be left alone.<p>The upside with the python code is that a complete rewrite of parts that has get extended beyond recognition tend to be easier than expected.')
