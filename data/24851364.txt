Training centers are mostly shut down for public safety.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the whole reason, though.  Were companies truly that desperate, they&#x27;d find a way.  Many training classes this year have moved to part-online, part-in-person, for example, which helps with COVID safety, convenience, and cost.  But demand is way down.<p>Ultimately, I think it simply boils down to money.  We&#x27;ve gone through the better part of a year where most big projects were shut down, and if they were lucky, restarted months later, slowly, with restrictions.  When you put a damper on every part of the economy (except Netflix and Purell), everything suffers.  As a wealthy friend of mine once said: it&#x27;s all about cash flow.<p>Reduced demand, few open training centers, DOH class size limits, limited spare cash from unemployed workers for class&#x2F;book&#x2F;cert fees, trainers who live elsewhere and might not want to get on a plane, etc.  It&#x27;s like hitting the breaker in Jurassic Park.  You don&#x27;t just flip it back on and get all the lights at once.<p>(I&#x27;m not saying we shouldn&#x27;t have hit the pause button.  Public health is critically important.  I&#x27;m just saying it should be no surprise that labor and training got hit badly by it.)<p>It&#x27;s hard to imagine a situation where it would <i>not</i> be worthwhile to have a trainer spend 8 hours teaching and certifying one new driver, if any real demand existed.  Guess how much a good trainer costs for a day -- a single pallet often holds material with greater dollar value than that.')
