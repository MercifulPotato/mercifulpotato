I guess for the people, Biden is still the better outcome than Trump, but the Democrats would have deserved another slap in the face.&quot;<p>democrats are not the &quot;good&quot; party, and we can hope for, but shouldn&#x27;t expect, better from them. it&#x27;s crucial that we look critically at both major parties, all the time, while also looking to indepedents for fresh perspectives. both parties have been highly effective at dividing the nation roughly in half and facing them off at each other, rather than at the politicians themselves and their big money donors who are surreptitiously wreaking the most havoc on our collective stability, well-being, and prosperity. we--citizens and residents--must remain vigilant that our representatives reflect our will, not theirs. it&#x27;s not only ineffective, but actively harmful, to blindly root for and support one political party.')
