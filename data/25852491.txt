All three are going to be pretty crap.<p>The robot pizza company in particular was a joke.  Viewed with a critical eye, the whole thing was technophiles blinded to obvious reality by their love for high tech gadgetry.  Why else would you use a sophisticated robotic arm to transfer a pizza from one machine to another when a simple conveyor belt can do the job faster and need less space to do it?<p>White Castle is doubtlessly being smarter about it, but I&#x27;m pretty sure you could replace their restaurant employees with a microwave oven.  BTW, automated restaurants are not new; look up &#x27;automat&#x27;.  If you&#x27;re retrofitting a kitchen designed for humans, systems like what White Castle is experimenting with might make sense, but if you were to design an automatic kitchen from the ground up, I think it makes little sense.')
