The biggest issue I have (forever) is FF is a memory pig that eventually becomes sluggish.<p>Though I do have a lot of tabs in four windows, I&#x27;ve set prefs so it only loads tabs when I click on them.  So in reality I have a lot fewer tabs &quot;active&quot; on any given day.  Yet I regulary see memory use grow from an initial 600MB to 4 or 5GB. FF seems not to properly release memory back, in particular after new tabs with video are closed. I might live with it were it not for the eventual slowdowns.')
