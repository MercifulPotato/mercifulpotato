It also contains a very important feature to me, which is sharing. The one thing I like the most is that everything is driven by the filesystem, there is no secondary database that organizes things differently and needs to be kept in sync with the filesystem<p>It&#x27;s 80% there for me, I just think for photos there is a little bit more work to do, so I&#x27;m going to investigate static gallery tools')
