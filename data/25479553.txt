Item(by='antisthenes', descendants=None, kids=[25479631], score=None, time=1608401259, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25478941, text='&gt; When he dies, his wealth should return to the society from which it came.<p>Sorry, but this stance is outright ignorant. What do you mean <i>return to society</i> ? His wealth is Amazon, the company, dozens of warehouses and an incredible logistics chain.<p>His wealth currently provides a pretty damn good service to society, in the form of being able to get items delivered fairly quickly and contact-less in the time of a pandemic.<p>Are you proposing we take his Amazon holdings after his death and give every person in the county a fractional share? Or however many shares it comes out to?<p>That&#x27;s certainly a possibility, but the realistic outcome of that is that most people try to sell their shares for cash right away, thereby crashing the price, and most shares ending up in institutional investment banks and funds within the first year.<p>I&#x27;m not against a stronger estate tax either, but you have to be real careful when you&#x27;re trying to divvy up massive amounts of wealth on a short time scale and think of the second order effects.')
