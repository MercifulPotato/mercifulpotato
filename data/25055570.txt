Yes there&#x27;s the odd cases of servers that use enterprise software that have to have GUIs, but most linux boxes run headless.  GUIs are just a waste of processing power and resources for the large majority of the things that servers are used for.<p>That said, I&#x27;m not happy that Canonical are entirely discounting the possibility that customers will have desktop environments installed on servers.
