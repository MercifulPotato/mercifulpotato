Even lockdowns are increasingly politically and socially non-viable. I suspect it might not be obvious over in the US because the press only seems to run comparisons which make the US look like a unique failure due to Trump for election-related reasons. (Seriously. It was amazing watching, for example, the New York Times switch from downplaying the severity of Spain&#x27;s outbreak compared to Florida to ignoring it to turning the country&#x27;s politics into a Trump analogue once the disaster became undeniable - and if I recall correctly this was ostensibly news, not editorial. France looks like it could potentially end up reporting more cases than the <i>entire US</i> in the not-so-distant future, and I don&#x27;t know how the press will cope with that.)')
