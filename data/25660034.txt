Item(by='armagon', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1609954600, title='Ask HN: How to run a remote election for a society?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;ll be running an election for a board of directors for a charitable society in my town next month. I&#x27;m looking for advice on how to do this.<p>Here are some constraints:\n- I expect 30 to 70 voters\n- The voters aren&#x27;t technically savvy\n- Ideally, the voting is anonymous\n- As the results are binding, the election needs to have integrity\n- People should be able to only cast one vote per election\n- There will be multiple elections, one after another, for different positions (ex. President, Vice President, Treasurer, Board Member).\n- We will take nominations &quot;from the floor&quot;, meaning the people on the ballot are not known beforehand.\n- We need the results right away (a few minutes after the vote starts, at most), as it doesn&#x27;t make sense to run for Vice President if you were just elected President\n- While most of the elections are to vote in a single person, with each voter voting for a single nominee, when it is time to vote for the board, each voter can voter for several people.\n- If using a web-connected device, it is possible that two members may be sharing the same device.<p>While I love open-source software, I&#x27;m not opposed to something proprietary. There is a budget (although probably fairly small) to make this happen.<p>----<p>Some possibilities I can see:\n- I understand you can have a meeting in Zoom, create a break-out room for everyone authorized to vote, and then run a poll. I think this would work reasonably well, except for spouses who are sharing a device for the call.\n- Possibly, we could have a number of people running the election, and have a list of all the eligible voters. Each person could phone, text, or perhaps e-mail in their vote; we cross them off, and record the vote. Time consuming, and not fully anonymous, but possibly do-able.\n- There does appear to be some software for this. I&#x27;m looking into it, hoping something will work and not break the budget. Some of it is not geared to this sort of audience at all.')
