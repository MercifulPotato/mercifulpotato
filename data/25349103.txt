It gets a lot wrong and a lot of it is questionable.<p>For example, notice something about the stats it gives throughout the article?  It&#x27;s whole numbers, and with large variations: 10-20 per cent of individuals, 30-50 per cent of people, and so on.  That variation and the whole numbers should be a read flag.  When performing a study very precise numbers pop up.  This isn&#x27;t a confidence interval they&#x27;re calculating, it&#x27;s made up numbers.  (The real numbers btw are between 8 and 9% of the US population.)<p>Let&#x27;s look at the premise:<p>&gt;For 15 years, research into dark personality traits (including narcissism, psychopathy and Machiavellianism) has been rapidly expanding.<p>Straight from the get go it uses fuzzy or vague terminology.  Furthermore, it does not attempt to explain its chosen initial terminology.<p>The actual terminology is:<p>- ASPD for something close to the Hollywood psychopathy&#x2F;sociopathy stereotype, there is no official psychopath in the DSM.<p>- Narcissism is NPD, and NPD is quite different from what people typically call a narcissist looking at themselves in the mirror, so the audience is going to misunderstand without explanation.<p>- Machiavellianism.  It explains how countries slowly take over land of other countries.  It explains how to maintain power on a national level once you have it, and so on.  I admit I don&#x27;t even know what the machiavellianism stereotype is.  Maybe Game of Thrones and people backstabbing each other?  That is not Machiavellian.<p>Using vague terminology is a way to get people to believe things without questioning them.  It gets the audience to think they know the topic on a deep level, but instead their understanding is reduced.  A lot of conspiracy theory websites do this, and even political websites as of late.  Sadly, at times, vague terminology can be used as a technique to manipulate people.  Fuzzy terminology is a red flag when validating a source.<p>I could keep going and critique this article all the way through, but it would be quite a long post. (eg, they say these characteristics are more common in men, but there are more female narcissists than there are males, which is the largest group.)  In short, a healthy dose of skepticism is helpful.  The article aims to solidify a stereotype, that makes it easier for actual bad actors to not be identified.  Sadly, reality is darker than these stereotypes.')
