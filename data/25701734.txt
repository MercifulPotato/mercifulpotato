Wikipedia for khan academy, duolingo, or anki, with arbitrarily interactive content. The above video shows some rich flash cards in action (ear training &amp; keyboard harmony).<p>Flash cards + SRS + dynamic difficulty sorting and pathfinding (ie, optimal content surfacing given demonstrated skills), and automated surfacing of achievement bottlenecks in courses so that the community knows where to author intermediating content or prescribe different approaches with existing content. Inside the classroom: peer-to-peer JIT instruction, and distributed competencies.<p>Most tentatively, but maybe most crucially, I think there is potential in this project for anti-fragile adversarial communities to build mutual understandings around contentious issues, where the propagation of your own views is proportional to your acknowledgement of contrary opinions.')
