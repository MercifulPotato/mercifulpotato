Item(by='jrockway', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606631391, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25242129, text='&gt; I simply don&#x27;t understand why developers keep investing their time on platforms that are openly hostile to them.<p>It&#x27;s because the users are there.  It&#x27;s similar to things like YouTube. Every YouTuber complains about YouTube... but there is no other place where their random video is going to be recommended to a million strangers.  (Twitch is similar.)  So, they put up with it.<p>It boils down to what problem you want to solve.  If you can figure out how to convince Mac users to switch to Linux, then you can be successful in your approach of &quot;ditch Apple for being evil&quot; or whatever.  If you can&#x27;t, then you have to find a new line of work (there is plenty of software engineering to be done that never touches an Apple product), or you have to put up with the poor developer experience.<p>It&#x27;s also unlikely to be sunshine and roses on the other side of the fence.  For everything that&#x27;s bad about platform X, platform Y probably has just as many annoyances.  If you&#x27;re looking for perfection, you&#x27;re going to have to remake the world in your image from scratch.  That&#x27;s a lot of work!')
