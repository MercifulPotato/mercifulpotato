While ReactNative might not result in quite as big of a performance penalty as embedding a browser engine, its performance can still be worse than actual native apps, given that it adds additional abstractions to make developer&#x27;s lives easier and allow for cross-platform development: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;swlh&#x2F;flutter-vs-react-native-vs-native-deep-performance-comparison-990b90c11433" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;swlh&#x2F;flutter-vs-react-native-vs-native-de...</a><p>While one could argue that there aren&#x27;t that many visually driven experiences like that out in the wild, the benchmarks still prove that most abstractions have drawbacks.<p>Of course, there are good reasons for using them, which is also why many choose even the previously mentioned Electron platform for development, instead of something like Qt&#x2F;GTK on desktop.<p>But for the discussion at hand, it simply serves as a suggestion that there&#x27;s more at play here than just &quot;Java uses a lot of memory and can be slow&quot;.')
