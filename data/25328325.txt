Item(by='mcswell', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607303013, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25325876, text='&quot;the task of JOIN is to modify the circuit so that at subsequent times there is the representation of a new item C that will fire if and only if the representations of both A and B are firing.&quot;  What that describes sounds like what in linguistic (syntactic) terms one would call conjunction.  I don&#x27;t recall whether Chomsky&#x27;s recent theories (which come under the rubrik of &quot;minimalism&quot;) count conjunction as a type of Merge, but what he&#x27;s more concerned with is subordination, which is quite a different thing from conjunction, given that subordination--but not conjunction--results in hierarchical structures.<p>And for the record, I don&#x27;t think Merge in the linguistic sense has anything to do with &quot;chunking&quot;, much less the &quot;magical number seven.&quot;  But then I don&#x27;t know much about chunking.')
