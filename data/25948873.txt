One of their arguments is that accidental (derived) state has a magnifying effect on complexity, so a first-order goal of any software architecture should be to reduce accidental state as far as possible -- and arguably, centralize the remaining essential state as much as possible.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;papers-we-love&#x2F;papers-we-love&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;design&#x2F;out-of-the-tar-pit.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;papers-we-love&#x2F;papers-we-love&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master...</a><p>It somewhat puts the old saying in another light: &quot;There are two hard problems in computer science: cache invalidation and naming things.&quot; Cached state is, effectively, another name for derived state.')
