If you think you will achieve anything significant with it, think again. Imagine that _you_ are TI and you receive a couple of messages there. You will think (probably even anticipate) this is clearly the public&#x27;s reaction to a decision that you thought through, which is not a typo or day-to-day error. So you will thank them for their concern and will carry on with your business!<p>A better remedy would be to publicly shame them about what they just did. TI will still carry on with their business but others will just know better than to engage with TI in the future!')
