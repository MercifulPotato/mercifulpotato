We aren&#x27;t looking to the past, but to the law, and the context surrounding it&#x27;s writing so as to understand it. Of course laws are written in the past, but that&#x27;s incidental. Many countries have lots of interesting ideas; that&#x27;s up to the legislative branch to be informed by, and perhaps copy. For the judicial branch to do otherwise would invalidate a rule of law, and the separation of powers. While interpretation of law evolves, it can&#x27;t be rewritten because a judge (or judges) liked something another country did.<p>If the legislative branch wishes to amend The Constitution, there is a procedure for that, including a wholesale rewriting of it (Constitutional Convention). We&#x27;ve amended it via 27 amendments, substantially altering its structure.')
