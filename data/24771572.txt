P(x)<p>P(c)<p>where c can be anything. This is usually called something like instantation or ∀-elimination. I suppose you could call P(c) a trivial consequence of ∀x. P(x), no matter what c is. The formula P(x) could be something like &#x27;if x is human they are mortal, so something like &#x27;if &quot;Scorates&quot; is human they are mortal&quot; is a trivial consequence, as is &#x27;If &quot;Blue&quot; is human they are mortal&quot;.')
