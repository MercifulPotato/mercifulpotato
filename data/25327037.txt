You can usually shift the problem a bit and get a bit more of both elegance and easy understanding with a good comment giving the general idea.  That isn&#x27;t to say things shouldn&#x27;t be laid out and named sanely to make thing obvious where possible, but any time you make assumptions about what someone else looking at your code know or is thinking, you&#x27;re opening up the future for more bugs.  It makes sense to attempt to limit that in some respect.<p>The fact that we have all looked at code and not known WTF is going on and stepped away and come back a little later and it was obvious should be all the evidence needed not to to assume <i>too much</i> about what some other programmer will understand just by looking the code itself, especially <i>elegant</i> code.')
