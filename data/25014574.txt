And some wonderful lines worth quoting. My favourites -<p>&gt;&gt; The highest calling of true elites is to translate the flux of reality into a coherent story.<p>&gt;&gt; Perspectives on reality of course vary according to the ideals and institutions involved.<p>&gt;&gt; We are fractured creatures, trapped in a subjective perspective, but we are also symbolic animals, viscerally craving a meaning for our individual lives that is universally acknowledged and so transcends individuality.<p>&gt;&gt; Belief is the default.  What needs to be explained is systematic cynicism or unbelief:  it’s a pathological state that makes individuals miserable and society untenable.<p>&gt;&gt; The public is disenchanted in the elites and their institutions, much in the way science disenchanted the world of fairies and goblins.<p>&gt;&gt; All you need is a smart phone and a sufficient measure of anger against.<p>&gt;&gt; The lust for destruction, rather than fascism or some “successor ideology,” looms as the great threat to democracy today.<p>&gt;&gt; For all the anger, we live pretty comfortably within this evil old system.<p>&gt;&gt; Websites must compete for attention and so practice the art of the rant.<p>&gt;&gt; Newspapers are trying to survive by selling polarization.<p>&gt;&gt; I have learned that the best way to be wrong in public is to make a prediction.<p>&gt;&gt; On the web, you can vote on anything, at any time.
