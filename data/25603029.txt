Why does it need to refer to &quot;online delivery platforms&quot; when it could refer to anybody that poses to deliver the food for you without express permission of the business owner?<p>I mean, if the worry is that the owner should be able to have say in how the food is to be delivered, it should not matter how the actual order was made, whether it was through online platform, by phone, mail or pigeon?<p>So, if I somehow do this without &quot;online&quot; component then it is fine?<p>Why does half of the law need to be so specific and reactive instead of setting principles for how people should live and cooperate together?<p>Imagine US Constitution referred to unimpeded travel by horse or train or by foot instead of unimpeded travel in general.')
