At the risk of sounding like devil&#x27;s advocate, had Gibson accurately predicted the high-tech panopticon of the modern day, he could create a much better thematic environment by ignoring or downplaying it. Much of the &quot;high-tech, low-life&quot; that characterises the sprawl would become near-impossible in the high-surveillance climate of a country like modern China. I feel like you&#x27;d have to expend so much literary energy constantly explaining how they shake the basic, ubiquitous surveillance we&#x27;re used to,&#x27;excusing&#x27; the characters from overexposure. Then again, explaining the mechanics of anti-surveillance might provide the kind of cyberpunk brain food that we all love.<p>That being said, there&#x27;s plenty of ubiquitous surveillance happening in the Sprawl Trilogy. Marly&#x27;s pursuit by Virek in Count Zero springs to mind here.')
