For legacy reasons, the base page size on x86 is always 4096 bytes, so an 8-way VIPT cache is limited to 32768 bytes (and adding more ways is costly). On 64-bit ARM, the page size can be either 4K, 16K, or 64K, with the later being required to reach the maximum amount of physical memory, and since it has been that way since the beginning, AFAIK it&#x27;s common for 64-bit ARM software to be ready for any of these three page sizes.<p>I vaguely recall reading somewhere that Apple uses the 16K page size, which if they use an 8-way VIPT L1 cache would limit their L1 cache size to 128K.')
