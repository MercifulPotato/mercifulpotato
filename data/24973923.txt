Item(by='yellowapple', descendants=None, kids=[24974371], score=None, time=1604354276, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24971939, text='A good writeup, though it misses a couple pertinent points.<p>One of those points is that the boom here in Reno is less about manufacturing and more about warehousing&#x2F;fulfillment and broader supply chain logistics.  Yeah, manufacturing jobs are definitely growing (the Gigafactory being a notable example), but it&#x27;s the storage and distribution of those manufactured goods that&#x27;s attracting companies to Reno.  The close proximity to Northern California is part of that, but just as critically is the proximity to the <i>rest</i> of the western US; a truck out of Reno can hit California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, or Arizona within 2 days, and likewise so can a package shipped out of Reno (or, correspondingly, a package out of Reno can cheaply be shipped to those states).  Vegas has a disadvantage there in that - being so far south - any shipment to those northerly states (Oregon, Washington, etc.) sees an extra day of transit time and - correspondingly - added cost.  The fact that the LA metro area is still a manufacturing <i>and</i> warehousing powerhouse, as the article mentions, sure doesn&#x27;t help, either.<p>The other point worth mentioning here (and one that might hopefully give Vegas a more optimistic outlook) is that Nevada&#x27;s got a trick up its sleeve: solar.  This whole state&#x27;s a big, dry, sunny desert.  There&#x27;s practically unlimited room for solar farms up the wazoo, especially since it ain&#x27;t like there&#x27;s much else to do with the land here (other than, you know, strip-mining it or blowing it up with weapons tests).  Plus, there&#x27;s geothermal; if you look at a map of the hot springs in the US (and thus the opportunities for geothermal energy), Nevada&#x27;s a giant blob, waiting to be tapped.  Nevada can very well be <i>the</i> green energy hub of the American West, giving Reno&#x2F;Sparks, Las Vegas, and Elko one hell of an economic jumpstart (pun very much intended).')
