Item(by='lucb1e', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606673341, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25244202, text='That link reads very much like a conspiracy theory blog, &quot;shocking revelation&quot;, &quot;Anyone who questioned this [was] attacked, ridiculed, smeared and hounded into silence&quot;, &quot;But the facts wouldn&#x27;t go away.&quot;<p>The content is worth following up on, though. Those emails are as if written in an alternate reality, where Roger Dingledine is a government agent. They seem hard to believe, but scrolling down there is a PGP signature with the right key ID. I can&#x27;t verify the sig, the email that I&#x27;d have to type over is many pages long and I&#x27;d be fighting line endings and it might never match and I&#x27;d not know if it&#x27;s due to a mistake on my part or because the message doesn&#x27;t match the sig so it wouldn&#x27;t prove anything anyway. The signing key ID is also a short one (64 bits) so it could also be forged with some effort. I&#x27;ve reached out on IRC some hours ago to see if they deny it, as there is nothing on the Tor Project&#x27;s blog, but have yet to get a response.')
