The vast majority of them still have Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, etc. The removal of extreme messages from these platforms should only be removing those condoning the extreme messages. Are you saying those extremists speak for all Trump voters?<p>And those extremists already committed and are planning further violence. There is no good reason to maintain support for their violent plans on popular platforms, and enable recruiting efforts.<p>A growing number of people believing something that Trump claims but has been disproven repeatedly isnot a desirable outcome. Rather let&#x27;s reverse that trend.<p>They should figure out how evidence and proof works and start taking it seriously. Go read <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;18&#x2F;this-might-be-most-embarrassing-document-created-by-white-house-staffer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;18&#x2F;this-migh...</a> and realize things like the Navarro Report are not documents of proof but persuasive essays that fail the minimum standards of basic research. Like a conspiracy, he hand waves over his evidence which he claims is not publicly accessible, but only he has special access to. Then he just uses a lot of speculation about what&#x27;s possible. This isn&#x27;t grounds for an exhaustive, wasteful investigation, because we are not starting from a place of evidence and reason, but merely the propaganda of a Trump machine that wants to maintain his power.<p>Removing the most extreme views can only serve to reverse this troubling trend of citizens listening to Trump over hundreds of reputable news organizations. To think otherwise is conspiracy thinking!')
