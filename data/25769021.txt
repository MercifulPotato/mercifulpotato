Item(by='Raphmedia', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610577856, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25766564, text='&gt; When you know you’re going to be downvoted regardless of what you post, it’s easy for your writing to take on a bitter and cynical tone. That said, most of my comments aren’t even like that and still get inexplicable downvotes.<p>I believe that you hit the nail on the head there. If your reaction to feedback from your peers is to turn bitter you are creating a vicious circle.<p>When I get a downvote, I analyze my comment and try to detect the mistake or social faux pas I commited. For example, most *chan or Reddit lingo is frowned upon so I avoid them.<p>This is an account I created 4 months ago because my previous account was named after a domain I no longer own. I am already at 811 karma. My previous account, created in 2013, had 5930 karma with long periods of inactivity. Karma is meaningless if you do not use it as a metric to detect how your peers perceive you. It&#x27;s points without a scoreboard and no one is keeping track.<p>This does not mean I bend backward and follow the opinions of others. I do stand by my comments that are downvoted and would repeat them verbatim if the same conversation arise. But that&#x27;s an exception and it&#x27;s usually about controversial topics.<p>Remember that the words you write are going to be read by someone (or what&#x27;s the point?). So make sure you are either helpful to other users or that you bring the discussion forward. Otherwise you are simply wasting someone&#x27;s time and they will quickly click on the downward triangle.<p>This is not an attack, I am genuinely trying to help you get out of that catch-22.')
