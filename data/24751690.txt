There&#x27;s still a robust MUD community out there, but most people have never heard of them. I&#x27;m currently building one from scratch in Go. Fun times.<p>I also miss the good ol&#x27; BBS days. I know there&#x27;s some BBS communities out there, but it doesn&#x27;t feel the same without dialup. I also spent some time this summer writing Solar Realms Elite from scratch as well. I didn&#x27;t finish it, but I got a decent engine going.<p>Speaking of BBSes, there was a networking protocol back then known as FidoNet which allowed BBSes to communicate and share information. In my more bored moments I&#x27;ve considered trying to find the spec and build some modern FidoNet clients&#x2F;servers or whatever it is.<p>Short version: I really love the old text-based (ASCII ftw) internet days, and I think about that tech a lot.')
