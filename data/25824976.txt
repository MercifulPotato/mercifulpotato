Define some code C (possibly using nums)\n    # 2. Encode a message using C (or interpret nums as a word or codeword)\n    # 3. Do something with the word\n    # 4. Find the locations of the errors in the word\n    # 5. The locations of the errors tell us the missing number(s)\n</code></pre>\nThe answer on stackoverflow seems to use methods very related to RS decoding, however I can&#x27;t quite squint enough at it to see, whether it could actually be solved using the exact same methods in RS decoding.')
