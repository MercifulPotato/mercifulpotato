Discover currently fails to install due to mismatched dependencies, but this is also something the future will solve.<p>So far: KScreen still refuses to save changed settings, so on every boot I have to manually set my Fujitsu Siemens P17-2 to Portrait at 75Hz again.<p>The scaling somewhat works, but not properly, especially GTK applications are upscaled rather than downscaled. (See Firefox in the screenshot linked below)<p>The plasma panels overlap about half a virtual pixel at 1x, or 1 pixel at 1.5x, so the panel on the right monitor opens the dashboard on the left one, and the panel on the left monitor sometimes doesn’t even open a panel at all.
