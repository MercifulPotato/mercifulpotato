Each of my daughters bought steel bed frames that will likely last a lifetime. They are really solid. The slats will probably need to be replaced someday, but they will last as long as any box spring.<p>But yes, a lot of their MDF beds are junk.<p>I bought a stand up desk from them a few years ago. They had three models available at the time, and two of them were &#x27;wobbly&#x27; when fully extended, but one of them was not. After four (five?) years of use, both raised and lowered, it is still a great desk. It is hand cranked. It is solid, it is sturdy.<p>So yes, when you shop at Ikea, you have to know what you are getting into, and you need to actually go and see the piece assembled on the floor. The quality from piece to piece is hard to tell from looking.<p>One of my daughters bought an &quot;Alex&quot; dresser. The construction on that is solid, the drawers move beautifully. But many of their other dressers are fine for four years of college, or maybe a first apartment, and not much else.<p>Having said that, that &#x27;temporary&#x27; market is huge.<p>Quick edit: If you are looking for a practical &#x27;sit&#x2F;stand&#x27; desk. Here is the one I have. It has been really good. It is <i>not</i> light (in case you live in a walk up). Available ina couple different lengths. Fully extended, it is very stable.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ikea.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;p&#x2F;skarsta-desk-sit-stand-white-s89324812&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ikea.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;p&#x2F;skarsta-desk-sit-stand-white-s8...</a>')
