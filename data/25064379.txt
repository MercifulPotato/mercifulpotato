I suspect this will convey and reinforce a good tone for our culture.<p>I said that some companies, like a certain FAANG, do the coding tests for <i>everyone</i>, perhaps partly because they&#x27;re huge enough to want objective metrics and standardization, and maybe in some cases also as an institutionalized power move.  And they <i>can</i> do it, because they&#x27;re otherwise attractive enough to many candidates, and can also afford to alienate some candidates.<p>Early startups are different: There&#x27;s an opportunity to get a feel for each candidate, and to discuss among the team.  And that we should be able to get a sufficient qualitative feel isn&#x27;t unreasonable: it&#x27;s just as fair for the candidate to wonder how competent the team they&#x27;re considering joining, yet we don&#x27;t let the candidate give us coding tests.  And a startup will usually mean less money and prestige, so we&#x27;re not paying for the right to have interviews be one-sided.<p>Then I wondered how universal the coding tests really are, among the FAANGs: at what level (or VIP situation, or other circumstances) do any of them <i>not</i> do the coding tests?<p>If, for example, one of the few inventors of a super-popular programming language&#x2F;framework&#x2F;technology were interviewing (with ample public evidence that they&#x27;re the desired technical caliber), what companies <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> insist that they go through the coding test rituals?')
