I didn&#x27;t find a way to create a dummy display with native Win10 tools. There was a way to do it in previous minor releases, but with recent Win10 updates Microsoft has removed it or disabled. So went for a hardware solution instead, as I didn&#x27;t want to install any 3rd party software. That&#x27;s quite reliable solution, just need to be careful if moving laptop too much :)')
