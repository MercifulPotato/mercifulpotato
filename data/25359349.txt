Item(by='graderjs', descendants=None, kids=[25360167], score=None, time=1607527166, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25359112, text='The slow and clunky I referenced don&#x27;t have &quot;loading semantics&quot; issues, they all show loaders, action statuses, and many indicate connectivity and save progress for multipage sagas. But you are right that slow and clunky <i>can</i> be unreliable, but so can slick and snappy. Tho, neither of them have to be. In some domains, slick and snappy can feel insubstantial and off-key. It&#x27;s interesting that the pages you reference are &quot;consumer&quot; products, not enterprise, so that&#x27;s inline with how I think this goes. I think basically we&#x27;re talking about orthogonal kinds of slow and clunky, yours is more the engineering focus of how it works, and mine is, like I said in the parent comment, about the aesthetics and the medium in a domain.')
