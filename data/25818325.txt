Who cares what individual site owners happen to be able to see if Google is going to monitor, track, send back (telemeter?) way more data and be able to analyze and store it forever?<p>It&#x27;s all about who <i>might possibly</i> get the data at a later date than who happens to house it presently.<p>EDIT: In fact, come to think of it, why are there two things being &#x27;conflated&#x27; here? Why is Google collecting <i>more</i> information about Google Analytics-using sites than it&#x27;s exposing to site owners?')
