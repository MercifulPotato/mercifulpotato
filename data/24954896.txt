Never been subjected to caste discrimination or seen it, only heard the odd jokes in Punjabi songs, Jatt ones but never seen high caste Rajputs, Brahmins etc say anything. If anything I think the problem is economic background, its always money that determines real status and that too the poorer suffer most.')
