There is too much friction throughout the entire systems. So it often slips the filament when extruding or retracting. Leading to clogged nozzles, holes in the filament and other nasty business that take a lot of time to fix. I&#x27;ve rebuild the one I have tree times now but it keeps misbehaving. I can&#x27;t rely on even 10 tool changes working out. And a big multi-material print often takes hundreds of them.<p>Its in stark contrast with the Prusa printer itself which I find to be of extremely high quality an easy to use :).<p>I also have two friends who have the MMU. For one them it always worked perfectly. For the other friend the first one didn&#x27;t work at all, but once Prusa replaced it with an orange one (they were very explicit about that) it did work a lot better.')
