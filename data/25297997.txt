Item(by='belval', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607046257, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25297419, text='&gt; The new rule now defines a service animal to be a dog that is “individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of a person with a disability” and limits the number of service animals a person can travel with to two.<p>Two dogs are already a lot, what if someone on the plane is allergic?<p>I get that some people may want to bring their emotional support animal (didn&#x27;t even know those were a thing), but the idea that it can be an untrained animal seems absolutely crazy to me. Nevermind the fact that it&#x27;s a dangerous for the other passengers, take off and turbulences are absolutely terrifying for them.')
