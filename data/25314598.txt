They’ll ignore TTLs, rewrite NXDOMAIN responses into the IP address of their ad-laced web search, and occasionally just highjack every single query to send you to a page saying you’re approaching your bandwidth quota<p>Universally? Perhaps in the US? But IoT devices are sold worldwide.<p>While I do run my own recursive resolver I checked my ISP&#x27;s and they&#x27;re behaving fairly reasonable and do none of the above and I have a direct (contractual) relationship with them and we reside in the same jurisdiction so at least in principle I could apply pressure to them if they do something shady. The same can&#x27;t be said about google or cloudflare.<p>&gt; Just be aware DNS over HTTPS is a thing now, and while the devices I’m responsible for aren’t going to try and evade your redirects, the companies that are trying to make sure ads get delivered will absolutely switch to DoH which will be much more difficult to work around.<p>I&#x27;m sure google had only our best interests in mind when unleashing that on us.')
