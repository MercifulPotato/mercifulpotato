Not compromise. We&#x27;ve had zero compromise from the republicans for decades. Even when it&#x27;s in their interest.<p>Obamacare was a let down exactly because instead of writing a new, decent system the Democrats kept giving away bits only for the republicans to still refuse to support it. That&#x27;s how they ended up with RomneyCare. Which was still opposed by republicans and which they tried to repeal and complained was forced down their throat.<p>The republicans will cry no matter what happens. They&#x27;ll call it partisan when a democrat is appointed majority leader. I don&#x27;t think the Democrats could appease them if they impeached Biden and then all committed group suicide.<p>So here we are.<p>Ironically we actually agree about a centrist coalition. The issue for the last 20 years has been that when the Democrats take a step towards the right, the Republicans take a step even further to the right. They don&#x27;t get closer together, they just debate far right vs far far right.<p>I actually think that a taste of their own medicine is long overdue and might be the only thing to bring to back to the table and make a real centrist coalition possible.<p>I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m an exhausted centrist. Or a cynical one?<p>Sorry this is a bit extremist. I&#x27;ve been burnt before...')
