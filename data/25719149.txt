The complaint isn&#x27;t that Pornhub, Visa, or Mastercard lack the right to do what they are doing.  People are explaining reasons why it is a bad decision and those reasons aren&#x27;t relevant to Twitter, Google, Apple, and Amazon.  There is nothing contradictory about someone who believes these companies have the right to kick people off their platform while also thinking that these companies can make mistakes regarding who they kick off.')
