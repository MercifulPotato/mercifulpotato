It&#x27;s my first stab at this kind of thing, so it has been really eye opening. When I read any kind of fiction now, I can&#x27;t help but map out all the elements of plot and scene described by Chester. (This has had the unpleasant side effect of making reading fiction less pleasurable. ah well)<p>So, I can see this kind of tool being very useful in structuring plots, sub-plots and scenes. I still haven&#x27;t written that book though, so I am wondering if any seasoned writers here have a take on it.')
