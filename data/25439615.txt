Very rarely will there be clean separation of data between endpoints, and the stateless nature of REST makes it harder to optimize each call -- meaning, there will almost certainly be redundant queries.<p>That said, with GraphQL, your front end dev may not realize they are executing the equivalent of many REST calls, which is another problem :) I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s harder to optimize if you look at the application as a whole, though.')
