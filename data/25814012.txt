This election is a standing act of illegal and fraudulent action by county-level and state-level election authorities.<p>This is not a debated aspect of the argument. Ask me, and I will show you just a slice of proof that would warrant a forensic audit (esp if the shoe were on the other foot).<p>Now, for Mr Friedman to call these great patriots numbering the tens of thousands that spent their own money to support the president in D.C. as, categorically, Nazis is ludicrous.<p>It&#x27;s an injustice to these American patriots, and to those that actually suffered under the Third Reich.<p>This is a joke at this point if you refer to you grandpa who wears Trump shirts as a &quot;Nazi&quot;.
