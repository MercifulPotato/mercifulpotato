I&#x27;ve only left one real &#x27;mess&#x27;, it was a smaller one and mostly because I left the org before we were able to get to the final state. However I gave plenty of notes to make sure they could finish it up.<p>On the other hand I&#x27;ve managed to build a good career out of being the guy who shows up after a mess is made, and cleans it up. (BTW, this is not a bad spot to be in if you like learning either, you will get good at actually -reading- code, other people&#x27;s code. And, all the crazy stuff you see, eventually you start to realize there is a -right- way to use some of it. :)<p>One thing about the software -development- process (be it software engineering or something else) is that there should still be some form check&#x2F;balance to avoid insanity. As an example, at the moment I&#x27;m working on some performance stuff for an open source library. But there&#x27;s a certain point where I said &quot;I&#x27;m stopping here, any work onward is going in a new branch, since it&#x27;s going to be impure to the rest of the project and IDK if that&#x27;s what people really want, even if it&#x27;s a decent gain&quot;. Common sense.')
