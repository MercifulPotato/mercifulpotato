I say they&#x27;re identity-less because let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s almost guaranteed that Google&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;Reddit don&#x27;t have enough people that are like <i>you</i> and <i>your community</i> on every team that touches stuff that <i>you</i> and <i>your community</i> interact with to give a proper shit about <i>your</i> values or how <i>you</i> will perceive something. I might even take this a step further and say they&#x27;ve developed their own culture for the internet and you either adhere or die. You can swap in and extrapolate any group that has some measure of depth to it in that statement and it&#x27;ll still be true. That&#x27;s why, in my mind, there&#x27;s this desperate race for diversity and to reflect all things at all times. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love to have a diverse workforce, and in my experience the teams that weren&#x27;t all predominately one characteristic have always been more productive and fun. I&#x27;m just extrapolating why these things suddenly matter, almost ten fold, to companies that run platforms.<p>I&#x27;ve seen people here suggest that developing more tools will help suppression, faulty-auto-moderation, deplatforming, etc... but let&#x27;s be real. It won&#x27;t. Maybe you&#x27;ll more accurately identify people who are violating your terms of service and can vomit up some reason as to why with explainable AI. I don&#x27;t really view that as a win though and here&#x27;s why:<p>Americans ran from King Henry because he was willing to chop peoples heads off and imprison them without having to answer to the public that he ruled over. We created The Boston Tea Party because of a relatively small tax. Some people laugh at that event, but it goes to show you that when you have the haunting memory of a tyrant in your past, the latest cut feels like open heart surgery without anesthesia.<p>In the end Americans decided that if even one person were sent to the guillotine without a fair trial it was one too many. Our laws have reflected that since, but \nwe have also stripped many of those ideals away in favor of racist ones or convenient ones (at times). Now Mega Corporations are your new King Henry, and all the smaller corporations who buy services from them are their Dukes. They&#x27;ll either do as the King says or as the saying goes, &quot;Off with their heads!&quot;.')
