Certainly was using it when it was just branded &quot;Hangouts&quot; (no relation to the end user Hangouts) in like 2018.<p>Google&#x27;s loss was that they had pushed Meet (formerly Hangouts Meet, formerly &quot;Hangouts, no the other Hangouts&quot;) as a business only thing while they were pushing Allo&#x2F;Duo as the consumer apps and chasing the whatsapp&#x2F;imessage market that year because of their addiction to launching a new chat app every year.<p>(Hangouts anecdote: In the early days, hangouts.google.com went to the more well known hangouts for users app which had a contact list UI and a different video call interface. There was another link on the same domain to go to the meeting listing&#x2F;creation screen now at meet.google.com. I don&#x27;t think there was any way from one to the other in the UI, Google had a g.co&#x2F;hangouts link to get to it and I think the unshortened URL just had an extra underscore component in the path. I guess they were still on the fence over whether to launch Meet as its own thing or as part of old Hangouts, before they decided to shut down old hangouts)')
