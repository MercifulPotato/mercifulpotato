I was working with him one day and received a &quot;He&#x27;s dead, Jim&quot; error from Google Chrome. He became very confused.<p>&quot;Why is it calling you Jim? How are you signed-in to Chrome?&quot;<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not. I don&#x27;t use that stuff.&quot;<p>&quot;Why is it calling you Jim then?&quot;<p>&quot;It calls everybody Jim. That&#x27;s a quote from Star Trek.&quot;<p>He assumed the error message was personalized based on how you were signed-in to Chrome.<p>Turns out that, though he&#x27;s a big Star Wars and Dr. Who fan, he managed to completely avoid Star Trek TOS. I found the phrase to be used ubiquitously too but, apparently, not so much that he ever noticed it.')
