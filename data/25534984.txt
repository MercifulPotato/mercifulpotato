But we know that any participation in international organizations reduces risks of war, whether by correlation or causation I don&#x27;t recall.<p>Either way, armed conflict is becoming less frequent and less violent. One could argue that progress could come faster without NATO, but given that we have no evidence that a dramatically different cause of action will reduce risk of war, and we know that current trajectory is bending towards less war. Maybe staying on the current trajectory isn&#x27;t so bad :)<p>Generally speaking, any kind of quick major changes tends to cause conflicts. So even if we did want to end NATO, it&#x27;s probably be best to do it slowly.<p>Ideally, we would just slowly extend NATO to cover all countries. That way nobody can attack anyone else :)\nI would want countries to be reasonably democratic before they join though...')
