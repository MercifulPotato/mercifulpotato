Censors.  Who is to ensure that they exercise that power both fairly and accurately?  It opens a huge can of worms.  It might seem to make sense for &quot;obviously&quot; black and white issues.  But most are not so clear cut, and choosing a &quot;correct&quot; side is impossible.<p>&quot;False information&quot; isn&#x27;t countered by suppression.  It&#x27;s countered with facts and open discussion.<p>I absolutely agree that the current state of affairs with social media is problematic.  That&#x27;s the reason I quit all of them and deleted my accounts permanently.  But what you&#x27;re advocating still amounts to censorship and a failure to treat individuals as capable of evidence-based rational thought, and is still the antithesis of what we want in an open and free society.')
