But I comfortably get by with using Vim&#x2F;tmux&#x2F;ctags alone. I do write simple utilities that&#x27;d help me be productive. Sure, I could have relaxed in an armchair had I used an IDE, but I feel most at-home with text-speaking utlities, Vim being my go-to editor. Besides, I learned a thing or two while writing those utilities. Masochism? Maybe.<p>What matters to me is simple, composable, stand-alone utilities. I don&#x27;t hesitate using GUI or IDE-like tools when it&#x27;s appropriate to do so. What worries me, though, is that the continued investment and excitement in monolithic tools may mean that newer languages and technologies will be serving those users alone. Simplicity and minimalism may be a thing of past.')
