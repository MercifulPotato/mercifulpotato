China is just special in the way that fraud and corruption commingle with business and government. It isn’t unique by any stretch, but it’s certainly...different.<p>I’ll put it this way: I take an extremely skeptical view of basically anything originating out of China in matters of this sort. I wouldn’t be surprised if “Ant is basically a state run company” and “Ma&#x2F;Ant aren’t necessarily entirely instruments of the Chinese government” are both true in different contexts. That’s just how screwed up it is.')
