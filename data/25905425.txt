Those loopholes are the law&#x27;s bugs.<p>One could argue that those loopholes are left intentionally (back doors), but even if all actors were honest, bugs would still happen from time to time.<p>Computer code has even more bugs because it is produced massively and quickly, without the bureaucracy of tax code. Anyone can create an awesome application&#x2F;library&#x2F;framework&#x2F;etc., and share it freely with the world. People end up using these projects as stepping stones for their own projects, creating a complex layered cake where bugs can hide for years.')
