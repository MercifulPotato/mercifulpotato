Instead of relying upon cloud provider based services one could use K8S constructs and make it easier to port applications and services across hosting providers. The lock-in factor is a point of nervousness not because people consider wanting to move from AWS but because it can be hard to port new features supporting providers concurrently if every developer immediately reaches for the provider’s message queue, e-mail service, batch processing pipeline, etc. It takes a lot of effort to learn these various services’ nuances and that’s not necessarily useful for everyone.<p>And while K8S maintenance is fairly involved, trying to do deployments and system administration in its absence (read: production grade applications packaged prior to containers) is expensive and extremely error-prone as well.<p>As much as it’s a pain to deal with a mangled K8S setup, it absolutely beats 20+ idiosyncratic applications wired their own particular way with oddball service hacks on a snowflake server. This is a huge business liability that is changed at least to random containers in a container-based ecosystem of applications.')
