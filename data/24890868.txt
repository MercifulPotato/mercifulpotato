The size of the bags kids are using to carry all their textbooks and notebooks is ridiculous. Of course, it breaks the model of the publishing industry, but screw that. The learning hardware is destroying kids backs.<p>How great would it be to go into an office meeting (when we&#x27;re back in offices) and rather than having everyone sitting there with a laptop open, we have these thin e-ink devices where we can comfortably share data and notes between us.<p>Sure, there are millions of excuses for why these sorts of things can&#x27;t happen, but I don&#x27;t think an OS that is targeted at black and white, somewhat limited devices should be treated as not having value.')
