Since it seems clear to me that that&#x27;s not the case, I am confused by this view. Am I misunderstanding what you&#x27;re saying?<p>Edit: Since this got downvoted already, I&#x27;ll try to clarify? I&#x27;m confused by what appears to be the opinion of the poster and asking for clarification so that I can better understand them. If you&#x27;re going to downvote me, at least be helpful and provide some sort of answer to the question.<p>Edit: Changed the word agenda to &quot;view of the problem&quot;, since it&#x27;s possible that was being interpreted in a way it wasn&#x27;t meant.')
