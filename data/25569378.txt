In the USA; I have no clue how others manage this.<p>The linked podcast episode touches on some of our bigger inequity challenges. My only notion is restore state funding to public institutions (to greatly reduce tuition burden). It varied greatly by state. My own state&#x27;s universities used to be ~80 state funded and are now almost ~100 tuition funded. So wrong.<p>Maybe also treat loan for private institutions differently. It&#x27;s really distasteful that our elites universities are hoarding so much cash (endowments). They should use it or lose it.<p>Edit:<p>Another reform for mitigating inequity may be increasing supply to meet demand. I truly don&#x27;t understand this dynamic. Admissions are down overall. But demand for the elites is ever greater. Meanwhile newly 100% tuition supported orgs are now dependent on foreign exchange students. Ad nauseam...<p>It seems to me the Pareto curve of credential issuing orgs has to be releveled. The elite have to either expand enrollment or partner with other orgs to share the glory or...?<p>I&#x27;ve read a lot of criticisms (gripes), but can&#x27;t remember any policy proposals. The most concrete I&#x27;ve seen is Scott Galloway&#x27;s new MBA teaching startup (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.section4.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.section4.com</a>), which really looks like an ITT (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ITT_Technical_Institute" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ITT_Technical_Institute</a>) or Phoenix University model, but I really don&#x27;t know.')
