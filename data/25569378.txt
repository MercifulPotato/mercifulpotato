In the USA; I have no clue how others manage this.<p>The linked podcast episode touches on some of our bigger inequity challenges. My only notion is restore state funding to public institutions (to greatly reduce tuition burden). It varied greatly by state. My own state&#x27;s universities used to be ~80 state funded and are now almost ~100 tuition funded. So wrong.<p>Maybe also treat loan for private institutions differently. It&#x27;s really distasteful that our elites universities are hoarding so much cash (endowments). They should use it or lose it.')
