For instance, the Lenovo ThinkBook 14s (with a Ryzen 4800u) with a 15W TDP posts the same Geekbench multicore scores [1] as the M1 Macbook. But the ThinkBook isn&#x27;t in any way faster than the top-end iMac for real world compute intensive tasks.<p>The M1 certainly looks efficient, but there&#x27;s little you can conclude from a single benchmark running for a very short period of time.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;browser.geekbench.com&#x2F;v5&#x2F;cpu&#x2F;4642736" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;browser.geekbench.com&#x2F;v5&#x2F;cpu&#x2F;4642736</a>')
