The unions have been in damage control mode for decades, trying to avoid losing the factories that employ two hundred to the more automated factories that employ twenty, but then as a result losing 100% rather than 90% of the jobs to China.<p>We impose labor and environmental rules on products made in the US but don&#x27;t require the same standards for products made overseas, even though we could.<p>China is basically a trust that uses profits in industries it has already taken over to subsidize its entry into industries it hasn&#x27;t yet, and for decades we did nothing so we could get cheaper shit, claiming that we would keep making the high tech stuff, until we turn around and every phone and computer is made in China.<p>There are solutions to this. Obvious solutions. But it would imply paying more for stuff because it&#x27;s not being made in a polluting sweatshop in an undemocratic country which is acting like the nation state version of a 19th century robber baron. (At least initially; you know what stage two of the robber baron playbook is if we do nothing.)')
