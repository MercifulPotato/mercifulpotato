Yet the opposite almost never happens.<p>Why wouldn&#x27;t you raise money from where the money is? Inequality means there&#x27;s a small handful of people with giant piles of money. That&#x27;s a good bet to go knocking at if you want some.<p>Generally if you want to build a successful business you should raise on the best terms possible, and European investors are not known for offering particularly compelling terms.<p>I should also say, just because you raise money in the bay doesn&#x27;t mean you have to run your business in the bay. Should you choose to do so remotely, you&#x27;ll like take a bit of a discount, but it&#x27;s worth mentioning this year&#x27;s YC class was entirely remote.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this argument is connected.')
