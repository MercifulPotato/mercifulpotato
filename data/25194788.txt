Even if the only difference is arrays of this type have a 15 byte dead space at the end.<p>Such behavior is not crazy but this decoder does not take a normal array as a type at that point. So describing it as such can result in other programmers providing an array that does not follow the expectations of this decoding function.<p>-edit\nI will say if you have length information you should be able to use the fast method on all but the last chunk without checking on every data chunk.')
