That said, I agree that the celebration of politically motivated violence is despicable, and the unwillingness of some the members and supporters of the republican party to condemn the recent riot is a terrible mistake.<p>My main goal with my first comment was to remind everyone that painting the people we have political disagreements with as irredeemable monsters can drive people from both sides to violence.<p>I&#x27;d also like to thank you for taking the time to reply instead of downvoting and moving on, this is a tough subject and I don&#x27;t think my hasty 1st comment was sufficient to the task.')
