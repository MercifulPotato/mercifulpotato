Item(by='sofixa', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609267030, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25569566, text='&gt; Citymapper is so much better in Paris where Google Maps is very poor for public transport. I&#x27;m extremely impressed.\n&gt; It can not only tell you which exit you need to take (extremely important in Paris) but also which car to board to be the closest to the proper exit or line change<p>Google Maps has been doing both of these for at least a year now.<p>&gt; Multimodal routing is also extremely impressive. They properly implement the city bike sharing system including how much bikes and empty spots they are available at each station<p>That one is pretty cool. If only the service wasn&#x27;t massacred and rendered almost unusable :( ( used it regularly but had to buy a bike due to how often there would be broken bikes or bugs in their system. I think they lost <i>a lot</i> of customers with the provider switch, it was a complete disaster for more than a year and still isn&#x27;t great).')
