The result is a high volume, low delta-T coolant cycle and those are notoriously difficult (read: impossible) to capture meaningful amounts of electricity from, it will actually consume a lot. That quote is just a slightly more elaborate way of saying: no, we&#x27;ll definitely not do any utilizeable capture.')
