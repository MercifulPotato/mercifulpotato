The misunderstanding is that OSM is argued to be not a map but a database. The homepage at openstreetmap.org is meant to be a sort of dummy viewer, showing what data is there and that you can have different styles, it also integrates a popular geolocation service (Nominatim, this is the component you&#x27;re complaining about) and some routing services. But it&#x27;s all just a demo and not meant to be the best one could offer. There is no proper user testing because it&#x27;s not a commercial company and also because it&#x27;s just a simple demo, similar to how one might have a demo for some JavaScript library that shows many or all of its features but not necessarily in the best or most integrated way.<p>The idea is that this <i>database</i> can be used by anyone, e.g. OsmAnd, the openstreetmap.org homepage, Facebook, Apple Maps, Mapbox, GraphHopper, etc. provide various services on top of it. Nominatim, the component you&#x27;re having trouble with, is indeed fairly picky in its input.<p>But do mind that you&#x27;re comparing this to Google, the company on this planet that is the undisputed king of search. I&#x27;m not surprised their search function works better than this open source project using an open source set of data. For what it&#x27;s worth, if you stick to common address formats and don&#x27;t put in abbreviations like a country-specific postal code (it doesn&#x27;t look for results near you, it just searches the planet for what you typed; it has no knowledge of where in the world you are as it doesn&#x27;t track you -- yeah, maybe it should), then it works fine, or at least as reliable as the underlying data is.')
