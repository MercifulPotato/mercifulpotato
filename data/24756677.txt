But for the sake of discussion, I&#x27;m willing to do that with people where we disagree on reasonable things. I&#x27;m not willing to have a civil discourse with people that adamantly refuse to believe facts and think I&#x27;m a part of a larger conspiracy.<p>Does that mean censorship of all of these people &#x2F; ideas is the answer? I don&#x27;t think so. But I know that if I ran a platform where people were discussing holocaust denial I would ban them. I&#x27;m willing to admit I might be a hypocrite on that front, but alas I am a human.')
