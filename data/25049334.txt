If so, he&#x27;s at least as much of an outlier as the $500k&#x2F;year folks on the other end.<p>From what I can tell, this is pretty common for continental Europe. It&#x27;s the one thing keeping me from leaving the US at this point. For whatever reason, their pay is total crap. Particularly when you include taxes.
