News media tends to focus on negatives and they tend to blow those out of proportion in regards to how events affect one personally.<p>In the `80s I realized that watching the evening News left me feeling depressed. I was being barraged with news about violence, murders, rapes and robberies, deadly accidents (autos, planes, trains, etc), wars, racial strife, poverty, disease.<p>It finally hit me one day when the &quot;News&quot; wrapped up with graphic video of a deadly car accident somewhere in Africa. I realized that when I got up that morning I felt fine, but after watching the &quot;News&quot;, which began with local news (I was living in Los Angeles), then National News, then World News, I felt as though the entire planet was filled with awfulness.<p>After sitting there pondering that I realized that in my own personal life things were not near so awful and that led to the epiphany that I needed to focus on that instead, and to do that I had to stop taking on the weight of the entire planet&#x27;s terrific events. I had to put that in perspective.<p>The &quot;News&quot; channel I was watching was an independent TV channel that became one of first to be purchased by Rupert Murdoch to form the &quot;FOX&quot; network. Tuning out provided immediate relief. But I didn&#x27;t tune out just them, I pretty much stopped watching TV &quot;News&quot; altogether.<p>That was &quot;Step 1&quot;. The next step was to begin focusing on things I enjoyed. I could list some of those here but this is something we all must figure out for ourselves.<p>I can watch the News now and maintain a much better perspective of how it affects me personally. and for the most part it doesn&#x27;t.<p>Right now, today, people all around me are stressing out about what&#x27;s going on in Washington DC. I am not. I cast my votes last year. My 1st choice lost. I&#x27;ll deal with what comes as it comes but I will not fret about what may or may not come. I&#x27;ll enjoy what I can instead.<p>I believe if there is a &quot;meaning&quot; to it, it&#x27;s to learn how to appreciate it. If you can do that living becomes amazing.')
