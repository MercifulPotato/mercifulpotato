Communicate and let value come back but there’s an significant amount of value in keeping a single backend relies on. CPython has done the Python community a lot of good by keeping one official compiler&#x2F;tool chain (despite the great work done by projects like JPython&#x2F;PyPy).<p>The only way to do this properly, if desirable, is to make GCC an official backend of the main frontend. That will defocus some progress that happens with LLVM (every feature has to be implemented on both backends) and can make dev lives hard (eg “oh this problem comes up with GCC so use the LLVM backend “). The value would be if the majority of bugs&#x2F;features are in the shared frontend.<p>This project though seems like a parallel implementation of Rust. That’s valuable for the community and inevitable as a part of successful growth. I don’t believe it’s beneficial to the community though if this grows beyond a toy, niche project.')
