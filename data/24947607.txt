Item(by='qppo', descendants=None, kids=[24948038], score=None, time=1604098358, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24943526, text='I think the hardest part of hardware is that its development is essentially an optimization problem - find the cheapest way a factory can make a widget with the features you&#x27;re trying to sell.<p>The hard part of this problem is that there&#x27;s an immense amount of information asymmetry between factories, designers, and marketers.<p>This will get better with factory automation. Right now you can upload CAD files to get a quote. The issue for designers is you want the quote to tell you <i>why</i> something is expensive (eg, a feature requires three tools for machining a part instead of one, or it&#x27;s slightly too large&#x2F;small for a process that is way cheaper, etc). Normally you work through this with engineers, designers, and factory staff iterating together on designs before tooling. That process is expensive and time consuming - it&#x27;s a very human problem that can and will be automated soon.<p>I don&#x27;t see &quot;hardware as a service&quot; coming into vogue for markets that are a race to the bottom (except if the service is sold to advertisers, like with Rokus). I see the service being manufacturing the hardware itself. It&#x27;s already turning that direction.')
