That said, the ability to manage this with essentially &quot;shadow mode&quot; is somewhat less impressive than having the kinematics &quot;built in&quot; so to speak. As I understand it (and correct me if you have more recent data!) the robots are programmed by using a person wearing an articulated sensor network to capture the motion[1]. The robots repeat what ever the person does.<p>There are lots of interesting domestic uses for this kind of capability. In California it would be interesting to see if they could be used to fight fires. Even if the kinematics where programmed and they were launched with a &#x27;follow&#x27; drone, I could imagine a 3rd Person game type UI for fire fighters who could take over control and &quot;drive them&quot; like they would a video game. That would enable a much larger fire fighting crew to be deployed.<p>[1] FWIW &#x27;training mode&#x27; for workstation robots has been a thing for ever where an operator manually moves the robot through the steps it needs to do, then tweaks the program after running it. Fixed problems like &quot;pick up a part in any orientation, then put it into this orientation&quot; are part of the robots built in moves.')
