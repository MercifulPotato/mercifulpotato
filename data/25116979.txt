The bad guy looks on in horror as he realizes that the people who he&#x27;s been maliciously declaring dead so that he can steal from them are also immune from legal consequences from taking revenge.<p>Of course in real life I bet they &quot;realize&quot; you&#x27;re alive all of a sudden.<p>Which does make me wonder if that&#x27;s not a legitimate way to &quot;come back to life&quot;.  Like if you commit a small crime are they just going to consider you a John Doe or kick you out of the country?  Or are they going to do the leg work to declare you alive?<p>Or for that matter, maybe you can just turn yourself into the IRS for evading taxes.  Would that make things better or worse?')
