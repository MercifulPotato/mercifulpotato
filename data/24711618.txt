There are also loaner situations, at schools etc. where machines are shared.<p>b) no specialized hardware is necessary, so it&#x27;s really cheap to execute.<p>c) this is probably the worst part - power cycling the laptop does not reset the T2 (&quot;The T2 chip is fully booted and stays on, even if your Mac device is shutdown.&quot;) - so there&#x27;s no practical way to ensure that your machine is not compromised after a brief interlude.  For extra fun, if it turns out the attack can be executed by a malicious wall port, then things start to get really interesting.')
