Almost every highly contagious virus mutates quickly. Same with bacteria. The cat is already out of the bag, even if we do manage to completely eradicate it it&#x27;ll take years. (To be clear I&#x27;m not against virus control measures, I&#x27;m just frustrated with the flawed reasoning that all this will just go away when the vaccine is within reach. It couldn&#x27;t be easier to get a flu shot and yet we&#x27;ll probably be dealing with the flu long into the future. If we know this will stretch into say 2022 I have to imagine that will change a lot of peoples attitudes as to how society should react)')
