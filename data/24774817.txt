Advertising is an example of fully decentralized propaganda, where the actors don&#x27;t have any kind of real central control, but if their goals align, they&#x27;ll amplify a single message to the level much larger than a monopoly ever could.<p>Perhaps we could call it mob-style propaganda. Mobaganda?<p>2:<p>The way I feel it, propaganda is about making a large group of people believe things that aren&#x27;t true, but benefit some other group of people. Said beneficiaries of the propaganda may be the original source of the message - but even historically, propaganda only works if some of the audience believes it and starts convincing&#x2F;socially pressuring others into believing it too.<p>So the core operational element here is just a meme that spreads. Centralization is orthogonal.<p>--<p>Basically, I feel that old school propaganda was just a way to forcefully spread a selected meme. It happened in an era where most media was unidirectional - from a small group of people operating newspapers, radio and television, to a large group of people who could only view it and perhaps comment between each other, but their response wasn&#x27;t broadcast to a wide audience. These days, with our hyperconnected social media where everyone is a publisher of thoughts, memes can spread without much effort. You don&#x27;t need force of a central power anymore for an idea to travel; memes amplify themselves now, as they spread through our <i>bidirectional</i> media.<p>And this means not only that propaganda isn&#x27;t restricted to a central power, but also that it doesn&#x27;t have to have any intent behind it. All it takes is for someone to accidentally craft a meme that resonates with people, and it&#x27;ll get amplified. If it incidentally benefits a group of people, that group will ensure it gets amplified further.<p>The problem is, said meme doesn&#x27;t have to be in any way correct, reasonable, or corresponding to observable reality.')
