If so, can you expand on the problems you were solving?<p>I&#x27;m trying to solve a similar sounding problem where I have to build the model equations from scratch quite often and right now it&#x27;s using templates to recompile my binary with new equations whenever I need to do so, but that takes time and I have to manage a lot of code complexity. I&#x27;m doing it for performance reasons right now because other methods I tried we too slow, but it&#x27;s getting unwieldily.')
