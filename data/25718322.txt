It’s entirely possible to have very definite tastes and views while acknowledging there are other equally valid viewpoints that doesn’t mesh well with yours.<p>For example I may love and have a highly developed taste for “western” style classical music and have little appreciation for microtonal Indian classical music without believing it is somehow inferior, yet at the same time believe that not all music is equally good.  This isn’t exactly the same as moral relativism that you call out but related.')
