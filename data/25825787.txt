Around 650 000 people died as a result of the Iraq War, around 50 000 in Afghanistan, around 400 000 in Syria and around 20 000 in Lybia.<p>Of course, neither were purely by the US but rather by a Coalition, but none of them would have happened if it wasn&#x27;t for the US.<p>I also include deaths from destruction of infrastructure and subsequent power vacuums, as is customary for crimes against humanity.')
