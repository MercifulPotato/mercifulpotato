Roasting doesn&#x27;t mean just putting something in the oven on high heat, the things you&#x27;re roasting need to be far enough apart on the tray that there is space for air in between them. Otherwise you&#x27;re steaming, not roasting. The point of roasting is to make the outside super crispy, while keeping the inside moist and chewy.<p>E.g. how to roast chicken thighs:<p>- Preheat cast iron pan in oven until the oven has been at 450 for at least 10 min.<p>- Place four chicken thighs in the cast iron pan with a good amount of space in between, after tossing them in a gallon ziplock bag with olive oil, sea salt, and pepper.<p>- Roast for 20 min at 450, then pour out excess fat. (If you don&#x27;t do this, then again you&#x27;re just steaming the chicken.)<p>- Turn down oven to 400, and cook for another 25 - 30 min.<p>You can apply the exact same technique to most vegetables and mushrooms, but understanding and nailing the principle is key. This recipe for roast maitake mushrooms also explains it well: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foragerchef.com&#x2F;simple-roasted-hen-of-the-woods&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foragerchef.com&#x2F;simple-roasted-hen-of-the-woods&#x2F;</a>')
