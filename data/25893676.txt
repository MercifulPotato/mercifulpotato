Item(by='slibhb', descendants=None, kids=[25893799], score=None, time=1611508449, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25891152, text='There should be government regulations (perhaps including more regulation of drinking water).  But the torturous political process that is currently required to enact those regulations is a good thing and the gist of your post, &quot;just sweep aside all the nihilistic whiners stonewalling and fix the problem,&quot; is the wrong approach.  My perspective is liberal: there are no good, simple solutions, there&#x27;s no such thing as a &quot;general will,&quot; people don&#x27;t agree, have good reasons to not agree, and therefore the political squabbling, as tiring as it is, is healthy.<p>Buried within your perspective is, I believe, the incorrect and somewhat dangerous idea that there is a way to harmonize society <i>if only we&#x27;d grant the right powers to the right people</i>.  I think civilization is best thought of as a tragic compromise and attempts to make it something else never end well.<p>None of that is to say you&#x27;re wrong to advocate for more and better regulations.  Only that there are valid reasons to argue for fewer regulations or to be skeptical about the government&#x27;s ability to regulate this or that.')
