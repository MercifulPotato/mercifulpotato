Item(by='JibStyle', descendants=2, kids=[25335612, 25335507], score=2, time=1607365625, title='RSU grant fully vested, now what?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I have been SW engineer at a successful startup for 4 years. The company went public and my 4 year RSU grant became worth a lot of money. Now that I have completed 4 years and the grant fully vested, my total compensation has dropped by about 50%. I received some &quot;refresher grants&quot; along the way, but they are much smaller. Due to the compensation drop, I feel less motivated, and my boss, who is only about 1 year in, is complaining about my drop in productivity.<p>How should I handle this? I am concerned a new job still would not pay as much as my current total compensation due to my refresher grants here, unless new job happened to be similarly successful startup. I am concerned boss would not understand &quot;less total compensation&quot; as justification for slacking off. I am concerned previous level of compensation is no longer attainable (my 4 year RSU grant was given at a time when the stock was worth less).<p>Slacking off at work allows me more time for personal and family matters. I am also depressed from a death in the family and general 2020 BS. I do not NEED the old level of compensation, but the lack of it leaves me less motivated to work.')
