For works since 1978, copyright lasts for the entire length of the author&#x27;s life, plus an additional 70 years. The &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; protection act (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Copyright_Term_Extension_Act" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Copyright_Term_Extension_Act</a>) increased this even further for some works.<p>There&#x27;s a need to allow artists and writers to make money from their creations and not just get their work instantly reproduced by pirates. At the same time, it&#x27;s in the public interest for their work to become widely available after a short period of protection. I don&#x27;t know exactly how long that period should be to maximally benefit society, but 15 years sounds a lot more reasonable than life+75 years.<p>It&#x27;s absolutely absurd that Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s distant ancestors can today be suing people for creating derivatives of Sherlock Holmes, a literary character conceived in 1887. Sherlock Holmes belongs to the public, not some greedy relatives trying to leech a living from him.')
