None of your criticisms are new. Actually using Tailwind makes you realize that creating CSS classes for your components is basically a waste, since you only ever use them in the component itself.<p>- Unless the same class can be used in multiple HTML templates, there’s no point in giving the class a name.<p>- Only very general CSS can be used in multiple templates because anything specific will have the brittle base class problem.<p>PS mr-3 is .75rem and mr-4 is 1rem, so you can see with your eyeballs if you’re using the wrong one.')
