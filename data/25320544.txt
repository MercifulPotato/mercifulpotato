I used to go to one of the parks in the early evening when it was cooling down and not as many people. I twas conveniently located right outside downtown separated by a river. I used to spend hours just thinking and would come back up after dark walk into town and grab me something to eat. Sadly now, I live somewhere with an even worse climate than before and the only parks remotely to me are a bit out of the way and close extremely early, so I don&#x27;t get out as much anymore.')
