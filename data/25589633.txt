I found the flexible schedules to be great but less productive so I understand why others don&#x27;t support it. Most of the engineers I worked with seemed to not be great at staying productive on 9 or 10 hour days any more then they were at 8 so I&#x27;d call it a net loss for the company. Honestly though there is so much bloat at defense contractors it doesn&#x27;t really matter for them.')
