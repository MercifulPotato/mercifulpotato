The play here is, &quot;Look, here is our 98% of sales laptop&quot;. That it&#x27;s entry level is only an incidental factor. 98% of sales volume is at this price point, and so they get the maximum bang for their buck, the maximum impact, by attacking that one first. Not just because it&#x27;s the slowest or entriest.<p>Had they started at the fastest possible one, sure it would have grabbed some great headlines. But wouldn&#x27;t have had the same sales impact. (And it&#x27;s icing that the slowest part is probably easiest to engineer.)')
