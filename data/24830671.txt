Compare that to the massive number of people who use password123 as their password for every account across the web, and yes, biometrics are far more secure. :) More secure than a random 30 character string? Probably not.<p>And if youâ€™re targeted by individuals who are sufficiently motivated to steal your biometrics and the physical device, then neither the password nor the biometrics will be enough to protect you.')
