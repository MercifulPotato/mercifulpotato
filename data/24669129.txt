Things have improved a lot since the original Raspberry Pi from 2012.<p>I need to figure out how to get the 8th Pi working though, since I&#x27;m using one of the PoE ports to power a Mikrotik that I&#x27;m using as a wireless bridge onto my existing broadcast domain. Technically I don&#x27;t need the bridge, since each Pi can connect to my wireless AP over 5GHz 802.11ac just fine, but it feels nicer to funnel upstream data through one point. More importantly, it reduces WiFi collisions since there wouldn&#x27;t be 8 devices broadcasting simultaneously and interfereing with each other (especially at those close distances) if they all needed to download something from the Internet at the same time... like a Docker image for a Kubernetes deployment :)')
