I&#x27;m sure it might be different if you have the cellular version and you can go for a run just with your watch.<p>Apple Pay always felt kind of awkward, mostly because of the placement of the terminals, so I always had to turn my wrist very awkwardly. Plus I always had my phone with me anyway, which does the same thing.<p>That&#x27;s my experience with the Series 3, it&#x27;s possible I might have a different experience now, but I really have no desire to buy a new one.')
