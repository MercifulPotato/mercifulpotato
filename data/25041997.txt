Only multiple choice tests that can be graded by a machine! Make sure the teachers never have a one on one conversation with students! It’s easy if we make sure they don’t have time and resources for that.<p>Imagine how much harder interviewing would be without having a one on one conversation. And if it had to be perfectly standardized nationwide. It would have a ton less bias, but you’d have a terrible signal and have to do all these crazy things to prevent cheating. In other words, these seem even worse than the state of tech interviewing.')
