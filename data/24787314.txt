The Romans didn&#x27;t have anything like our modern conception of social media, and they managed to collapse just fine without it. The problem as I see it is that fighting other Romans became more profitable for the Roman decision makers than fighting their neighbours.<p>Social media is an effective tool which can be used as a weapon, but the problem isn&#x27;t that Americans have effective weapons; it&#x27;s that they&#x27;re incentivised to use them against each other. The solution to me seems pretty obviously a return to federalism. It&#x27;s the fact that there is only one throne that makes everyone fight for it with whatever is at hand rather than build things up locally.')
