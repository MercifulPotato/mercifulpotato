The cost though was enormous. Our write db represented the lions share of our AWS cost, and doubling it for disaster mitigation increased our costs by something like 50%. It was mostly worth it from a business perspective when we were less sure about AWS uptimes, but I’m not sure I could keep justifying the cost given how little problems we had with RDS over time.')
