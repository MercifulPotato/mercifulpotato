There&#x27;s a good reason why so many of these hedge funds held short positions -- $GME is a business facing significant headwinds beyond what you&#x27;d see from the pandemic and a typical P&amp;L statement:<p>- Their primary product is used game sales, and the biggest players in that sector are making active moves against such sales (see: the disc-less PS5 and Xbox Series S consoles).<p>- Digital storefronts make purchasing new games much, much easier (and a borderline impulse purchase).<p>- Free-to-play multiplayer games cut Gamestop out of the customer acquisition loop.  The most $GME gets is a cut of any prepaid cards, but those cards are commonplace nowadays (my local chain drugstore has an end-cap with dozens of prepaid cards of various types).<p>- Their primary model is to lease space in malls.  With the pandemic, malls are either closed or seeing substantially less foot traffic.<p>- Consoles are typically a big driver of purchases, but their limited availability also limits $GME&#x27;s potential.  That said, that can be counterbalanced by very profitable bundles made more attractive by the limited availability of unbundled consoles.<p>I don&#x27;t play the stock market, but even if I did, $GME wouldn&#x27;t be something I&#x27;d look at in a buy-and-hold strategy.')
