I just finished Rise and Kill first, a book on Mossad&#x27;s targeted killings ops. Its full of really silly and clumsy stuff. My favorite story from the book is that back in the 60&#x27;s Mossad tried to do the Manchurian candidate routine with a PLO guy, they hired a hypnotist and gave it a few months. The PLO dude eventually got smart, \nstarted playing along, acting as if he got hypnotized and they believed it and let him go with a gun. Once he crossed Israel, he handed his gun to his PLO folks and told them about it. \nIntel agencies back in the day were more like startups.')
