Most people are under the illusion that suicidal thoughts stem from feelings of depression &#x2F; sadness, and the reality is that these are three <i>entirely different</i> things: suicidal thoughts, depression, and sadness are three things which are often very different from each other.<p>So you think someone must be sad because they have depression, or they must not be depressed because they aren&#x27;t sad, and these incorrect beliefs can lead to harm.<p>And you also think that someone who is not acting sad or depressed must not be thinking about suicide, when <i>very often</i> someone who has decided to commit suicide may feel very happy or liberated having made that choice.<p>It can be really enlightening to talk to different people who have experienced or who experience suicidal ideation, because their experiences are varied, and while suicidal ideation is considered a risk factor, it doesn&#x27;t <i>mean</i> that you&#x27;re more likely to commit suicide and the people with suicidal ideation are often reluctant to talk about it because of the stigma. Like, &quot;I experience suicidal thoughts, and I want to talk about them, but if I talk about them, people will wrongly think I want to commit suicide, or wrongly think that I am depressed, or wrongly think I am sad, so I am unlikely to get the sympathy or help I need and it is likely that talking about it will have a negative impact on my relationships.&quot;')
