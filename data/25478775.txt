Islam took a similar route with Zakat (a form of &quot;charity tax&quot; if you will, over 1400 years ago, and it&#x27;s proven to work. When you look at history, there was a period of time, when everyone paid their share of Zakat, and when there were no poor people left to take it!<p>It&#x27;s not that much either, only 2.5% for currencies like gold and silver over a minimum threshold (so the poor&#x2F;lower class are exempted anyway).<p>However, as I explain in my other post, there is no forcing to liquidate a fixed portion of any holdings you have. For example, if you own property and rent it out, the property value itself is not taxed, only the money you make out of rent if you hold on to it for over a year (and it&#x27;s above a minimum threshold). Similarly if you owe shares in a company, the taxation is not a direct percentage of that ownership, it depends on things like debt and the amount of produce or products the company owns each year.<p>Income tax is unethical and predatory as far as I&#x27;m concerned, not to mention continues to fail even at absurdly high taxation rates.')
