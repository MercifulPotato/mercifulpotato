At either framerate, I noticed several frames of video lag, putting my lips and voice slightly out of sync (although how much is the camera vs the capture card is hard to say).<p>I&#x27;m fairly certain the capture card also introduces some colour distortion compared to the camera&#x27;s preview screen - perhaps brightening? You&#x27;ll need a way to convince your camera to autofocus continuously, which might mean running in video-recording mode at all times. And of course you&#x27;ll need a camera support that&#x27;s the right height for where you&#x27;re making calls from. You&#x27;ll need mains power, or at least enough batteries to run the camera all day. And of course, no taking calls in different rooms for you!')
