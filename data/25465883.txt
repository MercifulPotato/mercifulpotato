I get that you are probably more evolved and its so easy -- but then again if you had been raised on a steady diet of targeted misinformation to shape your brain and fed a constant diet of food engineered to maximize tastes and addictive behavior, it might not be so easy to just &quot;eat an apple&quot; or at least that&#x27;s what the scientific evidence, and piles of cash the industry is stacking up suggests.<p>Its a bit like taking someone with a gambling addiction and saying &quot;its so easy, just understand gambling is a fallacy and you can walk away anytime&quot;, or &quot;why not just have fun with something else?&quot; -- the casino is designed to exploit human biases and mental weaknesses for an especially vulnerable population.  If those biases and weaknesses were simple misunderstandings, they wouldn&#x27;t be powerful enough to form those addictions, and casinos would probably be much smaller and less successful.')
