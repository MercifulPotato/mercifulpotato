Just to be clear I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s malice as I don&#x27;t believe that.  I&#x27;m just saying the end result is the same so one should consider them a hostile actor for purposes of threat modeling.<p>Given you&#x27;re the second person who I think took away that I was accusing them of malice, I probably need to reword my post a bit to reduce confusion.<p>Accusing them of malice is irresponsible without evidence, and if I were doing that it would undermine my credibility (which is why I&#x27;m pointing this out).')
