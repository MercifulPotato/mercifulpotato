Take Georgia for example. Turnout was up 20% compared to 2016. But the Black share of the electorate went down again, to the lowest levels since 2006: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;interactive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;17&#x2F;upshot&#x2F;georgia-precinct-shift-suburbs.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;interactive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;17&#x2F;upshot&#x2F;georgi...</a>. What flipped Georgia was white voters in the Atlanta collar suburbs—and 100,000 people who voted for Biden but a Republican (or not at all).<p>And that’s exactly what you would expect from the data. Georgia is one of the few states in the country where Black voter registration rates are equal to registration rates for whites: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kff.org&#x2F;other&#x2F;state-indicator&#x2F;voting-and-voter-registration-as-a-share-of-the-voter-population-by-raceethnicity" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kff.org&#x2F;other&#x2F;state-indicator&#x2F;voting-and-voter-r...</a>. (California, by contrast, has a 12 point difference in Black-white registration rates.) In 2018, the Black voter turnout rate was actually 2 points higher than the white voter turnout rate in Georgia. It makes total sense that as you increase turnout, you’re going to see roughly the same demographics.<p>Same thing in Texas. 87% of votes were cast by mail in ballot. Turn out was up almost 7 points compared to 2016. But Trump earned basically the same percentage of the vote as in 2016, with Biden gaining a few points from winning people who voted third party last time: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.texastribune.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;04&#x2F;texas-voter-turnout-democrats&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.texastribune.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;04&#x2F;texas-voter-turnout-...</a><p>Democrats have this idea that voter suppression is preventing more minorities from coming out (and voting Democrat). But what the data seems to suggest in Georgia and Texas is that people who want to vote are already voting. Making it easier to vote or having a high states election will increase turnout, but by dipping into a pool of lower propensity voters who don’t look all that different demographically than the people who were already voting.')
