If we look at last time round, Ireland, a country of 5 million people, got 450 million in the LTE spectrum auction. Germany, a country of 83 million people, got 5.1 billion. So per capita the Irish spectrum was almost twice as expensive as the German spectrum, and yet mobile data is generally cheaper in Ireland (despite lower density, generally higher labour costs, and other factors that would lead you to expect it would be more expensive in Ireland if cost of data was actually determined by input costs).<p>When it comes to it, 6.5bn _sounds_ like a lot, but it&#x27;s only 78 euro per capita, and that&#x27;s buying the telcos permanent assets which will be useful for decades to come.')
