They count the loss of heat radiated away from the cooking vessel against the efficiency of an induction cooker, but don&#x27;t mention (or perhaps don&#x27;t know) that because of the nature of induction heating you can actually use insulated pots with them. You can wrap a pot in your sweater if you want, because there&#x27;s no open flame.')
