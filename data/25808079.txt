The sighting came during a fortnight in which the USS Princeton had noted unknown aircraft intermittently passing across its radar systems off the US west coast. The contact was considered so inexplicable that the system was shut down and restarted to check for bugs — but operators continued to track the mysterious object afterwards.&quot;[1]<p>&quot;Witnesses included highly trained military personnel—among them several deeply experienced radar operators and fighter pilots—who at the time of the sightings were at the controls of arguably the most advanced flight technology ever created. And yet none can explain what they saw.&quot;[2]<p>Does Mick West, a &quot;science writer, skeptical investigator, and retired video game programmer&quot;[3], know more about the issue than &quot;highly trained military personnel—among them several deeply experienced radar operators and fighter pilots&quot;?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;science&#x2F;ufo-tic-tac-flying-saucer-chad-underwoord-dave-fravor-a9254671.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;science&#x2F;ufo-tic-tac-flyin...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;uss-nimitz-2004-tic-tac-ufo-encounter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;uss-nimitz-2004-tic-tac-ufo-enc...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mick_West" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mick_West</a>')
