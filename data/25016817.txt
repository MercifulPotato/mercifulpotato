I was amazed how much smoother the Windows experience had become. Windows feels far better than Ubuntu in terms of sound, Bluetooth connectivity due to the drivers. If this is the case with my Dell laptop which is officially compatible with Ubuntu, I wonder how the performance of Linux will be on other older PCs. With WSL2 and VSCode integration, switching back to Ubuntu makes less and less sense.')
