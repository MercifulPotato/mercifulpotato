It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s not public information or that it must dictate the vote. It&#x27;s that there&#x27;s no reason for the poll worker to ask or know what you party registration is prior to sending to you machine A or machine B. At best it&#x27;s a non-issue, at worst it&#x27;s an opportunity to steer voters to a broken machine.<p>Any comparison of total turnout v.s. historic turnout based upon political party could be done after the fact anyway.')
