I tried to do a similar thing with Windows. The free VM expired every 30 days or so and bootstrapping a build environment each time (even just downloading it) sucked. The build environment is an outlier compared to macOS&#x2F;Linux&#x2F;Unix. I eventually ended up paying for Windows. I still couldn&#x27;t test things like OpenGL inside a VM.')
