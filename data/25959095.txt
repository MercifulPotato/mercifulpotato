This is a pandemic that is costing the world trillions in dollars. The biggest question I have is - why are we not taking the best drug (sounds like Moderna?) making them share the recipe and Astra and J&amp;J just producing that drug and helping distro it? Not saying the formula should be open source of free (the rest should pay for it 1 way or another) but we should go with the best drug, not 3 choices as it stands?')
