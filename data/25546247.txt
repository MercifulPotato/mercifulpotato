It is marketed as a &quot;Console Monitor.&quot; I was going to attach a PC to it anyway, as I don&#x27;t have traditional cable or an aerial. I gotta say it&#x27;s a bit pricey for its size, though being 4K and HDR, it is not that bad. And I&#x27;m not limited to whatever clunky, ad-riddled UI the vendor chose, but can choose my own clunky UI for watching Netflix, etc.<p>If only HDR support on the PC side wasn&#x27;t so terrible, it&#x27;d be a fantastic setup :&#x2F;')
