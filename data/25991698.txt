People would have been super annoyed but it would have been pretty understandable in a world where the situation actually matched your description (&quot;sudden influx of new customers buying risky stocks before their deposits cleared.&quot;)<p>What actually happened was that users with perfectly well-funded accounts <i>also</i> couldn&#x27;t buy the stock, and nobody would explain why. (The actual explanation appears to be related to complicated rules around T+2 settlement and collateral, but that&#x27;s a whole different thing than &quot;people buying risky stocks on credit&quot; which implies that the users were taking risks rather than the system is broken in complicated ways.)')
