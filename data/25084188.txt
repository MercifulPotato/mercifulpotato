Antifa doesn&#x27;t have a military style chain of command, nor an organized use of firearms. While the proud boys have more of a hierarchical command structure, it&#x27;s still a bit of a stretch to call them &quot;paramilitary&quot;, there does however seem to be some shared membership with right wing paramilitary militia.')
