It&#x27;s just more expensive than DDR and much more limited in terms of capacity.<p>If Apple does go the &quot;huge SoC&quot; route I&#x27;d expect to see HBM2 memory with socketed DDR4 or DDR5. It&#x27;d provide the best of both worlds - extremely high bandwidth and low latency for a small portion (say 32-64GB) of the memory, and high capacity for the rest (say 1-2TB), all without compromising the unified memory concept.<p>This is not without precedent - recent Xeon Phis, for all their other shortcomings, have had a similar memory hierarchy.')
