I can move anywhere in Norway and have the same number, and have had the same number for years. When I moved from the US to Norway, though, I had to change the number.<p>And I don&#x27;t think this is unreasonable. The country code and phone number format is different (10 vs 8 numbers). Most non-spam calls I get are from somewhere else in Norway. I&#x27;m going to guess you could keep the same base number so long as the format is the same (between Canada and US, for example) - but that country code would still change')
