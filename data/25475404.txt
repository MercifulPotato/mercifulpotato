I am responding to a thread wherein the parent said, essentially, &quot;confirm that it&#x27;s really repeating&quot;.<p>My whole point was that we reach for DRY too early, when we don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s actually repeating ourselves. The logic -right now- looks the same. Will it be in the future? Most of the time, we don&#x27;t. Even when we think it will, we&#x27;re often wrong. Your example sounds like there&#x27;s literally a string literal that was not abstracted out, but hardcoded 30 places. That isn&#x27;t logic. It&#x27;s a literal. It has one meaning, and you can probably ascertain whether or not the meaning is the same across everything. And, as mentioned, it seems weird you couldn&#x27;t grep for it.<p>Either way though, as a counter example - I and a coworker spent three months playing whack a mole extending and supporting a rather small desktop application written by one, extremely senior developer, who had assumed 7-8 different things were basically the same, and so had written it to share a lot of the same code. They were not the same, and so a fix for one thing invariably broke two others. I was thinking of it in particular with my original post; we fixed one thing, and two more things would be broken.<p>I got permission to rewrite the application over the course of a couple of days from the team lead, and proceeded to basically do a lot of copy paste to separate out each thing into its own control flow, where a fix to one would not affect the others. Our MTTF plunged, and within a month it was basically stable.')
