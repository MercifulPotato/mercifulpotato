Many devs take the approach of let&#x27;s do it quick and dirty now and let&#x27;s ask for a month worth of refactoring later. But then when the time comes they don&#x27;t really want to refactor, they want to rewrite the whole thing again, making the same mistakes. I feel that many people avoid refactoring because they don&#x27;t want to spend the time and effort thinking of how to improve the code? Refactoring is hard, but I think it&#x27;s fundamental for writing good code. I like it when Christian Clausen says &quot;Clean code is not an option, refactoring is a requirement for being good at coding&quot;.
