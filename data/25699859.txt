I really am not a fan of OOP languages, largely because the data flow can be anything you want it to be. When the data flow is linear I find code far more easier to understand.<p>One thing I dont like about Haskell:\nGHC doesn&#x27;t seem to be aware of some of its escape hatches (allowing for imperative code) and performs incorrect optimizations. I had some trouble working with IORef recently and had to write some hacky code to get it to work properly.')
