It&#x27;s a subscription because the value you get depends on how long you use it.  Making the price incremental (vs e.g. a one time $100 charge) means more people can try it and get value for a limited time, and only keep it if it continues to add value for them.<p>Is $100&#x2F;yr too much?  A b2b sales team might spend $400 getting a first meeting with a customer, and $10k more over the course of further meetings.  A 1h internal meeting with 10 people might cost thousands in wages.  If mmhmm makes a handful of meetings marginally more effective it will pay for itself.<p>If the product works but the price doesn&#x27;t, you may not be the intended buyer.')
