Then there will be properties of the real numbers which are independent of ZFC as a result of Godel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems.<p>This is actually not correct. The propositions that are undecidable are NOT AT ALL connected to the propositions that are independent. Things like the CH or Axiom of Determinacy have to do with providing a definition to things that have no defined truth value. But the undecidable propositions are already true or false they just can&#x27;t be listed or computed in any meaningful fashion.')
