Item(by='Stratoscope', descendants=None, kids=[25218842], score=None, time=1606346627, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25213665, text='Wait, &quot;Funner Zooming&quot; is a reference to <i>Zoom meetings</i>?<p>I saw the phrase next to the bouncing down arrow and I thought it meant that when I scrolled down, things would zoom around on the screen. Or something.<p>Perhaps my mind had been primed for that by this discussion from the other day:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25191802" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25191802</a><p>It honestly did not occur to me that the phrase had something to do with Zoom meetings. I use Zoom nearly every day but I&#x27;d never heard of Zooming before.')
