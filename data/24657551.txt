A 1 TB 980 Pro SSD (I know, not a &quot;data center&quot; SSD, but it&#x27;s the most recent Gen4 SSD I&#x27;ve seen announced) can handle ~300MB&#x2F;s [1] of random writes at realistic queue depths up to 32. Previously with 10 Gbit (1.25GB) connection, 4 of those SSDs could handle that incoming write traffic, which is no sweat and can actually physically fit on a server. But as you go to 100 Gbit (12.5GB) of incoming random writes to a storage server, something&#x27;s gotta give.  At this level of traffic, you&#x27;d need 41 of those SSDs to be able to handle that incoming traffic without a write buffer on the server. This is a simplification of a very complex topic, but it&#x27;s what I&#x2F;O bound means to me, at least.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16087&#x2F;the-samsung-980-pro-pcie-4-ssd-review&#x2F;5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16087&#x2F;the-samsung-980-pro-pci...</a>')
