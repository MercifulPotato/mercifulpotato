There is no way my complex will install chargers, until it&#x27;s required somehow. No garages here.  \nHouse prices are hovering around $500,000 in my area. With a traditional mortgage, 20% down is a lot to save up (100K).<p>--<p>This has made electric cars a unique form of social signaling: It basically states &quot;I&#x27;m a homeowner!&quot; (or can afford house rental, which is also very expensive... or went with an FHA loan&#x2F;can afford that mortgage payment)<p>There are some apartments that have charging ports, but they&#x27;re very high-end, with rents comparable to a single-family detached house anyways. They&#x27;re also very rare in my area. Sure you can charge at whatever ports are available (not many here), but (IMO) it just doesn&#x27;t make much sense to go electric and not have the ability to charge your car at home.')
