As I am a privacy-focused person the articles were of interest to me. Both times I haven&#x27;t gotten past reading the opening sentences when an obnoxious pop-up appeared asking for my email address. It seems ironic that someone publishing articles on privacy advocacy would be so keen to collect my email address. This practice also creates a real miserable experience and I have simply closed the page immediately both times. If someone is interested in subscribing to your newsletter why not simply provide a link for them to do so at the end of an article?')
