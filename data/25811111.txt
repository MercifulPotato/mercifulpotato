If you have things going on in your life and aren&#x27;t afraid to exist as a person, they will naturally gravitate to you and give you a lot of leeway. Being a nice person or an asshole is orthogonal to the issue: they are just facets that may help or hinder this depending on the situation. In fact, they are defined entirely in relation to people&#x27;s general impression of you so they have no real meaning on their own.<p>People then end up frustrated because they often confuse being weak and hollow as being nice and being assertive and self-directed with being an asshole.<p>In a way, we are Veblen goods: it&#x27;s all about status and perceived scarcity in the end, whether it&#x27;s conscious or not. That is not necessarily a negative or depressing thing as it also is the engine behind great things happening.')
