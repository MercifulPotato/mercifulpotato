Use something like TECO or ed or Rob Pike, David Tilbrook, Hugh Redelmeier and Tom Duff&#x27;s Unix version of QED [1].<p>The small LCD is for seeing the command you are currently typing and a little command history.<p>With those editors you entered editing commands but did not see the results until you asked for them. You&#x27;d tell the editor to show you the current line plus say 10 lines before and after. Then you&#x27;d give it commands to edit the current line, such as telling it to change the text &quot;float&quot; to &quot;double&quot;, or telling it to insert a new line before the current line, and so on. When you had done enough changes that you needed to refresh your notion of the current state of the file, you&#x27;d ask it to show you again.<p>Even the older generation, slower e-ink screens would be fast enough for that kind of work.<p>Maybe instead of putting the small LCD display at the bottom of the e-ink screen, make it a separate unit that can attach to the e-ink screen or attach to the top of your keyboard or stand alone somewhere if you prefer.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;phonologus&#x2F;QED" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;phonologus&#x2F;QED</a>')
