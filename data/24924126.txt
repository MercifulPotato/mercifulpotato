Nobody is forced to accept it.<p>That truly depends on your meaning of &quot;force&quot;.  For example, if I point a gun at you and tell you to give me your money or else, you are not forced to give me the money.  You still have a choice. Yet, we commonly say that someone is forced because they are compelled by the alternative being a worse option created by someone else deliberately.<p>In that sense, yes people are forced to accept that contract.<p>Although it is part of the contract, I think it&#x27;s inhumane that the contract is set up that way, and nation states should be held to higher standards than that.<p>If the contract for living in a country was that they chopped off a finger each year, would that be humane?  No it wouldn&#x27;t, and we&#x27;d protest against it.  Some people would still choose it anyway.  But something being part of a contract does not make that thing humane.<p>Why would people choose it anyway?  Because being with the person you love matters a lot to some people.<p>And it matters to me that people who love each other, whoever they are, are allowed by nation states to be together if they wish.  I consider it a basic facet of humane society to allow that.  A proper example of what ought to be a simple human right.  In the ballpark of &quot;we hold these truths to be self-evident&quot;.<p>For two people who love each other to be prevented by law from being together in either of their home countries (because it&#x27;s certainly possible for both ends to have incompatible restrictions) is, in my opinion, inhumane.<p>Also, for someone to be with someone else and then if the relationship turns sour to have the state applying enormous pressure to stay in the abusive relationship (whether with a partner or employer), that is also, in my opinion, inhumane and not a state functioning as it should.  The state&#x27;s job is to protect all people in its care, that includes all people it has accepted into its care as well.  A state is ideally held to the standards of its noble constitution.  It is not good enough to say &quot;well it was part of the contract&quot;.  We do not allow abusive terms in contracts to be upheld, even if they have been accepted.  If someone agrees to be a slave, we declare that agreement void.  Some things are struck out by courts if necessary when deciding what is right.  Same should apply, in my opinion, to this.')
