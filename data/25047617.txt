Github is that big faceless storefront. Use your own personal site, make it really simple. Now you don&#x27;t have random &quot;drive-throughs&quot;, who really don&#x27;t care about your project, but are ready to give unsolicited advice.\nNo point to have public issue tracker, when developers are known and small group.\nI like  Drew DeVault projects, like sourcehut - doing things simple and off from big corp infra.')
