The energy cost may go down over time as the block reward decays, but the economics of transaction fees taking over isn&#x27;t totally clear yet.  Block difficulty still hasn&#x27;t reached stability.<p>The speculative bubbles are a bigger problem.  Bitcoin looks like at best a $5K-$10K thing in the long term (just look at the 2018 bubble).  The argument was always &quot;with limited supply bitcoin price will go to infinity!&quot;  but there isn&#x27;t limited supply because bitcoin isn&#x27;t the only cryptocurrency.  The Bitcoin-cash split doubled the supply. Every new cryptocurrency product increases the available supply.  Smart investors will diversify cryptocurrency holdings and bitcoin will eventually be priced accordingly; the cryptocurrencies that can grow appropriately with the economy will have the most stable prices.  At least difficulty adjusts more frequently than the block reward decays so that it&#x27;s very unlikely to have a giant crash where over-invested miners all go bankrupt on a downturn and no one bothers to mine the next block.')
