Aside from that you dont hold gold in perpetuity, its for certain  several year stretches and certain decades.  I hold none just because I think btc challenges it (which is also the view of JP Morgan&#x27;s latest opinion so in decent company).<p>Second comment here: Long cyclical runs can be timed.  For instance golds decade long rip prior to the decline was due to etf introductions.<p>And no I dont think you do “got it”. You dont hold anything in existence forever.  If youre not comfortable making shifts every few years (or whatever) and having to actually do some thinking from time to time then investing isnt for you.')
