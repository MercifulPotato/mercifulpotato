If there is a reported and unfixed bug, library is marked as not safe.<p>It happened several times that there was a reported bug, which was totally bogus or added by mistake (added to wrong project for instance), however repo owner hasn&#x27;t closed it, so the tool gave false positive.<p>Obviously said tool allowed adding exception rules, etc. but I can&#x27;t imagine how annoying it would be if there were hundreds of such crappy reports and it seems we are going in that direction.<p>This looks like another consequence of globalization and leaving in the &quot;global village&quot;, everyone can jump in into someones village and do harm over there and it is hard to get rid or somehow punish such unwanted visitors.<p>People would do a lot to gain 15 minutes of fame, even if this is just wearing some t-shirt.<p>Maybe that is not a big surprise, some people beat their parents or girlfriends or boyfriends and put that on Youtube for fame and money - whole &quot;pato&quot; streamers market is built around this (with said victims participating in the show to earn even more money).')
