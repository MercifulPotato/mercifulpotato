Minimum wage in Mountain View &amp; Sunnyvale is $16.05&#x2F;hour. My wife &amp; my salaries, if converted to hourly, would be several hundred &#x2F; hour. We cook at home because we&#x27;re salaried and so don&#x27;t actually reap that opportunity cost in cash,<p>You canâ€™t say that your opportunity cost is $x and then also state you did not have a choice to earn $x.  They are contradictory statements.  Unless you are a robot capable of working as much as you want with no downtime, this type of calculation make no sense.<p>Not to mention the costs of eating out include unhealthy meals, among others.')
