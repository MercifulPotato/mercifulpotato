People want certainty that they can&#x27;t actually get. Some will even overpay 2-3x just to have it be a fixed number. Having a good process for managing change and accountability is key.<p>In the case of UpWork, a friend in California was not particularly price sensitive, he just didn&#x27;t like the bullshit. Every project would involve Skype calls in the middle of the night. He would ask for something for his website and someone would bid $500, then come back and try to fight for another $100. But if they bid $600, they would probably lose. You post a job and there are 100 similar bids. So you just choose the cheapest from the first page or two. Anyone who put any thought into the bid is on page five. And the cycle repeats.')
