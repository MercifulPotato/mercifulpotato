TPP means you can&#x27;t outsource it to China, but you can absolutely outsource it to Malaysia, Vietnam, etc. as long as they respect the IP.<p>Mixed feelings.  It has no real benefit for US workers, but, at the same time, the damage is done and US manufacturing isn&#x27;t going to magically reappear.  Might as well at least try to lock down the IP and force Asia (read: China) to play by the rules.')
