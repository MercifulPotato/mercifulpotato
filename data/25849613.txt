That is some fantastic negotiation! I thought apple made capital commits to allow factory build outs on leading nodes so they had first dibs on capacity. Amazing to hear that Intel is getting to take over the 5nm and future production from Apple &#x2F; AMD. Not too long ago they were a fab competitor, now TSMC rolls out the welcome mat!')
