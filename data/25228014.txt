Also, if you interpret then say explicitly that &#x27;my interpretation &#x2F; perception &#x2F; feeling based on fact X is Y, and feel free to disagree with the interpretation&#x27;. Eg. &quot;Maybe you just simply forget checking things locally -- do you think it would help to set up a commit hook or do you have other ideas about we could help you not breaking the build?&quot;<p>So you<p>1) declare the facts (breaking the build too often), there&#x27;s no argument about those<p>2) state your expectations as a manager (this has to stop), the person can disagree but it&#x27;s your decision as a manager to set expectations<p>3) offer one or more possible interpretation, the person can agree or disagree<p>4) offer your help, the person can take it or not')
