Doing a lookup of a problem you&#x27;ve solved in a personal project &#x2F; elsewhere you have the code for is also very quick, but not as much. Having to perform lookups is akin to having to go out to RAM. Having to ask a coworker is slower still. And the slowest is having to learn something entirely from the ground up before you can process what you are seeing.<p>It all makes a difference to your throughput, and as you say your creativity!')
