Item(by='pc86', descendants=None, kids=[24769229, 24768934], score=None, time=1602615464, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24767645, text='We had 4 precincts with two councilmembers each, and got $50&#x2F;mo for one council meeting (~2.5 hours), two caucus&#x2F;committee meetings (~2 hours each), and usually at least one event a month we tried to attend. Meetings were in the evenings about 7-10 and events were almost always an all-day Saturday affair. The terms are 4 years and staggered, so each precinct has one member up every 2 years in the off (odd) year elections. I&#x27;ve heard all kinds of different setups from single-year terms, to term limits, to staggered 5 year terms and everything in between.')
