Global politics is a game, and everyone plays it.  It involves gathering intelligence and acting on it. The work isn’t beyond reproach, and the nature of secrecy makes doing dirty things an unavoidable consequence... but ultimately you have to accept that reality is messy, the world isn’t very nice, and sometimes you don’t have a choice as a nation but to do some detestable act for some higher purpose... and rarely will it be possible for the whole story to be told publicly in order to be judged fairly.<p>Sure it would be nice if everybody stopped being so awful to each other, but you can’t pretend like that is already true if you don’t want to lose everything.<p>In plenty of circumstances intelligence agencies have done things that never should have been done, but that isn’t an argument to stop all together.')
