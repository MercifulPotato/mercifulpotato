As a result the (direct translation of the) program became more than 5 times slower, which was a deal breaker for this use case.<p>Yes, there are ways to write it in a .NET-y way in F#, but then it requires a &quot;complete&quot; rewrite and F# gives no real benefits with &quot;being similar&quot;.<p>In contrast, after that I migrated to Rust and I am delighted. I wrote about it here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24893285" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24893285</a><p>Of course, this is also a full-rewrite without using the same idioms as in OCaml (mostly because I mutate objects directly when needed) but I still think it&#x27;s much better than F# as the language (Rust) is miles ahead in the practicality domain. Indeed, it&#x27;s much better than anything I&#x27;ve seen so far. And still so very much &quot;functional&quot; and &quot;elegant&quot;. I just miss the transparent currying from OCaml.')
