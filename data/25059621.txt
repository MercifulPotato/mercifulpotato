Here are some dev SaaS examples:<p>1. SnapShooter ($1k+&#x2F;mo), a tool to create daily backups of DigitalOcean droplets:<p>&quot; I tried sponsoring blog articles with a little bit of success.&quot; [2]<p>2. BugFender ($35k&#x2F;mo), a log storage service for app devs:<p>&quot;Here&#x27;s what didn&#x27;t work: sponsoring developer newsletters and podcasts&quot; [3]<p>The reason for this (IMO) is that most products that advertise themselves (especially on dev blogs) are not unique&#x2F;compelling enough. Why should you buy a sponsored app logger when you know 10 other look-alikes with 5 other friends using them? The fact that these guys managed to invest $6k and get $200k in return from sponsoring a blog just shows how unique&#x2F;compelling&#x2F;valuable their value prop. is. Good luck!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firstpayingusers.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firstpayingusers.com</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiehackers.com&#x2F;interview&#x2F;how-starting-small-helped-me-build-a-server-backup-company-f89c5f29a0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiehackers.com&#x2F;interview&#x2F;how-starting-small-he...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiehackers.com&#x2F;interview&#x2F;turning-an-internal-company-tool-to-a-6-500-mo-side-business-edc9893da1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiehackers.com&#x2F;interview&#x2F;turning-an-internal-c...</a>')
