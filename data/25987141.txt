I did it once and got a refund from Apple, because it was an obvious case. But recently I bought an app that was not obviously problematic: it was meant to do some things, cost a few $, and did indeed do &quot;some&quot; things, however the app actually felt like a tutorial code (maybe even one from Apple) implemented and pushed to the store. Just like that, almost no features, no design or quality. It&#x27;s difficult to complain, but I clearly couldn&#x27;t know from the store itself.')
