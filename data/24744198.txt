Most such cars are expensive sports cars.<p>CitroÃ«n attempted to launch a &quot;premium&quot; brand a few years back, the DS (riding on their classic DS model [0]) and the ads at the time were showcasing the possibility of getting them in very bright colors, sometimes even multiple colors, to make a fashion statement. While the brand was somewhat successful (don&#x27;t know the actual numbers, but they are fairly common), most of the cars on the road are actually &quot;boring&quot; colors, mostly white, some shade of gray and black.<p>Two years ago I stopped at a car dealership, and they were selling some &quot;almost new&quot; second hand Seats (a subsidiary of Volkswagen). They were basically demo cars, the older model that used to be exposed in the showroom. What I remember as striking is that they had three basically identical cars (same engine, trim, etc). The only difference was the color: one basic white, one metallic red and one metallic black. The red was a somewhat bright red (think Ferrari). It was the cheapest of the three. When I asked why, the guy told me that they wouldn&#x27;t be as easy to move off the lot when second hand, so people wouldn&#x27;t want to spend as much on them. Of course, brand new, the red would be as expensive as the black one. The white was in the middle as it was the presumably &quot;cheap&quot; paint (this was an entry level Ibiza).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Citro%C3%ABn_DS" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Citro%C3%ABn_DS</a>')
