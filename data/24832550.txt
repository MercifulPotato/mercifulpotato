Which is what Uber and Epic are doing.<p>They didn&#x27;t go under when they had to start doing background checks in Austin.  They don&#x27;t go under when they have to pay benefits in Germany.  This is a stunt to make another couple percent profit.<p>At the end of the day that&#x27;s what this boils down to - they will make a little more money if they succeed, they will make a little less money if they don&#x27;t, nobody is going under.  They&#x27;re using people&#x27;s livelihoods as leverage so that they can make a couple percent more profit.')
