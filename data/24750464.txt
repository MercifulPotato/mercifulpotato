There&#x27;s junk, like in a junkyard, and then there&#x27;s a toxic waste dump. Stick with the junkyard. The stronger a show&#x27;s resemblance to your current reality, the more likely you&#x27;ll find someone in it with whom to compare yourself. So right off the bat, so-called &quot;reality&quot; TV is off the table. Anything where you&#x27;re able to forget about &quot;you&quot; and be transported into someone else&#x27;s world, is good. That takes good writing, i.e. yes, an actual script. Old stuff works too - anything so old that you can&#x27;t possibly imagine yourself in that milieu, that helps. We watch old Columbo episodes from the 70s on network TV on Sunday nights. Granted we are then bombarded with ads for Sono Bello, Consumer Cellular, and every drug on the market (and then ads for the lawyers suing the makers of last year&#x27;s drugs), and anything else an advertiser has deemed likely to appeal to the demographic that cares about Columbo or the 70s... and all those ads in themselves are an assault on your self-esteem, so just mute that shit or do chores.<p>Mostly though it just takes time to build a life, and a you, that you love enough that you win most of those comparisons to celebrities. Think about how most celebs are basically slaves in various ways: slaves to public opinion, to the Hollywood social hierarchy, to the crappy contracts under which most of them are laboring, and especially to the fear of not being famous&#x2F;loved&#x2F;accepted tomorrow, of being replaced by one of the thousands of others who (maybe just as tragically) would jump at the chance to have that person&#x27;s shitty contract and precarious perch on the ladder of fame. Slaves to the empty holes in their souls that they have been filling with the quest for fame probably their whole lives. Ah, but to the extent that you spend time on social media, seeking approval from strangers, you are (or your avatar is) kind of a micro-celebrity and would tend to be plagued by all those same problems! So yeah, that ruins it. All the more reason to get the hell off of there, ideally permanently!')
