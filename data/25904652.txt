We need science and accompanying &quot;standards&quot; to remain as they are. I&#x27;d personally rather look elsewhere before resorting to authoritarianism.<p>What we IMO need is a push towards <i>more</i> technology, actually more resource use, more science and more rational thinking of any kind in general. We need to get out of the sub-Saharan mindset. Living in harmony with nature is not, and never was, sustainable and if it ever held any weight it is now a hollow, unproductive pipe-dream. We are created to do interesting things, hence the brains. So let&#x27;s make interesting shit happen instead of waving flags in each-other&#x27;s face and complaining about not being in harmony with the gods.<p>You ask how we sell that as a sunny future? Assuming the unwashed masses want to face the truth I&#x27;d think after some scrubbing they&#x27;d generally be onboard with a rational, abundance-filled, space-faring fucking utopia. Engaging further with our cultural and religious psychoses should be disincentivized and probably banned as the extinction-level threat it is. If you ask me, nationalism is the greatest threat humanity ever faced.<p>Also - while we still have nations - not voting for raging religious demagogues would be a start.')
