Here is the relevant paragraph:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;\nIn another example from the 1990s, an open-source developer created a program called WINE, which al- lowed developers to enable Windows applications to run on computers that used the Linux open-source system, without explicit authorization from Microsoft. Gratz &amp; Lemley, supra, at 611. To create WINE, the developer “use[d] the same hierarchy of function names” of various Windows APIs. Id. at 612. Years later, Microsoft created “the inverse of WINE,” reimplementing the structure of certain Linux APIs to create the Windows Subsystem for Linux, a program that allowed Linux programs to run on Windows. Ibid. The Windows-Linux experience shows that reuse of functional code is a “two- way street” that benefits both the original creator and the follow-on developer—and ultimately the consumer.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>Not to mention there&#x27;s no monetary chest at the end of that fight (and the creation of WSL wouldn&#x27;t bode well for them if they were to make a case at all).')
