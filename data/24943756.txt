We had a nice working demo a year ago, but there&#x27;s a lot of work to make a platform like this stable. Real-time collaboration is pretty difficult by itself (especially when you&#x27;re not syncing just text), but we also had to build a computing platform where users can run arbitrary code. That opens us up to everything from a large attack surface to a huge number of quite inventive crypto miners. So we kept building in a private beta until we were confident enough to launch publicly.<p>Interestingly, ever since we started almost 2 years ago we&#x27;ve been pretty laser focused and there were minimal changes to the vision overall. But we also knew what we were going into and that it&#x27;d take time.')
