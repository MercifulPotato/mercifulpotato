Regardless, I&#x27;m not so sure &quot;consciousness&quot; depends on inputs as much. The assumption is its consciousness would be similar to our own but an organism that was created in a lab might feel entirely different such that we can&#x27;t really compare what it would be like to just take our brain and put it in a jar.<p>I believe there is some phenomena related to the way people born blind visualize or think about things, but I only vaguely remember reading about such things.')
