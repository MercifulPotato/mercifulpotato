It&#x27;s more expensive, but not <i>that</i> expensive considering I use the internet for 12+ hours per day, and I earn an IT professional&#x27;s salary. At a Â£15&#x2F;month premium over other ISPs, it&#x27;s a far cheaper luxury than a fancy car, a foreign holiday, or a pet.<p>2. ISPs I&#x27;ve used in the past have had truly shitty support - no matter how often you have problems, they&#x27;ll just tell you to restart your router and close your ticket. AAISP claims to have support that can actually investigate and solve problems. I wouldn&#x27;t know, as I&#x27;ve never had to contact their support.<p>3. I respect their pro-privacy&#x2F;anti-censorship stance.<p>4. Many ISPs that are &quot;unlimited&quot; do have limits, they just won&#x27;t tell you what they are or if you&#x27;re close to them. They&#x27;ll be in small print like a &quot;fair use policy&quot;. Having spent a month throttled by Zen (admittedly years ago) I&#x27;ll take an explicit limit over a mystery one. And AAISP&#x27;s limit is more than enough for my purposes.')
