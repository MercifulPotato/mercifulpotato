Item(by='Waterluvian', descendants=None, kids=[24958432, 24957598, 24957974, 24957101], score=None, time=1604202225, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24956156, text='I use null in data because Json.<p>But otherwise I just leave undefined to play the role of &quot;this optional argument wasn&#x27;t defined&quot; and null for everything else. I like null because You have to specifically set something as null.  I can run into undefined through typos and such. I dont think you can accidentally hit null.<p>P.s. This reminds me of the one time in Python I thought, &quot;Damn I wish I had both undefined and None&quot;. I needed to know if a user was omitting an optional argument or passing an explicit None into it. Ie. This data is optional and the data might be &quot;None&quot;. I ended up using kwargs which weakened my function as it nolonger described all the possible arguments.')
