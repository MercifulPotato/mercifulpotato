Chargers are regularly out of service, and for extended periods of time.<p>There are a few Electrify America fast chargers near that have at least 3 out of 6 chargers out of service, and have been in this state for the last 2-3 months.  EVgo chargers are so hit or miss that I don&#x27;t even bother.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to fast charge in a smaller city and required me to call in and provide my credit card # just to charge.<p>I absolutely will not take my EV on an extended drive as I don&#x27;t want to have to worry about finding a charger.')
