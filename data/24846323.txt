They do know how to ignore this though.<p>For a nice country-wide seismograph display, there is: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geonet.org.nz&#x2F;earthquake&#x2F;drums" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geonet.org.nz&#x2F;earthquake&#x2F;drums</a> though (fortunately) it&#x27;s looking a bit boring right now.')
