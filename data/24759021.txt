In a sense, this can be used to measure the state of an entangled system at great displacement &quot;faster&quot; than it would take light to travel from that distant system to the observer.  However, the state of the entangled systems is prepared before the systems are separated from one another (at much less than the speed of light.)  Any attempt to change the state of one of the entangled systems (at a distance) breaks the entanglement.  Entanglement cannot be used to communicate information from one point to another faster than the speed of light.  It certainly doesn&#x27;t allow FTL transfer of matter&#x2F;energy.')
