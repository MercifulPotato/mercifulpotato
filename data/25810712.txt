When Windows 10 decided that it must install updates, it was much worse. The computer became available after booting only after a few hours.<p>I had to waste a few days with the unhelpful Windows Knowledge Base and with some more helpful Internet forums, until I discovered how to shut down all the Windows services that wanted to write to the SSD during booting, so that eventually the booting time of Windows reached an acceptable value of less than a minute.<p>On the same hardware Linux booted almost instantly, because the SSD reading speed was decent, unlike its writing speed.<p>There are Linux distributions that I do not use, e.g. Ubuntu, and I would not be surprised if those also come with default configurations that attempt to write during booting, e.g. for updating file indexing databases, or other such crap.')
