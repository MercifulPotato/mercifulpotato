China has far more software engineers than we do, all willing to work 996. They&#x27;ll steal our tech and our data until they&#x27;re ahead, then shut us off.<p>We already lost our manufacturing industry. Our tech, entertainment, knowledge, and capital are next. China has bought our biggest gaming and media companies.<p>We need to shut the CCP off. Yesterday.<p>Biden needs to create easy immigration programs for Hong Kong and mainland residents.<p>The recent Capitol shit show needs to be quickly dealt with and we need to take back our leadership role. Our image matters.<p>Hollywood needs to step in line and stop kowtowing. Where&#x27;s the \n&quot;Chernobyl&quot; series equivalent for Tiananmen? The Tibetans and Uyghurs?<p>This is the most important issue of our time.<p>I know the Chinese loyalists and many Europeans that hate the US are going to downvote me, but this should be the priority of all democracies. If the CCP reaches the top, it imperils democracy.')
