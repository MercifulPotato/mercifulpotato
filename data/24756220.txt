As it stands, I&#x27;m waiting for nice weather on a weekend in the Fall, and I&#x27;ll probably end up at the mechanic.<p>And economy of scale doesn&#x27;t just apply to LHD&#x2F;RHD, but the parts necessary to implement drive-by-wire can be shared between makes and models -- a Fiat won&#x27;t need as much torque to steer as a Peterbilt, but in theory a huge amount of that system could be shared.  That can significantly reduce engineering costs as well.')
