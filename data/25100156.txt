E.g. in bed upstairs and light is on downstairs?  Plus would one clap not turnnoff everything that hears a clap, and not just the thing you want off but leave other things on? And can it auto clap itself off&#x2F;on at certain times when you are asleep&#x2F;not there? Can it hear you clap when it is at home and you are in your car&#x2F;at work?   And <i>only</i> 300% as expensive as a WiFi switch?  Bargain.<p>But you know, when my hands are full I can just put everything down and rub two sticks together to make a fire just fine. The power of humanity&#x27;s intellect and dominion over nature is a wonderful thing and making fire is a privilege that not all mammals have that I plan to use for as long as I can - 4000 BC&#x27;s technology to the rescue &lt;&#x2F;sarcasm to illustrate a point&gt;<p>So much technology could easily be done &quot;the old way&quot; (fire to oil lamps to candles to gas lamps to electric lamps for example all make the room bright I&#x27;m the darkness), but it makes things simpler&#x2F;more convenient&#x2F;easier&#x2F;etc.  This is one of them IMO')
