Rust managed to use the borrow checker to avoid dynamic allocation with coroutines. I wonder how Zig handles this, and I hope it&#x27;s not through undefined behavior.<p>From reading it over, it looks like Zig does use dynamic memory for coroutines but it requires the memory to be passed in at the point of construction. That has some pros and cons to it and is consistent with Zig&#x27;s overall approach so I can respect that choice.')
