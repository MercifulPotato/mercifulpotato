Maybe we should have printed a notice on the command line tool itself ;-)<p>More seriously, one major issue with the 0.x versions was that bad performance meant we couldn&#x27;t really test it massively. But now we can, and actually one of my first tests was to try and import the history of Nixpkgs, and run massive checks for data loss after every operation. It works now.')
