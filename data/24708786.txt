It seems like a nice simple reduction but they&#x27;re very different things.<p>Corporations don&#x27;t run as household budgets, neither should governments.<p>Two main differences, growth and taxation.  Growth means that economically you can outspend your &quot;budget&quot; every year and still come out ahead because that spend this year makes next year&#x27;s budget larger.  Taxation means your can spend money on any one initiative and if it increases economic activity in any way you can make it back via unrelated taxes without increasing any tax rates or fees.<p>Households have neither of these options.')
