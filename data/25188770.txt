Based on the news you&#x27;d think US is over spending by records numbers.  The numbers are records but as a percentage of GDP they are not.  Another surprise is the S&amp;P PE ratio.  I thought it was really high now, but actually 2008 was the high point by about twice as much.  Again, no context in the article, but these were my takeaways.  All the other charts are saddening. Maybe the point is sow fear uncertainly and despair to pump bitcoin?')
