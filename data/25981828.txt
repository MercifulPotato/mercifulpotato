Imagine a production capacity of 2.000.000 doses per week, it would take AZ 50 WEEKS TO FULFILL THIS ORDER.<p>And 8 weeks before delivery is when they realize that they will miss the delivery by 70.000.000 doses? Are you kidding me?<p>70.000.000 is enough to give immunize plenty of European countries alone, and they remember to notify the EU few weeks before their delivery.')
