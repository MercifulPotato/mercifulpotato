This debate over the covid vaccines is getting weird. Especially when it comes to the HN demographic, I&#x27;m pretty sure 99%+ are perfectly fine with vaccines in general. As I am. Vaccines and a lot of modern pharmaceuticals are awesome and save many, many lives. However, I&#x27;m super against rushed, politicized pharmaceuticals. Especially when there are hundreds of millions of dollars in profit to be made. Big pharma isn&#x27;t exactly known for doing the right thing when big money is on the line... ever.<p>As you mentioned, vaccines are not safe because they are vaccines. They&#x27;re safe because of the exhaustive testing trails. A majority of the forced vaccines have been tested for many decades, those are fine (speaking from a USA perspective). The problem we face now, the anti-vax idiots muddied the waters of actual problems of some vaccines. It&#x27;s hard to determine what&#x27;s true and what&#x27;s just stupid. This is why it&#x27;s important not to overblow anything. It makes it harder to weed out true, legit problems that can be legitimately fixed.')
