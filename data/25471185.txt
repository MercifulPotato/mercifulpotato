Tho they can be kind of a deal-breaker when they happen during scenes that are supposed to have an emotional impact.<p>Like when a character you are supposed to care for is about to die, and their gun suddenly flies inside their head to get stuck there, while the drama keeps playing out regardless of how absurd it look.<p>I had to literally lol at that, but it really took me out of the moment&#x2F;the mood the scene was actually going for.')
