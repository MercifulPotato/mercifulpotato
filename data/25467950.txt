I can&#x27;t put my finger on it, but my comparisons come from playing the same title on PC&#x2F;Steam. Cyberpunk seems to have none to very little lag. And that&#x27;s playing with the chrome cast device on my wireless, Chromium on Linux via ethernet and Chrome on macOS. All platforms work great with Cyberpunk, but Destiny 2 is another story.')
