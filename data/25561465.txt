It&#x27;s an industry where the &quot;best practice&quot; is still reinvent as many wheels as possible every other game and open source little to nothing. The worst mistakes of the worst games&#x2F;studios should likely remain a valid indictment of the industry as a whole when the industry itself is so focused on making sure the tide rises as few boats as possible.')
