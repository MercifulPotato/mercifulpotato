The potential benefits must outweigh the risk of hardship and inconvenience.  Often the majority of workers support the strike because they are in a shared situation and will all receive some level of benefit if it works.<p>A consumer union, to have enough momentum to actually make the Googles and Amazons even blink, would need hundreds of thousands of members.  That vast quantity would need to agree to collective action and then follow through.  If the consumer union reps determined the best way to convince Google to make a change was to hit them in the pocket book then the majority of the union members would have to cancel subscriptions and deal with the inconvenience.<p>It is my pessimistic opinion that the general consumer base would not follow through on whatever action the union selected.  In the unlikely event they did follow through, even a hundred thousand users dropping a Google product or leaving Amazon Prime would barely impact those companies enough to make them alter their policies or improve their service levels.')
