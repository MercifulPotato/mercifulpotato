Rinse, repeat.<p>This attack is what locked bootloaders on cellphones are supposed to prevent.  I don&#x27;t support bootloader-locking, but it&#x27;s confusing that Apple is bringing locked-bootloader smartphone-style security to their laptops+desktops and then opening up a gaping hole that they worked so hard to close on the iPhone.  Seems incoherent.')
