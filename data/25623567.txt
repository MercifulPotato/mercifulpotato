The first is when a company is already using the JVM and so knows how to deploy and monitor it; in that case, it’s easy to choose because it presumably imposes limited burdens on the company’s operations people. The second case is when you want access to some mature environment, so that all kinds of packages and services are available to support it, but don’t have a commitment to any one in particular yet, and Clojure qualifies because of the JVM; in that case, a non-JVM language like Python, PHP, or Ruby might also work.')
