I barely even use it so all my information is second-hand.<p>&gt; Why is Twitter encouraging outrage-engagement via the (somewhat filtered) Trending section?<p>We&#x27;re not, at least not intentionally.  Do you think we are?  If so, why?<p>The Trending section is still biased towards things that are being talked about frequently.  Unfortunately, that means outrage-inducing topics will tend to bubble up there.  We&#x27;re working on making trend identification more sophisticated in order to provide better context, but it&#x27;s a really hard problem with such short snippets of context.<p>&gt; Why aren&#x27;t you actively trying to decrease political engagement if it&#x27;s a net negative?<p>&quot;Political engagement&quot; overlaps with, but is not synonymous with, &quot;outrage engagement&quot;.  Outrage engagement is a net negative; political engagement that does not devolve into misinformation and toxicity is not.  We <i>are</i> actively trying to decrease engagement with misinformation and outrage, but it&#x27;s a hard problem.  Also, frankly, it&#x27;s being hampered by a lack of focus internally that is leaving the teams involved with no clear direction other than &quot;do something, now!&quot;.<p>Non-toxic political engagement is a net positive for us.  We don&#x27;t want to throw the baby out with the bathwater by shutting it all down, assuming we even could (it&#x27;s fundamentally the same problem, though a little bit easier).  I see how other people might see that as the better option to shut down the toxicity and misinformation, though.')
