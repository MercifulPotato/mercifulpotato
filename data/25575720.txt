How using misleading or bad metrics can lead to a mistrust in what is being conveyed?<p>Think &quot;Reefer madness&quot; and all the bunk science out about Marijuana in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s.  Did anyone trust the information coming out at that time?  I would hazard most in their teens and twenties didn&#x27;t, which is exactly who that information was intended to sway.<p>Trust is important.  If people don&#x27;t trust that what you&#x27;re saying is accurate because it&#x27;s easy to point out the shortcuts taken that muddy the results, I think eventually they are going to look at most results about that subject with a grain of salt.  At that point they&#x27;ve been trained to do so.<p>The best ammo against a problem is clear and accurate information.  Not fear-mongering and FUD, or even something adjacent that&#x27;s just imprecise enough to be easily called into question.  All that does is cause confusion and arguments over veracity.')
