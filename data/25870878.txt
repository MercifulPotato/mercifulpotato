I never paid for a museum in England either anyway (other than voluntary donations). In New Zealand it&#x27;s free too.<p>In the Netherlands it&#x27;s pretty expensive, but a number of museums have a &quot;free day&quot; once a month.<p>My biggest problem is actually not so much the price, but rather the opening times, which tend to be during office hours: when people are working. I would love it if more museums would be open until 21:00 or 22:00.')
