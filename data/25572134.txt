I think examples in the article are all just accidental complexity.<p>Essential complexity from how I read Fred Brooks is a domain knowledge like what an accountant does and what features he is using. All frameworks, servers and doing scp or queries in that is accidental complexity.<p>Accountant does not need any React or Angular front end, they don&#x27;t need a server.<p>Where angular brings in reduction in accidental complexity since by using it I don&#x27;t have to build a lot of stuff from scratch, it does not make tax laws any simpler. Where tax laws are essential complexity that needs to be coded in accounting software.<p>The same with servers, going to cloud so reducing my accidental complexity by removing need to deal with servers is not making tax laws simpler or easier to grasp.<p>This way in my opinion, essential complexity and accidental complexity holds really well as general idea.')
