C? Doubtful. And in no way is it &quot;tiny&quot; compared to anything. C++ might feel enormously bigger but that&#x27;s because everything is actually specified.<p>Imagine how big the borrow checker specification would be if it existed! Or the specification for the requirements for writing safe `unsafe` code - last time I checked nobody was really sure what the precise answer to that even is.')
