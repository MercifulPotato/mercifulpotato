Or just - &quot;conciseness is a good thing&quot;?<p>How would you rewrite that example, specifically, to make it more concise without sacrificing clarity, then? Do you mean to change the names without omitting type or relational information somehow? Or to omit some variables entirely in favor of nesting function calls?<p>If the latter, I don&#x27;t see the relevance to that commenter&#x27;s actual point about short vs long names; reducing the number of names is entirely tangential.')
