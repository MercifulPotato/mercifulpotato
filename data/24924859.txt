It&#x27;s clunky, runs very slow, and because the interface is not standard UI, it&#x27;s just programmer game engine UI it comes off as very very hard to use. Currently, the best product out there is Tabletopia in terms of usability, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tabletopia.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tabletopia.com</a> I recommend you give it a try.<p>On that front, I&#x27;m very aggressively attempting to tackle this part of the market because even Tabletopia has major issues with usability in places. Developers often get confused and think these systems require massive user and permissioning systems, and lots of interaction structure, which is a wrong assumption. Turns out people just want to play games. To that I say, stop building token locking systems into engines, stop building complex joining systems!<p>Playtable requires no account, merely requires you to give a link to your friends to join. The problem is we&#x27;re only tackling D&amp;D and tabletop RPGs at the moment but I hope we&#x27;ll expand out to other systems later.')
