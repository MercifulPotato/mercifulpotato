For example, how much of The Party elite was women? Virtually none :) Sexism was through the roof too.<p>IIRC the &quot;less equality = more women engineers&quot; example was India. And USSR was somewhat similar to modern India. On paper women were on par (= purely technocratic acceptance to universities) but day-to-day life was different. &quot;Pursue your passion&quot; was not an option. So if a girl was smart in maths, engineering it is. Fatherland needed engineers, not people in BS studies who&#x27;d work in Starbucks afterwards.')
