I couldn’t really wrap my head around the proposed API changes for PyMC4. I find PyMC3 to be a pleasure to work with and understand!<p>Will the JAX backend and integration with external JAX modules mean that we’ll see improvements to PyMC3’s variational inference module? That would really increase the versatility of PyMC3 for probabilistic modelling in Python.')
