Now I’m content to let it be a black box I don’t have to think about, so I run it in Docker.  It saves a ton of time and hassle.<p>Docker adds a lot of value when devs ignore the best practice advice of putting everything in a separate container.  That’s just a package manager with extra steps IMO.  It’s the mini distro style containers like GitLab’s that can save you a masssive amount of time.')
