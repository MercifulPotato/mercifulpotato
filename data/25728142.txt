A lot of it used to just be tumblr kids with wealthy parents trying to talk about privledge, but here we are again.<p>Its also a movement that becomes quite discriminatory. The removal of slave&#x2F;master is discriminatory to BDSM.<p>Almost all of it is of course based on a lack of understanding to the english language. People glance over context and circumstances now, and will boldly claim &quot;context doesn&#x27;t matter&quot;. Which is entirely demonstrably false. But again - these people don&#x27;t care about what&#x27;s true, they have too much time on their hands and words are easier to do something about than to delve into something effective like their cities council and politics.<p>Nobody ever meant mitm to only mean a man, the declaration of independence did not only mean men. &#x27;man&#x27; is used contextually as essentially a definition for homo sapien.')
