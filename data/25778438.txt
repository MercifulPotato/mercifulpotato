It also makes it somewhat easier to capture Xkb &#x2F; Xinput events purely through API, without need for any elevation or excessive polling of the devices (&quot;it just works&quot;).<p>That includes any systems you might have SSHed into with X forwarding enabled, as it automatically extends the trust there. Yes, your ssh client might try to enable X SECURITY extension (which clamps acesss to just the current window), but it is disabled by default or bypassed anyway by the users as that extension is known to crash quite a few programs.<p>Both are a product of their time when the prevailing approach was to trust the programs you run.')
