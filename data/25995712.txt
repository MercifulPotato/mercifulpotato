I couldn&#x27;t finish REAMDE and Seveneves convinced me that I may not read another one of his books again, unless it debuts to unanimous critical acclaim or something similar.  I thought the ending of Cryptonomicon was pretty weak but the rest of the novel leading up to it was so fantastic that I didn&#x27;t care.  Honestly I found the Baroque Cycle to have the best ending of any of his works, and I would describe it as the one time I was happy with both the journey <i>and</i> the destination of a Stephenson novel.')
