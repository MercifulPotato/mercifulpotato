The computation is done in tubes via chemical reactions. The inputs (column and row) are specified by providing a variable concentration of two input solutions to the same base solution which encodes the ray marching algorithm. The scene is static, but you can theoretically sample it at arbitrary points and resolutions by varying the inputs.')
