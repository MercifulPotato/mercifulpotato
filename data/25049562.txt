Windows on ARM has no native support for WPF, WinForms, or WinUI.<p>Visual Studio 2019 running as x86 32bits application can&#x27;t see the local machine as a target for aarch64 applications. When I asked microsoft, the response was to use a x86-64 machine to develop on the same LAN as the aarch64 machine and use remote debugging. So you need two machines to ship a desktop application.<p>This is bad, and part of the reason there are so few app running natively on the Surface Pro X.')
