Whether the truth is in the majority or minority wouldn’t matter. The challenge is how to distinguish lies from truth. For what it’s worth the court system tends to be a place where that actually holds (discovered lies have a penalty). I think something similar could be done in the public square for public personalities as those personalities have an outsized influence on the public. In other words, as a public figure if you make blatantly false statements you open yourself to law suits where you have to demonstrate you had a good faith reason for your statement. This would instantly quash a lot of bullshit that politicians and celebrities spew with minimal downsides.<p>It’s the same line of reasoning that prevents public figures from suing people who make fun of them - when you’re a public figure you have an outsized responsibility to the public good.')
