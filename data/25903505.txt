I suspect it&#x27;s mostly maxed out in most places. Both because of geography and policy reasons. It&#x27;s more two things:<p>1) The hydro we have on the total grid is enough to balance how much wind+solar? There are countries with a lot more hydro resources than others (e.g., Norway has an even more hydro-based mix than Portugal) that could potentially allow a healthier grid mix with better interconnects. New interconnects have been announced but I haven&#x27;t found a source for a total opportunity.<p>2) How much of the hydro we have can be converted to pumped hydro to use as a battery. If you see the spreadsheet Portugal pumps in reverse about 14% of the energy. Not all dams have the geography for it but even the ones that do may not have the requisite hardware for it. How much can this be expanded?')
