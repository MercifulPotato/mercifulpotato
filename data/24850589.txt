Item(by='pmdulaney', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603304586, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24848335, text='There are fewer women in STEM for the same reason there are fewer women who collect garbage: there are other lines of work that they can perform as well or better and which they enjoy more. The example that seems to pop up in the news the most is that women who are capable of doing top notch engineering work are often equally capable in other lines of work (e.g., law, management, medicine) that they enjoy more. We also repeatedly see research stating that the countries in which women have the most degree of personal autonomy and freedom are the ones in which they are least likely to be in tech.<p>The meme which needs to be stopped is: We need more women in  tech. No, we don&#x27;t! Men in tech need to behave themselves in terms of harrassment and providing equal opportunity to flourish, but we only need more women in tech to the extent that more women <i>want</i> to be in tech.')
