The meds don&#x27;t have the same high of alcohol or weed, but there&#x27;s definitely an occasional deep sense of calm and wellness - one that&#x27;s hard not to want, being my chronically depressed self. Definitely enough to set off my &quot;never abuse this, it will end badly&quot; mental alarm<p>Otherwise though, it checks all the usual boxes - way easier to sit still and be quiet, way easier to do the thing I intended to do when I sat down to do it, way easier to get in and out of focus. Also improved my sleep schedule a surprising amount - between it and melatonin, I&#x27;ve moved from 6am-3pm to ~12am-8:30am, which is wildly outside any of the expectations I&#x27;ve seen set for pharmaceutical remedies, and puts me firmly in &#x27;able to hold a normal adult job without killing yourself through sleep deprevation&#x27; territory.<p>Honestly almost annoying it has such a positive effect since the practical difference between that and addiction are pretty minimal on a short-term basis. I&#x27;m deeply uncomfortable with the idea of having to go without it or something filling the same brain-holes for a long period of time precisely because I&#x27;m basically worthless without it, in a way I didn&#x27;t really come to appreciate until after starting medication.')
