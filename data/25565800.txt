Let me ask a question.<p>Why do you think that cheaper development costs will ultimately lead to lower drug prices?<p>I think we would both agree that drugs are not priced based on cost. Even if R&amp;D were 10X cheaper - all else equal - prices are not coming down.<p>So what is the mechanism you think will lead to lower prices given lower costs of R&amp;D?<p>Another question: Maybe as a patient (or a doctor), I like the better than the beetles problem.  I don&#x27;t need a thousand drugs on the market to treat every indication.  Especially ones that have not passed a high bar for efficacy.  I need a few drugs, preferably outside of patent protection, with enough diversity in structure to avoid specific toxicity effects.<p>If lowering the efficacy standards doesn&#x27;t get me treatment for new indications, why would I want it?  It&#x27;s not clear to me that solving better than the beetles gets me to new indications.  Presumably if I&#x27;m in a regime where BTTB applies, I&#x27;ve got a drug for that.')
