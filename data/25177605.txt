It is not just Zoom and OneNote but app compatibility is very important for developers and I think most developers(except iOS devs) would perhaps want to sit out the release. There is no docker. VirtualBox will probably never work on Apple M1, so an escape to Linux VM is not available if you need. Parallels and Vmware  Fusion may work someday but you will end up paying for those and someone should do performance&#x2F;battery comparison if I am going to run a VM all day. Things like Emacs don&#x27;t work yet  and only information available about this is from obscure twitter threads.')
