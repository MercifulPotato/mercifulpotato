Please do NOT simulate this type of gaming when the platform experience is vastly different: human hands versus a touchpad (mouse). Why do I need a 3d view?<p>We played a TTS game where we needed to pay coins, make change, and take resources each turn. We tried to stack the coins and they would not stack. We tried to take multiple resources and it would not let us, so we took them one-by-one. A painful experience.<p>We use BoardGameArena, Yucata, and Boiteajeux. All which have interface problems, but vastly superior for speed.<p>One of my pet projects is to make an open source, self-hosting, modular tabletop gaming platform, so this way ANYONE can write a &#x27;module&#x27; and share it, and leave the hosting up to the individuals.')
