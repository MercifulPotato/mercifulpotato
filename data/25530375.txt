Basically you request it whenever you think it&#x27;s appropriate, but the system decides whether it actually gets displayed.<p>Unfortunately, without asking for reviews, an app won&#x27;t get many, and reviews on the app store make a way bigger difference to sales than you&#x27;d think. Most developers I know don&#x27;t want to nag people for a review, but incentives are such that it&#x27;s important to their bottom line to do so.<p>The good news is that they can be disabled altogether for apps using the system API. Open the Mac App Store app, go to Preferences, and there&#x27;s an &quot;In-App Ratings &amp; Reviews&quot; box you can uncheck. There&#x27;s a similar option on iOS somewhere too.')
