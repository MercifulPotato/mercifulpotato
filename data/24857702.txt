Who cares that the rich can pay their way through it. That&#x27;s normal. They have more money than time typically anyway. To me though, this just sounds like lower income types who are avoiding it. They also value their time but don&#x27;t have money to &quot;buy it back&quot; so to speak. Essentially it&#x27;d be a tax on people committing crimes. Is that really such a ridiculous system as opposed to a criminal justice such as ours?')
