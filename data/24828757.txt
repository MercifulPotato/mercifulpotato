Unlimited domains and aliases. However, it only provides a single <i>user</i> per subscription. In other words, it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re the only one using it and you&#x27;re in control of all the other domains. If you&#x27;re setting a client up with email at their own domain, it will cost an additional $40ish&#x2F;year for their Fastmail user account.<p>I would love to find a good email provider that provides unlimited domains <i>and users</i>, and limits only storage capacity.')
