The problem here is that the leadership clearly doesn&#x27;t really care. They got a complaint, they &quot;investigated,&quot; and they moved on. Classic &quot;governance&quot; - totally ineffective.<p>I definitely don&#x27;t have the experience you do, but the regular judicial system (in most countries that aren&#x27;t kafka-esque throughout history) has adversarial parties that are incentivized to find if the other party is wrong. That&#x27;s very different from all the corporate, university or open source &quot;governance&quot; systems. Maybe they can&#x27;t bear that additional cost, but it&#x27;s a huge difference.')
