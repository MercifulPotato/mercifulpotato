Yes?  And?<p>You&#x27;re also saying &quot;The US is wealthy, people are paid more there, that&#x27;s not fair&quot;.  Yes?  What&#x27;s you&#x27;re point?<p>Nothing is entirely fair.  Other political and economic systems suck too.  So?<p>Don&#x27;t conflate &quot;companies paying by a logical, sensible, fair means under a free market economy&quot; with &quot;Turkey is a poorer country, due to social, cultural, historical issues, and therefore, someone 1&#x2F;2 a world away should help.  And not help my entire country, but just give me a few random people, software engineers, more wealth.&quot;<p>If Turkish law, case history, employment law, market and economics was the same, then likely there would be more upward pressure on wages.  In other words, the way to &quot;fix&quot; this, is to make Turkey a 100% clone of the US, along with all of its history, and most importantly, with the cultural outlook many have in the US.<p>But I bet that isn&#x27;t what a lot of people in Turkey want, is it?')
