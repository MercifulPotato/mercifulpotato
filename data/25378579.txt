To me that implies manipulating votes. I don’t think releasing information can ever count as “stealing” an election. Certainly that doesn’t justify calling him “illegitimate.” If those emails changed the outcome of the election, that’s only because the information was probative to voters.<p>To use a legal analogy, I don’t see political discourse as being something where there should be judges excluding unreliable or prejudicial materials. Information is fair game.')
