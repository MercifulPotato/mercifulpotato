Winter tires are a must if you want to have any kind of traction (and no, 4WD &#x2F; AWD is not a suitable replacement), and you definitely have to avoid sudden moves (my dad taught me to &quot;drive with an egg under your foot&quot;). Adjusting speed to the traction conditions is something I suspect a computer could do much better than I.<p>Having the lane markings be covered is also a challenge, but we usually find the lanes by looking at the road more broadly. If there is any kind of traffic, you&#x27;ll get &quot;tracks&quot; pretty quick, too.<p>I strongly suspect we&#x27;ll need a lot more AI training before we see a good FSD solution for colder climates, as it&#x27;s very different from summer driving.')
