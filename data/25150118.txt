Should we maybe look for solutions that don&#x27;t involve too much software, as the footprint of everything software (taken widely and including intensive machine learning, for example) is already pretty big?<p>- on the other hand: assuming software is required &quot;in large amounts&quot;, maybe there is room for heavily optimising all the things involved in building and running software.<p>With the observations above, if I&#x27;m interested in continuing to work with software, working on computational efficiency questions could be interesting and possibly useful.')
