Item(by='brundolf', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604557418, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24979129, text='Lots of interesting thoughts, and a good outline of ownership&#x27;s limitations, but I think some big leaps were made. &quot;Fatal flaw&quot; is quite a hyperbole, and the comparison to OOP, while interesting, is much too hand-wavy to be used as evidence for that assertion.<p>But they were spot-on about what is arguably Rust&#x27;s biggest weakness, and the things people do to work around it, and I think there&#x27;s kind of an open question whether that status-quo can be improved upon. I.e. Rust right now is excellent at certain things (&quot;linear things&quot;), and okay at non-linear things. But could it be made to be really good for the latter too? Or will it remain somewhat confined to its specialization? The language occupies uncharted territory either way, so these kinds of questions are not surprising, and I for one am excited to see where things go.')
