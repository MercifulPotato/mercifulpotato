The engine is really impressive, there&#x27;s a ton of assets, high res textures, it&#x27;s easy to create a natural looking terrain, but then bringing it to life is hard work and takes skills. Everything I built looked clunky, out of place, lacked details, lighting seemed off, it was rubbish. Minecraft fixes this problem. Everyone can build good looking stuff.<p>A lot of this is probably lighting. Lighting is hugely important for things to look good. Not just photorealism high-res whatever. Dynamic raytraced super expensive lighting looks good. Old school, fake lighting where everything is automatically lit is also good. Poorly configured lighting is very bad.<p>Minecraft has good enough lighting by default. Unreal does not. I don&#x27;t care much about high quality graphics, but I don&#x27;t think I agree with your hypotheses about lower quality being better for imagination though. It&#x27;s just another sort of uncanny valley.<p>If you want the 1 minute laydown on good enough unreal light:\n* Put a directional light in the scene\n* Set it&#x27;s property that says its a sun\n* Set it to mobile (so it doesn&#x27;t try to bake things)\n* Add a sky atmosphere and set all of its light scattering colors to black (so it gets its colors realistically from the sun)<p>As a non artist, the lighting and atmosphere functionality of unreal is probably my favorite feature: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;SeNM9zBPLCA?t=932" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;SeNM9zBPLCA?t=932</a>')
