That is the sort of &quot;high crime and misdemeanor&quot; that clearly falls in the remit of impeachment, and Congress has the ability and the moral duty to say that the president is <i>not</i> above the law and should face punishment for his actions, even if it is at the very end of his term.<p>&gt; he has repeatedly been saying he wants a peaceful transition<p>I don&#x27;t believe him. I don&#x27;t think he has actually conceded that he lost the election yet (he hadn&#x27;t as of last Thursday--his video was only &quot;the closest he&#x27;s come to conceding&quot;, not an actual concession). Some of the reports of last Wednesday have said that he was initially happy that the mob had invaded the Capitol, and I haven&#x27;t seen any signs of genuine remorse. As far as I&#x27;m aware, he has yet to criticize any of his followers who had done actions such as break into and vandalize federal property, which he was oh-so-incensed about 6 months ago.')
