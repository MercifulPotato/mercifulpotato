Instead, seek out people who have chronic illness and are living the sort of life you want. Develop individual friendships with them, and learn from them.<p>Totally. The more I think about the disease and difficulties, the unhappier I am. If I don&#x27;t read that garbage the unhappiness and bitterness subsides into a dull background noise.<p>---<p>I&#x27;m epileptic. I don&#x27;t deal with it well at all. I hate it and it annoys the hell out of me. There is the giant, &quot;what if&quot; fear that overshadows pretty much everything I do, including going to sleep. Fortunately, I have a good pulse on how I&#x27;m feeling (i.e. if I&#x27;m going to have a seizure in the next few days), and I know what I need to adjust in order to keep the seizures mostly at bay.<p>Apart from medication, the most important thing to keep in check is diet. I&#x27;ve found intermittent fasting and low-carb&#x2F;gi help the most, it&#x27;s annoying to keep up, but if I fast in the morning (aka skip breakfast, or keep my a.m. meals keto), then I can generally coast and not have to worry about seizures too much, but if I eat a moderate amount of higher-gi carbs, then I will likely have a period of a few days where I have partial seizures.')
