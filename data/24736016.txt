Broadcom would be glad to sponsor something like Verilog&#x2F;VLSI engineering tools. Maybe like an FPGA board that implements certain Broadcom proprietary instruction sets and lets people use that as an onboarding ramp to get them inducted in a &quot;first hit&#x27;s free&quot; kinda way.<p>Broadcom customers buy chips in order to build other electronic products. Not to learn or program python or even C&#x2F;C++. The original intent of the Rpi as an embedded controller is closer to what Broadcom wanted to do, and likely was how RPi talked them into agreeing with the whole thing in the first place.<p>That market position has been taken over by the arduino family though, so the positioning of Rpi within the Broadcom general strategy isn&#x27;t well matched.')
