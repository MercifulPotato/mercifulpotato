However, the systems I see online are inadequate to capture the full scope of the idea.<p>We&#x27;re now at a place where we don&#x27;t need someone telling us about a bombing: we can see the video that some guy who caught it on the ground had randomly uploaded.<p>When I look at things like NYT&#x2F;Reuters, I see a conventional &quot;blog&quot;: paid specialists writing eloquent depictions of what happened. If I look at Facebook&#x2F;Twitter, I see algorithmically tailored feeds of what people want, but precisely as people see it.<p>Is it possible to converge the two? If so, what kind of framework would you expect to see? And, from a critical mass standpoint, how do we make it the Wikipedia of social media?')
