A non-US person using a US service at least inherits whatever procedural protections US companies have. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a meaningful barrier, just that going overseas logically can&#x27;t <i>gain</i> you protection (unless you&#x27;re more worried about the Swiss or EU&#x27;s sigint agencies than you are the NSA).')
