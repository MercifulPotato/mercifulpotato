Hopefully, this will make it easier for their friends to switch too. So if you were unable to switch a few years ago, try again! People may be easier to convince than you thought.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;whatsapp-facebook-data-share-notification&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;whatsapp-facebook-data-share-not...</a>')
