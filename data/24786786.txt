But my German in not that good, and prefer English.<p>Not having local amazon blows.  You can buy prime but shipping isn&#x27;t free or next day (best case 3 days usual  around 5), a lot of the shows wont show etc.   Also random thing will decide that they wont ship from one amazon, but will ships from some other.  Also returns are expensive.')
