Red Hat has now pulled the rug out from under them by trimming eight years off the EOL previously committed to with little notice.<p>EOL in this case means &quot;no security updates&quot; so even if your org was prepared, technically, to deal with a zero-day for example by rolling out an update in a timely manner without relying on paying a vendor for hand-holding, that option has now been eliminated.<p>Essentially, you now only get the stability and problem-minimization if you also pay the vendor for support. Otherwise you&#x27;re stuck with a (relatively) unstable rolling release that will keep your internal teams <i>very</i> busy with a constant stream of minor issues, or potentially trying to roll-your-own updates or backports after the EOL for anything serious.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to see this as anything other than a naked, money-grabbing betrayal of users.')
