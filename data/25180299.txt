Item(by='firethief', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606073608, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25171056, text='&gt; The coin toss example given here seems tautological. Why would my unfair coin have to abide by some norm of probability? If I were designing such a coin, it would obviously include a mechanism for tracking state such that if the last toss was heads the next would always be tails.<p>If a stateful coin is permitted, the problem is indeed trivial; but if we start with the assumption that the problem isn&#x27;t trivial, we can assume a &quot;passive&quot; coin more in line with the intuitions most people would have about coins.')
