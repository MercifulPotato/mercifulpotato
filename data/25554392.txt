At least for me the energy transport cost is separated out (as the energy production and energy distribution are separate companies&#x2F;services) and comes out to something like 40% of pre-tax electricity cost.<p>6% is in the ballpark of <i>electricity loss</i> during transmission (and even that is on the low end - depending on how the last mile delivery is done, the lower voltage cables and transformers near the consumer can easily push it up to 10%+), but that isn&#x27;t the main part of the cost, that is dominated by the cost of building and maintaining the delivery infrastructure.')
