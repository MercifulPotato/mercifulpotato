I think that peaked in the oughties, and that the profession&#x27;s renown&#x27;s been in a slow decline since. This may in part be due to how replaceable and commoditized their industries have made them.<p>The average person may lust after famous person &#x27;x&#x27;, or be jealous of their resources. They may even follow them as a sideshow. But I&#x27;ve met very few people who want to be a celebrity, or admire more than one or two for their contributions to the world.<p>Celebrities may be able to capture our attention better, but put your average celebrity next to a reasonably successful entrepreneur, and ask the average person which is more praiseworthy, or admirable, and I think the entrepreneur will win 80% of the time (I say 80% of the time, because I&#x27;m certain a small number of high-level athletes and musicians break that rule)')
