I moved to C# when dotnet was released shortly after, but still have a personal website that&#x27;s built with PHP, and a couple of years back I updated it (from something like PHP 4&#x2F;5, I forget) to the latest version PHP. I was pleasantly surprised - it wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice by a long shot, but I can see why others would choose it today. And there&#x27;s always been a good community around it too.<p>I also started with JavaScript a long time back, maybe something like 1998-1999. I&#x27;ve always found it a most <i>loathsome</i> language, and the anaemic standard library a huge barrier. It&#x27;s not entirely the language&#x27;s fault, of course - being the language of the web was always going to mean glacial progress. Recently I worked on a vanilla ES6 project (since browser support is <i>finally</i> there), and at long last I wouldn&#x27;t <i>quite</i> describe it as &quot;loathsome&quot; anymore! Still, it&#x27;s a far cry from the nicities of Typescript, and the tiny standard library remains an issue.<p>Having seen both PHP and JavaScript evolve over around 2 decades, I&#x27;d probably argue that PHP has evolved more as a language than JavaScript has.')
