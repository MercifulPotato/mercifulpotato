However, in debate (which is what is happening here), facts and logic can indeed be used to vanquish one&#x27;s counterpart.  When the facts are in favour of one side of the debate, it is fairly typical that they will leverage them in the debate.  If you observe a debate where one side does not use facts but instead opts for pure rhetoric, it is often (but not always) a sign that they do not have facts on their side.  If you ask them about the abstract notion of facts&#x2F;truth, repeatedly, and the response is, repeatedly, as if they did not see the question, this may be considered another sign.<p>&gt; ...and without that axiom I think the rest of this analysis falls apart<p>This is interesting - are you able to articulate how you consider this to be the case?<p>I in no way considered &quot;Destroying people with facts and logic&quot; to be a key component of my overall argument, it was mostly just an off the cuff bit of snark.')
