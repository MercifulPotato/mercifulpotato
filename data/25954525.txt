Item(by='mrec', descendants=None, kids=[25956592], score=None, time=1611899754, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25954271, text='&gt; <i>Too low of inflation is bad because it means less investment in the physical economy</i><p>But why did this apparently only become the case after 2008? Positive real returns without gambling were acceptable before that, and we <i>still</i> got a gigantic speculative bubble, so why does it suddenly become reasonable to encourage bubbles even more? Was it just a coordination problem? An initial panic reaction to slash to zero, and then no central bank being willing to go first and unwind it?<p>As you say, the other major part of this problem is the inability or unwillingness to steer money toward productive investment rather than speculation. Here in the UK it&#x27;s housing that&#x27;s the killer; my suspicion is that governments have become addicted to the jam-today enabled by the money created for mortgage loans, which will then have to be paid off on some other poor sucker&#x27;s watch.')
