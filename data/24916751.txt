Europeans are doing a service to humanity by preserving the history of our collective past. Look at what happened with the artefacts that were left behind: destruction at the hands of invaders, sometimes sponsored by the polity of the time.<p>Look at what ISIS did to the pre-Islamic artefacts present in the territory they controlled.<p>Look what Saddam Hussein did (even with somewhat good intentions) by trying to &quot;modernize&quot; the remains of the Ishtar Gate for the consumption of the local people, while ignoring pleas from arch√¶ologists to let them thoroughly review the sites beforehand.<p>I, for one, am thankful that I can go to the Louvre and learn about our shared ancient history, rather than these artefacts ending up as a paper weight in some oligarch&#x27;s office, as would have been bound to happen otherwise.')
