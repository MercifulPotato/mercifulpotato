There are two fundamentally different ways in which masks could help: protecting the wearer from others, or protecting others from the wearer.<p>They state:<p>&quot;These findings do offer evidence about the degree of protection mask wearers can anticipate in a setting where others are not wearing masks and where other public health measures, including social distancing, are in effect. The findings, however, should not be used to conclude that a recommendation for everyone to wear masks in the community would not be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections, because the trial did not test the role of masks in source control of SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the study period, authorities did not recommend face mask use outside hospital settings and mask use was rare in community settings (22). This means that study participants&#x27; exposure was overwhelmingly to persons not wearing masks.&quot;<p>By suggesting that this paper concludes that masks don&#x27;t help much, it totally ignores the community benefit of widespread mask-wearing.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;dont-wear-mask-yourself&#x2F;610336&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;dont-wear...</a>')
