At work every React app I&#x27;ve built had all this custom logic for each of those pieces. But when I start a new project I&#x27;m loathe to do all that setup again.<p>I&#x27;d just like an opinionated framework built on React that gets rid of some of this boilerplate of browser routing, auth, api access, etc.<p>This isn&#x27;t a knock on React. React is awesome. But at this point it&#x27;s almost too barebones on its own.')
