We&#x27;re removing full roads in cities in favour of bigger cycling paths and more walking area.<p>We&#x27;ve also got cycling roads where cars may drive as a &quot;guest&quot;. So really slow driving speeds and only short distance until they go back up to the main road again.<p>The big difference here is that the bike is a priority vehichle here, instead of a nuisance for cars.<p>Cycling paths&#x2F;roads aren&#x27;t just for city infrastructure. It also is a way of providing safe intercity traffic for cyclists. You can cycle between major cities here without having to share the road with any cars.')
