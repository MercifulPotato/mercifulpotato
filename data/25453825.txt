I don&#x27;t know the history of it, and it could easily just be something that I haven&#x27;t personally witnessed. Ultimately I fall into the camp of someone who would do fine getting quizzed on the computer science stuff, but at the same time it is ultimately about adding value (at least, when we&#x27;re talking about someone paying you to work for them).<p>There aren&#x27;t two camps: &quot;glue software engineers&quot; and &quot;computer scientists&quot;. There is a spectrum of people with varying abilities in a wide array of sub-fields.')
