Databricks and the cloud data warehouses are rapidly converging. Databricks has enough SQL functionality that it can be reasonably be called an RDBMS, and Snowflake has demonstrated that you can incorporate the benefits of a data lake into a data warehouse by separating compute from storage. At this point, the main difference is that with Databricks you can directly access the underlying Parquet files in S3. Does that matter? For some users, yes.')
