It&#x27;s a joy to use. It&#x27;s slim, has a good palm rest, can tent, and having the thumb cluster take an angle when tenting the keyboard is a killer feature, it makes it much easier to reach all keys of the cluster without strain.<p>Only downside is the palm rest is huge, so you need a fair amount of desk space to use it.')
