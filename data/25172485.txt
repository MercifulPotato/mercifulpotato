Item(by='netsharc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605990017, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25172286, text='&gt; As compared to pretty much every Democrat in every office for the past 4 years calling Trump supporters Nazis and saying and tweeting things just as bad if not worse? Why are you giving them a pass?<p>&quot;Well your team is cheating so it&#x27;s legitimate that we cheat too!&quot;.. fucking hell, talk about undignified. It&#x27;s always this &quot;Well the other side is doing it too!&quot;, well, god damn, talk about a lack of self-respect and not expecting &quot;your side&quot; to have some dignity. &quot;Oh it&#x27;s fine that my beloved Trump is an incoherent clown spewing nonsense instead of showing some class and intelligence, because the Dems are tweeting about Nazis!&quot;. &quot;Every democrat in every office&quot;, that sounds a little bit (a lot) of hyperbole...<p>&gt; They are most likely buying time while they put together the much bigger case that ties everything together.<p>Oh, honey, bless your heart.<p>Bet you 1000 bucks they have nothing. I suppose we&#x27;d have to define what &quot;bigger case&quot; means. Maybe 1000 votes that a court confirms to be fraudlent and agrees to throw out? Although Biden would still win without said 1000 votes.<p>Although the next step in your conspiracy theorist mind is that the courts are in in the theft of the election. And so democracy gets undermined a bit further in the USA (except in your mind it was those god-damned libruls who are responsible).')
