Let me tell you why.<p>Earlier today I spent some time to read about &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (I watched it a couple of days ago, essentially for the first time in my life), and I discovered so many interesting things, such as:<p>1) The movie received 7 oscars!<p>2) It was based on the life of T.E. Lawrence<p>3) The director, David Lean, also directed &quot;Bridge on the river Kwai&quot; in 1957 (which also won some oscars), before working on Lawrence of Arabia.<p>4) There&#x27;s no love story. The movie lasts for almost 4 hours! It was shot in 70mm.<p>5) It&#x27;s interesting how the protagonist&#x27;s sexuality is never openly discussed, but it&#x27;s hinted that he might have been homosexual.<p>Etc. So, after half an hour reading about it, I realized how much more there is, besides the movie itself.<p>Your comment on Metropolis gave me similar insights about that movie. Thanks again for sharing it.')
