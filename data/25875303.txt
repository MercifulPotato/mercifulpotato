Pigdin was fairly niche even back in the early 2000s. Facebook is bigger than any of those services ever were, because Facebook did a way better job or attracting the average person. My family used email before Facebook, for example.<p>Given all those things with hindsight, it makes perfect sense for browsers to have long lineages and it makes perfect sense why standalone chat services mostly died out.')
