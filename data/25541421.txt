I prefer to live in a country with laws, but I don&#x27;t fancy being a police officer enforcing the law. And, while plenty of good folks do want to enforce the rules with the purest of intentions, there&#x27;s no question that, as with any role of power, some people will try to get the job because they specifically want to exert that power and derive great joy out of doing so.<p>I don&#x27;t think many people are against the concept of a code of conduct itself - &quot;hey, be nice to each other&quot; is perfectly uncontroversial. It&#x27;s when a few enforcers <i>want</i> to embroil themselves in a loud crusade against evil and stretch vague codes of conduct for their own gratification that we start to have controversy.<p>A case like this one where the rule broken was basically &quot;you were mean&quot; but the &quot;victim&quot; didn&#x27;t actually care, didn&#x27;t support the investigation, and wasn&#x27;t even aware there <i>was</i> an investigation, and a full inquisition complete with intimidation and public punishment was brought out nonetheless is a perfect example of a situation where some spectators can&#x27;t help but wonder if the committee is truly out to do good, or if some members are acting rather recklessly for their own enjoyment and parading around a false banner of justice to get their next high.')
