If this gets traction, then the government wouldn&#x27;t actually build the power plant, it would be more like NASA COTS where they help sponsor private companies that actually carry out the work.  The INFUSE and ARPA-E fusion programs are tentative steps in this direction.<p>Edit: BTW, rallying around an improved pitch is big deal for the federal fusion program.  Budgets have generally been in decline ever since it peaked in the 70&#x27;s, and for many years there was nothing much in terms of a vision for the next steps.')
