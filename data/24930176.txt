The same cannot be said of a technical founder, for whom a a business-savvy adviser (either as a cofounder or adviser) may be the thing that prevents them from getting fleeced by an early investor who is unscrupulous or undervalues the business.<p>None of this is to say the advice is given maliciously. Just that it should be taken with caution normally due to financial advice from parties with financial interests in your behavior.')
