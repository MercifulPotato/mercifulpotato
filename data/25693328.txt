That seems to me like a set-up for binary politics; an us or them thing.<p>My active involvement with political things has always been issue-based, often to do with local affairs - roads, planning, preservation or redevelopment of areas&#x2F;historic buildings. These things have never been, at local level, &quot;left or right&quot;, and I have found such labels, especially when applied before the subjects have been discussed&#x2F;examined, to be unhelpful.<p>FWIW, I prefer issues to be debated on merit, rather than their labelling broadly as left or right, and this is largely because of experience of such debates at the local level - where it really does matter to people.<p>edited for a typo - correcting &quot;beenn&quot; to &quot;beem&quot;. More may follow.')
