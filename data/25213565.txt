Don&#x27;t get me wrong: I also hate solving a gazillion captchas only because I&#x27;m using a VPN or get outright denied because my IP address happens to be a Tor exit node. At the same time you have to acknoledge that captchas don&#x27;t stop bots, only slow them down or increase their operating costs. People in third world countries happily solve one image recognition challenge by Google or hCaptcha for far less than a penny. If Google&#x27;s goal is to drive the costs up for malicious bot operators, then they&#x27;re definitely doing the right thing. In the end, it won&#x27;t stop them either since buying a couple thousand infected computers is probably not that expensive, but it is yet another stepping stone for anyone trying to bypass their captcha.')
