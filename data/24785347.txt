Even if it is real, do we know if Hunter Biden actually used &quot;his influence&quot;? What indications are there that Hunter Biden&#x27;s supposed actions were critical to Shokin&#x27;s firing anyway?<p>Several governments and other organizations were concerned because Shokin <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> investigating Burisma properly, having laid the investigation he inherited from his predecessor dormant. The demand to fire him wasn&#x27;t something that Joe Biden came up with himself out of the blue, and at the end of the day it was most likely to Burisma&#x27;s detriment.<p>It&#x27;s not an impeachable offense to threaten to withhold foreign aid for valid reasons that further the interests of the United States. It was (and should be) an impeachable offense to illegally withhold aid that was already meant to have been delivered, and to do so for personal gain.')
