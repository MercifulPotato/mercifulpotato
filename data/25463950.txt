Why?  My best guess as to why you can&#x27;t have a separate air intake from bleed air is that you need the pressurization and the heat. And the extra weight of a different system is cost prohibitive and maybe less reliable.   I would hope you could have a primary system that was all electric and taken from a safer bleed or entire system and then use the secondary bleed air system.')
