This is part of (IMO) a larger pattern of politicians and society at large struggling to integrate science and scientific insights into social action.<p>Science won&#x27;t set your goals for you, it can at most suggest what is the most efficient way to get from X to Y, yet there are unreasonable expectations being placed by society on scientific research (we are seeing this very clearly with covid and GW).<p>The net result is that science is often used as a shield by politicians, and those bullshit operations are often successful because the general public is so hopelessly uneducated about how science works.')
