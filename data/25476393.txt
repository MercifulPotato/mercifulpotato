I&#x27;m a postdoc in astronomy, and my situation is pretty good all things considered. But I think for many people their work becomes their identity, perhaps starting as early as childhood, and leaving is an enormous identity crisis. Going from being &quot;the kid who has always loved space&quot; to working on ad-tech or finance might as well be the same as changing your name, moving to France, and just hitting reset on your life. The &quot;sunk cost&quot; goes much further than just career skills.<p>The situation is actually very similar to what I&#x27;ve read from folks in game-dev. Almost one-to-one. And like you suggest, these sorts of situations probably all have their root in the supply&#x2F;demand of labor imbalance from people choosing the career out of passion and being willing to sacrifice on many fronts for the opportunity to do it.')
