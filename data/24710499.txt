I don’t find the argument that there are significant monopolies in the high-tech industry to be persuasive.<p>Moreover, the competitive landscape among America’s high-tech industry is very active. Each of the major tech companies is regularly sniping at each other’s major markets. Microsoft introduced Bing to compete with Google Search and Azure to compete with AWS. Google introduced Google Cloud to compete with AWS, GSuite to compete with Microsoft’s productivity suite, and unsuccessfully introduced Google Plus to compete with Facebook. Amazon is ramping up an advertising wing to compete with Google Ads and investing in Twitch to compete with YouTube. And everybody these days seems to have a video streaming service of some sort competing with Netflix. This seems like a golden age of competition.<p>Breaking up a high-tech monopoly would be tough because unlike historically successful breakups it would make no sense to do geographically. But for now it doesn’t seem like anything needs to change.')
