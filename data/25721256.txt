Item(by='skissane', descendants=None, kids=[25722141], score=None, time=1610319818, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25720074, text='&gt; I get that it&#x27;s not trivial to set one of these up (especially for someone who is already in a funding deficit), but I think it would make donations a more attractive option for people.<p>Is there any sort of general purpose tax exempt org for funding free&#x2F;open-source software development? Someone makes a tax-exempt donation to that org, earmarked for a particular project, the org forwards the donation to that project as a grant (minus a deduction for admin costs&#x2F;etc). Then on-boarding a new project would mean just getting that project approved as a grant recipient with that org, which presumably would be a simpler process than setting up a tax-exempt org from scratch.')
