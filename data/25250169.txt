From its scientific support for effective use in the 2003 SARS outbreak. From early tests in China showing positive results it also worked for SARS-CoV-2 when applied early on to mild cases (not to terribly sick pneumatics as a cure). From Trump stupidly talking about things he has no authority to speak on, carelessly misleading public. From how the media started attacking HCQ afterwards as a proxy for Trump bashing. From how a singly shoddy retracted study with possibly faked data, caused all WHO tests to cancel HCQ trials world-wide (when these very trials were designed to test adverse and positive effects, and not part of the shoddy study).<p>HCQ. Like mask-wearing. Like sensible quarantine methods. Are all incredibly polarized, political, and vague regarding to truths.<p>But any credible research on HCQ shows its effect or potential, still.
