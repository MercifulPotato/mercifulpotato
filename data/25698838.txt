Given their aspirational quality—a longing toward greater understanding—these roles might at first seem better filled by angels. But, because they often represent theories that violate laws of time or space, machines that exceed human capacities, and technologies that threaten human existence, the use of demons feels appropriate; their very identity suggests the workings of a mischievous or malevolent force<p>This characterization of the supernatural being is irrelevant to their nature.<p>&gt; Canales quotes a computer scientist at Microsoft who argued that Internet and finance companies today “are trying to become Maxwell’s demons in an information network.” His example was a health-insurance company using Big Data to sort desirable customers from undesirable customers<p>That’s a cute thought experiment albeit not directly the of the same kind previously discussed. This person is clearly discussing aggregated human effects, nothing hard to prove there.<p>&gt; This strange being disappears entirely from the final version of “On the Origin of Species,” where only the theory of natural selection appears, absent any miraculous causes or supernatural forces.<p>Makes you wonder if the publication would have received the same attention had this part not being removed from the final revision.<p>&gt; Still, among those who studied it more closely, Maxwell’s demon has inspired new technologies and theories in fields as diverse as chemistry, cosmology, nanotechnology, neuroscience, and cybernetics.<p>The article, albeit being a great summary, does little effort to acknowledge the difference between demons being merely analogies for the unknown versus being the catalyst of new ways to tame nature.')
