I often find it difficult to discover interesting books. Amazon and Goodreads are good, but not great. Amazon recommendations are often skewed towards popular books. We wanted to see if could build a better recommendation engine using the content of reviews. To make it more useful, we also added in a nifty feature to automatically check the price of books, while you are browsing online. We built this a a side project, so there might be hidden, unsquashed bugs. Please let us know. Thanks!')
