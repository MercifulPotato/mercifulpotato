Those bugs are hard to find in old legacy multi-million LoC codebase with lots of spaghetti code nobody bothered to refactor, so those bugs will haunt users for years. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m reluctant to move to this architecture at least for a few years, even if it&#x27;s superior in theory.<p>Thankfully ARM phones were a thing for a lot of time, so many libraries should work well.')
