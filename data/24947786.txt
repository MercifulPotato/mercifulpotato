Tom pulled on a different thread, one that even taught me some things about myself. Tom did the homework, interviewed a lot of people, and presented the person behind the keyboard.<p>My current role does little to describe where I am today. The path for others will be different, and what I think is most important, beyond the technical achievements is the person I&#x27;ve become. The higher you go up in the engineering world the less you lean on the skills that got you there.<p>In my opinion the best engineer can change the world with zero lines of code.')
