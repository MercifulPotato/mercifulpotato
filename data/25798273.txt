Item(by='kevincox', descendants=None, kids=[25798887], score=None, time=1610754869, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25797427, text='&gt; Billion-dollar verdicts to companies that do not even produce a marketable product are the antithesis of that intention.<p>It depends on how exactly you define &quot;a product&quot;. I think that if one could do research and come up with valuable technology that they hope to license. If this is a useful idea then I think they should be able to sue over it even if they don&#x27;t have a &quot;product&quot;.<p>I think it depends more on the patent itself. If the patent is very clever and something that people are unlikely to discover themselves then it makes sense to exist and be enforceable. However if it is something obvious or simple to independently discover than it should not be, irrespective if you are producing a product or not.')
