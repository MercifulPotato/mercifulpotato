Item(by='joshuamorton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604809477, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25022765, text='&gt; Biden and Harris where right there not only cheering that on from the side lines but where ACTIVE participants in this process, they personally sent people to those cages.<p>Absolutely, and this might be an interesting point if they continued to support those policies now, or if anyone voted for them due to those policies. Instead, you see the opposite: Biden and Harris have admitted that those policies that put people in cages were mistakes and that they&#x27;d act differently now. On the other hand, Trump has doubled down on putting more people in cages.<p>You can&#x27;t claim that Trump is superior if he&#x27;s the only one actively doing it. This of course doesn&#x27;t mean that he gets a free pass, but Biden will, without a doubt, be better about domestic policy and putting people in cages than Trump will be. Trumps populism depends on caging people his base sees as the outgroup.<p>Like can you explain this argument better, as best as I can tell it&#x27;s &quot;Hey we know our candidate is actively doing a bad thing, and refused to stop doing it despite pressure to stop, but the other candidate did a similar bad thing a long time ago, and has recognized the mistake and no longer supports that policy. These are equivalent, so ultimately the choices are the same on this issue.&quot;<p>&gt; Where is your moral outrage for those children? for those parents? for those victims?<p>Yeah it exists. But I can&#x27;t fix it now. And again, I would be stupid and uncaring to punish the people currently being put in cages because I disapprove of something a politician did before I was born.<p>&gt; Biden is bad on all them, Trump is bad only a few of them<p>There is no universe in which Trump is better than Biden on Open Borders or Free Trade. You might be able to make that argument with Trump vs. Sanders, but not with Biden.<p>&gt; I also believe when the final accounting is done a LARGE part of our covid death rate was down to several irresponsible governors mandating COVID positive people be sent to Elder Care Facilities<p>As far as I know, that happened in exactly one state and is responsible for, at most, a few thousand deaths. Unacceptable certainly, and NY and NYC absolutely deserves criticism for that mistake. But we&#x27;re currently seeing similar numbers of deaths weekly, and we have been for the past 20 weeks, and no longer due to the actions of any single state, but due to inaction by governors of many states, in part because those governors have been afraid to go against the president. Even if you believe that policy should be set per state, you should support the president not peddling misinformation and lying about the scope of the pandemic.<p>&gt; Now you have charged that is false equivalency the point that many democrats also are &quot;completely unable and often unwilling to consider any argument or information that conflicts with their views&quot; to the point where they are creating lists of Trump supporter<p>That&#x27;s okay, it&#x27;s clear that you&#x27;re not willing to consider any argument or information that conflicts with your views ;)<p>Less snarkily, there&#x27;s no equivalency, false or otherwise, between refusing to work with a person, and refusing to consider a position. Suggesting that a politician who lies and claims that 1000 deaths a day aren&#x27;t happening is the same as a political who says &quot;hey the guy who lied about the 1000 deaths a day should face political consequences for lying&quot; aren&#x27;t similar, at all.<p>Perhaps, in 20 or 30 years, when they&#x27;ve proven that they&#x27;ve moved on from those policy positions and demonstrated that they&#x27;ve actually changed, perhaps then they might have redeemed themselves. But on Feb 1? Nah.')
