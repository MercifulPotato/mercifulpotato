Net of deductions, taxation hasn&#x27;t changed that much. You can&#x27;t look at the nominal tax rates in isolation while ignoring the scope of deduction against those rates.<p>Eliminating deductions for high-income earners while reducing tax rates on that income is revenue neutral, and generally preferable as a policy.')
