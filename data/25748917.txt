For example, you can enter a balance assertion that&#x27;s identical to the month-end balance on a paper statement you receive. If you somehow later mess up transactions somewhere so that the assertion becomes invalid, plain text systems will let you know.<p>BTW, I think one of the main differences between Ledger&#x2F;hledger and Beancount is whether assertions are interpreted per-file or globally.')
