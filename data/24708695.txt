I&#x27;m guessing the dynamic nature of the languages is the factor in leaning on?<p>That is, both have the surprise for most people that (&#x2F; 1 3) doesn&#x27;t get rounded or truncated by default, due to the default of supporting rationals.  You have to coerce into a floating point, right?  Couldn&#x27;t you do the same with exact reals?  Put them at the top of the tower and maintain existing projections through the tower?<p>Edit:. Note that I don&#x27;t think this precludes the algorithms here.  Just that a type system that could use the tower could be augmented to get here.  If that makes sense.  Hence why I would think it would be mentioned.  It is the expectations that things project in one direction that folks want?  Right?')
