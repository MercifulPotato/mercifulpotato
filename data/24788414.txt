That said, the main difference is that it comes with a GC, or more accurately, multiple GC options that are tunable. If you cannot have GC, as in embedded, you can compile without GC, but then you lose access to the vast majority of the standard library (which is similar to rust&#x27;s --no-std, from my understanding).')
