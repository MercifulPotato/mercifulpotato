You can read about Ad Observer here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adobservatory.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adobservatory.org</a><p>=================<p>Absolutely preposterous takedown demand. Facebook doesn&#x27;t get to dictate what software I run on my own client devices, including browser plugins, or even what browser I use. If I want to install a plugin that sends a screenshot or data of every advertisement I receive, to a third party of my choice, that&#x27;s up to me. Or maybe I want to install ublock origin and see no ads.<p>It sounds like they&#x27;re complaining because they have no way of detecting this or preventing it on the user client end, thankfully, because of the way browsers are architected to prevent a website from screwing with the software on your computer. The only way fb could detect or block this would be to force users to install their own fb-written browser plugin, with extensive permissions required.<p>Obviously fb has a high level of motivation to get every user to use their officially app-store-published android or ios app, where the whole experience is centrally controlled, and such a plugin is impossible to use. Rather than having the user browse facebook in Firefox or Chrome or Edge.<p>If I can display something on my own computer screen it&#x27;s my right to choose to share it however I damn well please.')
