How about a way to register when bought an item, and a reminder to  review it 1, 5 and 10 years later? That way you will know how durable it really is.<p>Also, I have zero interest in &quot;following a brand&quot;. What I want from a site like this a way to research items when I am thinking of buying one, and to contribute back my knowledge on the few occasions when I have some. I don&#x27;t want yet another content stream attention suck - please think seriously about how you can make a great site while using as little of everyone&#x27;s attention-budget as possible. I signed up based on your HN comment, but just going from the site I would never have done - it looks like either marketing or a content farm.')
