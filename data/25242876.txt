If you&#x27;re genuinely a bad therapist, but fool yourself into thinking that&#x27;s not the case, then doesn&#x27;t that mean you could end up worsening a bunch of people&#x27;s lives?  It depends on exactly what &quot;bad&quot; means—if it&#x27;s &quot;takes longer to help narrow down the causes of someone&#x27;s problems&quot;, then that&#x27;s probably not too bad, but if it&#x27;s &quot;subtly but consistently exacerbates one&#x27;s patients&#x27; problems&quot; or &quot;recommends hallucinogenic drugs to patients with a family history of schizophrenia&quot; (I&#x27;ve heard this is likely to trigger permanent issues; some googling gives conflicted but mostly supporting results), then you could really mess people up.<p>And if you <i>know</i> what your flaws are, then you can usually limit their impact.  (For example, if you know you&#x27;re bad at figuring out the right thing to recommend—either due to not knowing the field or being bad at learning about the patient&#x27;s traits or situational details that make some approaches good and others inappropriate—then you could make fewer recommendations and&#x2F;or couch them with more of the &quot;here are a few possibilities that come to mind, I don&#x27;t know which if any might work well, if you do try them pay careful attention and reevaluate&quot; than you otherwise would; or consult better therapists and&#x2F;or refer patients to them more often.)  That may translate directly into becoming a &quot;better&quot; therapist, I guess, although you may still not be &quot;good&quot;.')
