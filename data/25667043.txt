It also needs:<p>- A machine to run on -- which needs money and a real person. This adds some (small) measure of accountability.<p>- A way for people to find the site. So it must be linked enough that search engines pick it, or shared via some other method. I feel this is the primary we address misinformation -- by not linking to it.<p>It seems that LBRY claims to not require either. So a misinformation&#x2F;disinformation video will stay there forever.')
