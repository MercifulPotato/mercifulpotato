Is it really critical thinking to understand that people have been dishonest to make money since... oh I don&#x27;t know... the past few millennia? I know it&#x27;s a fairly recent concept, but I think it&#x27;s happened enough to have merit.<p>I need someone with some expert critical thinking skills to explain to me why people are so surprised by these &quot;revelations&quot; of overblown, sensational claims...<p>At some point, people need to take some responsibility in themselves of being ridiculously gullible and reward blatant cons (Theranos anyone?). There&#x27;s a weird culture of &quot;It&#x27;s not my fault I was fooled&quot;. Yes, it is. This is literally why we&#x27;re all taught &quot;history&quot;. See the past faults, mistakes, success, good, bad, failures, cons, promises, etc. and understand that it can all happen again. Thus, you can protect yourself.
