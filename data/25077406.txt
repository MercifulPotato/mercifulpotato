Instead, it would be in taking the trips you don’t take now, because they’re too inconvenient. A flying car would shrink your world, expanding the radius of what you would consider for a commute, a shopping trip, a visit to friends, a business meeting, or a weekend vacation. [...] increasing the effective radius for each of those trips increases the effective area open to you quadratically (doubling your travel radius means four times as many destinations).</i><p>This very same effect happened on a small scale in the last ten years, when Uber&#x2F;ride-sharing unlocked journeys that would have been impractical for many with regular taxis.  Affordable flying cars would do the same, but with a much bigger sphere of impact.')
