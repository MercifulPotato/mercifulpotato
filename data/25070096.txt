The value is not in the edited content, it&#x27;s in having a single narrative going through society. Even if that narrative is partially wrong.<p>I feel like society is in the midst of restructuring itself to the reality that there will never be a single narrative again.<p>And I think that&#x27;s ok because we&#x27;re reverting back, societally, to a time before mass media. So we know it&#x27;s possible for societies to function without a single overarching narrative.<p>(Not to go too far off, but the same thing seems to be coming as a result of deep fakes -- reverting to a time where 1st person accounts from a reputable person were the only reliable evidence. [Where reputation was something of an organic page rank algorithm.])')
