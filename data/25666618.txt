There are also a lot of free designs which use open-source buses like Wishbone if you don&#x27;t want to build your own.<p>* Linux&#x2F;GCC&#x2F;etc. will probably support a compliant RISC-V implementation.<p>And the cynical&#x2F;realist crowd is harrumph-ing after a few important questions, like:<p>* Many important features are not yet finalized, including things as basic as a nested interrupt controller. So, how compatible will modern RISC-V implementations be with future software?<p>* Will &quot;good enough&quot; performance actually be good enough? It&#x27;s still not clear whether a RISC-V CPU will be competitive with ARM et al on power and performance on a similar process node. It might be, but the ecosystem needs to mature.<p>So it&#x27;s one of those things that always seems to be 5 years away, like practical fission or the year of the Linux desktop.<p>But if we ever do get to a point where you can use something like LiteX to generate a RISC-V  SoC with N CPUs and driver support for its major peripherals on Linux, that would be exciting. Fabrication on 45-130nm process nodes might also be affordable for small startups by that point, too.')
