I tried create a supervisor script[1] to achieve such evolution based on comparing stdout. But comparing stdout does not give me a stochastic picture of error&#x2F;loss. So instead in the following days or months, I&#x27;ll try to create a system that checks the values in the registers at the end of the program execution. It will pick the best offspring to go with and eliminate other offsprings.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m basically trying to create Artificial Life with this project.
