You are generally talking to beginners when you encounter anyone like that on any subject. Kind of like trying to draw too many conclusions from a Twitter argument you had with someone who is actually a 14yo (probably happens a lot more than we like to think).<p>Instead I think I could agree with people who could point out that it&#x27;s all trade-offs, and there are some upsides to having fewer autolayout options in UI programming. For example, flexbox and cssgrids enables things you simply wouldn&#x27;t have attempted before in CSS (you&#x27;d have gone with something less expressive, like media-query hard-coding). And any time you nest grids and&#x2F;or flexboxes you get to rediscover the horrors of autolayout flexibility.<p>UI is hard and there is no &quot;best&quot;. Though it&#x27;s the emergence of mobile devices that forced the hand to more complex autolayout tools.')
