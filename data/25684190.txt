Also that generation of consoles have pretty good hardware codecs for audio (320 channels in the Xbox).<p>And MP3 was just an example of what I had here at my disposal. But as an exercise I converted my 4 minute MP3 to Vorbis. Decoding it converting to WAV took the same amount of time as before: about half a second on a very old and underpowered MacBook Air. Most of this time is spent writing 50mb to disk.')
