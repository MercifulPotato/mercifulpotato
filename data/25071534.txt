When a bomb explodes, even a nuclear bomb, the energy created causes the atoms in the explosive to move violently in all directions. But in the Big Bang, instead suddenly all of those particles got farther apart without necessarily moving. The only real parallel in our current universe is the way the space between galaxies is expanding; nothing on our planet or even within our galaxy (afaik) behaves this way.')
