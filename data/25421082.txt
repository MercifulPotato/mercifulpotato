It just means people buying ads aren&#x27;t as willing to spend money to reach those populations. The cost of advertising to populations with lower disposable income has always been lower. This isn&#x27;t something new to web ads, it&#x27;s a phenomenon that has existed long before the internet. I&#x27;m really not sure where you&#x27;re going with this line of thinking.')
