They&#x27;re being lied to - being told that these kinds of anomalies, which happen every election year, are unprecedented and we can&#x27;t be confident in the result until they&#x27;re fully investigated. (There&#x27;s no reason investigations into problems can&#x27;t continue after everyone acknowledges the result!)<p>If I were confident that a month of preemptive investigations would lead to greater confidence, I&#x27;d be all in favor. But this seems unlikely, because so many of the people pushing for investigations have already declared the only result they&#x27;ll accept. What seems much more likely is a repeat of 2000, where trust in the electoral system is shattered, and a huge chunk of the losing party starts to argue that any election which didn&#x27;t go their way was corruptly stolen from them.')
