This likely has a significant impact on emulated performance.<p>At least the x86 (32-bit) emulation relied entirely on JIT compiling its emulated code, instead of doing anything AOT. _However_, it cached the JIT&#x27;d code so in practice it was a first-run cost, similar to the situation on macOS.')
