But I could be wrong) where they would cut the hole in the disk just slightly bigger, and then take advantage of the fact that in DOS you could talk directly to the hardware to convince the read head to go just a little too far.  Then it could read the magic 41st track to load the game, but no disk copy program could copy it.')
