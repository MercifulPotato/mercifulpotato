Item(by='WalterBright', descendants=None, kids=[25098886], score=None, time=1605417442, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25098200, text='&gt; did the Chinese study less military history than the Mongols?<p>I know next to nothing about the wars between the Chinese and the Mongols. I could read a book about it, and why one or the other won, which is precisely my point :-)<p>&gt; For someone like Pizzaro, where’s the line between studying military history and being the recipient of a body of institutional knowledge and practice?<p>Not much of one. Institutional knowledge and practice is transmitted via writing, far more than being carried around in one&#x27;s head.<p>&gt; Is the claim that the Inca didn’t have a body of institutional knowledge and practice that was effective within their own context and material culture?<p>Military techniques that work transcend culture. For example, attempting to decapitate the command structure is a well-known technique used by the west, and the command structure is designed to be tolerant of that. The Incas apparently never thought of that, and fell apart when Pizarro disrupted their command structure.<p>Just my own personal library has probably far more than 1000 times as much information as any person could carry in their head, let alone transmit to the next generation. When that&#x27;s military knowledge, that is a tremendous advantage.')
