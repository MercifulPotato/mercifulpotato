What&#x27;s wrong with that?  For &quot;Smart&quot; TVs that have obnoxious screens just to switch inputs - ignore them.  I still have a great stereo receiver and it does all my switching.<p>Yes, I prefer non-smart TVs but you can also treat most of them as dumb TVs and they still work fine.  If I ever did end up with one that refused to work if it wasn&#x27;t online I&#x27;d take the sucker back.<p>I have ZERO intention to ever use the software bundled with a TV for all of the reasons others talk about in this thread.  It&#x27;s just not that big a deal to use something else as the source for my content.')
