There are quite some articles on how to donate bandwidth but they seem to be quite outdated. What ways can you recommend to donate bandwidth to something good without needing to many resources? I would like to run this on something with low power requirements like a few Raspberry PI each serving 1gbits.<p>Note: I do not have any data-caps and I am not afraid to use a few gigabits continuously.')
