But given the judge&#x27;s really absurd rulings on other issues (such as whether Assange is a journalist or whether or not he&#x27;ll face a fair trial), I&#x27;m not inclined to automatically believe her interpretation is correct here. If she is correct, though, then the UK has not implemented the treaty, and more importantly, journalists in the UK are in serious danger if they report on foreign governments.')
