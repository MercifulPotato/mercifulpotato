You can count that this new provider will tear out a chunk of WhatsApp’s user base.<p>The next day yet another provider pops up and advertises cheaper subscriptions at $X&#x2F;2, further eating away at Facebook’s advertising power. FB understands that the earlier it revamps its business model, the more revenue it can generate from <i>actually paying</i> users; so it revises the ToS, adds paid tiers to its services and becomes very good at upselling them.')
