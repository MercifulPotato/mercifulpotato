I worked there because I liked the extra money on top of what my parents gave me and to me it was like getting paid for gym :D.<p>I&#x27;m happy you ended up with a great job that pays well. Congrats to you!<p>But I think you underrate what and how much you may have or could have learned from working at UPS. UPS is a fantastic logistics operation, and while being a package sorter is obviously not the same as being a VP, the job still exposes you to a system that&#x27;s highly optimized for profiting from being good at logistics, and that reaches every job in the system. Maybe you didn&#x27;t learn anything at the job, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there was nothing there to learn for someone observing and trying to learn.')
