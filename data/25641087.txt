Practically every &quot;enlightened&quot; &amp; &quot;advanced&quot; system of Europe that the US is compared to has failed. The most drastic measures in South America, likewise have failed. We are told to act like countries on the other side of the globe - it&#x27;s laughably unrealistic and divorced from reality.<p>Say &quot;it&#x27;s just temporary&quot; to someone months behind on rent and unemployed. It&#x27;s shockingly insensitive and paternalistic.

Entitlement is how to describe every comfy white collar worker that rolls out of bed and hops on Zoom, and then condescendingly and abusively berates everyone else that does not have that privilege.')
