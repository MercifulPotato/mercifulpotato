Item(by='jholman', descendants=None, kids=[25115582], score=None, time=1605486257, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25097304, text='&gt;&gt; Critical to any military, much less society, is the concept of a warrior class<p>&gt; The GP was talking about a sort of caste, ... treated distinctly from generation to generation<p>If it&#x27;s true that the kodah meant that, then it is patently hilariously absurd.  There are many militaries, and many societies, that haven&#x27;t worked that way, and some of them have been successful.  You mention the modern &quot;west&quot; (though I don&#x27;t know why, because it&#x27;s just as true in the USSR or in China or in etc etc), but this isn&#x27;t even the best example.  Many societies required <i>all</i> citizens to be equally warriors, such as most first nations societies, or for example the Mongols.  So clearly, if kodah meant what you claim they meant, they would be really really really wrong, like ludicrously wrong.<p>As such (and this is my point), it&#x27;s probably better to assume that the kodah didn&#x27;t mean that.  It&#x27;s probably better to steelman, rather than strawman.')
