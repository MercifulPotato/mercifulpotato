Here&#x27;s a bucket of money! Do lots of something so we have lots of growth!&quot;<p>[spending ensues]<p>As the Uber story shows, a lot of money gets spent without anybody making sure that it actually works. The actual goal is not to have an effect. It&#x27;s to be seen as taking bold action. If the business gets better, bonuses and promotions ensue, no matter what the actual cause. Cargo cult management.<p>It sounds insane, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s rife. Years ago I was coaching at a Lean Startup weekend class. One team really killed it, rapidly testing product hypotheses through real-world testing. Their initial idea was quickly proven worthless, but they listened to users and came up with an idea that would sell.<p>I kept in touch with one of those team members. He went back to his prominent, well-funded startup, excited to improve his company. But nobody wanted improvement. Execs wanted to sit in a big room, think big thoughts, and produce specs. The engineers were to implement those specs. But nobody would measure the effects of anything. Proof that a grand poobah&#x27;s idea didn&#x27;t actually pan out was deeply unwelcome. It slowly drove my pal mad and he quit. The company bumped along for a few years to a modest acquisition, but it never really lived up to the hopes.')
