Whether they be ML researchers or corporate diversity officer. What happens to these people when full equality is achieved?<p>Like let&#x27;s imagine tomorrow everyone she&#x27;d all of their sexist and racist and other ist tendencies both conscious and unconscious. Wouldn&#x27;t these people be out of a job, and as we continue to be a more and more equal society won&#x27;t these positions have less and less work Todo? Because if they are doing their job they should be solving the very problem they were brought in to counter.<p>Is it inevitable that these positions will end up continuing to try to justify greater and greater outrage over small and small incidents? What is the future for these positions and the cottage industry that has sprung up around inclusion and diversity?')
