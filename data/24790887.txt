Learning Lisp was extremely eye-opening, and I was amazed at how much could be done with such a simple language. It inspired me to learn way more about theoretical CS, knowledge which continues to serve me to this day, even though I wound up in a different field. I definitely came away a believer in Greenspun&#x27;s tenth rule.<p>OTOH, for most 61a students, this course (indeed the entire major) amounts to a very expensive form of vocational training. Developing an aesthetic appreciation for finely crafted code seems somewhat orthogonal to their end goal, which in 99% of cases is getting a high-paying job writing Python, C++, or some other A-list language. I can&#x27;t really see the benefit of a formative semester spent on honing their Lisp chops. As educators, we want to believe that the latter leads to the former, but I&#x27;m a bit skeptical.')
