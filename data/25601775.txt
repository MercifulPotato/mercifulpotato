Grin is about to undergo a significant upgrade in its 4th pre-planned hardfork [1] in about 2 weeks, has an active forum [2], and live chat groups [3] in addition to telegram and discord channels, and a weekly newsletter [4].<p>Meanwhile, Zcash is far from challenging Grin&#x27;s benefits of lacking a mining tax (recently extended from the original 4 years to 8 years), having a simple long term viable emission, relying on far simpler and better understood cryptography, and an order of magnitude smaller chainsize for the same amount of transactions.<p>Not to mention that about 99% of all ZCash transactions lack any privacy, and still rely on a trusted setup to prevent hidden inflation.<p>It seems easier for Grin to reduce input-output linkability and thereby erode ZCash&#x27; single remaining benefit.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.grin.mw&#x2F;t&#x2F;grin-v5-0-0-network-upgrade-hard-fork-4-january-2021&#x2F;7895" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.grin.mw&#x2F;t&#x2F;grin-v5-0-0-network-upgrade-hard-for...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.grin.mw&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.grin.mw&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keybase.io&#x2F;team&#x2F;grincoin" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keybase.io&#x2F;team&#x2F;grincoin</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grinnews.substack.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grinnews.substack.com&#x2F;</a>')
