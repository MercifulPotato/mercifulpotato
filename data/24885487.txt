I was asked at some point about what I did during the 2 months I had spent in the US the last time I went. I very naively proceeded to truthfully describe my activities during those two months, one of which consisted of going to a public school for a short time (maybe three weeks). That was enough to get my visa denied and my tourist visa canceled. It did not make any sense to me that something so innocuous, which I did when I was eleven years old under the command of adults and not from my own will, would need to have, 7 years later, such &quot;consequences.&quot; The interviewer of course questioned my knowledge of that word, and demanded proof that I had paid something to the school. I communicated with the school principal and managed to get a receipt of a $14 payment for buying a t-shirt, and got my visa which I had to renew after a year.')
