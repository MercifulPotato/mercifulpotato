No one will be even close, especially due to the scale of 2D data that they have gathered.<p>Potentially Tesla&#x27;s 2D data lead means they will still be the leader even if the compute resources in the current cars isn&#x27;t up to the task, and maybe even if they have to add additional sensors like lidar. They can probably retrain their models and still get a lot of out of it.<p>My personal guess is that full 3D lidar isn&#x27;t needed, but some additional cameras and other cheap sensors probably are. There&#x27;s a ton of stuff that costs a fraction of the cost of lidar that might fill in the gaps.')
