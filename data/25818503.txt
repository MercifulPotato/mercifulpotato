Basically, a clearly displayed &quot;Yes, I want to be tracked for the purposes of showing me ads&quot; option. How many people do you think with want to opt in if they really had the choice? Heck, why do you think Facebook is going so bananas over Apple just asking people to opt-in to tracking?<p>The only &#x27;innovation&#x27; going on is making the tracking difficult for your average, non-technical person to (a) know what is going on and (b) how to opt-out.')
