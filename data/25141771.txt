Of course it makes sense for them to build their own infrastructure.<p>For a company whose product is a saas application (business logic in code) with users spending hundreds or thousands of dollars per month, those cost savings may never materialize relative to the amount of infrastructure each customer is using per dollar.<p>Dropbox is essentially buying a barrel of gasoline and selling it in gallons. Their product can never be profusely more valuable than the underlying infrastructure.<p>As I recall there are giants like Netflix that still run on AWS...which brings up another point! If you’re large enough to consider your own data center, you’re large enough to negotiate contracts with cloud providers at below-retail rates.')
