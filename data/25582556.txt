Worst case the satellite has to flight an evasive maneuver. Usually it&#x27;s a false alarm, but we can&#x27;t measure well enough to make perfect predictions.<p>I think they do it with radar right now and the future cloud would be lasers, especially for more accurate measures of things already flagged as dangerous.
