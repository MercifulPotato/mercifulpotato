If I see I have more than ~10 open, I purge them of all but the pinned tab(s) and maybe the left most 2-3 which is generally where I keep the tab I for the ticket I am actively working on.<p>On my personal machine, I&#x27;d be surprised if I ever get above 5 non-pinned tabs open. I open a tab, look at it, close it, rinse and repeat.<p>I have the same habits in my IDE and Finder windows and iTerm and Sublime (which I mostly use as a scratchpad). If I have more than a few open, I inherently think I am doing something wrong and go to clean it up.<p>Frankly, I&#x27;ve always viewed the &quot;hundreds of tabs open&quot; as a sorta hoarder mentality. You might need that tab in the future, so you don&#x27;t ever close it. Even when it is obvious you will never need it, you still don&#x27;t close it. Even when it makes finding other tabs unusually difficult, you still do not close it. It clearly has no benefit, but you&#x27;re afraid or unwilling to close it (I use &quot;you&quot; in the general sense; not indicating you, tobr, specifically)')
