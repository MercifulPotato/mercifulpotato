Purpose exists only in our heads; natural objects don&#x27;t have one. There is no &lt;purpose=&quot;sail&quot;&gt; tag attached to atoms.<p>In other words, anything that behaves as a sail would, can be called a sail. And there are plenty of objects around us that behave as sails, not made such by humans, or made so unintentionally.')
