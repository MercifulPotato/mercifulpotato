What is to stop miners from &quot;betting&quot; on every possible value on the wheel?  If winning a spin gives the right to mint some new coins, then the only reasonable strategies would be to make such a blanket bet, or to never bet at all.<p>Perhaps, though, your system could be coupled with a system that restricts participants to one (public key) identity per IPv4 address.  The cosmic roulette wheel would then pick a participant at random who would mine the next block and receive the block rewards.<p>I feel like there must be a flaw with this design, other than the fact it rewards hoarders of IP addresses.  Perhaps the biggest problem is building a device which can run anywhere on Earth and measure variations in a pulsar, but there must be other globally-measurable random number generators that machines could cheaply reach consensus on.')
