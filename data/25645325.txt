Item(by='tome', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609853844, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25645250, text='Personally my experience doesn&#x27;t match that description.  I find it&#x27;s fairly reasonable to convert existing code between &quot;run time type checking&quot; and static types as necessary.  I realise that it doesn&#x27;t click for everyone immediately.  Sorry you had a bad experience with Haskell.  If you ever try again I&#x27;m happy to help.  Feel free to drop me a line with any questions whatsoever.  My contact details are in my HN profile.')
