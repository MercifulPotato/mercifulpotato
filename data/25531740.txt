Item(by='thunderbong', descendants=None, kids=[25531800], score=None, time=1608846436, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25531496, text='Honestly, I find this kind of comment not useful at all. Considering how internet &#x2F; tech &#x2F; security savvy the HN crowd is, I&#x27;m sure we don&#x27;t give our personal &#x2F; work email addresses willy nilly.<p>There are a huge number of anonymous email services available. I came across this list from a basic search [0].<p>In fact, recently, there was submission for <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;33mail.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;33mail.com</a> on ShowHN also.<p>So, my question is, why don&#x27;t we do this and add comments about the application itself.<p>I agree there are many ways to persist data even without a login. But that in turn means wasting a huge amount of resources for anonymous users with hardly any return at all. Why should developers do that?<p>In my opinion, what I find worse, is this expectation of getting something for nothing. Facebook, Google and others have grown to this size because of this sense of enlightenment. And we complain about them all the time.<p>So, in short, my suggestion is - if you don&#x27;t find use of a service without submitting an anonymous email, don&#x27;t use it. There&#x27;s really no point in adding a comment which does nothing towards the understanding or increasing our knowledge.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techuntold.com&#x2F;mailinator-alternatives&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techuntold.com&#x2F;mailinator-alternatives&#x2F;</a>\n[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25434753" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25434753</a>')
