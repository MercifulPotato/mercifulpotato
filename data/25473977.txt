I live rent-free at a nice B&amp;B rent-free, in exchange I work three websites for the owners (B&amp;B, record label, a school). It&#x27;s fun and challenging but also exhausting dealing with nepotism, technophobia, being &#x27;the support guy&#x27; for anything that breaks.<p>I&#x27;m ready to move on but am also a little afraid. I think my current mental state isn&#x27;t helping. I&#x27;m trying to talk about it to get that spark back and make some big changes in 2021.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this is relatable to anyone here but I genuinely need some support and connection. I feel very alone surrounded by people more interested in my astrology chart than in the wonders of astronomy.')
