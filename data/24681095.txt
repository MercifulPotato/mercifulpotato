OxyContin could grow on trees for all I care - it doesn&#x27;t matter who made it, and that property doesn&#x27;t do anything to strengthen or diminish my argument.<p>To make the argument you&#x27;re making, you would have to prove that it doesn&#x27;t need to exist and was fraudulently made and promoted to deceive, not to help.
