I also think there&#x27;s a confusion here and that you&#x27;re talking specifically about RTF while the people responding to you are talking about the capabilities provided when they use &quot;rich&quot;. The point being that Markdown has far more formatting features than most people who write novels need, and so it is &quot;rich enough&quot; as a format.<p>I&#x27;ve written two novels and I&#x27;m writing my third, and as others have also pointed out, there&#x27;s rarely a need for more than headlines, bold and italics, all of which are trivial in Markdown.<p>Whether or not the <i>editors</i> are capable enough depends on peoples preferences and tools. But there&#x27;s nothing about writing a novel that requires a <i>format</i> more complex while <i>writing</i> (if you send it off to an <i>editor</i>, they&#x27;ll almost certainly insist on something they can import easily into word, though some accept Google Docs or ODT these days)')
