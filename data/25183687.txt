I&#x27;m speaking in the context of that you&#x27;d are calling scientism because I think it&#x27;s the dominant religion of our times. An example is this slogan: &quot;I believe in science&quot;. We might say well, this person is saying they have faith that the scientific method produces ... But I would argue that this person (in aggregate in modern society) is actually much more like a religious believer. They believe without any real idea of what science is.<p>I don&#x27;t dispute the difference between the scientific method and the mythological one. All I&#x27;m saying is that religion had at it&#x27;s heart a hard science and mythology was it&#x27;s product. I am sorry saying that modern science produces mostly mythodology as well. I don&#x27;t claim that everyone has to agree, but this is how it looks to me.<p>So I see a world around me made of scientism. Yet you never hear the word, and certainly it&#x27;s not a legitimate sounding word. So I go a step further and say, our modern religion is science which produces the mythodology which we consume. I think it&#x27;s a valid position. But of course no dominant paradigm likes to consider it&#x27;s falacies.')
