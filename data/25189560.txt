It&#x27;s self-hosting, and it keeps all tickets, wiki and forum posts inside the repo, so that I can work on things offline and do backups very easily.<p>Fossil doesn&#x27;t support basic code review and merge requests though (like Github PRs). Actually it kinda does through bundles, but Github would probably be better for that use case. Don&#x27;t think it will be a problem any time soon for this project, though.<p>All in all, I&#x27;ve used Fossil for about a year and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.')
