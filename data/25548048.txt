I had dreams like many people in high school and none of them came true. Instead of finishing college I joined the military after the stock market collapse in 2008&#x2F;9. Impressions were left on me throughout my early life that I only came to know as an adult. My family got sick, I ruined the relationship that I&#x27;d worked for, and at times I alienated people close to me out of my own sense of self-defense. I pushed myself to the brink repeatedly. My twenties were filled with stress, frustration, confusion, and at times anger. These things taught me acceptance and forgiveness of both myself and others. Looking back, I would not trade them for an easier or more prestigious life.<p>When I came back from Afghanistan I had to scratch, claw, and climb a ladder without a degree thanks in much part to people who saw in me what I could only hoped to have seen in myself. I looked around me when I arrived and I saw Ivy League and top school graduates with multi-million dollar homes, Teslas, and their own literal fig trees in their back yards that complained about everything in life. I&#x27;ve now had the opportunity to live in multiple cultures with varying degrees of prosperity. These things taught me to know my value but to have perspective on what I&#x27;m really asking for.<p>Here I am considering selling all my belongings, buying a truck and an RV to go embrace the new open road that is remote work. Life isn&#x27;t about looking back. It isn&#x27;t even about getting what you want. It&#x27;s about navigating the road in front of you and making the best of the opportunities in front of you and for everyone around you. All that to say, I&#x27;ve embraced the idea that whatever lies ahead is where I&#x27;m supposed to be and I needn&#x27;t look at what my neighbors value or what they have because I don&#x27;t care. This life is mine to live.')
