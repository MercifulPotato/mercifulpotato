Item(by='shirakawasuna', descendants=None, kids=[25098123], score=None, time=1605411681, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25095863, text='&gt; Our perspective is that fascists are not capitalists because they seek to manage the economy through central planning.<p>An incorrect perspective. Fascism is sacrificing one set of the ownership class for another, diverting populism directed against a hostile liberal economic system to only part of that class while giving more power to the rest of it. Fascism is characterized by <i>privatization</i>, not central planning, with a subset of the bourgeoisie gaining vast new powers in comparison. You could even ask Mussolini himself about this in his comments about how fascism should more correctly be called corporatism - and see his transition from opportunistic socialist to opportunistic fascist serving key bourgeois individuals and their interests.<p>&gt; The rest of this argument is not likely to be fruitful unless you can critically examine your notions surrounding property and violence.<p>I can critically examine them and always have been able to. Should I interpret this to <i>actually</i> mean, &quot;until you change your opinions on them&quot;? I figured there would be an accompanying pushback about them, but I don&#x27;t see one.<p>&gt; Theres also a healthy amount of revisionist historical thinking that seeks to whitewash the terrible conditions created by communist countries.<p>Again, this seems to just be, &quot;I disagree&quot;. A fruitful conversation would be one where we can have a discussion and real exchange, not vague dismissiveness.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not interested in debating matters of fact here so thank you for your replies and your perspective.<p>Historical and economic analyses are rarely simple matters of fact and this is a subject where dealing with other perspectives is a necessity. None of what we&#x27;re discussing is at the level of simple facts, they are interpretations depending on a large set of suppositions and historical knowledge.<p>But I welcome a discussion.')
