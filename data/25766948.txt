That assumes it was a completely self-centered act without acknowledging the possibility that they did it because they believed it was the right thing. I would argue that not making any statement would have been more political and less in line with their duty.<p>Yes, its possible there were political reasons but its also possible (and seems more likely to me) that the statement that was released was an attempt at applying a calm steady hand to remind members of the military of their duty and assure them and the general population that they won&#x27;t put up with any anti constitutional behavior.<p>What happened last week was historical; it will be remembered long past the end of our lives. The capitol hasn&#x27;t been violated like that since the war of 1812 when the British took the city. To me, it warranted a statement from them and I can&#x27;t think of a better way that they could have handled it.')
