Item(by='yowlingcat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603290409, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24846303, text='&gt; The EMH is a framework. With any scrutiny it&#x27;s obvious that it can at most be first order accurate since obtaining and processing information is costly. This is not a particularly new insight or one that would be a surprise to any proponent of the EMH.<p>Great clarification. I&#x27;m always suspicious of interpretations of EMH that are a lot more literal than they should be, drawing effectively false conclusions from double negations. I think the truth is as you said.')
