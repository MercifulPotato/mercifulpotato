My software will need a PE sign-off, and so will my dependencies. This will hopefully lead to some OSS libraries getting certified (perhaps with corporate interest funding the certification), creating an excuse&#x2F;incentive for other companies. Now some bank will notice that a third-party app they use internally has eaten their data several times, causing monetary loss, and it&#x27;ll decide that going forward, PE-certified software is prioritized during procurement. Creating incentive for non-critical software vendors to get their software certified. Etc.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if the dynamics would play out this way, but it seems plausible. The goal here is to retain free experimentation - I&#x27;d hate to end up in a world where you aren&#x27;t allowed to use a Turing-complete language without a license - while at the same time forcing responsible software practices where they matter.')
