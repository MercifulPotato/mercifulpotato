Simple as that. The user doesn&#x27;t need to worry about how git manages its data internally.<p>This &quot;simple&quot; model is completely useless when trying to understand what merges, cherry picks, rebases, and patches actually do. Snapshots don&#x27;t naturally do anything, and can&#x27;t be combined in any way.<p>If you think in terms of snapshots, then you have to also start thinking about diff algorithms, and how different diff algorithms can give completely different meanings to what a &quot;merge&quot; or a &quot;rebase&quot; actually mean. Which is true, but given that git comes with one specific diff algorithm built in, and beginners should DEFINITELY not mess with it, it muddies the waters quite a bit.')
