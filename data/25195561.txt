Item(by='sporkologist', descendants=None, kids=[25195669], score=None, time=1606195443, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25188102, text='&gt;&gt; you should stop thinking about it like it&#x27;s a secret language meant to keep you pesky programmers out of it.<p>&gt; I find it&#x27;s rarely a constructive thing when someone tells others how they &quot;should&quot; think. You&#x27;re not really offering any evidence to counter the other user, you&#x27;re essentially just saying &quot;you&#x27;re wrong, just stop questioning things and get in line.&quot;<p>OP is making all kinds of claims about how current keyboards, music theory, and notation (&quot;verbiage&quot; -- jargon?) are overdue for a &quot;refactoring&quot; to the &quot;codebase&quot;.  My evidence is: the current state of the art of music theory and practice in Western civilization. OP&#x27;s evidence is hand-waving conjecture not backed by anything. But you want me to defend my side?<p>&gt; get in line<p>If that means &quot;learn your scales like every other grown-up musician&quot; then yes I will be kind of harsh about it. That&#x27;s the barrier to entry, because no one wants to hear a musician who doesn&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing.<p>&gt; Your argument is like saying Mandarin must always be written in traditional characters because it&#x27;s just complex, it&#x27;s as efficient as it can be. Yet China went from traditional to simplified characters, and Vietnam abandoned characters altogether and uses an alphabet, despite having one more tone than Mandarin.<p>Nothing of the sort. The complexity of language is baked in there. Whether it&#x27;s one character that says 47 different things depending on the inflection, or 47 characters that describe one thing not depending on inflection, the complexity is going to be there.  OP wants to make an improvement to the music system to ostensibly reduce complexity, which while appearing admirable, seems to be based more on his frustration that the &quot;vain professional musicians&quot; are making things too hard for him. Which is misguided energy in my opinion.<p>&gt; You&#x27;re allowed to say you just personally aren&#x27;t interested in new notation or theory verbiage. But you need some pretty strong evidence if you want to claim that the current methods are as efficient as they can be when human history shows that most times, lack of innovation is due to cultural and political factors rather than lack of opportunity for improvement.<p>As efficient as theoretically possible, ever, for the rest of time? Probably not. As efficient as is practicable by today&#x27;s professional musicians? Yes for sure. But improvements are always welcome.<p>&gt; cultural factors<p>There is no way to separate cultural factors from music, which innately involves culture. It&#x27;s not like music exists in an ethereal vacuum and if it wasn&#x27;t for politics and culture, music would be better. Music is part of the fabric of culture.')
