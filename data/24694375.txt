We have to tell customers to stop opening CSVs in Excel and then uploading them to us because what they upload could be missing critical data. Excel interprets a number and then formats it as a number, but in healthcare, 10 digit numbers are really strings.  Unless your IT team has created an Excel extension and had it preloaded onto your local copy, Excel will remove leading zeros and there isn&#x27;t a way to get them back if you save&#x2F;overwrite.')
