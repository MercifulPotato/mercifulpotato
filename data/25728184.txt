If you want type inference you already have auto. If you want to minimize your keystrokes, you&#x27;re using the wrong language to begin with, whether there&#x27;s type inference or not. C++ is designed for writing software robustly, not quickly. (&lt;-- This is not a trivial or obvious statement btw. It took me several years to grasp this. And I viewed C++ from an entirely different perspective when it finally sunk in for me that I would appreciate C++ much more if I decided to make minimizing keystrokes a non-goal.)')
