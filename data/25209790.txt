Who cares if <i>some</i> laws require interpretation. Just write MAY instead of WILL (like RFC language) to make it clear the judge can decide, then provide statistical information regarding past case law. Nobody is saying &quot;fire all the judges&quot;, they&#x27;re just saying make the law clear. Right now it&#x27;s not clear, and it&#x27;s a big problem.<p>Refugee? Read up to date law in your language, automatically. Business? Determine what is required by law in order to execute a transaction. Human? Determine what you are and are not allowed to do in some field (like architecture, driving, sailing, pet walking or rock collecting) without being fined.')
