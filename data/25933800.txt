The common pattern behind those exceptions is that they&#x27;re not as simple as the examples, which gets to a better lesson that OO is not pointless but that you should use it cautiously when you know that your problem domain has a sufficiently complex combination of state and code. Anything is going to seem simpler when you have 2 variables and the whole thing is 20 lines and while it&#x27;s definitely useful to pause before accreting complexity it&#x27;s also important to remember that projects and teams come in many different forms and there&#x27;s no guarantee that something which works for you on a project now will be the best option for someone else with different needs.')
