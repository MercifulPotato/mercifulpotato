For us the main driver is that it would make it harder to run older versions of our program alongside newer versions.<p>We rely on this to be able to bring updates quickly to our customers when their needs change.<p>We also found the tooling lacking for our database server.<p>On the other hand, we don&#x27;t use ORMs, instead mostly relying on handwritten select queries, with &quot;dumb&quot; insert&#x2F;updates being handled by library and others by hand. So we normally don&#x27;t pull more data over the wire than we need.<p>Then again, I guess we&#x27;re a bit old fashioned.')
