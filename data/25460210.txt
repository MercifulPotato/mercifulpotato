But if people are disciplined and DO use Rename&#x2F;Move (and Copy), then P4 is much nicer to use. In particular, since many languages require file contents to be change depending on dir structure, Git often forces you to commit invalid files just to try to ensure that it will pick up the changes.<p>With P4, you can move the files around, adjust everything until it compiles, and only then start telling P4 about what you actually did (you can even start from Reconcile Offline Work, which will try to use exactly Git&#x27;s logic to identify moved&#x2F;renamed&#x2F;copied files based on content - but only one time, on your own machine, not every time someone looks at the history).')
