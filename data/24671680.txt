Their language of choice is javascript or typescript. And if many are complaining about the inconvenience of writing graphql plugins — in javascript! — for Gatsby, imagine the annoyance of having to write the logic for your build step in an entirely different language. In Go, or in Ruby for that matter. It isn&#x27;t fun. You can&#x27;t easily use the skills you developed in javascript to tweak the behavior of the static site generator to your liking. You can&#x27;t extend its behavior by writing a custom plugin. You feel constrained, and at the mercy of Hugo maintainers. It&#x27;s very disheartening.<p>However. There is a fantastic alternative both to Hugo (by being javascript-based) and to Gatsby&#x2F;Next (by not requiring React for the simplest hello world). Its name is Eleventy, and it is beautiful!')
