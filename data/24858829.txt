Converting a large gallons-to-the-mile ICE to an emissions-free electric drive train shows a willingness to cannibalize a previously successful marketing brand with a more responsible offering.<p>Ideally, the EV Hummer would offer comparable or better performance than the ICE, though achieving such will likely take further research and investment.<p>Such manufacturing and marketing moves, though late in coming, are laudable and I sincerely hope such companies blow through their wildest sales projections in the EV market.')
