Very little to do with boomers mentalities, and much more to do with how economic growth has shifted outside the US.<p>That <i>is</i> absolutely the result of US political decisions, but much more the fault of economists and politicians rather than “Boomers” as a whole.<p>If younger generations think they can improve their lot by draining ‘money’ from Boomers, we are going to have a different problem, since the value of anyone’s money is determined by the current health of the economy. Yes a few millennials will be able to displace a few boomers from their decaying houses, but we’ll still have a bunch of sick old people to take care of somehow and an unproductive economy.')
