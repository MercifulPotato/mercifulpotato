If someone&#x27;s got exec access to your container though, you&#x27;ve got bigger problems.<p>&gt; Or do we just accept that you have to treat anyone with access to kubectl as authorised to know your private cert ?<p>You can set up access so that someone can login with Kubectl but still only be readonly, and you can preclude read (&quot;get&quot;) access to secrets to the readonly role, so they won&#x27;t be able to view the contents of the secret.')
