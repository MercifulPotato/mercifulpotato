What harm, specifically, do you think the Section 230 liability shield is causing? What change, specifically, do you think should be made to cure that harm? How would your proposed change not cause sites with UGC to either shut down entirely (thereby eliminating the ability to speak out at all), require pre-approval for <i>all</i> UGC (thereby increasing the amount of censorship), or be overrun by spammers and trolls (thereby making the site useless)? Don’t just think about Twitter and Facebook. Think about Hacker News, or a subreddit you like, or a small community forum that you visit, or the comments section of your favourite tech news site. A change to Section 230 affects <i>everybody</i>.')
