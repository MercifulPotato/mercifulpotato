One can imagine the sort of hell unleashed if later the code is changed to make use of a dangling pointer. That&#x27;s often the type of bug that slips through testing and ends up causing rare unexplained crashes&#x2F;corruption in shipped code. Worse it can take multiple iterations of changes to finally expose the bug.')
