And languages and friendships made in the process. Been everything up to CTO, usually many hats at the same time (last few years - CTO +architect +coder +methodologist +mentor, in startup. Mostly because of the last role). Have my own python course and work-style, mentored a few teams, turned a few people into good programmers-and-persons, consulted a few companies on agile and cultural-health..<p>So, looking for mentoring a team or more, 20-25h&#x2F;week, about programming and life, with me there.. or them here (taken outside comfort zone, people do they best.. or worst). Something like playing trainer, within the team and the project.. coding&#x2F;designing is only the ink of software, made by people, for people.<p>have fun')
