The main difference from Lisp and Smalltalk systems is that FORTH environments are, generally speaking, more spartan.<p>In the late 1980s I had a group of friends at Apple that included Smalltalk, Lisp, and FORTH programmers. We certainly found plenty of things to admire and attempt to steal from one another, and everyone accepted the basic goodness of building systems by engaging in conversation with them as they run.<p>Lisp and Smalltalk cross-pollenated each other more than each did with FORTH, but maybe Slava Pestov&#x27;s Factor is a glimpse of what you get if FORTH is more in the mix.')
