Item(by='dehrmann', descendants=None, kids=[25318863], score=None, time=1607204652, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25318492, text='Which jurisdiction to tax large companies in, even without doing the double Irish trick, is complicated. The question was talking about state income, and taxing all of Amazon&#x27;s profits in Washington doesn&#x27;t really make sense. Amazon also doesn&#x27;t make <i>that</i> much money; its profit margin is 5%; Apple&#x27;s is more like 21%.<p>It&#x27;s also not like the money is never taxed. If Jeff Bezos wants to turn his AMZN shares into dollars, he&#x27;ll federal capital gains on the appreciation. He pays nothing in Washington state because it has no income or capital gains tax, and that&#x27;s Washington&#x27;s choice. Corporate taxes are also a form of double taxation for this reason; the profits are taxed when the company makes the money, and taxed when investors realize gains.<p>Amazon also indirectly pays taxes in ways you&#x27;re not thinking about. There&#x27;s sales tax on sales, taxes on all the supplies it buys, property tax on all the land it owns, payroll tax for employees, and its employees also pay income tax (except in Washington), property tax, etc.<p>Taxes are actually getting collected pretty much everywhere along that chain. The usual criticism is with tax inversions, and even those mostly defer taxes, and because dividends and capital gains are taxed, I&#x27;m not convinced it makes sense to tax corporation.')
