At least for ripgrep in particular, it has always been dual licensed under the MIT and the UNLICENSE[1]. This was itself a continuation of a decision I made a bit earlier with regards to another project[2]. Namely, I had been using only the UNLICENSE. But dual licensing with the MIT allowed folks with a more conservative risk profile to use the project.<p>But the point of linking to VS Code&#x27;s decision was to say that I have direct experience with situations in which a copyleft license might have inhibited use of my software. That is, it&#x27;s an example that runs counter to my goal of as many people using my code as possible.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean copyleft is never used in popular projects or that copyleft somehow perfectly inhibits popularity. I mean, obviously that&#x27;s not true. But the existence of popular copyleft projects doesn&#x27;t mean that copyleft isn&#x27;t itself a barrier to use in other circumstances.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BurntSushi&#x2F;ripgrep&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;COPYING" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BurntSushi&#x2F;ripgrep&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;COPYING</a><p>[2] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BurntSushi&#x2F;byteorder&#x2F;issues&#x2F;26" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BurntSushi&#x2F;byteorder&#x2F;issues&#x2F;26</a>')
