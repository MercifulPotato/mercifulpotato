It&#x27;s a common tactic that has been practiced for decades by political campaigns and even media outlets. Heck, there is a reason why the Kavanaugh story broke when it did. There is a reason why the NY Times published Trump taxes when they did.<p>What&#x27;s different is that all of center-left&#x2F;left news establishment decided that they are going to get Biden elected and protect him from any negative news.')
