All the way from leftover bin junk from 5 years ago sold as new to high end cutting edge.  When you get bellow 900 dollars the market decidedly on the crap side with respect to windows.  There are some exceptions but usually you have to get 1200-1800 before you start get quality items.  Not saying you can not find good stuff near the bottom.  But you get what you pay for.  Usually they skimp on the screen, memory, and disk.  I am currently using an MSI stealth gaming laptop.  other than the keyboard layout being slightly odd i am liking it a lot.  i replaced my previous hp of 8 years.  that will find a new home doing something else once I do a full teardown and repasting.  luckily it is one of the last hp laptops where taking it apart is not a total nightmare.  finding a decent laptop takes a lot of work.  going with apple has a lot of advantages as the hassle of &#x27;picking&#x27; is cut down to a few models, and you have a good shot of it being decent.  I personally would not buy an apple but that is because of other &#x27;petty&#x27; reasons and not quality.')
