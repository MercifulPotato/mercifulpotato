Item(by='mullingitover', descendants=None, kids=[24796040], score=None, time=1602805402, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24795602, text='Ok, let&#x27;s try something easier to understand: Let&#x27;s say that rather than conspiring with aliens, the Post was ginning up a story that Biden conspired with bin Laden and was secretly behind 9&#x2F;11, and they produced some highly suspect documents to back this up. No reputable news outlets verify the story. The Biden campaign produced evidence contradicting the story. And let&#x27;s say the Post did this not just any random time, but as millions of people are actively voting in an election.<p>That&#x27;s what this is - a pretty blatantly false tabloid story being pushed by Rupert Murdoch, the closest thing the world has to a cartoon villain, during the voting process in a major election. In the time it would take to conclusively debunk the story to the public, the damage would already be done. This is straight out of the 2016 election playbook, where disinformation was pushed as voting was happening.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but I can&#x27;t bring myself to clutch pearls over a disreputable tabloid being treated like a disreputable tabloid. If anything it would be good for journalism if they banned the Post from the site forever.')
