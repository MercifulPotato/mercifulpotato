Someone messed up over there and tagged my compensation as delivered, but no money had actually arrived in my bank account. I kept track of the number of emails it took to solve this: &gt;30, 1-2 every week. That&#x27;s only from me, double that for the total.<p>The customer service was simply repeating the same thing over and over: accounting says the money was sent. What aggravated the issue, was that basicly every email was replied by a different customer service agent. I pointed out to them that according to SEPA regulations it is the sender&#x27;s responsibility to ensure that the funds reach the recipient, but they were ignoring it. I didn&#x27;t think to ask to be forwarded to the legal compliance office. I did take legal action, sort of, by complaining through the EU out-of-court dispute resolution platform, but didn&#x27;t receive any response through the platform (might have helped anyway, don&#x27;t know).<p>What helped resolve it, was looking up SEPA regulations (because until then I was saying &quot;this is your responsibility&quot;, they were replying &quot;no it&#x27;s not&quot;), endurance, and a sense of humour.')
