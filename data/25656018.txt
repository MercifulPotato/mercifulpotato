I&#x27;ve just always had trouble buying the argument that &quot;people spend more time in enclosed spaces&quot; in winter. At least not a degree significant enough to make a difference.<p>I go to an office and spend the same amount of time in it in the winter and in the summer. Employees at meatpacking plants and Starbucks baristas don&#x27;t get to work outside in the summertime. Children still go to school, their school days are just as long, and they don&#x27;t have classes outside even if the weather allows it. You still have to walk the dog, whether it&#x27;s summer or winter.<p>All the outdoor activities that are easier to do in warmer weather just don&#x27;t seem to be universal enough to explain effects on a whole population. Most people spend very little time hiking outdoors. As a fraction of the total number of people in the entire country, the number of people who play tennis outdoors is probably tiny. Drinking at the bar versus drinking on an outdoor patio barely seems worth mentioning. Maybe the cold epidemics are driven by agricultural workers who stay indoors in winter? At least they&#x27;re pretty numerous, there are more of them than there are tennis players...')
