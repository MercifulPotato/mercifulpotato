There&#x27;s no rule that says love has to be wholesome and balanced, sadly. Whatever process causes love inside us doesn&#x27;t always work like that. Having run the gamut myself, I&#x27;d rather these men fall in love with an AI that at least talks to them and helps them, than some random girl in a caf√© or online who simply shows them contempt.')
