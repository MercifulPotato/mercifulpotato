There is a claim that CEOs are well paid because they&#x27;re in high demand. The truth is that it&#x27;s actually difficult to find someone who will work for minimum wage in a In-n-Out burger in San Jose. It&#x27;s easy to find a dozen qualified candidates for CEO - hell, half of them are CEOs at similar smaller companies and the other half are CxOs&#x2F;SVPs at the company you&#x27;re hiring for. The myth is that  you need some massive salary to attract the best, whereas what actually happens is you hire who you would&#x27;ve hired anyway, but you pay them a <i>massive premium</i>.')
