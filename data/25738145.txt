Ads, love them or not, have funded the Web thus far. Blockchain is making it even easier to integrate support into the Web. Brave sees the potential in both, and leverages the two together. Users are able to privately and anonymously be rewarded for viewing an occasional ad notification, and turn that into meaningful support for content creators. All other methods of supporting those who make the Web great tend to involve digging into your own pocket (not everybody has disposable income), and&#x2F;or handing over personal details to a third party. Brave&#x27;s approach requires neither of those.')
