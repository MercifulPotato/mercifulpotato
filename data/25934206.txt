At the next NGO debunking, you could pretend you never heard any of this.<p>&quot;Andy Ngo, an editor at Quillette, wrote an opinion column in the Wall Street Journal about &quot;Islamic England&quot; that plays fast and loose with facts and context in a cowardly attempt to fear monger around England&#x27;s Muslim population.<p>Ngo visits pockets of Muslims living in London to paint a picture of a terrifying and restrictive land governed by religious law, which is an absolute fabrication that must have required him to willfully ignore facts.&quot;  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;wall-street-journals-andy-ngo-writes-cowardly-islamic-england-2018-8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;wall-street-journals-andy-ng...</a><p>&quot;Though he poses as a journalist, the purpose of his platform is to sow harassment and violence against his targets on the Left — and the mainstream media have fallen for it.&quot;  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jacobinmag.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;andy-ngo-right-wing-antifa-protest-portland-bigotry" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jacobinmag.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;andy-ngo-right-wing-antif...</a><p>&quot;But it wasn’t until Ngo was attacked at the June rally that he truly ascended to the ranks of right-wing media crap-stirrer. “Attacked by antifa.
