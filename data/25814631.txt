No one has been &quot;banned from society&quot; based on &quot;legal speech&quot;, a meaningless phrase.<p>A lot of people have been banned from using specific internet services because they used them to make threats of violence, or to tell dangerous lies about COVID.<p>This isn&#x27;t &quot;banning them from society&quot;.  Get a grip!<p>Also, we are talking two classes of people here:<p>* people who work against humanity to spread COVID-19 based on a pack of obvious lies<p>* people who wish to violently overthrow the elected US government based on a pack of obvious lies<p>and frankly, these people can get fucked.  They are destroying the country and the planet, and they deserve every single penalty the law can give them.<p>If private corporations, which Republicans claim to love, use their perfectly legal power to stop doing business with horrible psychopaths, then good for them.<p>One side went crazy, and now we have to choose sides.<p>Are you on the side of the delusional hateful lawbreaking violent psychopaths, or with the majority?<p>(My theory - you are not with the majority.)')
