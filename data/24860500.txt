This is true even in the state of Karnataka, which possesses the so-called &#x27;Silicon Valley&#x27; of India, BLR, which ironically is located in the midst of a vast plateau.<p>In comparison, China which started out it a much worse economic position (WWII, CCP..), and with a far more difficult writing system, has ended up today a &gt;95% literacy rate.<p>I realize people like to downvote these pessimistic comments, just because &#x27;India is the next superpower&#x27;, the &#x27;great hope of democracies&#x27; that will take PRC&#x27;, but how this can happen without any groundwork is something I can&#x27;t comprehend.<p>It takes a whole 20-25 years for a generation to grow up. The tiny sliver that is being reared are very good at servicing people by emigrating to other countries and this is how India (like Phillipines) earns much of its forex. How they can turn into a &#x27;superpower&#x27; by turning themselves into a country of glorified serfs is beyond my understanding.<p>Worse yet, Indians themselves are sucked up to this drunken madness instead of focusing on real problems that have remained unsolved over the past ~80 years either due to political incompetence, or worse conscious decision-making.')
