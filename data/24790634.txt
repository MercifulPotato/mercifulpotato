Item(by='runako', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602780223, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24790129, text='&gt; Most of the big tech cos. can replace Zoom overnight.<p>This ignores the fact that Zoom rose alongside competing offerings from all of the big tech cos. You cite using Google Meet, which has essentially existed (as Hangouts and G+) for all of Zoom&#x27;s lifetime. Microsoft bought Skype around the time Zoom was founded (edit: and obviously has Teams now). Cisco bought WebEx in 2007. GoToMeeting (Citrix) is older than Zoom.<p>And that&#x27;s without counting the transit providers (AT&amp;T, Verizon, Comcast, etc. in the US), who have been doing video chat trials since the late &#x27;80s. Again, all big rich companies.<p>Edit: Amazon has video calling in Alexa &amp; Chime. Facebook has Portal. IBM had Sametime until 2019.<p>The assumption that the big tech companies can replace Zoom overnight needs to account for the fact that Zoom started in a marketplace crowded by competition from big public companies and should never have achieved traction. Not to compare them directly, but people made similar arguments about Google, which also launched into a crowded marketplace and was &quot;overvalued&quot; etc.<p>Note: I am not taking a position on Zoom&#x27;s valuation.')
