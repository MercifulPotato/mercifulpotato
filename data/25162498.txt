NPR claims that it costs $6.30 to mail something across the street. They never give a specific number for a shipment from China to compare to.<p>Prices have gone up since then, but even today the most expensive option with no pre-sorting for 13 oz is only $5.39. It can go as low as $2.36 depending on the level of sorting.<p>NPR is clearly not doing an apples to apples comparison, and nobody has tried to defend them, they just attacked the numbers I sourced.<p>Now, you&#x27;re saying that China does full pre-sorting to the zip code level but doesn&#x27;t deliver to the closest location. This is roughly equivalent to the 5-digit DNDC option, which currently costs $3.56 - maybe slightly more because I don&#x27;t know the exact details of how China delivers to the US. And it was lower at the time of the NPR article, which claimed the domestic price would be $6.30.')
