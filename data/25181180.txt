Why should they set different prices for different markets in excess of the costs to ship between those markets?<p>It sounds like they&#x27;re being overly aggressive with their price segmentation. When setting up your first lemonade stand, you learn that you should set prices at the sum of costs for goods, labor, and overhead, plus a profit margin, hoping that the output of your manufacture delivers more value to your customers than that sum. Shimano doesn&#x27;t want to be paid a flat rate for the value they add, they would prefer that everyone to pay exactly as much as they could possibly be willing to pay.')
