It reminds me very strongly of an accent I&#x27;ve been hearing on tech support telephone call frequently in the past 5 years but never recalled hearing before that. I have a pet theory that it&#x27;s actually from a new technique for more rapidly teaching intelligible English pronunciation to folks learning it as a second language.  But maybe it&#x27;s just an accent from a region that only recently started hosting lots of tech support calls?')
