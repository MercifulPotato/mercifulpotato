That is not threads or anything, that can be and is being done in a single threaded program.<p>AMD and Intel have 4 units for reordering tops, because their architecture is CISC and on instruction can be up to 15 bytes. M1 is RISC and instructions are just 4 byte fixed-length.\nThus architecturally it is easier to reorder instructions for  RISC than CISC.<p>CISC were better because of the specific instructions but now Apple has stuffed their CPU with specific hardware for alot of things including machine learning, graphic processor and encryption, instead of specific instructions, Apple has specific hardware, and can do with less instructions.<p>And since they control hardware, software SDKs and OS they can actually get away with such radical changes. Intel and others can&#x27;t, without a big change in industry.<p>Source:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;debugger.medium.com&#x2F;why-is-apples-m1-chip-so-fast-3262b158cba2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;debugger.medium.com&#x2F;why-is-apples-m1-chip-so-fast-32...</a>')
