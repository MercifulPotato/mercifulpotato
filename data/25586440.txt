Won&#x27;t you please further this discussion and share it instead of making vague allegations about right-wing conspiracies?<p>It&#x27;s well known that Covid-19 is by wildly disproportionately more lethal as age increases[1] and it&#x27;s also well known that older people on average have less life left than younger people.<p>Also please note that deaths of despair is a broader category than suicide[2]. Someone who drinks himself to death isn&#x27;t counted as a suicide, even though it&#x27;s a person taking action that ends his own life earlier than it otherwise would. Alcohol consumption has increased markedly during the pandemic[3].<p>Caring about 2nd and higher order effects isn&#x27;t a right-wing conspiracy theory, it&#x27;s just a sensible, intelligent, and compassionate thing to do. We should expect better than kindergarten tier reasoning from our leadership.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;covid-data&#x2F;investigations-discovery&#x2F;hospitalization-death-by-age.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;covid-data&#x2F;investi...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marketwatch.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;the-same-number-of-people-could-die-from-deaths-of-despair-as-have-already-died-in-the-us-from-coronavirus-new-study-finds-2020-05-08" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marketwatch.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;the-same-number-of-people-...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnews.go.com&#x2F;US&#x2F;alcohol-consumption-rising-sharply-pandemic-women&#x2F;story?id=73302479" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnews.go.com&#x2F;US&#x2F;alcohol-consumption-rising-sharply...</a>')
