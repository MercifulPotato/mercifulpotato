He&#x27;s not wrong. Gentoo makes it easier to have compile flags while building your system. Say you want to disable pulseaudio support completely? You can get rid of it completely from anything that might link to it by setting it globally as a flag you want to avoid.<p>Sure the guide doesn&#x27;t follow a threat model, but there&#x27;s still some good advice in there. If someone follows the guide as dogmatic gospel, as a list of rules to follow at all cost, that&#x27;s on them. If one is responsible for securing down their stack, maybe they should know better than following everything down to the bone as if it&#x27;s some gospel.')
