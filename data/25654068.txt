Although I wish they documented how much compute and data was used to get these results.<p>I absolutely believe we&#x27;ll crack the fundamental principles of intelligence in our lifetimes. We now have capability to process all public data available on internet (of wikipedia is a huge chunk). We have so many cameras and microphones (one in each pocket).<p>It&#x27;s also scary to think if it goes wrong (the great filter for fermi paradox). However I&#x27;m optimistic.<p>The brain only uses 20 watts of power to do all its magic. The entire human body is built from 700MB of data in the DNA. The fundamental principles of intelligence is within reach if we look from that perspective.<p>Right now GPT3 and DALL-E seem to be using an insane amount of computation to achieve what they are doing. My prediction is that in 2050, we&#x27;ll have pretty good intelligence in our phones that has deep understanding (language and visual) of the world around us.')
