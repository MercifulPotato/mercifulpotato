I live in NYC and commuted year-round to work via bicycle for 5 years straight ... and then COVID happened, I haven&#x27;t even been allowed into the office in 9 months, and my bicycling activity has correspondingly plummeted off a cliff. I now do most of my biking on weekends (for errands and such), which was far from true before March.<p>So, it&#x27;s amazing how much the cycling numbers here have gone up even with people like me staying home. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how many people are cycling once it&#x27;s all over. Will people like me going back to cycling be added on top of all the others who switched from subway to cycling, or will they go back to subway?')
