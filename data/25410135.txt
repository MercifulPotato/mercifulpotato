How exactly is situation B less safe than A?<p>You are instead comparing B with (C): two VMs, each running a process.<p>Whether k8s &#x2F; docker or VMWare Workspace &#x2F; custom Xen etc is worse is another question. In my limited experience they are all terrible. But that is distinct from containerisation (confinement at the syscall layer + tooling).')
