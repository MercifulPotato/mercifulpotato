It was almost a windows only thing. It required constant updates independantly of the browser, sometimes not working properly. It was also a common cause of browser crashes. There was low control over what it was doing (remember those horrible ads with blasting sound?) Having a plugin to block flash was almost mandatory. It was also taking over user input in a way that always seems to break website that were a mix of html and flash. Flash was a horrible user experience.<p>The flash editor was indeed a user friendly and nice tool to get into vector animations though, for anything else HTML&#x2F;js already does a much better job than flash in my opinion.<p>One thing i&#x27;ll never get is why adobe didn&#x27;t open source flash player instead of killing it. The money was in the editor, not the player. Open sourcing it might have changed its fate.')
