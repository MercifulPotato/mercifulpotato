My Rocky Mountain has a 10-51 on the rear and I have a 30-34 Oval ring up front (One-Up Components). I can climb anything!<p>But there&#x27;s an awesome side effect of drive trains like this, they&#x27;re really noob friendly. I used to sit in the top three gears when going uphill, but now the 51 tooth is reserved for climbing walls as my fitness has improved.<p>Long live the 1x12!')
