Item(by='thiago_fm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611676805, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25914302, text='I used to take punctuation and grammar very seriously until I&#x27;ve met a person that studied literature(was almost a PhD at the time) and showed me a movement of people writing poetry without punctuation or proper grammar, as well they wrote like people spoke in different regions spoke colloquially in my home country. It gave those texts much more meaning, feeling and made sense, as rarely people spoke anywhere close as school lectured them to write it.<p>I&#x27;ve became quite fond of that idea, because I&#x27;ve always dealt with the &quot;representation&quot; problem having the background I have. Basically almost everybody in my country is poor and had &quot;poor&quot; education, our language was brought to us by europeans by force. I&#x27;ve never felt like the same as the people who had parents which spoked in a very polished way, because my parents didn&#x27;t. So didn&#x27;t my family and friends.<p>I&#x27;ve became a bit happier about myself and who I am as I started to accept the way I write. I also don&#x27;t buy all the cultural heritage we&#x27;ve got and I believe I can think for myself and leave those tiny languages nuances, that might be important when people are writing laws or fancy books that I&#x27;m not interested at as I know that the reason behind those are usually to rip people off, or to feel that they don&#x27;t belong. It&#x27;s like a race of imperfect people to see who is the least imperfect, sort of tragic. Rather than people trying to find acceptance and who they are.<p>I feel it has a very negative impact to my fellow nation, as we can&#x27;t really identify with the europeans and meanwhile we always feel like we are doing something wrong.')
