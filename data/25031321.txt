Item(by='Veedrac', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604894270, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25028500, text='I don&#x27;t want to dismiss automated provers, as they are often quality, useful tools (SAT solvers in particular), but if you&#x27;re interested in learning <i>AI</i>, traditional approaches are no longer more than briefly and tangentially relevant.<p>That&#x27;s my point, that you don&#x27;t need to learn woodworking to build a car, even if wooden carts still have occasional uses, and some cars have wood trim or wooden trailers.<p>&gt; If I am permitted to tout my own horn, my broader subject area can be described as &quot;program learning&quot;, i.e. machine learning of arbitrary programs from examples of their inputs and outputs. In this area also, deep learning systems are hopelessly outclassed by symbolic approaches, not least because these approaches learn precise representations of target programs (rather than approximations) from a mere handful of examples (four or five, etc).<p>I have looked at the program synthesis literature before and it really does not seem very advanced to me. The General Program Synthesis Benchmark Suite lists unsolved benchmarks like “Given three\nstrings n1, n2, and n3, return true if length(n1) &lt;\nlength(n2) &lt; length(n3), and false otherwise”, and that&#x27;s with 100 examples. So, probably less practically useful than GPT-3, which wasn&#x27;t even trained on the task.<p>&gt; the last winter happened because of strictly political reasons and for no reason that had anything to do with the scientific merits, or practical successes of the relevant approaches<p>I disagree, but you&#x27;ve not given me much more than a list of vague references that don&#x27;t all exactly support your argument, so I don&#x27;t have much clue where you diverge.<p>If GOFAI worked, we&#x27;d see some indication of it working (again, in an AI context), but we don&#x27;t.<p>&gt; But if you think about it, in the era where the trend is to use deep learning, the most interesting results can only come from not using deep learning. In a gold rush, if everyone is digging up Widow&#x27;s Creek, then Widow&#x27;s Creek is the last place to dig for gold.<p>This analogy doesn&#x27;t work. Neural networks are giving unparalleled results by the bucket. That&#x27;s why people are digging there. A gold mine might have plenty of competing miners, but it&#x27;s sure going to be a lot more likely to give you chunks of gold than a random patch of grass in your backyard.')
