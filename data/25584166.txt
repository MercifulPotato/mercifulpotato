There simply aren’t comps that can compete in terms of location, size, and amenities that don’t also have a $1200&#x2F;month HOA and $900+&#x2F;month taxes, interest, and insurance. In 5 years rent has gone up\n$50, meanwhile my 401k and other investments have maintained 10% year over year returns and I could now afford to outright buy houses and condos I was interested in 5 years ago. Or I could move out to the ‘burbs on a $600-900&#x2F;month mortgage.<p>Now, if only I could work somewhere that I felt like I was changing the world in ways I’m more interested in (high tech vs automotive), I would feel less pull to uproot in my mid-30’s for a place where Google or Amazon are hiring.')
