While it&#x27;s not perfect it&#x27;s amazing the difference between the system there vs the system in America.  I think one of the problems with Elder care in the US is that it&#x27;s hard to talk about Elder care while we are still arguing about universal health care.  It&#x27;s also hard to talk about how we could create a similar system in the US, because the basis for the system is adult children care for their parents, and mandatory long term care insurance provides coverage where that is not possible.')
