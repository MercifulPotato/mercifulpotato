Baker is treated as a merger case, but it’s more a case about the difference between copyright and a method patent. Baker claimed that copying the general structure of the tables was infringement. The court essentially held that the structure that was copied was the structure dictated by the method itself. And Selden couldn’t copyright any table that had the same structure because that would give him a monopoly on the method.<p>Here, the Java APIs were copied literally. For example, say you’ve got a function to append an item to a list:<p>Append(item, list)\nAppend(list, item)<p>If you changed the order of the parameters, you wouldn’t be literally copying, even though it’s the same basic signature. That’s the Baker case. You can’t monopolize the method of appending an item to a list by extending copyright to all possible permutations of the limited ways to write the signature.<p>But what happens if you do literally copy? That’s this case. Then, the question is whether these choices of where to put the parameter reflect any creativity.<p>I happen to think they do—I strongly prefer the first form, which is how it’s done in the Common Lisp standard library.')
