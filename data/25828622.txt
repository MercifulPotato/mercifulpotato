I agree that Musk&#x27;s other ventures also challenge existing incumbents but I feel like ISPs are probably more (even if much less than I would like) nimble than in transportation (terrestrial and otherwise) industries and said ISPS already have better service at least in well populated areas than Starlink could possibly provide via radio frequencies even in low earth orbit.  The window of opportunity seems small to me.<p>I guess I&#x27;m just wondering if I am overly sceptical of the hype around Starlink that I have seen, if I&#x27;m somehow missing something fundamental.')
