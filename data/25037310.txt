Sadly Samsung sold their printer division to HP. HP even removed features from the driver, they took out the ability to do manual duplex printing.<p>HP doesn&#x27;t sell toner for my model anymore but I was able to find it from cdw. I figure the printer will outlast my ability to find toner for it.<p>This just confirms my already existing stance to never buy anything from HP.')
