We&#x27;re baremetal. Setting up an ELK stack, log ingestion, openresty, gitlab, CI, rabbitmq, etc: no problem. Making our applications hot-deploy and HA: no problem.<p>When we ran PostgreSQL, I was using barman for PITR and that was fine. But getting PostgreSQL in HA? My confidence in relation to how critical that piece is? Nope. Even just trying to handle upgrades with no downtime scared me. If I had to do it, I&#x27;d look at repmgr.<p>The story is completely different with CockroachDB. We have 3 instances and taking down an instance (or the server it&#x27;s on) for maintenance is no problem. The setup also probably couldn&#x27;t be easier. Most importantly, if an instance goes down in the middle of the night: our app keeps working.')
