Everything up to step 7 works. So Huemer&#x27;s axioms amount to the statement &quot;under hard determinism, whatever I believe is true&quot; (as Burner states in premise 6, but restricts to MFT).<p>No wonder then if you then introduce the premise &quot;I believe hard determinism is false&quot; you get a contradiction.')
