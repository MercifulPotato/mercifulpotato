I used to respond to all of them daily, then I was so burned out from that chore that I don’t even read my notifications anymore.<p>Funny how people here think it’s just basic human decency to spend an hour of my time each day responding to people who managed to click a submit button. For every HNer here bragging about how thoughtful their issues are, there are 100s of low effort issues from people who won’t even respond to a follow up.<p>Running popular projects has shown me there’s no “free” in open source just because literal money isn’t exchanging hands. It’s basically a ddos of your time.<p>Github needs a feature where you can attach a tip to your issue to compensate the maintainer. I get so much\nlow effort garbage that I would set a $10 minimum on my most popular projects.<p>People here think bug reports are free labor. What they would know if they ran a project is that most bug reports, even with an issue template, are “it doesnt work wtf.”')
