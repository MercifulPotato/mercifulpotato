The problem, of course, is that a healthy level of skepticism should only inform the investigation of facts, and then perhaps new legislation and oversight. Without the investigation, oversight or legislation... the skepticism is pointless.<p>For example, it&#x27;s unfortunate that gaming machines in Las Vegas have more oversight and regulations than voting machines. That doesn&#x27;t necessarily there is a problem with voting machines, but it does mean we could do more to ensure there isn&#x27;t a problem with them now or in the future. Dominion has not done anything to lose my trust, but when it comes our elections, we should have proper oversight over these machines (no matter who makes them since there are multiple suppliers for voting machines).')
