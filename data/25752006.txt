Nah, never heard of it. Dismiss with prejudice? I&#x27;m not prejudice! (Magistrates in my state don&#x27;t even have to be lawyers)<p>My god, no wonder there are people who want to actually <i>abolish</i> the police. Gave me a lot of perspective. I contacted a civil rights lawyer and he said I have a case, but that judges don&#x27;t want to be bothered with it unless it involves significant financial damages. Says a lot about how much the system values our rights.')
