From what I understand, the run up to mobile was a major source of funding for GNOME 2 from several mobile companies, and that&#x27;s where all the developers came from, but most of those companies were not able to keep up and failed to iOS&#x2F;Android. So the funding dried up and Red Hat was one of the few companies that happened to survive because of their other business. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve heard but you should talk to more people who were actually involved in the project back then if you want a more complete answer. (Please assume good faith and don&#x27;t be hostile, we&#x27;re all friends here, these are just developers trying to pay the bills like the rest of us)')
