I don&#x27;t think decade long transitions from old tech to new tech is a bad time scale or even close to that of the churn of web technologies. Julia offers enough of an improvement over Python to warrant a switch over the next 5-10 years and leave Python behind in the same way. I believe Julia offers the same level of improvement over Python as Python does over MATLAB.<p>I also believe that it has drawn too much from MATLAB only for the sake of being familiar to that group and not the computer science and software engineering communities though such as the one based indexing you mentioned. Unfortunately that ship has already sailed and we will likely have to wait another 10 years for the next one to hopefully fix those problems.')
