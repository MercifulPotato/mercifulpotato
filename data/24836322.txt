After using &quot;modern C&quot; (as in C99 or later) for a while it becomes quite obvious that this isn&#x27;t the case anymore, instead C++ was a fork of C and developed into a very different direction (including developing the original C subset into a non-standard C dialect). Especially with more recent C++ standards, C and C++ have become different languages with very different goals.')
