On the one side, we have a beautiful thing memorializing the most basic, and instinctually pleasant of human activities (sex between adults).<p>On the other side, we have something so unequivocally and fundamentally immoral that many countries place it on the same level as <i>murder</i>, and even typical murderers draw their own moral line against it.<p>The two can&#x27;t be spoken with in the same sentence.<p>If PornHub is complicit in child pornography, every single executive involved should go to prison. If MasterCard has evidence, or suspicion that PornHub is complicit then they <i>must</i> turn such evidence over to the authorities immediately, and have a moral (not legal) duty to ensure that all the PornHub executives they dealt with are prosecuted. This is a poison barrel issue from which no one must escape.<p>However, the way MasterCard is acting is as if they merely want to break ties with a high-fraud risk client, whose risk profile may have changed during the COVID crisis. It reeks of a company protecting profit margins, and <i>not</i> of a company hurriedly running away from a tarpit of felonies and turpitude.<p>I may be wrong, and PornHub will be destroyed within 2021 like BackPage was, but right now I doubt it. VISA was their primary payment processor, and they only cut off access after MasterCard made public allegations. VISA has their own evaluations team, and I know from experience they&#x27;re quite strict. The question is how could they not catch this before MasterCard?')
