A bad translation is effectively a new work, at best inspired by the original bad script. You could replace a bad Japanese script with a &quot;good&quot; English one - this has happened before - but at that point it&#x27;s questionable whether any translation has happened at all, you&#x27;re mostly writing new content inspired by the original work or adhering to broad constraints.<p>What distinction are you drawing between working with an editor vs working with a translator? Often it&#x27;s a very similar process, and there are cases where something is cleaned up in a translation and then that gets incorporated back into the next edition in the original language.')
