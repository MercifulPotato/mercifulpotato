Linux has less than 2% of the desktop market share (that includes laptops).  Where&#x27;s the payoff for the huge investment required to make a dent?  The numbers just don&#x27;t add up.  Apple has made this happen using their massive iOS product revenue to fuel their custom CPU development teams.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gs.statcounter.com&#x2F;os-market-share&#x2F;desktop&#x2F;worldwide" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gs.statcounter.com&#x2F;os-market-share&#x2F;desktop&#x2F;worldwide</a><p>As you say, Qualcomm is probably the closest to being competitive, but there is a lot of work to do to catch up.  Nvidia is trying to acquire ARM, so they seem to be interested in moving into the space.  Samsung and AMD are now working together in ARM processors, so they are another player.  Intel used to have an ARM presence via their DEC acquisition, but that was sold to Marvell about 10 years ago.  Marvell might move into the space.  There are also some ARM startups, some of which were founded by Apple engineers.  Lots of activity.  Intel is probably the biggest loser in all of this.  Sad to see that.  They will respond, but it will take time.<p>At any rate, in terms of desktop market size, Windows is the biggest (76%) and getting a chunk of that processor revenue is a big enough payoff to warrant the required investment.  Doubling or even tripling Linux desktop share is comparatively small potatoes.  Microsoft is mostly agnostic so they will encourage cannibalizing X86 Windows in favor or ARM Windows rather than lose market share.  I think we are going to see a big uptick in ARM Windows investment and product announcements.')
