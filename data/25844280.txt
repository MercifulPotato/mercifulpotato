But since we can speculate about the outcome of a truly free market, here&#x27;s my view:<p>In a free market, the first entrepreneur to get a loan from the bank to build up some of the infrastructure would beat all the public collectives - they could just build up, sell at a loss until the local collective gives up, and jack up prices as most users switch to their offering. Rinse and repeat, and with every iteration it only gets easier - because wealth and power compound, much like interest in the bank.<p>A free market structurally favors larger companies. Unlike what some people say, government intervention is neither necessary nor sufficient to enable monopolies - all that&#x27;s required is the positive feedback loop on capital. The more you have, the easier it is to get more.')
