Which wouldn&#x27;t even surprise me, I could imagine them doing some stupid A&#x2F;B testing to discover they got more people clicking around when durations were removed.<p>But regardless, it&#x27;s insane that one of the biggest sources of internet traffic on the planet is software that can render a bunch of images (thumbnails) but it takes several seconds to display a few characters of text on them. I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re grabbing durations as a separate API call, or if that&#x27;s just how slow their JavaScript is. Either way, it&#x27;s pathetic.')
