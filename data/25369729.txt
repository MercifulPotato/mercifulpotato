That is like saying the Supreme Court shouldn&#x27;t have a say over how Federal laws are applied. It&#x27;s their entire job.<p>And all this is ignoring the idea that the legal system <i>ought</i> to represent the democratic will of the people and the institutional processes they put in place, whether it&#x27;s via upholding the laws of the legislature or the vote.')
