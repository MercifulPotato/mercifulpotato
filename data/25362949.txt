Here is why:<p>We were told that Russia interfered in 2016 elections and helped to elect Trump. Now, we are told that 2020 elections were of the highest integrity. Why wouldn&#x27;t Russia interfere in 2020 elections? Were they scared of Trump administration?   But wait, we were told that Trump was Russian puppet, so they would be scared of him, right? So again, why wouldn&#x27;t Russia interfere in 2020 elections? Or did Russia interfered in 2020 election, &quot;just as they did in 2016&quot;, and elected Biden this time?<p>In short, Tech Media narrative does not make sense to me. And all censorship eventually fails, just take a look at the Fall of Socialism in the Soviet Union.')
