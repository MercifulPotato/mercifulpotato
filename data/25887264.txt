But again, that&#x27;s the wrong way to look at it. The way to do it is to look at actual fraud problems that businesses are actually having and then see what measures, technological and otherwise, best mitigate the problem.<p>Even if the fraud in question was of the very specific type where somebody fiddles records after the initial write (as opposed to fiddling them before, or on output, or making offsetting transactions, or any of the many other ways to hide internal fraud) I still wouldn&#x27;t try to set up some sort of multi-organizational distributed blockchain ledger. I&#x27;d just write a regular ledger to some immutable medium. E.g., AWS&#x27;s WORM solution. [1] That would not only be simpler, clearer, cheaper, and more thoroughly vetted, it would also be very easy to prove compliance with the sorts of standards used to prevent fraud.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;storage&#x2F;protecting-data-with-amazon-s3-object-lock&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;storage&#x2F;protecting-data-with-am...</a>')
