If the army needed they have the money to put into developing a car computer specialized in whatever terrain they needed to.<p>Their problem is being easy to repair.<p>Most of the regular people can take their cars to a shop that will have the really basic in stock (ie. oils and filters) and can order most of the rest from a distributor to have delivered same or next day for most cars. You will only take longer to get specialized parts or parts for unusual cars. Also most people can work around not having a car for a few days even if it is a hassle.<p>While army base does have specialized mechanics to properly fix the trucks, if one break in the middle of a mission after engagement the team in that truck need to be able to patch it up and get it going on the field.<p>So the army need trucks that people that are primarily soldiers and not mechanics can patch up &quot;easily&quot; in the field without tons of specialized training, without access to special or weird tools and minimal to no access to parts.')
