Does innovation not count if you&#x27;re not doing it for charity? For several years I was reading articles about how Moore&#x27;s Law was totally over and we couldn&#x27;t expect any more improvements in chips, and then along comes Apple to blow x86 out of the water.<p>&gt; but it&#x27;s still an investment not directly tied to product (their core competency)<p>I don&#x27;t even agree with this- Apple&#x27;s core competency is the top-to-bottom customer experience, which they (almost certainly correctly) think they can improve by making their own silicon. But even if it was true, so what? Again, &quot;investment not directly tied to product&quot; doesn&#x27;t make innovation &quot;not count&quot;.')
