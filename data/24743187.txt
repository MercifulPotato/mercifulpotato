Dealers don&#x27;t want cars to last more than a month or so on their lot unsold.<p>Most people won&#x27;t balk from buying a plain looking car, but they may not want a yellow, purple, red or green car. So dealers don&#x27;t order many brightly varied cars.<p>You also have to remember that even if a person does want a green car, for instance, they may not want the options on THAT green car.<p>Different color paint doesn&#x27;t take any longer in the paint booth, but some colors show defects better, and it&#x27;s a LOT of work to do color harmonization - making the plastic bits match the painted body.<p>It only takes about 24 hours or less to take a car from parts to finished product, the lead time comes from getting parts from suppliers.')
