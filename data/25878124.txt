Often when a rheumatologist sees frequent use they can prescribe a sustained release NSAID that doesn&#x27;t present as much risk to the stomach, etc., compared to frequent dosing of OTC pills. Since this medication is just attempting to control inflammation, it is taken in response to a mild or severe flare up to try and make the pain stop, but isn&#x27;t always the most effective. The best solution for people in these cycles is to journal their behaviors, habits, sleep, food intake, and try to find patterns in what causes the flare-up and then avoid those in the future.<p>Diagnosing an autoimmune disease on your own isn&#x27;t advised, you should really see a specialist, not a GP. Specifically, get a referral to a rheumatologist. Blood work, sometimes xrays are required to properly diagnose. There are some 200+ known autoimmune disorders if I recall correctly, many people end up with a two-for-one deal. Sj√∂gren&#x27;s and Raynaud&#x27;s seem to be not uncommon companions of other disorders, for instance.')
