All the advanced stuff is only in books (networking, sockets, concurrency (which is an absolute nightmare in VB6), etc.).  And, note, the primary purpose of that website is to <i>sell a book</i>.<p>And, as for screw threads, tap and die simply aren&#x27;t accurate enough for stuff like watchmaking (although with modern technology--carbide cutters, titanium materials, CNC machines, etc.--they <i>might</i> be).<p>The screw thread question wasn&#x27;t hypothetical.  I actually asked at a fairly big machinist&#x27;s meetup how to do that on a jeweler&#x27;s lathe.  Nobody knew how.<p>The answer, it turns out, is that they would build a custom power feed.  This is documented on p62-76 of &quot;Practical Benchwork for Horologists.&quot;  This is such an important concept that the book devotes more than 10% of the &quot;Tools and their Uses&quot; section to it and it&#x27;s the only thing in the book with actual plans.<p>Yet nobody now knows.  And I had to <i>figure out</i> where the answer might lie with very little guidance.  And I had to buy the book <i>blind</i> to figure that out.  I got lucky and the book was $20 (it&#x27;s normally about $200) so I took a flyer (It&#x27;s a wonderful look at the art of machining.  As I explained to my wife why I found a nearly 100 year old book so entertaining--&quot;It&#x27;s engineering porn.  You&#x27;re not supposed to understand.&quot;)<p>I couldn&#x27;t request it via interlibrary loan from any library in my purview.  I couldn&#x27;t find the knowledge online.<p>And this wasn&#x27;t a terribly rare book.  Sure, it wasn&#x27;t a bestseller, but it went through 7 or 8 editions over about 70 years.  There is <i>zero</i> reason for it to be gone other than the libraries <i>threw it out</i>.')
