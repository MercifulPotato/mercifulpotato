There&#x27;s always something, but in this case the primary &quot;lobby&quot; is probably law enforcement and intelligence.<p>Corporations like google are somewhere between neutral and pro-privacy, or rather, against sharing their data with law enforcement.<p>Where money-politics does play, it&#x27;s probably apathy related.
