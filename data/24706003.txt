Already on the old system, I was paid significantly more than my US citizen colleagues due to the minimum wage. Iâ€™m worried about what this rule change will do to my field, where talented postdocs are hard to find. It also never made sense to me to invest many $100k in foreign Ph.D. students to then make it so hard for them to repay part of this investment to the country.')
