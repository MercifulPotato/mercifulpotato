Price is a meeting of supply and demand, and we&#x27;re discussing an asset that is roughly only a decade old. Of course the price is volatile, but that does not reflect anything <i>intrinsic</i> about the utility of Bitcoin itself. If gold never existed, and just suddenly starting raining from the sky occasionally, we would also have trouble meeting minds on the effective price of this sky rock.')
