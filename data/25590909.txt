Most of the IT &quot;service&quot; companies in India mandate 9 or 9.5Hrs a day and there is no overtime if you work more (which is always needed to match some meetings scheduled in client&#x27;s timezone). Worst some companies do not even have paid sick leaves so I hardly imagine here we will get such 4 day week option in near future.')
