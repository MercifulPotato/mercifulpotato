Also rebooting without saving the state of the applications opened while the user is working away, not great either. There are reason why security is taking a back seat, business needs are greater than the risk incurred by user bad behaviour.<p>BTW how is it that Windows 10 still needs more reboot to update any parts of itself, than a regular Linux distro? The update cycle on my Windows 10 machine is maddening compared to my Linux workstation.')
