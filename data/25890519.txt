It was an interesting experience with his wine, but in my experience  the optimal temporal span for tasting a single wine is no more than a few hours.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nicolas_Joly" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nicolas_Joly</a>')
