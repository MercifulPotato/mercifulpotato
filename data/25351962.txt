There is a financial motivation that is misaligned with trying to help you; they (and their employers) have very twisted incentives to try to get you to do procedures that are at best unnecessary and expensive, but at worst potentially damaging to your health.<p>I&#x27;ve seen and dealt with it enough times in my life, and came to the frustrating conclusion that you really just have to look out for yourself. Don&#x27;t rely on doctors unless you know them personally.<p>Not that it&#x27;s super related to this Q-Tip thing. I just had to take issue with this, because I hear it so often, and it is really just a lazy cover-your-ass line.')
