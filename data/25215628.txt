Wasn&#x27;t the &#x27;hand of God&#x27; cheating? He knew he hand-balled and he didn&#x27;t own up to it. To me that&#x27;s such a grave betrayal of sportsmanship. Everyone else seems to see it as a bit of a joke? Why play at all if you&#x27;re going to be dishonest? Seems like if we&#x27;re going to tolerate that the whole thing is corrupt and rotten and has no honour.')
