A 240V UK wall socket can be up to 13 amps whilst a US 110V line is 12 amps.<p>With power (watts) being volts * amps that gives the power of 3120 Vs 1320 watts for UK Vs USA respectively.<p>This means a UK kettle can dump heat into the water up to 2.4 times faster so should boil in less than half the time.<p>Kettles are at the high end of power consumption as generally people want a fast boil. Lights are towards the low end as its rare for someone to want even 1000 watts of incandescent brightness.')
