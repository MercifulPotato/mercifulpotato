They prefer Trump over Obama because he isn&#x27;t droning their homeland.<p>So they think Trump is an improvement.<p>&gt; But choosing Trump of Clinton was just plain stupid, face it.<p>This is why everything is becoming polarised. This assumption that the other side is stupid or evil or both.<p>A lot of voters were turned off by Clinton calling Trump supporters deplorable. Others were worried after Clinton said she wanted to put a no-fly zone over Syria which would have meant a direct conflict with Russia.<p>I still remember Christopher Hitchen&#x27;s scathing criticism of the Clitons.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;christopherhitchens.net&#x2F;hillary-clinton" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;christopherhitchens.net&#x2F;hillary-clinton</a><p>He wrote a whole book about them IIRC.<p>There are a lot of valid criticisms of both Trump and Clinton however calling people stupid isn&#x27;t going to convince anyone of your position.')
