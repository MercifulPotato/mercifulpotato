The houses generally aren&#x27;t designed for cold weather and we as a nation tend to just put on more clothes and endure somewhat colder houses. I&#x27;ve had people from overseas complain about how cold they get because we don&#x27;t do much about it.<p>In say, Germany&#x2F;China in winter I remember being stunned by how hot people kept their houses and public spaces. We don&#x27;t heat our spaces in the same way generally.<p>On the other hand, it gets real hot and we are somewhat optimised towards that way of living.')
