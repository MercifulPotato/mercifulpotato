Every file is saved as a zero-byte file, which makes the files discoverable even though it&#x27;s not stored on my disk. When I try to open the file it downloads it automatically, which works surprisingly well. And it&#x27;s way faster than mounting DigitalOcean Spaces using s3fs for example.<p>Also Dropbox is cheaper: 12eu for 2TB, compared to DigitalOcean Spaces: 5eu for 250GB. And I can even access my files through the Dropbox API.')
