There&#x27;s a huge difference between that and what&#x27;s happening in China.<p>I was aware of that when responding.  In fact, when I said:<p>&quot;There are valid reasons to separate some folks from the rest of society (think John Wayne Gacy, Jeffrey Dahmer, Ted Bundy, etc.), as they&#x27;ve shown themselves to be unable&#x2F;unwilling to respect the rights of others within that society.<p>Incarceration as a tool of punishment, while widely used, often poses more risk of harming society than any benefit from &quot;punishing&quot; offenders.<p>It&#x27;s a complex issue, and simplifying it to &quot;Law and order! Lock &#x27;em up!&quot; is reductive and often detrimental to the societies it&#x27;s supposed to improve.&quot;<p>I was <i>specifically</i> referring to my home, the USA.')
