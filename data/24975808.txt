In fact it&#x27;s basically the bare minimum of Java + sum types + some syntactic sugar.<p>It has rock solid tooling due to Jetbrains support. It has access to the entire JVM ecosystem. It has a huge amount of learning materials out there. And it&#x27;s got all the resources on how to deal with web CRUD problems you could ever imagine.<p>It&#x27;s not server-side Elm by a long shot, but to be fair, Elm would suffer from all the same problems you listed.')
