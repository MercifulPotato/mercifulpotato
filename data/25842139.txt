Let&#x27;s not.<p>&gt; it bothers me that platforms can be taken down everywhere because of an unrelated group that happened to use them for something horrible<p>Does it bother you that many people are calling for exactly that wrt Facebook right now? I just checked comment history and saw no evidence of that, but I figured I&#x27;d ask instead of pretending to be psychic.<p>&gt; Will Signal be taken down for refusing to add a backdoor?<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone, including Apple or Google, considers Signal to be in the same category that requires moderation. Why not? Because there&#x27;s this commonly applied but never defined distinction between public and private communication. Facebook is considered public, even though some communications there can be private. Signal is considered private, even though you can form pretty large groups of people who are nearly (but not completely) strangers. I wish someone <i>would</i> codify the difference, and its implications wrt moderation&#x2F;takedown requirements. The lack of clarity around such issues is why both posters and platforms can claim immunity while toxic content spreads.')
