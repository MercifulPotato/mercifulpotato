I&#x27;m merely making a correct observation about a phenomenon of which you are a small part.<p>It is of course even more ludicrous to expect anonymity when you have solved the lottery in states that do not permit anonymous winners.<p>&gt;  It is unacceptable to try to track someone down about money through their parents.<p>As a blanket statement, that&#x27;s nonsense. Stalking someone&#x27;s parents to collect an unpaid medical would certainly be unacceptable. A polite DM or e-mail requesting an interview with someone who has apparently come up with a foolproof method to generate millions of dollars is entirely reasonable.')
