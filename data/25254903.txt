I used to have a <i>lot</i> of credit card and personal debt, and was paying over $1,500&#x2F;mo <i>in interest</i> on less than $100k USD&#x2F;year. If you get stuck in that trap it&#x27;s damn near impossible to get out of if you overextend yourself.<p>A lot of folks grossly underestimate what they spend eating out and drinking. Probably less of a problem now than a few years ago, but coinciding with my credit card debt phase I would have told you I spent &quot;$100, maybe $150&quot; a month when it was closer to $400-500.<p>If you&#x27;re not set up for retirement (see below) there&#x27;s little to no reason to be leasing a brand new BMW. I was absolutely guilty of this and it&#x27;s tens of thousands of dollars I essentially set on fire for three years. You don&#x27;t even have to sacrifice the nice car, my 2016 5 series was less than $25k out the door and I got it right after someone turned it in off-lease. My payment is less than theirs was and it&#x27;ll be paid off before the warranty runs out. I&#x27;ll then have an &quot;asset&quot; (not really) worth $5-10k, and can get another $25k off-lease car which will cost me less and get paid off quicker, if not in cash.<p>If you max out your 401(k) you are saving about $20k&#x2F;yr while only reducing your taxable income by ~$15k&#x2F;yr depending on your marginal tax rate. A Roth adds another $6k to that if you&#x27;re under the cap (something like $140k for 2020) and you can withdraw the contributions from that account at any time without penalty. Not helpful for someone making $40k&#x2F;yr but if you&#x27;re making $100k it&#x27;s hard to make a good argument not to max out your retirement unless you live in one of the outlier cities as far as rent and expenses.<p>There are absolutely the &#x2F;r&#x2F;personalfinance types who act like if you go to a restaurant more than once every six months you&#x27;re going to end up destitute and starving while homeless. And the FIRE community is a borderline cult. But nobody working in our industry, even in super high-COL areas, really has to worry about retirement, even if they&#x27;ve made dumb mistakes like I did that ended up costing hundreds of thousands in the long run.')
