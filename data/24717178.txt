Item(by='michaelt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602146488, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24717021, text='<i>&gt; Is this a good idea?</i><p>If you want electric delivery vans, yes.<p>Delivery companies that own their own vans and pay their employees hourly are in price competition with &#x27;gig economy&#x27; delivery companies where the driver brings their own vehicle and gets paid per-parcel - so traditional companies are limited in their ability to absorb or pass on higher costs.<p>A diesel class B van with a 3.5 tonne weight limit, set up as a delivery van, can carry perhaps 1 tonne of cargo. In inner-city areas, where the density of deliveries is high, vans having a shorter range isn&#x27;t a problem - but the vans will leave the depot at the absolute maximum weight capacity.<p>If electric vans have 20% less cargo capacity due to the weight of the batteries? That&#x27;s a profitable business turned into an unprofitable one.<p>While there are some delivery companies (UPS for example) that use a lot of class C1 vans, and hire employees with the special licenses required, the supply of people with C1 licenses is much lower than the supply of people with B (i.e. car driver) licenses and the hourly wages are higher accordingly.')
