But when all you&#x27;ve ever known is reliable infrastructure and a bank which reliably holds your money its easy to lose this point.<p>The bitcoin block chain is never going to freeze your funds. The bitcoin block chain has changing transaction costs but they not susceptible to wild swings in cost by administrative decree. These points sound attractive when you don&#x27;t have access to good banking infrastructure. None of these things have anything to do with crime of any sort.')
