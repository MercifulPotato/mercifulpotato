Irregardless of how clear the law is, there will have to be an appeal process and anyone unhappy with Twitter&#x27;s moderation decisions will be be able to sue them. So in practice content moderation will have to be handled by a government agency. IMHO that would be much worse than the current situation because (besides being huge waste of resources) now when you&#x27;re unhappy with what Twitter is doing you can still (at least theoretically) move to a different platform.<p>&quot;Wouldn&#x27;t it be better if this is legally defined in the Constitution of the country where the user is from&quot;<p>So if someone in (for example)  Thailand posts something negative about Thailand&#x27;s king Twitter would be required to remove that post, while if someone in the US does that they would take no action. Do you really think this is a good idea?')
