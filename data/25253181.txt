I actually chalk this up to the weird fetish people who use Apple products tend to have with things being exactly &quot;modern&quot; as opposed to being stable and functional or even performant (which tends to lead them to pester people to upgrade to new things on the Apple treadmill constantly rather than support new features or use cases... Windows and Android users don&#x27;t do this and I frankly think are much better off--both professionally <i>and psychologically</i>--because of it). Put elsewise: Apple <i>did</i> do the work of porting homebrew... <i>by writing Rosetta 2</i>, and they probably tested it on Homebrew internally to make sure it was compatible with lots of Homebrew packages.')
