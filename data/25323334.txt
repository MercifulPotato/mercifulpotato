I also thought about investor-driven approach. \nSlack had to justify massive funding it took over the years. It has 1500+ employees for a chat app. In comparison, Notion has &lt;50 employees and they seem to release more stuff than slack (though it might not be a fair direct comparison).<p>Having said that, 28 Billion is a great success by any metric.
