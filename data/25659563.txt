The 5th fleet is there to protect cargo from Iranian aggression.<p>Particularly between Egypt and Israel both for the defence of Israel and of course, that the Suez Canal stays open (open to everyone, by the way).<p>The US did not have anything other than a basic presence over there (5th Fleet in the Gulf) before 9&#x2F;11 and that was after a major war in Iraq.<p>The US wants to take a &#x27;hard position&#x27; in the ME about as they want to in South Asia. Or South America. Or Western Europe i.e. they don&#x27;t. They don&#x27;t really even want to be there.<p>Iran is super chauvinist antagonizing state - they don&#x27;t simply want to &#x27;live in peace&#x27; with their neighbours, far from it, they want to be the &#x27;regional superpower&#x27; and take their historic position as dominating the Arabs, who they hate.<p>Right now, the Arab&#x2F;Persian hate war is much worse than the traditional Muslim&#x2F;Jewish hate war and it&#x27;s causing problems.<p>The bulk of instability in the Middle East right now can be traced to Iran.<p>If Iran would just shut up and stay home, then there&#x27;d be some mopping up in Syria, Yemen might very well stabilize and then there would be peace in the ME like there has not been in centuries.<p>To see Saudi Arabia, UAE and Israel getting along like buddies is basically shocking to everyone who remembers how bad it was, and they are &#x27;besties&#x27; specifically because the mutual threat they face in Iran.')
