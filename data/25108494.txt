This is clearly a cross waste of money, is dangerous, and totally pointless. Just use a helicopter and as another poster noted, there&#x27;s totally fine place a helicopter could land close to the hospital.<p>The Italian people should be outraged at this profligate (and self serving) waste of resources.
