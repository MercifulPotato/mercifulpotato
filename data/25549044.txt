Most of your people are new and drawn from your general population, and it&#x27;s hard for anyone to predict who it will be. Makes it hard to infiltrate ahead of time.<p>But if you&#x27;ve been fighting a cold war using a wartime-sized apparatus for decades, in which adversarial powers have been trying to infiltrate your organizations the entire time, what happens if they succeed? Get someone into the clandestine organizations in a position to direct hiring. Then hire their own people. They&#x27;re career bureaucrats, not political appointees, so once they&#x27;re in, they&#x27;re in. These organizations are expected to operate in secret, so there is no oversight.<p>Hanlon&#x27;s razor and everything, but I&#x27;m not sure that applies in a situation where strong attempts at malice are actually expected. It would explain a lot about their behavior in recent memory.')
