The fact they are censoring #trump while not banning him comes off as extremely weak.  It&#x27;s exactly the kind of move that makes liberals seem hairless and under-handed.<p>MailChimp on the other hand is primarily a ad&#x2F;spam tool.  They do have transactional email abilities, but any email that isn&#x27;t transactional is (IMO) ad&#x2F;spam.  The whole point of ad&#x2F;spam is to manipulate people... it&#x27;s not a conversation.  Limiting what type of mass manipulation they allow is very different from not letting people talk about whatever they want.')
