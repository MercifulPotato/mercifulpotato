How do you even explain the pipe burst that never happened and the counting that continued. Everything in your area might have been on the up and up, but things happened you may have not seen:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=keANzinHWUA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=keANzinHWUA</a><p>Also keep in mind Georgia never did re-canvasing and when they did a re-count, they recounted the IMAGES of the ballots, not the paper ballots. Georgia has also refused to release the images of the ballots. Give me a data dump of images so we can go through and make sure they all have different serial numbers. If they really didn&#x27;t run the same ballots through over and over, it would be easy to prove. Why are they not releasing them?<p>Finally, that &quot;leaked&quot; call between Trump and the GA sectary of state everyone went ape shit over, did you know that was literally illegal. It was a Settlement Call, lawyers on both side were present (and named) and all of that was privileged. The GA Sec of State should be in jail right now. He won&#x27;t be.<p>There are no consequences for breaking the law if you&#x27;re on the right side.')
