I guess my upbringing was just the opposite as that of arrogant people like Jobs.  My parents taught me to assume that most things are the way they are probably because a lot of people smarter than me set them up that way.  This leaves you in a perennially grateful, happy state.  When you find something that does not work in an optimal way, you become sad and try to fix it for the better, but only after you have thoroughly understood how it works.  How is life like for an arrogant asshole?  Do they become happy only when they &quot;gotcha&quot; the failings of less smart people?  Won&#x27;t they unconsciously find errors in many things they don&#x27;t understand?  It must be a living hell to be like that.')
