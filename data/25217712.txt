If they choose to spread falsehoods, they&#x27;re free to do so on their own website, but they don&#x27;t have free reign to do so on <i>someone else&#x27;s website.</i><p>(If they want to prove that their claims are correct in the fact of everyone else saying they are wrong, the burden is on them to prove their claims, which they didn&#x27;t even bother to do. They just claimed that something is a cure for COVID without evidence, and provided an affiliate link to a website where you could buy the supposed cure.
