I wonder what the build quality is but the fact that the screen doesn&#x27;t tilt is a turn off for me personally (neck issues) and don&#x27;t see myself typing on that keyboard while holding it in my hands. I got a pocketchip which is has been discontinued and that had a much worse keyboard but the form factor was a bit better suited for handheld computing. At this point I wish the pocketchip had the performance of this device or this device had that form factor or had a tiltable screen.')
