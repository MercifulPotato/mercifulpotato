Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google have, I would argue, materially changed our lives for the better. They created the smartphones that are now ubiquitous and that opened up a whole marketplace of app based tech. They literally created cloud computing which has allowed more companies to focus on product ideas and get off the ground quickly. E-commerce (disrupting retail), streaming (disrupting Hollywood). Not to mention all the OSS and platform improvements that have originated at Faangs.<p>They have grown powerful and entities with power will often abuse it, and I would argue that regulations would be a good step in this direction. But arguing they haven’t had a positive impact on society is absurd.')
