The First Amendment does not say that private companies are obligated to spend money broadcasting someone else&#x27;s speech. Hosting and serving isn&#x27;t free and any private company has the freedom to decide what not to host.<p>I&#x27;m in the UK, but the difference is that right now, these private companies control communication.<p>I&#x27;m not allowed outside my house and I live alone. I&#x27;m not even allowed outside to go and talk to friends - people are getting fined and arrested for just sitting on a park bench because of the latest lockdown. All my communication with everyone I know is done via private companies. If they lock me out, I&#x27;m totally screwed. What is free speech if I can&#x27;t talk to anyone? Are the phone companies allowed to lock me out if they don&#x27;t like what I&#x27;m saying?<p>So one could argue, that actually if we want free speech in the 21st century, and want to honour the intent of what it means to have free speech, there does need to be some protection here.<p>The protections around freedom of speech were put in at a time where it was inconceivable that a huge majority of worldwide speech could be mass-monitored and auto-censored by a few giant private companies that self-police what can and can&#x27;t be said - and I think the legislators would have been horrified!')
