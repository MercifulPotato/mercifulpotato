Basically the north-west coast. Rhyl and Anglesey were occasional choices too. I loved Anglesey and crossing the Menai bridge, driving through all the tunnels on the way. The joy of having parents split between Lancashire and Cheshire.<p>That was in the 90s and early 2000s. Morecambe is famous for a load of underpaid cockle pickers drowning when the tide came in, if I remember right. Southport and Blackpool were great when the tide was out, you could literally cross the estuary separating them if you were stupid enough. The beaches weren&#x27;t always so fun unless you liked  strolling through a mass grave of washed up jellyfish. And the tide was a force to be reckoned with when the sea wall along the prom was as tall as a house.<p>But that was then. All I&#x27;ve heard about Blackpool, for a long time, is that it became a stag&#x2F;hen party hotspot and otherwise a dump. Southport was more or less a retirement community like Lytham St Anne&#x27;s.<p>Shame really, just a part of the country that&#x27;s been neglected since Thatcher. And you&#x27;ve got the lake district barely an hour&#x27;s drive away. Such beautiful nature.')
