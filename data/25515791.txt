It combines features from programming languages like Go, Haskell, OCaml, and Scala in a way that no other language does. It has:<p>- a sound type system (like Haskell and OCaml)<p>- a complete local type inference algorithm (like Haskell and OCaml)<p>- eager evaluation (like OCaml and Scala)<p>- CSP style concurrency (like Go)<p>- type classes (like Haskell)<p>- full tail call elimination (like OCaml and Haskell)<p>If you look at the &quot;Innovations&quot; page you will find that Flix has (at least) two features found in no other programming language: a polymorphic type and effect system and first-class Datalog constraints.<p>(I am one of the authors of Flix).')
