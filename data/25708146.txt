Obviously actual terrorist group sites can and should be taken down, but this feels like it&#x27;s getting more murky than that.<p>- Should we be okay with Facebook censoring these groups?<p>- Should we be okay with Google censoring search results?<p>- Should we be okay with Apple censoring apps?<p>- Should we be okay with AWS censoring websites?<p>- Should we be okay with GoDaddy censoring domains?<p>- Should we be okay with Verizon censoring internet traffic?<p>Giant corporations arenâ€™t simply following court orders, they are acting on their own now. This is problematic for a multitude of reasons. The precedent has been established.<p>*<p>EDIT:\nBy &quot;actual terrorist groups&quot; I mean those that are classified as such by the US Government (e.g. FBI, CIA, NSA). While I think QAnon and Proud Boys have many of the characteristics of a terrorist group, they are not classified as such (personally I think they should be, but it&#x27;s the government&#x27;s job to decide that).<p>*')
