Maybe the better authors wouldn&#x27;t need it, but as for everyone else -- take a look at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.sufficientvelocity.com&#x2F;threads&#x2F;generic-pawn-templates-a-gpt-3-quest.70063&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.sufficientvelocity.com&#x2F;threads&#x2F;generic-pawn-t...</a>, and compare the first couple of story posts to the last few.<p>One of the ways in which people get GPT-3 wrong is, they give it a badly worded order and get disappointed when the output is poor.<p>It doesn&#x27;t work with orders. It takes a lot of practice to work out what it does well with. It always imitates the input, and it&#x27;s great at matching style -- and it knows good writing as well as bad, but it can&#x27;t ever write any better than the person using it. If you want to write a good story with it, you need to already be a good writer.<p>But it&#x27;s wonderful at busting writer&#x27;s block, and at writing <i>differently</i> than the person using it.')
