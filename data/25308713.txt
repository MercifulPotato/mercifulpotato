Item(by='foobarian', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607119161, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25303694, text='I feel that what happened with tech is that there were two things occurring simultaneously: one, there were many new useful ideas possible to build with IT that were not possible before and that delivered genuine value.  With companies like Amazon or Airbnb or Google you had genuinely motivated &quot;builder&quot; founders who were first to scale, kind of like when a dam breaks and the water rushes out.<p>But, the second, more negative thing is that a lot of the inefficiencies removed by these companies were in the form of livelihoods for many people, or adherence to various regulations and laws that was a lot easier to omit with IT in the middle.   Examples would be the Mom-and-Pop retail stores going out of business or Uber breaking taxi regulations.<p>Like you said, Bezos didn&#x27;t set out to bankrupt Mom&amp;Pop, it was just an unfortunate side-effect of using IT. The thing that I think pg is missing is that projects where this happens <i>are</i> exploitative to a degree, and is why they get rightfully criticized.')
