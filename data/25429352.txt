Basically, we need a way to easily write fine-grained attribute-based access control functions like “allow authors to edit and delete the content field of their posts” or “only allow doctors to see records for their patients” — inspired by Nader Dabit’s (et al) interesting work on AWS amplify auth directive here: [packages&#x2F;graphql-auth-transformer&#x2F;src&#x2F;ModelAuthTransformer.ts](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws-amplify&#x2F;amplify-cli&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;packages&#x2F;graphql-auth-transformer&#x2F;src&#x2F;ModelAuthTransformer.ts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws-amplify&#x2F;amplify-cli&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;packa...</a>) I carped on the Apollo folks about this and provided a [hackish Ramda solution](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ardatan&#x2F;graphql-tools&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1234#issuecomment-629295572" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ardatan&#x2F;graphql-tools&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1234#issueco...</a>) which seems to have helped lead to [functional directives in graphql-tools](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graphql-tools.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;schema-directives#at-least-two-strategies" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.graphql-tools.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;schema-directives#at-leas...</a>) but still there’s no fine grained ABAC lib I truly love for simplicity.<p>How can Nexus &#x2F; Prisma be used to implement custom functional [auth] directives?<p>SQL is nice for this, and I eventually switched to that, but the column and row level security work independently and are pretty verbose. It would be amazing if sql row&#x2F;column security were more tightly integrated...')
