And well, there aren’t. The vendor split is not a thing, we’re all running the same software on Intel and AMD x86&#x2F;x64 processors. And you could argue that the x86&#x2F;x64 split doesn’t really matter for this, since x64 is a superset of x86 and inherits this tradition from the 16-bit and 32-bit eras.')
