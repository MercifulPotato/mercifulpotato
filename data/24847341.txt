In April if you were a 25 year old with a mild cough you couldn&#x27;t get a test even if you begged for one. Now you can get a test easily, its little wonder the denominator has gone up a lot.<p>Edit: Yeah I see its hospitalized and they tried to control. I&#x27;m not convinced its a useful study but at least dont upvote this.')
