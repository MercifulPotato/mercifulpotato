Hell, we just had 4k people die today of covid alone. It is an issue, even a serious issue and it is being handled by appropriate agencies ( as it should ), but by overblowing this people will only make it worse. So why not let system work? That is what it is there for.<p>edit:<p>&quot;to call that a &quot;quintessential act of American patriotism&quot; is open advocacy for violence, and I don&#x27;t think I can ethically participate in a forum which permits such a terrible thing.&quot;<p>Correct me if I am misreading this, but you are making this an ethical issue the same way your opponent does. Note that the comment you replied to appears to view his position the same way. He, apparently, sees it as not only ethical, but a mandatory subset of being an American; a virtue.<p>May I suggest that all of us participate freely in this exchange of ideas. You are free not to the same way he is free to. Ethics have little to do with this.')
