Item(by='dsr_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607533863, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25346006, text='The Sony is basically flat (by mass-market standards), with a little emphasis in the &quot;presence&quot; area, 3-4.5KHz.<p>The B&amp;O adds a bass boost from 20-50Hz, and then an upward curve from 400Hz up to 3.5KHz, then a bigger bump from 6.5KHz and up.<p>From that, I expect you found the B&amp;O to bring a deeper thumping bass and a sparklier sound to cymbals. It&#x27;s almost certainly more exciting than the Sony.')
