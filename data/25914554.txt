Just because you don&#x27;t feel threatened and free to be a proud hindu<p>What if a person lives near racists, people who keep directing hate at hindus because of their (unjustified) hate against muslims? They may feel unsafe if people knew they were hindu no matter the area of the world<p>It&#x27;s good that you don&#x27;t feel threatened, but unfortunately not everyone is so lucky.
