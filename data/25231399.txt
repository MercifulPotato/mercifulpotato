They have been interested in nuclear weapons consistently for the last 70 years, and they&#x27;ve been rather explicit about their position with respect to Israel (it&#x27;s a &quot;cancerous tumor that must be uprooted and destroyed&quot; or something to that effect). I think they pretty credibly want to wipe out Israel and emerge as the regional power.<p>I&#x27;m also assuming that the US, IL, and SA are pretty interested in regional stability if only because stability favors their own interests.<p>You have a few implicit assumptions of your own:<p>1. Keeping Iran in check &quot;destabalizes the region&quot; (and the corollary, that Iran&#x27;s objective is stability in the region)<p>How can you believe this in light of Iran&#x27;s pretty explicit intent to wipe out Israel? Are Iranian officials merely posturing benignly?<p>2. The US, IL, SA objective is &quot;systematically killing tens or hundreds of thousands of lives and waging wars in the region&quot; (and not to stabilize the region)<p>Of course, these countries aren&#x27;t &quot;systematically killing&quot; anyone. You can criticize them for their actions, but they haven&#x27;t been &quot;systematically killing&quot; anybody, nor expressed interest in the same.<p>3. There is a dichotomy between Iran killing tens or hundreds of thousands and the US&#x2F;IL&#x2F;SA killing tens or hundreds of thousands (i.e., if we prevent Iran from killing tens or hundreds of thousands then we implicitly allow its adversaries to kill tens or hundreds of thousands)<p>Of course, there is no such dichotomy. Thwarting Iran&#x27;s nuclear program and stabilizing the region are two sides of the same coin.')
