Same reason why we don&#x27;t lay out programs in some sort of graph structure but instead write text from top to bottom.<p>&quot;To taste&quot; is usually reserved for salt or some sort of textual element (like thinning a soup with water). Sometimes it involves pepper. Rarely will it involve other spices, though I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a terrible idea since most everybody has old ground spices so 2tsp will taste very different between kitchens.<p>You <i>can&#x27;t</i> make a recipe amazingly precise for home cooks because equipment is wildly different and ingredient quality is wildly different. This is just a property of home recipes. Serious kitchens have things like salt done in precise weight ratios.')
