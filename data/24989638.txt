However actually trying to figure out what the code is trying to accomplish becomes a chore because I can&#x27;t keep all of the lines in my head.<p>Maybe it is because what I am used to but I find I am often &quot;pattern matching&quot; loops into `map`s `filter`s and similar in my head. Of course doing this, and making sure that I didn&#x27;t miss a side effect or condition that makes it not-quite-a-map takes a lot more brainpower than just seeing `slice.map(|path| path.basename())`.')
