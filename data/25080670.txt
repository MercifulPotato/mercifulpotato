Item(by='shadowprofile77', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605260299, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25079839, text='Where I live, you can get just about any blood test you want or heard of done at a days notice (excepting clinically conditional time rubrics for the sake of test accuracy, ie: waiting a couple weeks+ after possible HIV exposure to get an HIV test, that kind of thing) at any one of dozens of private laboratories for extremely reasonable costs. Complete blood profiles go for a little over the equivalent of 25 dollars US and most typical tests are not far below or just above that figure. Exotic tests can get more expensive but rarely exceed a price equivalent to 200 dollars for truly unusual things like specialized checking for exotic tropical diseases.<p>Socialized health is also available here but with the usual pushing and prodding necessary for anything outside the most basic, routine preventative tests, and slow at that. Advanced countries with socialized healthcare offer wonderful advantages for medical catastrophes and sufferers of chronic illnesses that would be hard to privately insure against, but when it comes to preventative discretionary healthcare, my impression is that they can be awfully bureaucratic (I used to live in Canada).')
