There&#x27;s something distasteful about these very small number of global companies shaping so much of our human condition.<p>I already dumped Facebook. I feel like I could do Google and Amazon next. I make my living with AWS, so there&#x27;s that.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if Netflix is worth dumping, by din of this criteria.<p>I feel like Apple is the least offensive here, but their app store missteps this year put a harsh light on their relationship to their dev community.<p>Twitter I&#x27;m likely to close after the election.
