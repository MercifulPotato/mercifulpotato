If you&#x27;re going to run this server anywhere near you, <i>stay away</i> from server cases like supermicro, dell, etc. since you will suffer hearing loss if you&#x27;re around them for long periods of time.<p>If you plan on using ZFS, make sure to take into account for the overhead and parity drives. For example, I have 12x 16TB (192TB raw) drives in raidzfs2, including overhead and parity I only have ~125TiB usable.')
