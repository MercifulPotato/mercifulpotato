It tends to show the American-style dates even on non-American locales, making the control not just useless but sometimes actively misleading.<p>Even apart from that it&#x27;s pretty basic. Keyboard navigation is bad everywhere bad but in Chrome where it&#x27;s just mediocre -  there&#x27;s no inline&#x2F;auto-popup mode like other js pickers, and it requires nonintuitively pressing ENTER to pop-up.<p>Some browsers like Firefox don&#x27;t have a &#x27;Today&#x27; button, and even in Chrome you can&#x27;t hide it when it doesn&#x27;t make sense. No browser has a &#x27;Clear&#x27; button which makes sense in some scenarios.<p>I can go on and on about how flawed that control is, but this is long enough.')
