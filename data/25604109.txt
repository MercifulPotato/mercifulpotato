That being the case, how useful will this library actually be? Using it means your code will only be as efficient as the library. You&#x27;d also be relying on the library developer to fix any issues you have, be it with the library or your own implementation.<p>In my experience, when people write libraries for the purpose of providing ability to those who can&#x27;t do it themselves, the libraries become more general purpose, which typically ends up in less efficient algorithms for the sake of compatibility.')
