For everything that isn&#x27;t Seinfeld or Friends, 2 years probably is 99% of the revenue. As long as Quibi does a decent job of selling those licenses they&#x27;ll probably recover some of their investment. Oh, and by the end of 2 years Quibi will either be bankrupt or a $100b company, so it&#x27;s not like it mattered to Quibi.')
