Or &quot;F1, F2, etc. keys&quot; if you prefer.  Whichever one you set, holding down the &quot;fn&quot; key will temporarily toggle to the other one.<p>You still don&#x27;t get the same feel as physical keys, but no Siri, no sliders to adjust volume or brightness, no stuff shifting around as you switch apps.')
