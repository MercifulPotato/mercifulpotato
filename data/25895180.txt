That&#x27;s fallacious reasoning.<p>&gt; “[Bill] Gates has staked out this outsized role in the vaccine world,” Love said. “He has an ideological belief that the intellectual property system is a wonderful mechanism that is necessary for innovation and prosperity.”<p>Ideological belief.<p>Many people have a different take on this, but they tend to not get the power in a capitalistic system, so you won&#x27;t get the possible alternative story told. Gate&#x27;s success is a self-fulfilling prophecy and hardly evidence to justify the means.<p>My point is he is shaping the world to his liking, his ideology. No single human should have that power.')
