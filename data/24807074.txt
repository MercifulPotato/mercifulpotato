The worst one took hours to get it partially back online, days to fully recover. At least I got to have one free drink before I had to leave our holiday party to start fixing it. (Ok, technically it was non-prod; luckily prod was ECS... long story)<p>&gt; I don’t believe single instance is going to give you better availability when single machine faults happen<p>Depends on your definition and context of availability. It is possibly the simplest thing to destroy any existing nodes (and in the event that a node can&#x27;t be destroyed, null-route it and&#x2F;or disable its network port) and bring up a new node. So single instance is fairly easy to recover. But with multiple nodes, for each function of each instance that is required to reach consensus, the likelihood of consensus failure increases; you actually need more nodes and variety in the cluster to resist consensus failure. Yet ironically, the more nodes you have, the higher the probability of failure. In the end, the real-world reliability of the system is based on additional factors besides the network model.')
