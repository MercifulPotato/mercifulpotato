Item(by='chrismorgan', descendants=None, kids=[25631244], score=None, time=1609754317, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25629172, text='I’d remove several lines.<p>----<p><pre><code>  &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;x-ua-compatible&quot; content=&quot;ie=edge&quot;&gt;\n</code></pre>\nThis was basically always the default for IE, and for almost the last decade has been, I think, pretty superfluous. It’s a holdover from IE7–9 days, and to instruct those extremely rare devices which had changed the actual browser default (which was never easy to do, but which is extremely difficult by IE11) not to operate in compatibility mode for this site.<p>Plus IE is dead, so you shouldn’t care about IE to any meaningful extent anyway.<p>----<p><pre><code>  &lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;&#x2F;head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n  &lt;&#x2F;body&gt;\n  &lt;&#x2F;html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n&lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt; elements can be omitted if they have no attributes. I like to omit them.<p>----<p><pre><code>  &lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;&quot;&gt;\n</code></pre>\nUnless you’re careful about this, it’s easy to do more harm than good. I’m not convinced it belongs in an “absolute minimum base.html”.<p>----<p>And one more that I’m not certain about: the `, initial-scale=1.0` in the viewport declaration. I <i>think</i> it’s been unnecessary for the past five or six years, that it was basically just a way of working around a bug in iOS Safari that has since been fixed, but I don’t have any iOS device handy with which I can test this.<p>This is my typical starting point:<p><pre><code>  &lt;!doctype html&gt;\n  &lt;html lang=en-AU&gt;\n  &lt;meta charset=utf-8&gt;\n  &lt;meta name=viewport content=&quot;width=device-width&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;title&gt;…&lt;&#x2F;title&gt;</code></pre>')
