I&#x27;ve had plenty of issues.<p>A lot of weird graphical glitches. A game-ending bug that locks you into the Maelstrom base and prevents you from leaving (had to restart from an older save game to get around that one). Non-aggressive NPCs can&#x27;t always be hit by melee weapons, meaning I have to let the gang members go aggro on me before I introduce them to Mrs. Sockety Wench.<p>As far as completeness, I actually take a little of an opposite position. There&#x27;s a lot of really neat side quests, and if you read the shards, there&#x27;s a ton of interconnectedness. I was hired to kill a corporate executive, then later in just a simple assault quest, I got a datashard indicating she put a hit out on someone.<p>And there&#x27;s tons of intersections like this. The Delamain side quest is genuinely one of the best in the game.<p>Yes, NPC and vehicle AI needs a serious overhaul. Yes, the game probably needed another 12-18 months of development, but its still a decent game even with all these faults.')
