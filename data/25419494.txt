If I can verify it, I can say &#x27;its true&#x27; and that &#x27;I know it&#x27;.<p>But the problem is that most individuals verify very little - its beyond ridiculous how little we verify.  If we see something on TV, we think we have verified it!  Did we verify the film Independence Day?!<p>All day long, individuals will say &#x27;I know&#x27; or &#x27;its true&#x27;.  Even though they haven&#x27;t verified their assumptions, if they even know what their assumptions are.  Most people&#x27;s lives are based on massive, unverified assumptions.  They are so big, that they cannot consider questioning them - they have to be true or they may have a mental breakdown!<p>Say most people &#x27;know&#x27; that we are on a globe.  How?  Have they experienced the globe?  How was it proven to them that this wasn&#x27;t a flat plane?  Do they really &#x27;know&#x27; it, like they know the chair they are sitting on?  They do not.  So, when they say &#x27;they know&#x27; what do they mean?  Its a hypothesis, or a belief, or faith.  They believe they know.<p>So, if we were honest to ourselves, and accounting for our assumptions, we should say, &#x27;I believe&#x27; such-and-such.  But we say &#x27;I know&#x27;.  What is it to do that?<p>If you ask me, this is a lie.  We lie to ourselves and to those around us.  We live in a world of lies, of false, unverified information - and yet we call it knowledge.  Its actually quite amazing.')
