The idea was to get people to put together lists of activities and then share&#x2F;review them. I still think it&#x27;s a decent idea but I was young and expecting a &quot;if you build it they will come&quot; sort of scenario. So once it was &quot;finished&quot; I didn&#x27;t know what to do next so I moved on to the next thing.')
