In the real world, those trades take days to settle and clear. To bridge the gap, Robinhood loans you the difference. And Robinhood, in turn, is &quot;loaned&quot; [2] some of that difference by the DTCC.<p>So when the cost of that loan goes up, their costs go up, and they responded to that cost pressure by turning off trading. (There are other options.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25950361" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25950361</a><p>[2] In quotes because it&#x27;s technically a collateral requirement. If you sell $100 of stock, DTCC may tell Robinhood it only needs to put up $2 of stock as collateral while Robinhood gets the rest from wherever it&#x27;s getting it from so it can pass it along to the next person. The $98 is &quot;loaned,&quot; as in it&#x27;s owed to DTCC. If Robinhood fell down, DTCC would sell that collateral and buy the rest of the shares in the market. In this case, DTCC said &quot;these shares are super risky, and may lose all their value in a heartbeat, I need you to hand me 100% of the shares you say you are selling when you sell them.&quot; And Robinhood said no. Because that&#x27;s expensive.<p>[a] DTCC says put up $100 per share because DTCC is not a lender either! It has lines of credit with various banks. And the banks bear the risk of the loan defaulting. So they&#x27;re setting their rates and then DTCC draws from the cheapest line.')
