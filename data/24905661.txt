Item(by='martindbp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603790047, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24905497, text='&gt; I&#x27;m definitely not bitter - but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s typical of you as a Swede to characterize my hatred of Sweden in that negative way.<p>I just shared my own experience, which I would call bitterness. Basically, I couldn&#x27;t appreciate the good parts because I was blinded by the bad parts. Maybe there&#x27;s a better word than bitter, I don&#x27;t know. I won&#x27;t assume our situations were identical, so feel free to disregard what I said if it doesn&#x27;t apply to you...<p>Then I&#x27;m curious, what country would be ideal for you to live in? And have you lived there as an adult? In my experience, you only get a true sense of a country if you live there as a working adult, even better if you have kids. As a student, or short term visitor, there&#x27;s no way of knowing what it&#x27;s like. That&#x27;s why my image of Sweden was so rosy (and also because I didn&#x27;t know anything else), I hadn&#x27;t actually lived there as a working adult by the time I moved back. Likewise, my view of the US took a sharp turn for the worse once I entered work life there.')
