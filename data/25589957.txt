Linux was the hated bastard at best (anyone remember switching between OSS, ALSA and PulseAudio to eke any sound out of the plugin?).<p>And even that only on x86. ARM? What, you mean that&#x27;s a processor architecture? That&#x27;s not even going into the utter dead silence when it came to supporting other Adobe plugins outside of Windows. Adobe Air? Shockwave?
