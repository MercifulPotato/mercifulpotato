The statistical and scientific rigor employed by experts and epidemiologist seems to be massively lacking.<p>Similarly, a series of missteps by the NYT has led me to (a much larger degree than the previous analogy) lose trust in its reporting. Sadly, there do not seem to be any alternative sources outside of either reading the papers directly or finding specific individuals I place high amount of trust in.<p>Both are all too time consuming for someone with a full time job.')
