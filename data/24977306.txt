As stupid as it sounds, this is something I learned playing WoW many years ago with the expansion that added glyphs.  Everyone _needed_ glyphs in the sense that your character wasn&#x27;t hitting it&#x27;s full potential and you&#x27;d get mocked if you didn&#x27;t have them.<p>Back then I wrote my own auction house addon that would scan for glyphs below a certain price threshold, buy them, and re-list them in bulk for higher prices.  It also scanned for raw materials and bought them too to help strangle the supply as much as possible.  It was so easy that hitting the technical gold limit (something just over 200k IIRC) was a realistic problem to deal with.<p>The supply was limited enough that 2-3 people could monopolize an entire server.  I recognized the other 1 or 2 people doing it on my server and it&#x27;s something I would describe as tacit collusion.  We never talked to each other, but we didn&#x27;t compete with each other either.<p>The whole time _everyone_ complained about the price of glyphs, but there wasn&#x27;t much they could do about it.  If someone came in and tried to compete by undercutting you, you&#x27;d just buy out their supply and re-list it at your inflated prices.<p>It wasn&#x27;t complex.  You just needed to be willing to be a bit of a scumbag.  The only thing that was moderately difficult was getting enough gold to start monopolizing that part of the market.  IIRC it costed 5k gold to get a flying mount and most players had to save up for that, so being able to drop 5k at the auction house gave a lot of buying power.<p>Having a limited supply product that people _need_ means your profits are only limited by your ethics.  Capitalism works really well for luxury products IMO, but less so for necessities.')
