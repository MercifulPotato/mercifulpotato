It’s never been anywhere near the level of impacting a lead like Biden has in multiple states.<p>Trump needs to invalidate a city’s worth of people in PA AND tens of thousands of AZ, GA, and NV votes to win. There’s not even the slightest evidence of fraud on that scale and the stuff they’re doing trying to invalidate military ballots might get them into triple digits but they need 5-6 digit changes.<p>Edit: here’s a great example - they’re litigating in Maricopa county over at most a couple hundred votes, and there’s no expectation that all of them will go their way. Trump is behind by 14k votes in Arizona so even if they got a total win they’d need to do this many dozens of times.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.azcentral.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;arizona&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;09&#x2F;arizona-election-results-maricopa-county-challenge-involves-180-ballots&#x2F;6229767002&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.azcentral.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;arizona&#x2F;2020&#x2F;1...</a>')
