The basic idea is that Filecoin builds on top of the existing IPFS storage layer to add an incentive to provide storage to the global network.<p>If you&#x27;re someone who follows cryptocurrencies, the first question you&#x27;re probably asking is &quot;what&#x27;s their consensus algorithm?&quot;. The answer is &quot;proof of storage&quot;. Assuming they&#x27;ve figured out the technical details (I haven&#x27;t read their paper thoroughly yet), this seems like a decent idea. It avoids the massive power requirements of proof of work, and there&#x27;s lots of unused storage out there in the world for people to offer for a price, and they can offer it at a very low power usage. Persistent storage doesn&#x27;t actively require power.<p>As a back-of-the-envelope calculation, if you total up the storage capacity of every iPhone in the world, you&#x27;ll probably reach something like 64000 petabytes [1] [2]. Backblaze, a fairly large cloud storage provider, has a total network size of around 500 petabytes [3]. Maybe S3 is a hundred times larger? Maybe? Still, it&#x27;s good that the combined storage capacity of all the iPhones in the world alone can compete with the big storage providers. That gives me hope that there&#x27;s at least the theoretical potential for actual decentralization, as opposed to with proof of work, which tends to favor a minority of people with large compute rigs. Normal people don&#x27;t want to max out the chips in their phones and laptops 24&#x2F;7, but maybe they wouldn&#x27;t mind using some passive storage.<p>I&#x27;m not sure about how consistently people in Filecoin need to be connected to the network, but that could prove to be an issue.<p>Another thing to look at would be whether there&#x27;s any way for a third party to see what data you&#x27;re holding. This is an issue because you probably don&#x27;t want to let random other people store whatever they want on your machine. Lots of that content could be illegal, and (IANAL) I&#x27;ll bet the law can hold you accountable just for storing it.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kommandotech.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;how-many-iphones-have-been-sold-worldwide&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kommandotech.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;how-many-iphones-have-be...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.counterpointresearch.com&#x2F;average-storage-capacity-smartphones-cross-80gb-end-2019&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.counterpointresearch.com&#x2F;average-storage-capacit...</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.backblaze.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;500-petabytes-and-counting&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.backblaze.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;500-petabytes-and-counting&#x2F;</a>')
