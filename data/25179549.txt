Seems like a lot of people have as well this year?<p>I&#x27;ve found it to be a wonderful combination of nostalgia and relaxation.  And what a perfect time to get back into the hobby; it looks like there is an exploding section of &quot;adult&quot; LEGO sets these days.  The Saturn V rocket is amazing, second only to the NES build.  The NES set is just crazy; the TV you build is a kinetic sculpture with a scrolling Mario level.<p>I ended up using Rebrickable recently for data munging because I wanted to build two MOCs.  The Chris MvVeigh designed LEGO Apple 2 and LEGO IBM PC.  He used to sell them as sets, but got hired by LEGO and so discontinued them :(  But you can still find the instructions on his site.  A bit of data entry and munging, thanks in part to Rebrickable, I was able to get everything imported and buy the parts myself from LEGO and bricklink.  It&#x27;s really wild to get a package of LEGO pieces shipped all the way from the Netherlands and Finland.<p>I just wish my wallet didn&#x27;t regret getting into this hobby...')
