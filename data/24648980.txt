My husband (1.85m) can <i>fit</i> in that seat, but we’re not sure how great that’s going to be for long drives where we need to switch drivers.<p>We’re in Germany, which appears to have similar car seat rules to the US, along with increasingly large cars, but without home or public garages that are growing at the same rate. I’d like to replace the Fiesta with a hybrid Corolla wagon, but the current model is 5cm too long for our garage from the 80s.')
