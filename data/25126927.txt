They call it &#x27;Unified Memory&#x27;. It makes a lot of sense but I don&#x27;t know if they are going to be able to pack enough memory in there.<p>A lot of folks are fixated on CPU performance lately (which is rad) but I think that there is a tendency to ignore memory. I have 32gb of RAM on my Macbook Pro and finally feel like it has enough. You can&#x27;t get an M1 configuration right now larger than 16GB which is a table-stakes baseline dev requirement today.')
