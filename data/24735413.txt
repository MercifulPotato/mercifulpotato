Otherwise your statement becomes the &quot;if we can&#x27;t fix everything we should fix nothing&quot; fallacy.<p>I agree that the enforcement needs to be monitored, and also that the enforcement needs to be done. Not mutually-exclusive. There are absolutely agreed-upon lies today: there isn&#x27;t a deep state of vampire child rapists running the country. Fight me. ;-)')
