A mix of mostly plastic conduit with wires fished inside and a couple of runs that were not in conduit.<p>Out of 56 total drop locations (many with multiple cables), we&#x27;ve seen the need to fish new wires down the conduits exactly 0 times in 21 years. That makes for a tough RoI calculation, especially if we&#x27;d been paying for all the labor to do the conduit installs.')
