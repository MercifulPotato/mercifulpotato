Look who is still moving the goalposts... First we started about the environment, then it is the &quot;impossibility&quot; of layer-2 and PoS, now we want to throw Tether into the mix.<p>Yes, I have plenty of concerns about Tether. I tell anyone I can they should stay away from it. I also tell everyone that when Tether crashes down it is going to make Mt. Gox look like a day at the spa.<p>I also repeatedly tell them to avoid exchanges that can only do on-ramps in USDT and to use exchanges where they do have a proper KYC system in place.<p>I also repeatedly tell people that they shouldn&#x27;t put money into crypto that they can not afford to lose.<p>I also repeatedly tell them that the idea is <i>not</i> to be rich by doing nothing. That buying crypto is not <i>investing</i> and that those trying to time the market or finding &quot;moonshots&quot; are <i>stupid fools</i>.<p>I also repeatedly tell people to do DCA, buy a little every month and <i>get the money back during the boom cycles</i> and only keep the profits to grow their stash, so that they don&#x27;t feel bad about &quot;losing&quot; anything when the next crash inevitably comes.<p>I also repeatedly tell people that learning and getting involved with crypto is a matter of hedging against the vicious and corrupt financial elites that on each generation take away more and more of our agency and independence. That the price doesn&#x27;t matter and that our freedom is what at stake. That there are tons of issues with the technology and there will be tons of bad actors trying to exploit both the technical and the social problems.<p>I tell them to expect things to crash any time, but I also tell them that even if past performance is not guarantee of future returns, so far every crash drove the price down <i>4x</i> and then the boom cycle brought it back up <i>20x</i>.<p>Depending on what country they live, I might tell them that even with all the crashes, <i>BTC has NEVER gone down in price against the Brazilian Real since 2013</i>.<p>You know what I <i>don&#x27;t</i> tell people? That I have all the answers and they are fools for trying something on their own volition. Only douchebags do that.')
