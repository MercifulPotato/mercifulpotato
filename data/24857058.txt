From 6+ years of experience it seems that we got fouled by the multi-az promise of being able to survive datacenter outage.<p>You can survive datacenter (AZ) outage IF you have separate stacks per AZ and don&#x27;t mix traffic. If you have Kafka cluster spread out in 3 AZ don&#x27;t get surprised if you just LOWERED your availability because any issue in one AZ makes your stack unstable. And issues in single AZ are quite common.')
