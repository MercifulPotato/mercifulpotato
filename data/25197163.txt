Unstable firmware&#x27;s, non-responsive support on their forums, deprecating working products... Like you can&#x27;t self host their DVR software, but the newest versions don&#x27;t run on older hardware so you have to buy a new hardware to get new software.<p>Also their product lines Edge and Unifi don&#x27;t work together, so you can&#x27;t manage an EdgeRouter with Unifi or vice versa, for which I don&#x27;t think there is a technical reason, just commercial.<p>Hardware wise they also have made strange choices regarding PoE, don&#x27;t assume your Unifi PoE switch will work with your Unifi PoE device (really double check the versions, voltages, passive&#x2F;active)<p>So lots to complain, though I think it is still the most accessible pro-sumer networking stuff.')
