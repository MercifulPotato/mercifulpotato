The technique is called structure from motion and has been demonstrated to work well more than a decade ago.<p>The biggest problem with relying on visual data is that you get very noisy data. Poor lighting and reflective or glossy surfaces cause problems (I&#x27;m not sure what current state of the art is, it&#x27;s been a few years since I looked at the research).<p>As far as I understand the big advantage of LIDAR is that you get nice and clean depth data and it&#x27;s not so computationally expensive.')
