MIT and other non-copy left licensing,  it allows companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and other to leach off of &quot;Open Source&quot; focusing exclusively on dev tools and libraries used to build their products.<p>This has lead to ALOT of developer growth, and ALOT of Open Source access for Developers but no much growth in END USER software products that are open sourced.<p>Linux one of the most popular Operating Systems in the world, and is the final product not a development library is as big as it is because of Copy Left,  one can make a big case that the BSD&#x27;s never got to be as big as Linux directly because of their permissive license.')
