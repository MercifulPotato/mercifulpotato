An example of this is a guitar. I have a guitar that I don&#x27;t play too often and would like to both make money by lending it to someone as well as allowing them to experience it instead of buying and potentially not using it later.<p>However, recently I have realized that what I&#x27;m building is effectively something people will use very rarely since it is a platform where you go to rent stuff that you don&#x27;t use often. Is this adding real value to people? Would you rent things instead of buying them? What kind of things would you rent? (e.g. game console, lawn mower, surfboard, etc.) How is this different from what Airbnb is doing with homes? One big difference I see is rental of homes makes sense because they are very expensive to buy and you wouldn&#x27;t want to buy a home everywhere you travel to. What is the threshold for buying something vs renting it?<p>Thank you all in advance for your contribution!')
