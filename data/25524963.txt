Not being able to demonstrate the right skills in the interview does not mean that the candidate is a bad programmer or even a bad fit for the job. It just means that I was not able to verify their bona fides in that hour.<p>That&#x27;s the difference between &quot;that interview didn&#x27;t go well&quot; and &quot;you are a bad programmer.&quot; One&#x27;s a major blow to self confidence, and the other&#x27;s a bummer. It&#x27;s also a helpful mindset shift for both the interviewer and the interviewee: both of us are working together to achieve the goal of proving your capabilities. My job is to give you as many opportunities as possible to do so.')
