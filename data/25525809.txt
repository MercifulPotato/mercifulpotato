That is, how come the early universe ended up with way more &quot;stable neutrons&quot; than regular neutrons, yet somehow our experiments which regularly make neutrons has not noticed them? The missing mass should be very obvious.<p>You should at the very least have a plausible answer for that before spending the considerable amount of money and effort it takes to make and launch a probe.')
