Even iPhone was designed with idea of web apps.  After invention of Apple App Store things slowly started to rot. And now we are in moment where after one or two Mac OS iterations you will be totally closed in predictable UX patterns inside walled garden for Security reasons, etc.<p>I am a long time Apple user and I understand that this platform is not for me anymore. Apple undoubtedly will have expansion of user base, M2 will be monster of processor and will eliminate the idea of Mac Pro tower. But trade off will be: no user control over software and hardware. For general user base this is not a problem. They feel at home because this is nothing new for them. This is iPhone and iPad experience all over.<p>So what is the solution? The solution for me is to relearn computing. Actually things that I cannot live behind (yet) are Affinity Designer and Logic.<p>Linux is the way for power user. Arch, Gentoo, Debian, Fedora. Plenty of choices.<p>I discovered that learning Emacs is investment in future in which I will not depend on corporate idea of &quot;user interface&quot;. As a long time designer I sketch and draw on paper with pencil and ink brush. In the past I successfully shipped designs with Inkscape (people were unaware of SVG) so in near future\nmy work (if is any left) will be done without new Apple.')
