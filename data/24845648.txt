I don&#x27;t really get why so many permission models on what software can do are effectively &quot;admin mode&quot; or &quot;user mode&quot;. Why can&#x27;t you get a very strong warning when software tries to snoop on traffic, but you can still do it? Or maybe you have to go into settings and allow it or something like that.<p>When you rent space in a building, do you get access to every single apartment&#x2F;office space in the building? No. You get access to specifically what you rented and the front door. The maintenance people for the building will have access to the front door and other maintenance areas, but won&#x27;t have access to your space. We can clearly conceptualize models like that. We even have <i>something</i> like this on phones.')
