Shouldn&#x27;t they be allowed?<p>If your answer is affirmative...I guess I&#x27;ll just have to accept that in a near future, maybe browsers will ship with a whitelist of the sites we&#x27;re allowed to browse, since they&#x27;re developed and published by private entities.<p>Maybe open source forks without those list will start gaining market share....but just until the private ISPs will decide to implement a whitelist as well.')
