Programming languages are used for writing programs. You suggest that Python is objectively superior in one context &quot;scripting&quot; than other programming languages. There are languages that are not cross-platform, that would fit that, there are languages like PL&#x2F;SQL that are limited to databases, those are not practical for many program development efforts. In this context, we&#x27;re really talking about two different types of hammers, perhaps one has a claw and the other does not, but they are both fairly portable and can target nearly all the same platforms.<p>But if Python is objectively better than these other general purpose languages, does that imply that there are areas where Python is not superior to these languages? Would it suggest that folks who&#x27;ve been successful even when choosing Python in those cases objectively made the wrong choice?')
