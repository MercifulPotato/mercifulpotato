Why didn&#x27;t governments institute a policy that keeps people away from those in vulnerable groups with a £1000 fine for breaches? Mandated masks etc. That would have been just as manageable. Lockdowns do not work, the figures clearly show that yet people still mandate for more lockdowns? I don&#x27;t get it.<p>&gt; and despite the huge effort, covid still escapes into the community every so often.<p>yes, but who is dying from it? It&#x27;s the old and vulnerable, not the young and non-vulnerable: the vast majority of people will not die from this!<p>The cure is worse than the disease.')
