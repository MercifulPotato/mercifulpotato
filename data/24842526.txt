I wasn&#x27;t expecting that much of a difference in NVMe performance, and looking around elsewhere I couldn&#x27;t find a similar kind of resultâ€”maybe other CPUs&#x2F;busses are just so fast at their base frequencies that it isn&#x27;t an issue at all.<p>I mean, it&#x27;s not like the Pi CM4 can put through 1500 MB&#x2F;sec on its PCIe 1x lane.')
