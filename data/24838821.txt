Over time, we want to get that up to 95%. Webflow has an amazing product if you already know how to code. You can make award winning websites in Webflow, but it will take you time. Makeswift sites may not be winning any AWWWARDS (yet), but you&#x27;ll be able to build something good in a fraction of the effort. In addition, other people on your team can learn it as well, parallelizing your throughput. If speed is top priority, then our product is for you.<p>Squarespace and Wix are great for people who want to set up a template, skin it, and forget it. Their focus on wizards and templates optimizes the user experience for beginners, but at the cost of flexibility for advanced customization. There are a lot of people that this makes sense for.<p>Makeswift is designed for opinionated people who are constantly tinkering with design, layouts, and new ideas, but don&#x27;t want to climb a giant learning curve. We&#x27;re focusing on making a generic, flexible user experience with composable components that doesn&#x27;t have opinions about how you build your pages.')
