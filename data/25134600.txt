I live in the UK and have been renting for many years, I&#x27;ve lived at 15+ addresses and not at a single one could I have powered the car from home. Not one.<p>The UK is small, cars are squeezed onto tiny roads and most people do on-street parking, i.e. you park where you can. When I last had a car I could only park around the corner from my flat (which was set far back from the road).<p>Having off-street parking is a luxury here that only a small % of people have, and even then if you have a block of flats it still makes charging from home more or less practically impossible.<p>Unless the govt intend to install charging points at every car parking spot on every residential road in the entire country in 9 years (!) or whatever the full timeline they have in their minds for everybody to have electric then this is not feasible.<p>That&#x27;s not to mention the fact that charging electric cars requires very significant current to do so in a reasonable timeframe. Electrical substations in the UK simply could not cope with anything close to full electric car deployment without the entire electrical network being upgraded.<p>And this is before we get on to practicality issues around cars breaking down, longer trips or how petrol stations might be used given charge time.<p>I think there is some kind of shared delusion that this is some easy way of reducing CO2 emissions. It&#x27;s not easy, and there are very big questions and trade-offs that nobody appears able to address.<p>Before people suggest &#x27;well people need to use public transport then&#x27; - while the UK has better public transport than e.g. much of the US (I went to Austin without a car once, that was tough) - outside of London public transport is extremely expensive, very very unreliable (our trains for example are the most expensive and least reliable in all of Europe), slow and entirely impractical for many areas.<p>I am not anti-electric car, in fact I wouldn&#x27;t mind using one (that acceleration, consistent torque, so much more reliable) - it&#x27;s just there are huge practical issues that the govt seem never to address.<p>I personally think the appropriate compromise is to move forward with very efficient hybrid vehicles.')
