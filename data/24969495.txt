Our hottest data set, which could easily fit in RAM, was on DynamoDB. So much &quot;event sourcing&quot; and CloudWatch. Because you needed all those logs for troubleshooting such a brittle system, right?<p>And since our core function was the recommendation engine, of course we hoarded and munged data like gnomes, with almost no value add, result negative ROI. (+70% of our &quot;lift&quot; was from the customer&#x27;s own &quot;recently viewed&quot; list. The highest cost recommendations accounted for less than 3% of &quot;lift&quot;.)<p>There was some director level push to migrate from AWS to Google. Which meant first Kubernetes and then Google. Such fun.<p>There was next to zero consideration of questioning assumptions. Like unwinding the unholy tar pit of mainframe era batch processing mentality fork lifted onto cloud era web services hotness.<p>And I don&#x27;t think they could question their assumptions. The skills and experience of the traditional brick &amp; mortar types simply couldn&#x27;t.<p>This &quot;consultants ruin everything&quot; story has played out across all industries.')
