A reasonable claim like &quot;I think this should be higher because XYZ&quot; gets investigated and, if justified, higher bounties issued.<p>This blog post seems a bit one-sided and doesn&#x27;t correlate to the facts that I have heard. I wasn&#x27;t there at the time being so I don&#x27;t know the truth. But that blog post seems not quite 100% to be it.<p>What I have seen, however, in the past years, is that some people omit facts or misrepresent things to get some press. So I am quite a cynic on blog posts like this :-)')
