Once you release software with an open source license, users are free to do what they wish as long as it&#x27;s within the bounds of the license.<p>Separately comes the business model. If a business intends on selling a hosted version of their product, as most open source database companies seem to want to do, that product needs to compete on its own merits. Can the business truly offer a better hosting experience on someone else&#x27;s cloud than those cloud providers themselves?<p>I think maybe we conflate the two because we want everything. We want to create open source products that a community contributes to and supports but that only the originating company can monetize. It just doesn&#x27;t work that way.')
