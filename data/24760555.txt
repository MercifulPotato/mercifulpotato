If git is a failure as claimed then the alternatives should be better, no? We have a list of known version control software [0], how many of these are better than git and how many are worse? I&#x27;ve heard Mercurial and Fossil are pretty good but I still haven&#x27;t been pressured to give them a try. However, most of that list is filled with software people hated enough to ditch for git.<p>I think it&#x27;s very likely that git is solving a problem hard enough that it can&#x27;t be simplified much further. If it can be simplified, I would expect to hear a growing minority of users pushing for people to switch to the next system.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Comparison_of_version-control_software" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Comparison_of_version-control_...</a>')
