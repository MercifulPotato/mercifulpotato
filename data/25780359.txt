It&#x27;s a different style of play for people who came out of AD&amp;D or who took to the OSR style games.<p>DCC, which I&#x27;ve been playing and running for a while, is <i>lethal</i> in comparison. Which is a mark against it for many people, but my group loves it. We don&#x27;t have a death a week, but we had several deaths over the past year. The threat changes the play style versus what we saw with 5e where it just felt like PCs couldn&#x27;t die unless the DM went out of their way to create an excessive challenge that bordered on a forced TPK scenario.')
