Item(by='thomastjeffery', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604839731, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25024354, text='&gt; This is people denying your humanity on no grounds whatsoever, and when you point it out they say &quot;well, minorities have always felt this way, so shut up and take it.&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s where they are coming from: Donald Trump was denying people&#x27;s humanity on the grounds that they came from south of the border. He was literally separating children from their parents to scare others away.<p>When I have explained that to Trump supporters, they immediately gaslight me; telling me it wasn&#x27;t that bad, or Trump&#x27;s fault.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s about Bill and John and Sally-- people who used to be friends and colleagues-- treating me like I&#x27;m a monster for no reason whatsoever other than a mass psychosis.<p>They don&#x27;t mean to. Really, they don&#x27;t. The trouble is, they just can&#x27;t find a reason.<p>The only reason I can think of is that Trump supporters really don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happening. That they don&#x27;t believe it. It looks a lot like mass psychosis.<p>It looks even more like a cult. I would know: I grew up in one. If I can come back from that, you can come back from this. The first step is empathy.<p>Are you certain that you aren&#x27;t in the &quot;group of people oppressing other groups of people&quot;?<p>I know it can be hard to confront that question. I did it about a year ago. When I did, I found out the answer was &quot;no&quot;.<p>I dug a little deeper, and realized it wasn&#x27;t a soft &quot;no&quot;, either. I was an instrumental part of an institution that tears families apart and drives children to suicidal ideation. I always knew there were issues, but I had plenty of excuses for those issues and the institution&#x27;s part in them.<p>If you really aren&#x27;t a Nazi or a racist, then will you reconsider your support for the GOP? Bill, John, and Sally didn&#x27;t just pull that out of their asses. What they said to you was disrespectful and dehumanizing, but it didn&#x27;t come from nothing.')
