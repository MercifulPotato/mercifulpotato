There were always random kids in and out of the house, we&#x27;d give them food&#x2F;water&#x2F;bandaids whatever.  Tell jokes&#x2F;stories.  Even though we aren&#x27;t related, we all knew each other and our kids just kinda bounced around together.  Definitely a cool experience.<p>I think the media making the entire world out to be some bogeyman waiting to kidnap your child is as much to blame as anything.')
