I don&#x27;t want to have programs that think they&#x27;ve sent mail when they&#x27;ve just handed off responsibility to some other program. And, closely related, I don&#x27;t want to have incidents where mail isn&#x27;t getting sent and I don&#x27;t know that.<p>I&#x27;d like a mail client as capable as mutt, but that also works whether I&#x27;m online or not, handles mail sync automatically in the background while I start processing those mails, lets me browse and search and draft responses offline, and has a built-in idea of &quot;has that mail been sent yet?&quot; rather than just saying &quot;sent&quot; the moment a mail goes into another queue the client doesn&#x27;t manage without giving any status for when it actually gets sent. And all that while also leaving mail on the server so that <i>other</i> mail clients such as K-9 mail on my phone (which can do all those things) can also process mail.<p>Sometimes I like &quot;programs that do one thing well&quot;. But doing mail <i>well</i> involves taking full responsibility for mail.')
