Once the fact that most likely Intel CPUs or Windows can be safely considered &quot;backdoored&quot; is brought up, those same people pivot to &quot;who backdoored it matters&quot;.<p>No, it does not. A backdoor is a backdoor and once it&#x27;s out there it will sooner or later be used by everyone with enough resources, making the &quot;who&quot; irrelevant. Any Windows or Intel backdoors are very likely now in the hands of all major intelligence services around the world.<p>But let me frame it in a different, albeit slightly crass way: if you have a turd floating in your soup can you honestly say there&#x27;s a good answer for &quot;who put it there?&quot; that will make you like that soup more?')
