In fact, I&#x27;m damn horrified at how far the guy got, and I think I understand quite well how it was done.<p>It&#x27;s not just some abstract &#x27;otherwise neutral orange man&#x27; whose identity is entirely constructed by news media, and that&#x27;s a strange argument to make. I think many people thought &#x27;Al Capone bad&#x27; too, particularly if he&#x27;d robbed them or shot somebody they liked. I&#x27;m sure the greedy news media HELPED people get mad at Al Capone, and that there were redeeming factors in the guy, but the notion that there were automatically as many redeeming factors in Capone as in everybody else is NOT sensible. Maybe he just was mean, and sucked.<p>Likewise with &#x27;orange man&#x27;. Way before he was a political figure, he was mean and sucked REALLY bad relative to my sense of how things work in the world. Some people just suck very, very much.<p>If you assume anyone who has success automatically does not suck, I admire your optimism but I sure don&#x27;t share it. Seems to me that without considerable oversight, the opposite is usually true, and that the worst people, entities, companies etc. win. Hence, the invention of means of oversight, and the attempt to codify what&#x27;s good and bad.')
