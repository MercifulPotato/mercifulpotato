See the NYT getting rid of its public editor&#x2F;ombudsman.[1] I&#x27;d actually have trouble seeing Apple hiring someone like that given how tightly they control external messaging&#x2F;speaking&#x2F;etc.<p>It&#x27;s really hard for execs, including but not limited to PR, to have worked really hard on getting some message&#x2F;narrative accepted by the media&#x2F;analysts&#x2F;etc. and then have a high profile employee on social media or in a major publication saying it&#x27;s sort of B.S. even as an occasional thing.<p>ADDED: It doesn&#x27;t make it &quot;right&quot; for them to storm into their boss&#x27; office and demand said person be fired but it is at least an understandable human reaction. I think anyone who takes that kind of role has to understand they&#x27;ll be a lightning rod, feel passionate about it anyway, and understand they may well eventually set off a tripwire and be fired in a very public and humiliating way.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedailybeast.com&#x2F;why-the-new-york-times-fired-its-public-editor-in-favor-of-a-reader-center" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedailybeast.com&#x2F;why-the-new-york-times-fired-i...</a>')
