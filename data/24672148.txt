These organizations are made up of people who live and breathe film making, and they vote for what they think is the best, not the most popular.<p>Note that their choices aren&#x27;t perfect; I&#x27;ve watched some movies that won awards that I really didn&#x27;t like. That said, I think these sources are a better starting point than lists based solely on popularity.')
