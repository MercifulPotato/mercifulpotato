Seeing as I&#x27;m working on my Merced box I felt like commenting on this.<p>Intel&#x2F;HP did many things wrong when they designed EPIC.  The \nabsence of dynamic scheduling was supposed to have made it simpler and thus have a faster cycle time. Alas it was so bloated when it finally arrived and horrendously complicated that it clock very slowly (mine @ 733 MHz while contemporaries ran at 1+ GHz).<p>The EPIC designers probably also didn&#x27;t anticipate the advances in OoO machines that got really good.  Trying to statically schedule for unknown load-misses isn&#x27;t just difficult, it&#x27;s impossible without code explosion.<p>EPIC got some things right, but design by committee and betting again dynamic scheduling doomed it.')
