It took two weeks pointing out we can&#x27;t do any work, our contractor rates they paying us to do nothing and the approaching deadline to make it way up the chain for senior execs to organise machines with 16gb.<p>If you need to run Docker with a few containers that&#x27;s several gigs immediately unavailable to the system. Start MS Teams, another gig, visual studio code &#x2F; intelij, another gig, a browser another gig or so.<p>Even without running developer tools on a 8gb machine which seems to be standard issue laptops at most office based companies and average non techy person off the street you very quickly hit the memory limits and swapping to disc as you have a handful of small Electron applications open.<p>Memory usage is extremely important to users just that most users being non technical don&#x27;t know it and just think their machine is slow.<p>Running an application in 2020 with the ubiquitous use of Electron my desktop apps seem less responsive, i can run fewer of them, and any sign of bad internet connection my system comes to a halt as all that apps even if only sending metrics block until api requests are complete or timeout vs running them in the background and not blocking ui functionality.')
