Can you point to the specific instances of violence you are talking about and the speech that inspired them?<p>The issue here is that this isn&#x27;t theoretical.  Trump actually spoke to a real mob, in person, told them to march to the capitol, and then praised him once they had invaded and sacked it during a joint session of congress.  Given that, yes, we look at his speech with much less tolerant criteria.  He wasn&#x27;t just spouting off, he is at least a proximate cause of a direct attack on our seat of government.')
