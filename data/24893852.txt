Previous schemes involved digging shallow burial sites, 100 m or 200 m deep. This is not safe in the medium term, as ground water could easily seep through in the case of geological events. But if you drill a 2000 m hole and cover it back up, there&#x27;s absolutely no chance of the material coming back up in any way (as long as the site is not the worst.)')
