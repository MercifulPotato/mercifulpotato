In general none of them will work as well as the PinePhone, because Pine isn&#x27;t fighting this sort of thing the way most manufacturers are, but it could be a fun thing to look into if you own anything already supported. You could also port it to a device not yet on the list if you&#x27;re up for it.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.postmarketos.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Devices" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.postmarketos.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Devices</a>')
