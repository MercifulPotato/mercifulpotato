Her translation work was journeyman level at best. I&#x27;ve read most of her translations, and they simply do not convey the magical soul of Chekhov&#x27;s prose very well. Nothing is going to replace reading it in the original language, but Pevear and Volokhonsky get far closer in my opinion. Constance Garnet&#x27;s translations still stick around largely because they are now free.')
