I recently picked up a 3W, 365nm UV light with a visible light filter.  I brought it along on our nightly dog walk to play with it and noticed my Yorkie&#x27;s hair glowed quite a bit(light yellow IIRC).<p>I highly recommend picking up a real UV light with a visible light filter if all you&#x27;ve ever used are the cheap blacklights that glow purple.
