Everyone gets credits and by giving away stuff&#x2F;helping people you can earn them.<p>One could say it&#x27;s the same as money, but I don&#x27;t think so. There&#x27;s no use in hoarding those credits and it&#x27;s not as strict as real money. As long as it stops abuse it works as intended.<p>The downside is you now need someone to organize and keep track all of this.')
