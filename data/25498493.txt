The first thing you did when you walked in was hand them your ID and coverage info. You think hospitals operate on the honor system?<p>As a Canadian I&#x27;ve never been asked to pay up before <i>or</i> after receiving treatment [edit: at the point of care].<p>And before you jump into taxation, Canadians pay less per capita in taxes than Americans ($13K vs $14K), and that&#x27;s before you factor in the $600 per month in private tax you directly (or indirectly via employer) have to pay your insurers.<p>&gt; Especially when I arrive there unconscious.<p>You either have insurance or you&#x27;re driven into Chapter 11. Further I suspect this is not due to good will but rather government intervention.<p>&gt; And Herb Cohen would say once you&#x27;ve received the service, you&#x27;re actually in a great negotiating position.<p>The debt was incurred once the service was rendered, and you are now liable. 66.5% of all bankruptcies in the US are medical -- are they just bad negotiators? I&#x27;m not sure what point you&#x27;re trying to make but it&#x27;s not in good faith.<p>&gt; People actually negotiate hospital bills all the time. Especially in those crazy stories you hear about.<p>That sounds the worst.<p>&gt; And you need a citation for your claim about when free markets do and don&#x27;t work.<p>Voluntary contractual exchange is one of the undisputed key pillars to a free market economy. If you&#x27;re being told you will die without the service it is a coercive exchange and therefore violates one of the key tenets. [1]<p>If I hold a gun to your head and tell you to buy my oranges for $1000 or I kill you, is the free market price of oranges $1000? If I tell you that you have cancer and you&#x27;ll die unless you get $48,000 worth of chemotherapy, is that a free market? [2]<p>A free market requires both the voluntary production and voluntary consumption of services.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Free_market" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Free_market</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.asbestos.com&#x2F;featured-stories&#x2F;high-cost-of-cancer-treatment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.asbestos.com&#x2F;featured-stories&#x2F;high-cost-of-cance...</a>')
