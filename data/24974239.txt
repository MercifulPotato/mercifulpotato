We’re building a music-focused social network fighting back against algorithmically generated playlists and soulless corporate radio. We’re creating a democratized platform people connect with their music, their favorite artists, and each other. One of our founders is an actual rockstar, and we have artists and industry executives lauding us as the future of music streaming.<p>We are a small team developers working collaboratively in a diverse and inclusive workplace. Our dev team has a wide range of backgrounds—including self-taught hackers and bootcamp grads.<p>The position is Android-only. No backend or iOS programming is expected, although some understanding of Swift and iOS fundamentals is helpful since some feature work will be direct ports from our iOS project.  Our Android codebase is less than a year old, uses Kotlin exclusively.<p>While the position is remote, we’re based in NYC and general availability for collaboration is expected between 10am and 4pm Eastern time.  Interest in relocating to NYC in the post-pandemic future is desirable, but not required.<p>email me at andrew@stationhead.com if you&#x27;re interested.  Be sure to include the name of your favorite band in the email!')
