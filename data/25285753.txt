I personal don’t buy Apple products anymore for the reasons you have listed, and am transitioning from my iPhone 7 to my newly purchased pine phone. However, from both the standpoint of an engineer and a consumer I’m continually impressed by the quality of the products Apple makes. Not as impressed as I was when I got my first Mac in 2007 bu despite conducting the same shady business practices that have landed others in hot water, as long as Apple makes quality products I doubt any antitrust “changes” will be more than symbolic in-practice.<p>I’m all for putting pressure on them with antitrust lawsuits but ultimately consumers are who will drive meaningful change')
