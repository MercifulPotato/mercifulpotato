Item(by='yyyk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610337072, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25722298, text='&gt;Thinking about this design choice, I now wonder how many times I&#x27;ve had files mysteriously go missing on Windows and other operating systems simply because I used CTRL+X when I meant to use CTRL+C<p>Zero. If one CTRL+Xs accidentally, Windows and most Linux Desktop pickers change the highlight colour before the copy. At worst you can CTRL+Z it after or copy it back. It&#x27;s not a &#x27;destructive&#x27; operation since you always have one copy of the file.<p>It&#x27;s a typical case of Apple deciding users are stupid and therefore should be limited, combined with the typical &#x27;just everything Apple does&#x27; syndrome.')
