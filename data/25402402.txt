If the protocol is wrong, the suite should go against the policy setter (municipality). If the person violated policy, it should be on them. If they neither violated nor followed policy, it should be determined by the courts.<p>I don&#x27;t generally agree with capping damages. This could prevent real damages from being reimbursed. Capping intangibles could be ok though.')
