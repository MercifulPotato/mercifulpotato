The heart of liberalism is individual freedom, responsibility, and culpability. True liberals believe that speech that does not directly evoke violence (such as Holocaust denial) <i></i>is not violent<i></i>. If somebody hears that speech and decides to become violent, that&#x27;s on them.<p>Believing that we need to restrict what is said in the town square because people will get bad ideas, believing that people are not free but just a confluence of the ideas around them, believing that people need to be led by an authority - these are the classic arguments against liberalism.<p>You&#x27;re trying to say that liberals are reciting anti-liberal talking points within their community regarding whether this kind of free speech is good. I think it&#x27;s far more likely that these people are not really liberals, and just consider themselves to be liberals because it&#x27;s the most popular political ideology of the day. We should not call those that recite anti-liberal talking points &quot;liberals&quot; - to do so is to rob the word of any meaning at all.')
