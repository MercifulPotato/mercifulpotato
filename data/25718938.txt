I don&#x27;t think just opening would work because the short-term shock would be too great (+ nobody in those countries would agree to do it), but I do think eroding borders in some way may be necessary to get people in wealthy countries to take the needs of those elsewhere seriously. Currently we tend to have some level of wealth redistribution within countries, but very little between them.')
