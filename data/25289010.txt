RPC has been tried and tried and tried and the same problems happen all the time. Tightly coupled, brittle, hard to upgrade.<p>If by &quot;gRPC&quot; you meant protobuf as a message format, then sure. But TLV based binary streaming has been around for yonks (eg ASN.1).<p>Pushing is an optimization to avoid API round trips, not just the capability of sending a binary stream.<p>Link headers have the same effect as HTTP&#x2F;2 push, but a client can cache previous requests (and the new 103 Early Hints status).<p>It&#x27;s a hint from the server that it&#x27;s highly likely that the Link URLs will have useful information in terms of the current request.<p>It can be seen by caching layers between the client and the server, so they can pre-cache the links or deliver them without server interaction if previously cached.<p>All of that is part of HTTP, which has nothing to do with &quot;hypertext documents&quot;. It just happened to be that hypertext documents were the first use of the protocol.')
