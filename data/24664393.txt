This very fact, is important psychologically.  The fact that any online alternative is taking place in the same medium (staring at a screen) as work, will make it difficult to avoid either:\n1) too much distraction to get work done, or\n2) too little &quot;reason&quot; to go there, to have spontaneous conversations<p>So, it sounds like I&#x27;m being very negative, but if you manage to find a way around these problems, it would be an impressive feat of both technology and psychology.  Good luck!')
