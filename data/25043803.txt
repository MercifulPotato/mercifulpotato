I would be more than willing to pay for more expensive meat where the animals have more space for them, or eat proper grass, as opposed to, let&#x27;s say, having corn shoved into them and antibiotics to suppress persistent infections, etc. The meat is tastier that way, too.<p>&gt; you&#x27;re just a sociopath<p>Sure, according to your definition I would be. So would most people, billions of them.<p>&gt; Do you also believe it is okay for me to torture a dog just because I get visual satisfaction from it?<p>Visual satisfaction? No. But if you want to slaughter and eat it I don&#x27;t have a problem with that.<p>&gt; really? lol ok<p>Yes, really. You come across as some sort of quixotean person yelling at windmills while most of us over here are just eating our meat. It&#x27;s simply that people don&#x27;t say it, out of politeness.')
