Most people under 50 won&#x27;t have the opportunity to be vaccinated for <i>months</i>. So this absolutely is a theoretical problem, at least for now.<p>Given that Covid is such a mild disease for most young people, I predict that by the time the elderly and vulnerable have been vaccinated, this will be a non-issue anyway.')
