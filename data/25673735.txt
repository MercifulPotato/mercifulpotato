Item(by='netsharc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610039216, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25673306, text='See sibling reply, your purported evidence just went up in a puff of smoke.<p>Although I have a feeling you&#x27;d rather wave your hand and say &quot;Aah, Snopes, what do they know, and it&#x27;s not concrete enough!&quot;.<p>The problem with the &quot;1000&#x27;s of people with sworn affidavits of violations&quot; is, it seems their understanding what a violation is, are based on misinterpreting (deliberately or not) and wishful thinking. I&#x27;ve seen the videos of people commenting &quot;Look at this security camera footage, they&#x27;re taking boxes, and those boxes have fake ballots!&quot;, without even showing how he came to those conclusions. I could just as easily show a footage of a man walking into a building and claim it&#x27;s a building where voting machines are stored and he&#x27;s a hacker with a USB stick that will hack all the machines. I hope all the affidavits were looked at carefully before being dismissed, but it seems like the courts would have work until the sun burns out if it wants to look at every theory.')
