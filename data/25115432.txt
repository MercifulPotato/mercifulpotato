In contrast, there was no between-group difference in the proportion of patients treated with corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine or dedicated antibiotics, or hospitalized for COVID-19.&quot;<p>And this has to do with Vitamin-D&#x27;s role with the ACE2 receptor. SARS-CoV-2 has a binding affinity to ACE2, aggressively invading cells with proportionally higher ACE2 receptors (including the lungs).<p>In fact, someone had tried injecting hrsACE2 into someone as a treatment -- that is, letting the virus bind to hrsACE2 instead of the ACE2 receptors in the cells.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41392-020-00374-6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41392-020-00374-6</a><p>A treatment with hrsACE2 isn&#x27;t generally-available, and needs a lot more study. The logsitics in producing them at scale would need to be solved, if this is a viable treatment. But this looks promising to me.')
