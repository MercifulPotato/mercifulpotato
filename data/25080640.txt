You&#x27;re gonna have a heart attack when you realize that this isn&#x27;t just an Apple thing and that <i>nobody</i> encrypts OCSP.<p>Once you understand why, I&#x27;d be interested in hearing your new, revised solution.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s not quite as bad as <i>sneak</i> makes it out to be. OCSP responses are cached so, as mentioned in TFA (so certificate status is not being checked every time you launch every app), although I&#x27;m not sure what the validity interval of OCSP responses from ocsp.apple.com is (and don&#x27;t have anything running macOS to check). Additionally, I don&#x27;t see anyone but Apple announcing any part of the 17&#x2F;8 network (regardless of ocsp.apple.com. being CNAME&#x27;d to Akamai).')
