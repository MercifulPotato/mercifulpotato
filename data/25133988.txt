Normally what I would do, if I were writing an email to explain a problem, is create that explanation in depth on a wiki or other knowledge repository somewhere. Write the email referencing the url of this wiki, and explain the main points in the email.<p>This is as a general rule if I am explaining something important for tech team to know, if I am explaining something that is important for product owner to know I write it in as verbose an email as is required to explain everything. That&#x27;s up to the product owner to follow. Generally after receiving an email like this they will want a meeting where I can explain in person and draw stuff on the whiteboard.')
