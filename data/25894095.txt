This is really nothing special IMO.<p>Plus, the fact that the filters are inside of the app source and not fetched from a remote repo means that filtering errors (false-positives) will take hours or maybe days to be fixed, as the dev will need to push out an update (or pull Fanboy&#x27;s upstream fixes), it will need to be approved by Apple, and then the user will need to update the entire extension.<p>Compare this with uBo or Adguard, where one can manually check for updates and pull a new version of a single filter list or every filter list in ten seconds. In uBo, the user can also badfilter the offending line in the list or disable uBo from running on a specific domain.<p>In general, as evidenced from this issue list, cookie consent lists are somewhat problematic and can break sites. Some of these issues may be fixed by now. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ryanbr&#x2F;fanboy-adblock&#x2F;issues?q=%22easylist+cookie+list%22+is%3Aopen" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ryanbr&#x2F;fanboy-adblock&#x2F;issues?q=%22easylis...</a>')
