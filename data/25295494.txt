I feel like you are not getting the point that everyone is trying to make to you.  \nMaybe if I throw a few more examples at you. Otherwise I give up...<p>If I buy a smart TV at Wall-Mart, Wall-Mart gets a &#x27;referral&#x27; fee for the TV but not for the Netflix subscription I use on that TV.<p>If I buy an Xbox at Wall-Mart, Wall-Mart gets a &#x27;referral&#x27; fee for the Xbox but not for the Xbox live subscription I run on that console.<p>If I buy a physical copy of Adobe Photoshop at Wall-Mart, Wall-Mart gets a &#x27;referral&#x27; fee for the purchase but does not get a cut when I sign up to Adobe&#x27;s CS subscription each year (because at that point there is no more &#x27;referral&#x27; going on!).<p>If I buy a fridge at Wall-Mart I am allowed to purchase my groceries I put in it from stores other than Wall-Mart. Imagine if Wall-Mart set up a system to block any non-Wall-Mart purchased groceries from going into the fridge? Then you&#x27;d be forced to pay a &#x27;referral&#x27; fee to Wall-Mart every time you want to use your device. No one could set up a competing store to sell you groceries for your Wall-Mart fridge.')
