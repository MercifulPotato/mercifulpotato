If most people make the effort, then the aggregate will add up to more than a FAANG, so a social push for it isn&#x27;t a waste.<p>Sure, don&#x27;t expect to change the world on it alone. But if every industry takes on an awareness of this sort of thing, and each niche within an industry discovers some way to shave a fraction of % off it&#x27;s emissions, it will all add up significantly.<p>Doing this kinds of thing is always going to be a game of inches, not miles. We can&#x27;t say &quot;It won&#x27;t even get us a mile, why should we bother?&quot; Be realistic about it by all means, but take the easy inches when they present themselve.')
