And what&#x27;s the debate called today, then, if not musicality?<p>Regardless of whatever you&#x27;d like to call it, I would argue that most audiophile products do not have it. I&#x27;ve personally tried a ton of &quot;audiophile&quot; products, from your standard Massdrop DAC+IEM combo to the incredibly fancy setup of a Swiss acquaintance and was left disappointed. Sure, there&#x27;s plenty of music that did sound good to me on those setups, but there was more music that sounded better on a pair of AirPods. This is also borne out by my own personal experiments. Let a random Joe listen to your expensive setup with a carefully chosen song, and they&#x27;ll likely be impressed at first. Wow, the details! The range! Incredible! But let them put on their favorite song, and they&#x27;ll often actually prefer it on their shitty setup. Try it - the results will surprise you.<p>And my critique of audiophile equipment is not coming from an untrained ear, or someone who cares about branding. I&#x27;ve been playing violin for almost my entire life, and even plenty of classical music sounds better on AirPods vs many audiophile setups! And as much as I like my Etymotics+DAC combo, it exposes flaws in the music. You hear the sneezes in the orchestra, you notice the small mistakes, and God help you if you play a recording of lower quality - it&#x27;ll sound terrible. There is an enormous amount of music that is _only_ available in low quality, and it will sound a million times worse on your audiophile setup than your AirPods.<p>In my opinion, the audiophile world has completely lost its mind. Nobody cares about if the music is actually fun to listen to - they&#x27;re far more concerned with frequency response curves, which, as anyone in the audiophile world knows, absolutely makes or breaks a manufacturer. Case in point: all the audiophiles downvoting the comment by &#x27;gambiting&#x27; to oblivion, simply because they expressed their personal preference! It&#x27;s preposterous to actually _like_ Beats: clearly that user is just an uninformed sheeple, downvote them and move on. I am so tired of the idea that Beats is objectively bad and Massdrop DAC+IEMs is objectively good. Has anyone ever considered that, just like the music you play with them, it&#x27;s possible to have personal preferences in headphones?')
