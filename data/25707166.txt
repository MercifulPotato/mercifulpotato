I think they finally figured out how to manufacture bearings for ballpoint pens in the last couple years. For both of these things, it&#x27;s basically assumed that they stole US plans&#x2F;technology&#x2F;IP years&#x2F;decades ago, yet still struggled&#x2F;struggle to actually execute.<p>What&#x27;s the best example of a successful, overt, non-domestic Chinese military operation, since deciding to go the totalitarian capitalism route?<p>Although now I&#x27;m also asking myself the same re: the US, and have sudden doubts.<p>As a bit of a tangent:\nI don&#x27;t buy most of the current China conspiracy theories, but I struggle to think of what a non-traditional attack by China would look like that might be more effective than our current reality.<p>If nothing else, we&#x27;ve just supplied blueprints on how to successfully wage a future covert&#x2F;non-traditional first-strike offensive.')
