However, it is a very different statement from your original:<p>&gt; Consider that at 14nm+++++, Intel still manages to outpace AMD with its 7nm CPUs and latest architecture. AMD competes mainly on price, which is not a great position to be in. Intel&#x27;s profit margins are massively better.<p>AMD is in no way &quot;competing mainly on price&quot;. In fact, if you look at prices on the market instead of MSRP, they are generally the more expensive option right now, and are still sold out on most models almost everywhere.')
