I think you learn to appreciate art the same way you learn to appreciate any other product.<p>The first step is to accept that some things just aren&#x27;t your cup of tea, even if all the true fans love it. I don&#x27;t like Holy Motors, Zen And The Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance, and IPAs. Popularity is a signal, not an obligation.<p>The second and most important step is to learn how the sausage is made. It gives you a much greater appreciation for the final product. My recent interest in gardening completely changed my forest walks. It quite literally made me see the forest for the trees. Likewise, I learned to appreciate film by paying more attention to the camera work, the sound design, and the many other things that make great movies great. YouTube has many great video essays that will show you a lot more than meets the eye [0].<p>The third step is to understand the context behind a work of art. My favourite example is Guernica by Picasso [1]. Look at it, then listen to this [2] from 1:12:54 to 1:16:00, then look at it again. You will get a far different impression of that painting. If you grew up in the 90s, the sound of a computer modem probably elicits some sort of emotional response to you. It would seem weird if you robbed the phenomenon from its context. That&#x27;s also true for art.<p>That, or date an art student for a few years.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-woNlmVcdjc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-woNlmVcdjc</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.museoreinasofia.es&#x2F;en&#x2F;collection&#x2F;artwork&#x2F;guernica" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.museoreinasofia.es&#x2F;en&#x2F;collection&#x2F;artwork&#x2F;guernic...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;soundcloud.com&#x2F;james-hewston&#x2F;blitz-logical-insanity" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;soundcloud.com&#x2F;james-hewston&#x2F;blitz-logical-insanity</a>')
