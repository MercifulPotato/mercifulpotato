Most ARE doing Cargo Cult Science.  Particularly those working in psychology and medical research.<p>Let that sink in.  Because it really, really matters.  And given that it is true, perhaps you should stop objecting to the characterization and start thinking about what would be required for that to no longer be true.<p>Now you said, <i>If you think that more research dollars should go to the second group (and I would likely agree), cool.</i> Well, that is a mild version of what I am saying.  I am saying that the decades long refusal of the field to fund or allow publication of any alternative lines of research is a genocidal crime.  I mean that quite literally.  They wasted billions of dollars entrusted to them and caused millions of unnecessary deaths.<p>This is not to say that amyloid research should not have been pursued.  It was the leading hypothesis for good reason.  But doctors have learned the hard way the importance of giving both a diagnosis and a differential.  And then to look for evidence for the differential.<p>Researchers need to be better at doing the same thing.  And as long as they are apathetic or, as you have been, openly hostile to it, they will continue doing Cargo Cult science.  No matter how impressive the procedure looks, they are failing to do the basic things that are likely to make it work.')
