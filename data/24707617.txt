Good engineering means practical engineering. It means things like choosing a sane, common voltage that is well suited to the already-existing real world. Picking 8V-30V is the kind of decision that sounds beautiful to a utopian engineer working high in an office tower, and I&#x27;m sure it would be lovely if we could have instantly warped into a world of full adoption, but here in the real world your standard is going to have to be useful today, and it&#x27;s going to have to be useful with more than just brand-new top-of-the-line freshly designed kit. Any engineer who would willingly forgo access to the entire world of already-existing 5V ICs is not a good engineer in my books.<p>To be fair to them though, it&#x27;s very easy to get caught up in the beauty of those theoretical designs and forget that the best-selling car is a Toyota Corolla, not a Lamborghini.')
