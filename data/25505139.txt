Item(by='milesvp', descendants=None, kids=[25505368, 25505172, 25506179], score=None, time=1608635785, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25504771, text='This article sort of glosses over the actual cost of designing the hardware. You should be able to get 500 units made working through a factory. Though minimum qty for parts can be as high as 5000, usually factories can find most components in smaller qty for 2-5x the price, especially since they already have relationships with suppliers. At $25-$35 bill of materials for something retailing at $250-$300 you&#x27;re only looking at maybe $15k capital costs for the electronics and maybe another $15k for the molds (less if you can use one of the cheaper processes). $30k is pretty cheap from a capital expense if you&#x27;re just talking about testing a market. The bigger cost is going to be all the engineering that goes into a product like this. It would be easy to spend $100k in billable hours to bring something as complicated as a webcam to market. You&#x27;ve got component selection and schematic work, board layout, industrial design work, firmware. If you&#x27;re lucky you can slap together the equivalent of an arduino with an attached camera for initial prototypes but that&#x27;ll only get you so far, and can still take weeks of development just to have a proof of concept. Hardware development is not for the faint of heart.<p>, and if you don&#x27;t already have expertise in the webcam world, there&#x27;s a good chance your product isn&#x27;t going to actually be very good.')
