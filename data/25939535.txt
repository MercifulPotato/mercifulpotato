Item(by='jiggawatts', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611822412, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25932504, text='Geometric Algebra is merely a variant of linear algebra that is purpose-designed for describing geometric concepts such as signed areas. For comparison, vector algebra is mostly a direct extension of linear algebra. Linear algebra was originally largely designed for solving large systems of simultaneous equations. Its native objects, vectors and matrices, are not ideal for geometric concepts. Trying to pretend everything is a vector ends up causing issues with the equations that are hideous to solve.<p>Some of these issues are <i>not obvious</i> when manipulating vector algebra purely symbolically. They manifest when it comes time to create a numerical simulation. You suddenly realise that there are practical issues such as high numerical error, conditional statements all over the place, and corner-cases like gimbal lock.<p>For comparison, something like simulating the full electromagnetic interaction in a 4D spacetime <i>ought</i> to be straightforward with a geometric algebra!<p>It&#x27;s just that I haven&#x27;t seen anyone try. Every EM textbook is the same. They go through the same equations. The same algebra. The same symbolic solutions. With the same corner cases. The same numerical stability issues. The same result: &quot;Oh we can talk about it, but rendering it is <i>too hard!</i>&quot;<p>I want an &quot;acid test&quot; of EM, a... wavepool to play with. Not a toy model. The <i>full thing</i>, capable of simulating even obscure but experimentally-verified results such such as the  Aharonovâ€“Bohm effect. See: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Aharonov%E2%80%93Bohm_effect" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Aharonov%E2%80%93Bohm_effect</a><p>That is, I want something where instead of plugging numbers into a simplified equation to derive such effects, I want to be able to set up a bunch of charges, press &quot;simulate&quot;, and watch the test particle get deflected in the area with zero field.')
