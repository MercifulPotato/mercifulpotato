Item(by='ajarmst', descendants=None, kids=[25446192, 25444982, 25445019], score=None, time=1608137759, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25443935, text='I&#x27;ve been using Magit for years, but I&#x27;ve never seen the use of &quot;porcelain&quot; as a jargon term to describe anything but Magit. Can you point me to a &#x27;splaner on the use of that term?  Googling hasn&#x27;t gotten me anything but an insight to just how many people take porcelain (the pottery) very, very seriously.')
