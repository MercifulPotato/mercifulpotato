And CircuitPython from Adafruit.<p>I have been turned off from some Arduino projects in the past due to the C&#x2F;C++ requirements, but MicroPython apparently runs on many microcontrollers and makes it pretty simple if you know basic Python.<p>Once you get a design working, if you need the efficiency and power gains from C, then you can drop down to that level. But with the Pico having a 133 MHz processor, the overhead for many projects isn&#x27;t too bad, and it&#x27;s still going to be a lot more efficient than running something equivalent on a Pi Zero.')
