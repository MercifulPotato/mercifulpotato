Vocabulary is the corner-stone of learning a language.<p>You can make yourself understood using simple sentences and botched grammar, if the key words in them are the right ones.<p>You can&#x27;t even study grammar without vocabulary, because grammar study uses examples. Examples loaded with words you don&#x27;t understand are poorly conducive to learning.<p>The best resources for Japanese grammar assume that you can read. You get some furigana over some of the kanji and that&#x27;s it.')
