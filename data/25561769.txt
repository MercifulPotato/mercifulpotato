I (like most people) am not in a position to become a board member - certainly not an Executive Director. There are obstacles of both personal qualification and free time (since I don&#x27;t see any evidence that the position is paid).<p>Because of that, I&#x27;m much more interested in how the Board will determine how it can best serve the community, and gather community feedback. That question can only really be answered after the board members themselves have been chosen.')
