The interface requiring  multiple downloads prevents automation or simply waiting out a large transfer, and not having a robust automated retry mechanism ensures wasted time and increases the odds of data loss.<p>2. Few people have a high-speed free WiFi network nearby. You’re not getting better results at Starbucks or the local library, and Google’s campus networks require logins even if you are one of the few people who lives near one.<p>3. Setting up a VPS and running downloads from a web app requires money and skills most people don’t have, especially if you care about not accidentally leaking your personal data. If you have enough data to matter, you’ll also hit many providers quota limits or bandwidth charges. If you navigate all of those challenges, you still haven’t solved the problem of getting it home - at best you can now use rsync to remove the manual component of the second transfer.')
