I wasn&#x27;t trying to defend taking action in general, I was trying to claim that I think a consequential rule of: &quot;Do not block new information due to perceived impact on election&quot; might be a good one.<p>&gt; Plenty of people lost trust in the media following their focus on the Hillary Clinton email scandal, which amounted to nothing but likely swayed the election.<p>Hm, let&#x27;s do a comparison.
