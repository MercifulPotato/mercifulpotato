Plus, inductive hobs around here tend to detect the presence of a pot and not just try pumping 2kW of energy into &quot;nothing&quot;. And you&#x27;re comparing a dynamically pulsed EM field with the static M field of the alignment magnets - they might be able to heat the reed, but might just not be able actually trigger it (edit: to clarify, that&#x27;s my guess; I&#x27;d expect manufacturers of either devices [ICDs and hobs] to test for potentially lethal problems).')
