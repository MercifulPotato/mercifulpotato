I&#x27;ve given it a look before, would be very nice if it could support Erlang too, but I imagine  Elixir macros are doing a lot of work for you.<p>I think the biggest hurdles when writing NIFs are:<p>* Interacting with Erlang terms from C&#x2F;Rust&#x2F;Zig. Admittedly both zigler and rustler help in this regard, by wrapping Erlang terms. Pony is able to expose raw pointers and structs to C, which I&#x27;ve felt easier to work with.<p>* Dealing with the Beam&#x27;s preemptive scheduler. This isn&#x27;t as big of a problem now with dirty schedulers but still a mismatch compared to normal Erlang code. Pony uses a cooperative scheduler everywhere, so you&#x27;ll already be used to splitting long tasks in different steps by the time you need to use the FFI, which makes the transition easier.')
