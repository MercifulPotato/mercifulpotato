It&#x27;s easy for Trump to condemn the KKK, not so easy to condemn militia groups in general. Similarly, it&#x27;s easy for Biden to condemn rioters, not so easy to condemn Antifa in general. Effectively, both candidates dodged that question.<p>&gt; ... I haven&#x27;t seen him denounce anyone who might vote for him.<p>That&#x27;s moving the goalpost a bit too far for my taste. Trump has condemned white supremacists, that at least is on the record.')
