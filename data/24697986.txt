I can&#x27;t remember the name anymore, but it wasn&#x27;t publicly available, just circulated amongst upper echelon guilds.<p>We would wipe dozens, if not hundreds of times, just to get all the timings down and scripted. It also helped that four of the people in our guild worked in QA for Blizzard (not so well-kept secret of many top guilds back then).<p>Like someone else mentioned, now WeakAuras more of less does that in a much more user friendly way. Still the same process of wiping hundreds of times to build the WeakAuras though.')
