Item(by='code_scrapping', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603892217, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24917721, text='[Off-topic] I see the other post on Scott&#x27;s blog &quot;My summer 2020 road trip along the Italian Riviera&quot;, and I have to give impressions.<p>It&#x27;s not the first time I hear the story along the tune of &quot;we went on vacation, and it was so strange, everything was deserted, people were masked&quot;. There&#x27;s a reason for that - it&#x27;s called a pandemic, it&#x27;s taking lives in the thousands per day. Yet, people still can&#x27;t seem to rationalize that we shouldn&#x27;t do unnecessary trips, even if we really, really need a vacation right now (and probably everybody does).<p>The author said they chose Italy because they were &quot;only country that seemed to have a handle on infections&quot;. Again - that&#x27;s because Italy was the hardest hit country at the start of the European side of the pandemic. It&#x27;s like saying &quot;Wuhan seems to know how to deal with the issue&quot;.<p>Usually, I go for the ad-hominem attack &quot;people are too uneducated, they don&#x27;t understand...&quot; when I see this kind of behavior. But this year - I see it over and over again in highly (formally) educated (PhD-level) people, who keep track with things, are aware - and yet, can&#x27;t help themselves. Scott certainly doesn&#x27;t seem like a uninformed person, nor is he blind to the situation. That&#x27;s the kind of contradictory examples that whisper &quot;this isn&#x27;t going to be OK, we&#x27;re always going to have easy short-sighted goals that will justify the risk and make us go downhill&quot;.<p>I do see that Scott is the original poster, and would like to hear the rationalization beyond &quot;we really needed a vacation&quot;.')
