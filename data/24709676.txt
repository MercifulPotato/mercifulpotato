I took the vitamin D for reasons I forgot.<p>There was no time in between taking it and drinking the juice. It was what I drank most of the day.<p>One can take a few of these drops <i>(liquid, in case that&#x27;s unclear)</i> every day, but that makes my stomach gas up massively for some reason.<p>One can take them once a week, too, but then he had to take the whole weekly dosage at once. Apparently it doesn&#x27;t matter. I don&#x27;t remember how much it was, but I&#x27;m talking about one or two dozen water droplets here. I&#x27;m sorry, I don&#x27;t know how to express this any better.<p>The headache started maybe two hours later.')
