And hardly any of them were released as retail products; they were mostly OEM-only drives. All of those drives went out of production 3-4 years before the first host devices that <i>require</i> NVMe and can&#x27;t work with AHCI started to show up: USB to NVMe bridge chips for external enclosures. So if you haven&#x27;t encountered an AHCI M.2 SSD yet, you probably never will and knowing about them is just an obscure historical curiosity.')
