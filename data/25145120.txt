Normal thermal radiation is only random in the sense that it&#x27;s very hard to compute all the photons given the initial states of all the electrons etc, but it&#x27;s possible in principle. Does black hole have an internal state, that depends on the states of all the particles that fell into it? If so, the emanating radiation can be computed from that internal state, so information is preserved.')
