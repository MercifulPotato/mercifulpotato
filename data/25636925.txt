It was very important to make sure the new hire had a place to sit, a phone, and a computer as soon as they arrived.  Meeting your new manager (as scheduled) is extremely important to a new hire.  If the manager doesn&#x27;t show, it makes a bad first impression on the new employee.<p>All of that being said, I will now relate that I <i>NEVER</i> attended the new hire orientation meeting at that company.  I was on business travel and I never rescheduled it.  It did not seem to matter much for me though as I stayed there for most of my career (35 years).')
