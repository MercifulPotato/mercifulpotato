But you claim Trump&#x27;s followers should not be subject to an unfair caricature. Why not? Trump came out as a racist in 2011, and the last five years have been a horror show. They&#x27;ve had years to self-correct. There are no positive ways left to be a Trump supporter.<p>Rural America used to be honest, hard-working, and moral. Now it&#x27;s dishonest, lazy, and immoral. This is Trump&#x27;s base. It&#x27;s not their fault, but we should view them in mostly negative terms, just as we do with Islamic extremists in Europe (the only analog I can think of).<p>Yes, I agree that progressive activists have too much influence given their small numbers. But it doesn&#x27;t make sense for Republicans to complain about progressive activists because they have opted out of mainstream society. First alt news, then alt morality, and now alt reality.')
