If I lost $100,000 to something like this and it took a few years to resolve, I would expect to get back $100,000, not some other form of currency that was worth $100,000 at the time. What I&#x27;m saying is that MtGox can&#x27;t claim they&#x27;re making people &quot;whole&quot; from their losses by giving them what their money was worth at the time. Plenty of those people would have held on to the bitcoins and had their full value.<p>Sure, I don&#x27;t expect MtGox to be able to make everyone whole. I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s accurate to say they&#x27;re doing so by giving them their 2014 dollar equivalents.')
