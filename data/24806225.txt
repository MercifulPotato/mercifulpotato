I mean, I can create `libellous_rant.txt` and push it into a public Github repo. Since any file on a pubic github repo is viewable (even without setting it up as a site or whatever feature they have) that feels like they could be viewed as publishing that content. So Github couldn&#x27;t even really force moderation of issues, they would have to moderate every single file in every single repo.<p>But to address the specific concern you brought up, removing Section 230 wouldn&#x27;t prevent someone submitting bugs&#x2F;issues. It would just force the moderation of those posts before they were made publicly viewable. For small projects that receive 2 or 3 bug reports a week I doubt that would be the massive issue everyone here is wringing their hands over. It becomes a problem with scale - like 1000+ issues per day on a project ran by a single developer. But to be fair to my position - could such a developer even deal with that volume of issues even if the default behaviour was to make all posts public?<p>I grant that moderation slows discussion. For example, if you were asleep and someone posted an issue then before you even had a chance to moderate some other non-admin user might answer the question. Maybe we lose that. More likely we find a way to work around it.')
