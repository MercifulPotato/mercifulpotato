So this is a fair point.<p>On the other hand, I would still think that throughout most of French history, and also now with the yellow vests, people rarely went to the streets to protest for &quot;less regulation&quot;, and especially not in order to advocate for the interests of big corporations over those of the state. Yes, there was (is?) a French brand of anarchism, but that was always more of a &quot;property is theft&quot; kind of anarchism, and not a US-style libertarian anarcho-capitalism.<p>So, I think what I rather meant to say is the following:\nMost people in Europe trust the idea of a powerful government (even if they violently disagree with its current incarnation) much more than the idea of equally powerful private corporations.')
