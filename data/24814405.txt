Source: I&#x27;ve owned a Tesla for the past three years and I drove a friend&#x27;s brand new Outback a couple months ago. Autopilot is smooth, easy to use, and lets you basically &quot;monitor&quot; instead of driving for any highway driving. Overtaking a slow car is just tapping the turn signal, and it handles waiting for a window, merging, and accelerating for you.<p>The Subaru version on the other hand is more of a &quot;driver safety&quot; tool that would sometimes stop you from drifting all the way out of lane, but was nowhere near reliable enough to be relied on to steer.')
