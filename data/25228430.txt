Even when you buy stuff in a normal store, if it says 100% recycling paper and has a high price tag, you can assume it doesn&#x27;t involve deforestation and probably not everybody in the supply chain has been screwed over.<p>I won&#x27;t argue that everyone has to buy all things in specialized organic stores because the effort would be unreasonable. But everyone with a high salary should have a bias towards things with the higher price tags from relatable brands&#x2F;producers.')
