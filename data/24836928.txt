C++ is my primary language, and if I replace it -- given that switching a new language is very costly no matter which new language I pick -- I might as well wait for a more revolutionary replacement, that fixes all&#x2F;most problems I have with it, rather than just a few. I don&#x27;t know if Zig is that thing just yet, but it looks more promising -- to me, given my particular taste -- than Rust. But, TBF, I was very excited about Rust at first, so my excitement for Zig might wane as well.')
