Half the time the review pictures don&#x27;t even match the product because the sellers have some scam going on that somehow is OK with Amazon. That Amazon won&#x27;t let me leave a warning to the next user makes Amazon an accomplice in the fraud. I&#x27;ve just started leaving fake 1 star reviews of the product since Amazon loves fake reviews anyway.')
