Or, are you more interested in being able to share tour photos?  Is there a particular feature that is most important for you related to a G Photos alternative?  I think if you post that, perhaps viable suggestions might be offered that would be best for you; instead of some general &quot;try XYZ because it is randomly better!&quot; sort of comment.')
