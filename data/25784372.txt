It was basically for the person who was most accurate at upvoting things that got popular and downvoting the things that did not.<p>The people who won the award the most were the ones that upvoted all the memes and blogspam.<p>My point of this is not to discourage you, but to warn you that the way you&#x27;ve described your platform, the most &quot;profitable&quot; thing to do is not upvote good content but upvote the content you&#x27;ll think the most people will upvote.  So you&#x27;ll need to adjust for that.')
