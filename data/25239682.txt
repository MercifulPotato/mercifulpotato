Item(by='steelframe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606590632, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25236057, text='&gt; Cellularization is an approach we use to isolate the effects of failure within a service, and to keep the components of the service (in this case, the shard-map cache) operating within a previously tested and operated range. This had been under way for the front-end fleet in Kinesis, but unfortunately the work is significant and had not yet been completed.<p>Translation: The eng team knew that they had accumulated tech debt by cutting a corner here in order to meet one of Amazon&#x27;s typical and insane &quot;just get the feature out the door&quot; timelines. Eng warned management about it, and management decided to take the risk and lean on on-call to pull heroics to just fix any issues as they come up. Most of the time yanking a team out of bed in the middle of the night works, so that&#x27;s the modus operandi at Amazon. This time, the actual problem was more fundamental and wasn&#x27;t effectively addressable with middle-of-the-night heroics.<p>Management rolled the &quot;just page everyone and hope they can fix it&quot; dice yet again, as they usually do, and this time they got snake eyes.<p>I guarantee you that the &quot;cellularization&quot; of the front-end fleet wasn&#x27;t actually under way, but the teams were instead completely consumed with whatever the next typical and insane &quot;just get the feature out the door&quot; thing was at AWS. The eng team was never going to get around to cellularizing the front-end fleet because they were given no time or incentive to do so by management. During&#x2F;after this incident, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if management didn&#x27;t yell at the eng team, &quot;Wait, you KNEW this was a problem, and you&#x27;re not done yet?!?&quot; Without recognizing that THEY are the ones actually culpable for failing to prioritize payments on tech debt vs. &quot;new shiny&quot; feature work, which is typical of Amazon product development culture.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with enough former AWS engineers to know what goes on there, and there&#x27;s a really good reason why anybody who CAN move on from AWS will happily walk away from their 3rd- and 4th-year stock vest schedules (when the majority of your <i>promised</i> amount of your sign-on RSUs actually starts to vest) to flee to a company that fosters a healthy product development and engineering culture.<p>(Not to mention that, this time, a whole bunch of peoples&#x27; Thanksgiving plans were preempted with the demand to get a full investation and post-mortem written up, including the public post, ASAP. Was that really necessary? Couldn&#x27;t it have waited until next Wednesday or something?)')
