An example of another comment that <i>does try</i> to address the author&#x27;s issues is the one from arathorn[1] and I hope that one gets upvoted to more visibility.<p>As an example of a concrete point you didn&#x27;t engage with, he worries about the reliability scenario of sending a critical message such as <i>&quot;my car broke down&quot;</i>.<p>You cite a link of XMPP servers.  But here&#x27;s another list of servers where many are colored pink (they&#x27;re no longer online):  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jabberes.org&#x2F;servers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jabberes.org&#x2F;servers&#x2F;</a><p>How does the <i>average</i> person curate your list and avoid <i>choosing</i> a server that will be offline pink in the future?  Non-techie people don&#x27;t want to keep <i>switching</i> servers because somebody quits their hobby of running a XMPP server.<p>That&#x27;s an example of why directing friends &amp; family towards Signal is <i>less of a cognitive burden</i>.<p>The author also mentions ease of voice &amp; video calls on Signal.  The cheerleading &quot;XMPP is alive and kicking&quot; doesn&#x27;t address that either.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25977828" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25977828</a>')
