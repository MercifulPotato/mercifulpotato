I&#x27;m not sure what kind of engineering mentality goes after people who don&#x27;t share their fanboism! On my previous comment on the Elon Musk comment regarding SN8&#x27;s &quot;success&quot;, every single comment I&#x27;ve made got -4 rating! Silencing people with downvoting them massively is the last thing I&#x27;d expect from self-respected engineering minds! Well, I just commented! Feel free to downvote!')
