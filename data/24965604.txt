However, we must acknowledge that &quot;hackers&quot; is not never a homogeneous group, and even more so today. I know some greyhat hackers who do brilliant technical works that rightfully entitie them &quot;hacker&quot;, but they have questionable ethics. Normally I use the generic definition from RFC 1392 as the compromise.<p>&gt; <i>hacker: A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular.</i><p>Using this definition, calling this site &quot;Hacker News&quot; is not exactly accurate, but also not too far-off. I think this website is 40% &quot;Silicon Valley &amp; Startup&quot; News, 40% &quot;Hacker&quot; News, and 20% misc.')
