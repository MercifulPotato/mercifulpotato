Everyone dismissed them. They are the ones asking for a congressional oversight review and being rejected.  They think something is being covered up.  I thought the same way about 9&#x2F;11 when it happened.  It’s one of those believable far-fetched scenarios. But no one is legitimizing it and people are upset about it.  Rather than be human about it we’re laughing them off then acting shocked and surprised when that group acts out.<p>For contrast, black people were claiming police abuse decades ago and the country turned a cheek towards it.

Just like my police encounters in the late 90s.<p>I’m sure at one point in your life you have said “my vote doesn’t matter, the president will be picked regardless of my input”.
