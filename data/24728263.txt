Payment costs <i>could</i> be a tiny fraction of current. It is a tax. I&#x27;m dubious of the who. Stripe is now a big player. They&#x27;re have no interest in turning their $X00bn sector into a $Xbn sector.<p>Incidentally, I think the current economy harbours a lot of sectors that could be orders of magnitude smaller. This has always been a debate in the financial sectors. Today though, there are some (IMO) less ambiguous sectors&#x2F;companies.<p>Does facebook actually need $70bn in revenue to operate facebook. Could it be done on $7bn? To me, it seems like an obvious yes. Quite a glaring inefficiency, IMO.')
