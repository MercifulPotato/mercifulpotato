If you are in the US, you want a Freestyle Libre 2, which costs what you state, with coupons: $35&#x2F;week<p>In the European Union, the Freestyle Libre 3 is available and is far better technology than the Freestyle Libre 2, for a variety of reasons. This also does not require a prescription in Europe. Because I cannot get a Freestyle Libre 3 in Croatia, I order the Freestyle Libre 3 from Abbott Diabetes Care in Germany, without a prescription using a German mail forwarding service (I personally use myGermany). You can ship to the USA using this method. The pricing is also regulated by the German government, so the price of the sensor is reasonable.<p>I actually use 2 glucose sensors in tandem: a Freestyle Libre 3 and a Dexcom G6. The Freestyle Libre technology is better than the Dexcom. It is also, way, way, cheaper.<p>While these articles were for older iterations of the Dexcom\nand Freestyle Libre, they are still very applicable. [1] [2] [3]<p>I use the Dexcom because it connects to my Tandem t:slim x2 insulin pump and it creates an “artificial pancreas”. It automatically manages my blood glucose, with very little effort. I can get a 6.2 or 6.3 A1c with almost no effort, using only the Dexcom G6 sensor (no Freestyle Libre 2|3 sensor use), and I have an profoundly messed up digestive tract, that really should profoundly mess up my blood glucose values.<p>Anyways, the Freestyle Libre updates more frequently (1 minute versus 5 minutes) and responds to changes in blood glucose faster than the Dexcom, so I can take action and dose insulin much faster.<p>With the Freestyle Libre 3, used in tandem with my Tandem t:slim x2 insulin pump using artificial pancreas technology via the Dexcom, my A1c hovers around a 4.9 or 4.8.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;type1tennis.blogspot.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;12&#x2F;how-much-faster-is-freestyle-libre.html?m=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;type1tennis.blogspot.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;12&#x2F;how-much-faster-is-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;type1tennis.blogspot.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;12&#x2F;14-days-with-dexcom-g4-non-ap-and.html?m=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;type1tennis.blogspot.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;12&#x2F;14-days-with-dexcom...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;type1tennis.blogspot.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;02&#x2F;another-view-of-freestyle-libre-vs.html?m=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;type1tennis.blogspot.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;02&#x2F;another-view-of-fre...</a>')
