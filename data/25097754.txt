I used to work for a very simple role which was a very stable product just pure maintenance and FR nothing crazy. Fight after fight with wife, it makes you wonder many things in life. But I try to continue and think that after the pandemic, daycare, personal life will be better. Good luck to everyone and let&#x27;s cheer up. We are alive that&#x27;s the greatest gift')
