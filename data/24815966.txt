But wait, is it? What does this mean? Watch the value at memory location 0xfeedface? But that&#x27;s totally inconsistent with the semantics of &quot;watch my_ptr&quot;. So,<p>gdb) watch * 0xfeedface<p>and once again, no ambiguity over what is going on <i>and</i> consistent syntax.<p>As for you other complaints, I&#x27;ve been programming for about 33 years in C and C++, and I don&#x27;t recall ever needing to use a hexdump inside the debugger or the disassemble command. Which is not to say that they&#x27;re not important for some work, but they are also not important for <i>all</i> work.')
