Knowing the effect exists is useful when learning about a totally new topic: you know you need to hit that first peak, so to speak, to figure out (roughly) the scope of what there is to know. This helps avoid <i>actually</i> having that false confidence early on.<p>One of the most memorable examples of this for me was early on doing calculus in high school. There was a time where I was like &quot;ok, yeah, I understand all the maths stuff now,&quot; then I hit that first peak and suddenly realized &quot;oh wow, I know only a tiny, tiny fraction of what there is to know!&quot; When I later learned about Dunning-Kruger it resonated because it described what I had experienced years earlier and had being thinking about since.')
