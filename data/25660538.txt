That&#x27;s not high revenue for a mom-and-pop online reseller.  Especially given the margins for typical resellers.  Plus, it&#x27;s far more efficient than something like a car wash.  You can have one automated platform that sells through various businesses to keep revenue figures where you need them.  So if you want to stay under $50k&#x2F;y revenue, then split the sales among five various &quot;companies.&quot;<p>With a car was, 1000 washes, at 5m per wash is 84 hours of active operating time.  This creates an upper limit on the amount of money that can reasonably flow through the company, since 84 hours is roughly 3 hours a day of utilization per month.  You might be able to get by with about double that many washes without raising suspicion.  But all it takes is a peak at the company&#x27;s water bill to determine how accurate that figure really is.<p>Plus the operating expenses are much higher, as it requires a specialized building, land, etc.  Whereas the online retail requires a computer and some software.  It&#x27;s easier to move and hide.  There&#x27;s just so many benefits to using online retailers over brick and mortar operations.')
