Item(by='pc86', descendants=None, kids=[25497203], score=None, time=1608565311, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25494874, text='My whole point is <i>most</i> jobs aren&#x27;t in SF or NYC, and <i>most</i> software devs make six figures. Even if the high six-figure jobs are concentrated in those two locations (I&#x27;m sure they are, especially if you expand it to Austin, Chicago, and D.C.), there are going to be plenty of people making six figures in low COL areas. FAANG only accounts for a small percentage of dev jobs (a few tens of thousands at most, out of nearly 4 million devs in the US). Let&#x27;s call it 100k to be super generous, and that they all make above the median. With 3.8 million devs, 1.9 make six figures. 1.8 non-FAANG. NY State has 220k developers so let&#x27;s remove all of them for the sake of argument, even though that&#x27;s going to include the guys in upstate in low COL, and double-count a bunch of FAANG folks. We&#x27;re down to about 1.58 million non-FAANG, non-astronomical-COL living folks at least who are making six figures.')
