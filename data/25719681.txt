I participated in a primary caucus for a small district and was disgusted by the leadership and how the event was run. No one was heard, whatever the moderator wanted was how the vote turned out, regardless of how the group actually voted. All of the leadership was among the most smarmy, slimy people I’ve ever been in a room with.<p>If you want to run for office, not only do you have to spend time with these narcissistic, power drunk politicians at the local level, you have to get them to support you.<p>This meeting was on the extreme local level for a community of maybe 35k people. I can’t even imagine what the county level, or national level would be like.<p>Maybe others have had a better experience, but this disillusioned me from any participation in politics and politicians in general.')
