And then people nod and are like, &quot;yeah, that vaguely reminds me of a folksy saying, it must be credible.&quot;<p>The saying is &quot;one bad apple spoils the barrel&quot;, and is stressing how much of a problem it is for there to be individual deviance, and how we must be super vigilant for it and throw it the heck out.  If we&#x27;re to believe that, and we&#x27;re to believe there have been &quot;a few bad apples&quot; for some time, we should expect that the whole barrel is spoiled and would be quite right to be cynics.<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily agree, and I certainly don&#x27;t think that folk wisdom is the best way of making decisions... but it&#x27;s probably better than the uncritical opposite!')
