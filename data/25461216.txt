The time to cook and prepare is quite similar to Chipotle as well, especially if you go to Chipotle instead of delivery.<p>Rice, beans, salsa, lettuce, cheese, chicken. Everything that goes into a burrito&#x2F;bowl is quite cheap. You could prepare everything in half an hour and then make bowls at the same speed Chipotle does just pulling containers out of the fridge.')
