The vast majority of functions I write are best executed synchronously, the remainder is usually composed of logic wrapping heavy computations which can be executed in parallel or logic surrounding I&#x2F;O which can be executed concurrently.<p>An async system which poisons the rest of my code to force async usage doesn&#x27;t seem like it will scale to code leveraging multiple libraries and will likely fail at the first lib where the author decided not to bother.  The beauty of coroutines in go and Java(soon) is that the async functionality remains local to the code that can make use of it - everyone else just sees a thread-like API.')
