This feels perhaps tenable for VC backed corps but for anyone bootstrapped, this is a long, long road.<p>I&#x27;m not remotely convinced that these steps feed into each other in a more pragmatic way than... I guess any other way? Couldn&#x27;t you start with enterprise sales and move backwards, releasing your stuff as OSS once you&#x27;re running a stable business?<p>The thesis seems to be that without community and a proven track record, you can&#x27;t make money organically, which is patently false and proven by hundreds of businesses that don&#x27;t have OSS&#x2F;communities. Also, SaaS seems tangential to Enterprise sales in many cases, they&#x27;re often times different segments (i.e. I won&#x27;t consider your SaaS since I must be on-prem) -- if you only serve one segment, you&#x27;re only missing out on the other segment, not cannibalizing? This is all hand-wavey of course, but I posit that this is <i>a</i> way to <i>maybe</i> build an open source business, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s a solid, proven recipe by any means.<p>Maybe once Ockam knocks it out of the park in their IPO we can look back on this with greater confidence.')
