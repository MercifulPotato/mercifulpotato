I personally agree that &quot;the vast majority&quot; of software engineering does not require deep knowledge of computer science, and I also believe there are plenty of &quot;real world&quot; problems that absolutely do require computer science. In no way does my agreement with the first statement commit me to disagreeing with the second statement.<p>You say caymanjim&#x27;s comment &quot;reflects a common meme&quot; that real world work &quot;doesn&#x27;t involve the academic nonsense you learn in school&quot; Why? It seems like you swapped out his argument with something different, by claiming one &quot;reflects&quot; the other. Sounds like &quot;We got trouble, with a capital T, and that rhymes with P, and that stands for Pool&quot;. Stating that most software engineering work doesn&#x27;t require CS theory doesn&#x27;t commit anyone to claiming that it never relates to real world work. Furthermore, I think you can claim that theory isn&#x27;t used in the vast majority of real world work without dismissing that theory as &quot;nonsense&quot; - a word you supplied here that wasn&#x27;t part of the OPs comment.<p>Now - I will agree with you that many people say this stuff, and you may very well have diagnosed why. But you refuted something you recall other people saying, not what caymanjim said.')
