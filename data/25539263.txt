It is time and money wasted if you are a SMB. Anything else, including taking a walk is better for your business than going into SEO optimization.<p>Your clients are people who buy your stuff. Search engine robot is not your client. After years of working with SEO it becomes clear for me, if you satisfy a robot, you don&#x27;t satisfy your client. These are two different things.<p>The bright side is that when you will serve your clients, robots will catch up eventually. But it is search engine problem not something you should spend time on.<p>There is no magic bullet method to rank high. No special hack you can use. Everything you will read about SEO is smokes and mirrors. If you have million dollar company and did everything else right - sure, you can throw hundreds thousands dollars into SEO and pray search engine devs won&#x27;t change their minds.<p>But as a SMB company, counting each dollar, just leave it. You won&#x27;t win over search engines and people with bulk of money.<p>Spend your time and effort on clients. It is the only way to spend it right. If search engine will change mind - so be it. You won&#x27;t be dependant on it. And your clients will come to you because they love your product, it is stronger than being number one in a twisted search ranking.')
