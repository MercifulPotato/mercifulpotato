The even bigger problem, climate change, suffers from the same problem. There is very loud propaganda out, especially on social media, which tries to deny the existance, throws doubt at attempts to limit it. Because it is spread by certain political forces, and this is an international problem. One which we have to address quickly, both now for the pandemic and long term (as in the next years) the climate change.<p>I am especially baffled by the anti-vaccination movement, as I grew up in a world where smallpox and polio had been basically erradicated due to vaccinations as were most of the typical childhood diseases. But where all the victims of those diseases were not forgotten yet. There was no doubt whatever to be vaccinated, I still can remember the polio vaccinations I got in school. And those were ridiculously risky compared to a modern Covid-19 vaccination. But overall the vaccinations saved so many more people than they harmed.<p>One can only hope that the next months will bring a change. On the one side, there will still be many deaths due to Covid-19, as the death spike follows 4-8 weeks after the infection count spike. On the other side, in two months the effect of the vaccinations should become very visible.')
