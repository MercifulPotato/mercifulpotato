Having an EU citizenship allows you to live and spend an unlimited amount of time in any EU member state vs 90 days out of every 180 days for a normal American so if he wants to retire to a beach in Spain for 5 months at a time he can&#x27;t currently do so but this will allow him to<p>2. It gives him visa free travel to various parts of the world that he might not otherwise have, most notably Russia.  If you&#x27;re in Eric&#x27;s position and say you want to do some business and investing in Russia the hassles related to travel might not be worth it for you and it makes it so much easier if you&#x27;ve got a second passport that allows you to go without issue<p>3. As mentioned you&#x27;re setting up your family for a future with more options<p>4. You&#x27;re creating a back up plan for yourself')
