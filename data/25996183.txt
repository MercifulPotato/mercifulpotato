I am a (very happy) user of Stadia. If you haven&#x27;t tried it, you really should...it&#x27;s an amazing piece of tech. I can find myself with 20-30 minutes worth of downtime during the day, fire up Cyberpunk 2077 or Hitman or Assassin&#x27;s Creed in moments from my browser <i>on a macbook</i> and play at high settings with no noticeable lag.<p>There&#x27;s zero chance I&#x27;m ever going to give Google any support in trying to take over the gaming industry. The best thing they can do is kill Stadia, considering how anti-consumer it is.<p>&gt; The company plans to begin offering its Stadia tech to publishers, opening up the possibility for Stadia to become the streaming tech for other video game companies.<p>This alone scares the fuck out of me.')
