At least as decent as all the C based work is which lacks any decent unit-tests to make sure it keeps working (the linux kernel is not better).<p>The problem with those embedded solutions is often not lwip but that the integration and requirements between lwip, the OS and it&#x27;s task system (e.g. FreeRTOS), and the actual hardware is not properly understood. Which can e.g. lead to function calls being made from the wrong context - which could work in the beginning - might lead to weird errors later on.<p>For this reason I would also recommend people who want to build connected devices to build on top of a more mature and streamlined stack - like the Linux TCP&#x2F;IP stack plus associated drivers.')
