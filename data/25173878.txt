Relative standing is irrelevant.<p>Further, having 10 times more income (or wealth) than subsistence farmer in sub-Saharan Africa is meaningless if your cost of living is 1000 times higher than that of a subsistence farmer in sub-Saharan Africa. Poor Americans aren&#x27;t paying sub-Saharan African prices; they&#x27;re paying American prices, and that means their income does not go very far.')
