Current nonlinear\nalternatives include predicate invention (Muggleton and Buntine, 1988) and latent\nvariable discovery in graphical models (Elidan et al., 2000).<p>Hah! Fancy seeing that here! Predicate invention is a main line of my PhD\nresearch.<p>Briefly, predicate invention is the ability of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)\nsystems to learn their own inductive bias. It is in a sense similar to feature\nlearning or learning-to-learn. ILP systems learn logic programs from examples\nusually by searching the space of programs defined by a set of sub-programs,\ncalled the background knowledge (BK), and a language bias that determines the\nstructure of learned programs. Predicate invention then means learning new BK\nand language bias to change the program search space while searching it.<p>The reference in Domingo&#x27;s article is the first description of the concept which\nwas for a long time more theoretical than practical: ILP approaches could only\nperform a limited form of predicate invention, e.g. could only invent BK programs\nof fixed structure or could not invent recursive programs etc. Things changed in\n2013 with a new approach, Meta-Interpretive Learning (MIL). MIL systems are for\nthe first time capable of unconstrained predicate invention, including the\ninvention of mutually recursive programs. Full discolosure: my PhD research is\non MIL.<p>Here are some more recent references on predicate invention in MIL:<p>Meta-interpretive learning of higher-order dyadic datalog: Predicate invention\nrevisited (IJCAI 2013):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ijcai.org&#x2F;Proceedings&#x2F;13&#x2F;Papers&#x2F;231.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ijcai.org&#x2F;Proceedings&#x2F;13&#x2F;Papers&#x2F;231.pdf</a><p>Bias reformulation for one-shot function induction (ECAI 2014):<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.doc.ic.ac.uk&#x2F;~shm&#x2F;Papers&#x2F;metabias.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.doc.ic.ac.uk&#x2F;~shm&#x2F;Papers&#x2F;metabias.pdf</a><p>Logical minimisation of meta-rules within meta-interpretive learning (ICLP\n2015):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.doc.ic.ac.uk&#x2F;~shm&#x2F;Papers&#x2F;minmeta.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.doc.ic.ac.uk&#x2F;~shm&#x2F;Papers&#x2F;minmeta.pdf</a><p>Like I say this is my field of study and as you can probably tell I&#x27;m very\nexcited about it so I&#x27;m happy to answer questions- email in my profile.')
