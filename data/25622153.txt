Specifically I mean if you have no REPL and maybe a long compile time you’re forced to put a little more thinking and planning in up front if you don’t want to waste your time. You might be more meticulous in catching bugs. Whereas with a REPL you can throw stuff at the wall. If something breaks you can just tweak variables and structure in real time till it starts working.<p>That’s just one characterization I came up with off-hand and it may be inaccurate. I’m mostly trying to paint a picture where tools affect the thinking of the programmer.<p>What are people’s thoughts on this? Does using a REPL or not using a REPL change your thinking and how so?')
