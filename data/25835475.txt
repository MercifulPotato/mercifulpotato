It’s that the little things that made life interesting are missing (occasional dinner at a restaurant, concerts, sports, going to my gym).  So life has turned super monotonous and dull, so work and everything else suffers.  It also doesn’t help that there’s just a level of constant ambient misery and sadness if you interact with anyone since everyone’s in a similar place.<p>Honestly, it’s annoying but I don’t worry too much.  Everyone is in the weird place now, and it’s not forever, so I don’t beat myself up if my productivity is slightly down or if I don’t feel super perky.')
