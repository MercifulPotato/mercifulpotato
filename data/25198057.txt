This makes it easier to find what you&#x27;re looking for in somebody else&#x27;s policy document and to verify they ticked all the boxes. If they&#x27;ve got a rule about Certificate Revocation for example that&#x27;ll go in section 4.9.<p>So there&#x27;s going to be a section 3 about &quot;Identification and Authentication&quot; and it&#x27;s going to have a subsection 3.2 &quot;Initial Identity Validation&quot; and that&#x27;s going to have a sub-subsection 3.2.2 about how we figure out who this actually is we&#x27;re talking to, and so these sections will be further divided. 3.2.2.4.x is the &quot;Ten Blessed Methods&quot; (these days there are rather more than ten) for how we validate DNS names in the Web PKI).')
