But, for most values of Bigcorp that anyone could name, there&#x27;s clear evidence of ongoing unethical behavior.<p>&gt;If you work for Bigcorp and act to help them behave more ethically, are you making more of a difference than you would elsewhere?<p>Definitely, and I would support anyone who is doing so. But this isn&#x27;t easy, and the typical software engineer plugging away is almost certainly not doing this. It takes a lot of hubris to presume that you, an engineer worth .00075% of your employer&#x27;s revenue, can exert the necessary influence to cause substantive changes in unethical behavior. Perhaps if megacorp tech workers collectivized, it would be more realistic.')
