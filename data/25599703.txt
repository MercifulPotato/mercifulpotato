Cloud services have lost customer data before, but it&#x27;s more likely that you&#x27;ll lose access to your account with the cloud service. Many people have lost access to their Google accounts, for example.<p>&gt; Are there any other better solutions to store photos safely ?<p>There is no single fool-proof thing you can do. This is an exercise in risk mitigation.<p>It&#x27;s not terribly likely that you&#x27;ll lose access to your Google account, but if you do, you&#x27;ll lose everything off this is your only backup.<p>If you only have your photo library stored on one hard drive, it&#x27;s <i>likely</i> that the hard drive won&#x27;t be readable after 8-10 years (depending on luck and wear).<p>The best solution is to have multiple copies of everything, in multiple places.
