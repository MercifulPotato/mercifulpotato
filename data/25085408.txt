These things happen, but they&#x27;re so rare that it&#x27;s silly to go through your life in constant fear.<p><i>besides being incredibly selfish</i><p>It is not selfish to consider whether it&#x27;s possible to protect vulnerable people without demanding that everyone give up their social lives, children&#x27;s education, and jobs for a year.<p><i>just like the &quot;kids can&#x27;t get or spread covid&quot; MYTH that people have been grasping to for dear life in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary</i><p>What evidence? Schools haven&#x27;t been significant drivers of infection or deaths anywhere in the world. Yes, the risk is not literally zero, but if that&#x27;s your criterion then you&#x27;d never leave your bedroom.<p><i>this &quot;only old people die of it&quot; myth needs to be squashed</i><p>If everyone had the risk factor of a healthy 30 year old (say, 1 in 10,000 chance of death and 1 in 2500 chance of serious complications), would you still support shutting everything down?')
