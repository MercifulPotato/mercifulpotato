It&#x27;s still not an ideal scenario, because those deaths could be <i>further</i> reduced under the threat of real consequences.  But by and large, it&#x27;d still be better than what we have today.<p>If they&#x27;re killing people during testing of experimental tech that hasn&#x27;t been approved for general use (like the Uber case you mentioned), they need to be smacked down hard. If they&#x27;re killing people at a higher rate than human drivers, they should not be approved for general use in the first place.  If they&#x27;re approved, but release an update that ends up killing more people, they again need to be smacked down hard, with the update immediately reverted.')
