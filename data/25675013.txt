I use it to power a second 4K monitor with my M1 MacBook Air running lid-closed. I have a 1080p gaming monitor as my primary connected to a Elgato dock via DisplayPort.<p>DisplayLink is definitely suboptimial, but it&#x27;s the only option. There is noticable input lag (my guess is around 100ms) that makes mouse and keyboard input feel sluggish. Showing a moving image on the screen pegs the DisplayLink Manager process to 100% of one core while it&#x27;s playing. DisplayLink does not currently support rotation on Big Sur, though it probably will in the future. However, the image itself is pixel-perfect, so it&#x27;s fine for secondary apps like chat or monitoring.')
