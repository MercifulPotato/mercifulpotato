For example, Bash 4.0 to Bash 5.0 was only 123 commits over 8 years.  But, Bash is a absolutely a critical project (ask any org about how much work they had to do when affected by <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shellshock_(software_bug)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shellshock_(software_bug)</a> ).<p>* A measure of criticality should understand _as many of the various forms of dependence on software_ that may occur that it can.  Dependencies can take many forms, such as:<p>a package manager resolving a dependency<p>a user purchasing a mobile phone with software pre-installed<p>a user visiting a website (react&#x2F;jquery&#x2F;etc)<p>etc.<p>* Criticality should understand if, how, and when dependencies are updated.  For example, fixing a bug in Chrome and distributing that fix to 80% of users in 1 week is feasible.  Fixing a bug in Bash and distributing that fix to 80% of users in 1 week is not so feasible.')
