Item(by='that_guy_iain', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607849577, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25400088, text='&gt; But you did say it would be &quot;useless&quot; if there were different strains and now you are saying &quot;there are multiple strains&quot;.<p>Yea... That&#x27;s what the experts are saying, you know the scientists. Are we not to believe them now? And the experts have said if it mutates alot that a vaccine could only ve good againist a certain amount for a certain amount of time. You see a vaccine could work againist strain 1-8 but then stop working on strain 9+.<p>&gt; I haven&#x27;t seen anything about the current vaccines not being effective to what is already out there. If that is true then what you are saying is wrong, because the fact that the vaccines can treat what is now filling up hospitals and killing thousands per day means they are the opposite of useless and in fact one of the most valuable things in existence right now.<p>Overall, this paragraph is moot because you failed to understand my original point, which I&#x27;ll explain further down when responding to another line. But the fact you haven&#x27;t heard anything about how a brand new vaccine just being rolled out this week. And I believe there were thoughts it wouldn&#x27;t work againist the mink strain that Denmark had to cull it&#x27;s entire mink population to stop.<p>&gt; Even the regular flu shot was recommended as being more important this year so that there would be less spread and less to deal with.<p>Who said that? Last I read, they were expecting the flu to be pretty much non exsistant this year due to all the measures to stop corona stopping the flu. They seen this in the south and expect it to be true for the north.<p>&gt; No, that isn&#x27;t what you said. That might be what you are trying to claim now that you said something ridiculous.<p>Ok... I said something ridiculous? I repeated something the experts said. The flu vaccine is needed to be done every year, why? Because the virus mutates so much that it&#x27;s only good for one year and then useless.<p>My original comment was merely there was another option. It didn&#x27;t advocate for anything, didn&#x27;t state any opinion, etc. You seemed to misunderstand a rather simple thing and on a massive scale.<p>You seem uninformed on this matter. The experts have been saying for a while, even if we get a vaccine (which we have) it may not to stop it as it may only work for a short period of time. And the fact they won&#x27;t be able to vaccinate everyone in a timely fashion due to production limits, means corona could be around for decades.<p>And if you&#x27;re going to carry on saying I said something come back with the quotes or please keep your thoughts to yourself.')
