These similar &quot;fan like&quot; group attachments branch out into so many aspects of American life.<p>It&#x27;s one side vs. the other. We&#x27;re better they&#x27;re worse. One side must be good, one side must be bad. Like interviewing an Arsenal fan and a Chelsea fan about each other.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t even know if these groups could possibly put aside their differences to see themselves as all Americans. It seems like everyone is in the mindset of &quot;I&#x27;m Team A&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Team B&quot;, etc. rather than all part of the same whole.')
