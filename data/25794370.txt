BLS has classified all expenditure items into more than 200 categories, arranged into eight major groups (food and beverages, *housing*, apparel, transportation, medical care, recreation, education and communication, and other goods and services).&quot; [1]<p>Furthermore, it includes housing expenses for <i>owner-occupied housing</i> as follows:  &quot;The [owners&#x27; equivalent rent] index is designed to measure the change in the rental value of owner occupied housing change.  In essence, OER measures the changes in the amount a homeowner would pay to rent, or would earn from renting, <i>his or her home in a competitive market</i>.&quot; [see p. 107 of [2]]<p>As the BLS notes, the primary service provided by houses is to shelter the inhabitants.  The house itself may be held as an investment.  See [3]<p>So the CPI explicitly captures the cost of providing shelter, though it excludes the investment value of the property.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;cpi&#x2F;questions-and-answers.htm#:~:text=BLS%20has%20classified%20all%20expenditure,and%20other%20goods%20and%20services" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;cpi&#x2F;questions-and-answers.htm#:~:text=BL...</a>).<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;opub&#x2F;hom&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;cpi-20180214.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;opub&#x2F;hom&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;cpi-20180214.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;cpi&#x2F;factsheets&#x2F;owners-equivalent-rent-and-rent.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;cpi&#x2F;factsheets&#x2F;owners-equivalent-rent-an...</a>')
