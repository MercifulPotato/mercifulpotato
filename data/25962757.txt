What do you expect when you&#x27;ve abdicated the right to sue the company for something you think is illegal or injurious? It&#x27;s supposed to be the bastion of last resort, to keep everyone honest. When the safety net of the legal system is gone (e.g., forced arbitration) -- or only used for one side, there&#x27;s nothing to restrain these humungous companies which are running the world now. We&#x27;re a long way past needing a legal reset on &quot;terms of service.&quot;')
