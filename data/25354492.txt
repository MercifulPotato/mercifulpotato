I do not fully understand the browser rendering process (someone who does please chime in), but what I gather about how this is works is:<p>- the content-type of the page is &quot;text&#x2F;html&quot;, so the browser is trying to render html<p>- there is no special meaning of the #render key to the browser (again the browser doesn&#x27;t know this is json)<p>- browsers are very fault tolerant so they&#x27;ll just skip over your document till they find pieces of html<p>- the JS made by the author is the part that parses the json as json, and it uses the #render key as its metadata section<p>You can try opening a file like this to test for yourself to get a sense of just the browser-parsing part, test.html:<p><pre><code>    {\n        &quot;test&quot;: &quot;hello&quot;,\n        &quot;myHtml&quot;: &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;meta charset=utf-8&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;&lt;&#x2F;html&gt;&quot;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI do however get this warning in FireFox so perhaps this is pretty fragile:<p>&gt; The character encoding declaration of the HTML document was not found when prescanning the first 1024 bytes of the file. When viewed in a differently-configured browser, this page will reload automatically. The encoding declaration needs to be moved to be within the first 1024 bytes of the file.<p>I&#x27;m guessing differently-configured means not in quirks mode? Does quirks mode just make the browser extra fault tolerant?')
