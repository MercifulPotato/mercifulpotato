I&#x27;ve never met an end user who, when presented with something they want to do--like change the Safari icon to a picture of a dog--who is like &quot;I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not allowed to do that because X&quot;... they pretty much <i>couldn&#x27;t possibly</i> say that as they aren&#x27;t in a position to understand X. It is only some vocal minority of admittedly-informed software developers attempting to analyze the tradeoffs of how all this stuff works that are making that decision, and to be a bit frank about it, it just seems like they (you) are either being a bit snooty about the feature in question (being able to have a photo of something you care deeply about as your wallpaper can bring someone immense joy, and to just discount that feels weird) or a bit unimaginative (as there are just so many things you could get: in the jailbreak community we would routinely take suggestions and throw something together for small handfuls of people because it brought us and them joy to do so) with respect to &quot;what they are losing&quot; :&#x2F;. Even if you can&#x27;t just can&#x27;t fathom anyone like yourself benefiting, how about this: we had a blind high school student get involved in jailbreaking <i>as a developer</i> who then built a bunch of software to make his ability to live his life more practical... should we just say that people with niche problems can only get them solved if they are important enough to hit Apple&#x27;s radar, because no one is ever allowed to solve problems for themselves &quot;for their own good&quot;? :&#x2F;')
