I was asymptomatic. I have an autoimmune disease. I do not want the vaccine for myself. Does the vaccine actually stop the spreading of COVID-19? Because according to other posts, we do not know that it does, all we know is that people would take it for their own safety, but do not know if it actually stops transmission, in which case we are just talking about whether or not I decide to risk my own health. I would risk it, considering I have been asymptomatic positive before, and I do not know what this vaccine would do to me given that I have an autoimmune disease. The vaccine seems much riskier to me, than COVID-19. That, plus I barely leave the house.')
