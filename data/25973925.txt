The &quot;Wayland Way&quot; is for the compoisitor to relay information (monitor-reported scale, etc) to the client, and have the client figure out how to scale itself correctly.<p>Unfortunately this means that these HiDPI bugs have to be fixed over and over in myriad apps and toolkits, and software (cough cough chromium) that is so complicated that it cannot use a toolkit.<p>Some compositors like sway will let you do in-compositor scaling, but this is admittedly a kludge: it produces blurry scaled-up output instead of rendering at the right resolution in the first place.  The sway authors acknowledge this; the feature is only there as a &quot;better than nothing&quot; workaround.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25973875" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25973875</a>')
