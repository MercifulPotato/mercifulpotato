Most people running a small business or self-employed relate to it, and it&#x27;s indeed a &quot;set and forget&quot; thing, mainly because you just do what the accountant tells you.<p>In that world, tax efficiency is largely seen as the right thing to do and sensible (&quot;good&quot;).<p>And when you scale that up, the end result looks like international corporate tax avoidance (&quot;bad&quot;).<p>That&#x27;s not at all the same as saying the small business version <i>is</i> tax avoidance of the &quot;bad&quot; kind.<p>It&#x27;s saying that one thing <i>follows</i> from another, not that they are the same thing.<p>And so we can&#x27;t solve international corporate tax avoidance by a simple expedient of trying to &quot;ban&quot; or &quot;shame&quot; it, because there isn&#x27;t any clear boundary at which sensible, approved, &quot;good&quot; tax efficiency turns into shameworthy &quot;bad&quot; avoidance.<p>And so, to solve it, we need to use a different method, and I advocated such a method.')
