We, the public (including people like Biden, and allies of USA) were deceived by the Bush government and its lackeys (Cheney, Rumsfeld, etc) concerning WMDs in Iraq. That not only deceived the American public; the deception included Congress as well. My government (The Netherlands) got lied to as well about WMDs. We ended up with our right-wing government supporting the war in Iraq politically, but not military. I remember protesting against this war, on the streets in Amsterdam. Something I hardly ever did in my life, btw.<p>For reference, see the movie Vice (2018) which is basically a third party account on Dick Cheney&#x27;s biography. Scooter Libby, who got sentenced due to Plamegate due to leaking Plame&#x27;s name while she was an active CIA asset on foreign ground (a retaliation move), as well. He got his sentence commuted by Bush and got fully pardoned by Trump. Why? I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s a valid justification. Nepotism 101.<p>Btw, while Obama did a fair amount of drone strikes, was vigilant on leaks, and probably knew all about NSA&#x27;s ops before Snowden leaked, he did inherit a mess from Bush. After Obama, Trump did an ample amount of drone strikes (tho we need to put both into context as drone strikes are a new technology), and while Trump did not start a war in the traditional sense he escalated enough foreign relations including NATO and other treaties like WTO, Middle East (ISIS being partly a mess USA made with Iraq invasion), China (trade conflict), Iran (killing of Suleimani). Trump was a nationalist, and an egocentric one at that, who did not follow conventional scientific consensus on e.g. climate change. I&#x27;m all for freedom and opinion, but denying an important truth which is going to affect all of humanity if we don&#x27;t act Soon (tm), is dangerous. Especially for people like me who live under the sea level (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). I&#x27;m so utterly relieved that Trump is gone. Senate isn&#x27;t decided yet AFAIK, but I am not anti Republican by definition, and I believe dialogue is the way forward. Dialogue based on rationalization, facts, and science though; ie. <i>not</i> lies, denial, deception.')
