Every single company in the US buys stuff from companies from foreign countries who promise to deliver things under contract. This is not an Apple owned company, or an Apple problem, or a U.S. problem, but a problem at a company in India (I believe owned by someone in Taiwan). Do you know who made the shirt you are wearing, the product you just bought from Amazon, who picked the grapes you have in your kitchen and who is reading your prescriptions, or how your company&#x27;s security software supplier builds their software? No? Then you are no different than Apple, who at least tries to keep up with 1000&#x27;s of suppliers and their treatment of employees. And sometimes those companies are determined to screw their employees over and cover it up. It happens in farmer&#x27;s fields, giant suppliers or government agencies. Having fake outrage over someone else&#x27;s occasional failure but ignoring your own. Are you eating food picked by some exploited farmhand? Wearing a cheap shirt made by a prisoner in some labor camp? Ordering some cheap crap on Amazon stolen from a real business? But sure blame Apple for missing the boat.')
