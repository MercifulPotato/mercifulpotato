This works quite well to be honest. They can send a whole bunch of notifications (I see them every time I log in) but I&#x27;m not bothered by them. I do this because I agree with you that LinkedIn is still the most helpful tool for job hunting or recruiting, and I use it for such purposes. Other than that, I don&#x27;t want it to notify me of anything.')
