Item(by='CPLX', descendants=None, kids=[25304223], score=None, time=1607097622, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25303608, text='&gt; It&#x27;s just a bizarre primary school understanding or morality where there&#x27;s a group of &quot;Good&quot; people and &quot;Bad&quot; people.<p>I think it&#x27;s even more simple than that. It&#x27;s a failure to realize that everyone is the plucky hero doing things with good intentions in their story about themselves, and that others don&#x27;t see him as he sees himself.<p>So despite there being a world where the society is becoming increasingly unequal, where the average American struggles to feel financial security and those born without access to education or the right geography (or, perhaps, who just aren&#x27;t as bright or ambitious) are merciless casualties of a &quot;meritocracy&quot; that excludes them, PG feels like he can&#x27;t be the bad guy because he can&#x27;t pinpoint any specific situation where he did something &quot;wrong&quot;.<p>His only fault, perhaps, is being a massive beneficiary of a system that is profoundly and deeply unfair and getting more that way every day, and he&#x27;s not able to see that as something he&#x27;s at fault for.<p>So I have some sense of empathy and understanding for his perspective. But I think he would benefit greatly from really trying to dig into understanding what it might be like not to share his perspective and vantage point, as well as to do a better job understanding how different the world is for people now than it was in the early 1980&#x27;s when he began his professional life.')
