Item(by='euske', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607955743, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25417210, text='&gt; Are there any persons who can work, say, 8+ hours? I mean, really work, not be at office.<p>The only time I worked continuously for 8 straight hours is when I participated a game jam (Ludum Dare). I did it several times in my life, but boy, is that exhausting. After finishing the good 48 hours, you don&#x27;t even want to think anything computer related. All I wanted were flowers and baths and some yummys! A 72-hour jam was even more extreme and I actually ran out the steam in the middle. I&#x27;ve never run a real marathon or some sort, but I wonder if the experience is similar to those.')
