I&#x27;ll say what I said last time:<p>If many people are substantially harmed by wasting their time and energy on distractions, then those who waste less time will outcompete them. Whether the mechanism is common wisdom analogous to &quot;don&#x27;t drink alone or before the evening&quot;, parents teaching their kids in certain ways, religions that consider much &quot;wasteful&quot; entertainment to be sinful, or genes that contribute to conditions perhaps resembling autism where colorful flashy video registers as annoying or even painful, the problem seems likely to create its own solutions.<p>One of the premises of &quot;Brave New World&quot; is that all children are raised by the State, and are forcibly (a) oxygen-deprived in the womb to limit their intelligence and (b) subjected throughout childhood to indoctrination <i>and hypnotherapy</i> to make them say &quot;I&#x27;m happy and content with my life, and my only desire is to chase consumer goods&quot;. I&#x27;m not sure why so many people seem to forget this.')
