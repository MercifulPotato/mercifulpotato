Really just annoyances. The biggest issue that I have with it, is that it is <i>huge</i>, and takes forever to download and install.<p>Swift documentation is pretty sparse, but a fairly robust &quot;tribal knowledge&quot; base is developing. StackOverflow is not bad. Most answers I see have at least &quot;Swift 3&quot; variants, which is really the line of demarcation. It usually takes me thirty seconds to tweak for language changes. Xcode is fairly helpful, there.<p>A lot of the &quot;moving targets&quot; in Swift are the system framework SDKs and APIs. The language is morphing, but mostly in less-frequented corners.')
