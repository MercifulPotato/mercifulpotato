Their response is like a streaming service that responds to a DMCA takedown by saying they plan on making it possible to comply sooner or later rather than immediately yanking the content.<p>I&#x27;m inclined to think the Parler mgt preferred this outcome, where they get to play victim, to actually moderating content and making their users angry.')
