Signal uses SGX specifically so that they can store metadata without exposing it to the server. Matrix’s contact discovery spec doesn’t.<p>My initial question, earlier up the chain, was in regards to this dilemma: Signal didn’t upload contact metadata to their servers for years, until they implemented SGX to allow them to do so securely. By contrast, every other messaging platform (Matrix included) just wrote up a spec for contact metadata storage that doesn’t address protections from the server operator.<p>We’ve got back and forth about the upsides of federation and open source clients and such, but as I’ve tried to point out, none of that is relevant to the actual question I asked, or the upstream point in the thread: that Signal’s spec didn’t include contact uploads at all until there was a way they could store them securely, and other message platforms just skipped straight to storing them.')
