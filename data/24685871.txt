What&#x27;s the point of having so many? It doesn&#x27;t provide any extra semantic meaning over just having general &quot;herds&quot; or &quot;groups&quot;, since you mostly use the animal name anyway (ie. everyone will say &quot;a murder of crows&quot; instead of just &quot;a murder&quot; to avoid confusion).<p>I realise that language is mostly not designed and that there is no specific reason, just like gramatical gender is useless for non-gendered things and still many languages have it. but I&#x27;m curious about the historical path that led to that differentiation')
