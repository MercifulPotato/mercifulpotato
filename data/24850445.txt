Wouldn&#x27;t they if Facebook was biasing content for the right?<p>No, because Facebook biases the content any given individual sees toward things that fit in better with that person&#x27;s beliefs. What you can infer about their biasing from what you personally see doesn&#x27;t tell much if anything about their biasing other people see, or whether or not Facebook is biased as a whole in any particular way.<p>When it comes to liberal vs. conservative biasing, there is also a problem from squeezing an array of behaviors and beliefs down to just those two labels.<p>I remember reading an article that tried to show Twitter was massively biased against conservatives. The author found a bunch of accounts that were banned, then took the subset of those for which he could infer from their tweets and retweets whether they had voted for Trump or Clinton in the 2016 election. That left something like 20 accounts, 19 of which voted for Trump. He concluded that Twitter was massively biased against conservatives.<p>The problem with that is that since we are de facto a two party system, anyone who wanted their vote to matter had to pick Trump or Clinton. Who, for example, are white supremacist or Nazi or &quot;death to all Muslim&quot; people going to pick among those two?<p>Neither most Republicans nor most Democrats support those people. Democrats though are more likely than Republicans to consider them to be a problem that needs to be actively dealt with now. Republicans are more likely to consider them to be a potential problem that doesn&#x27;t need to be addressed now. And so the white supremacist vote or the Nazi vote goes heavily to R.')
