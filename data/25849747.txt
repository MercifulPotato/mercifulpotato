So can definitely agree that it is one of the best experiences to move away, at least once. On the other hand not sure if I would be ready to settle down for example in Zurich.<p>Also, governments lookout for you. So basically if you start a business in my country and are then not satisfied, it becomes much more difficult to move away. You will have to pay a tax on the liquidation value of your company. Actually I never dealt with this stuff and was surprised about all the laws around this topic.<p>&quot;don&#x27;t do anything just for money if you can help it -- and you usually can.&quot; Can&#x27;t agree more. Been always my mindset as well. It changed a bit to be honest as I&#x27;m thinking about paying multiple millions in taxes that can be avoided just by moving to another city. Especially since the Government actually wasn&#x27;t able to provide a good and fair regulatory framework. So there is a non-zero risk that they could kill the company.')
