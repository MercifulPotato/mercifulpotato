The different ram models in the Pi 4 are great too. As soon as we get a &quot;Pi 500&quot; in a future generation with the 8GB model, I think we can officially replace computers for browser-only users with one of these (especially if the graphics hardware improves for videos).<p>Even now, I wonder if this would be fine for someone who just uses Facebook, email, and YouTube. Maybe a bit of lag here and there, but I&#x27;d imagine this would do the trick, right?')
