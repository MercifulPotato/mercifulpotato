Item(by='ncallaway', descendants=None, kids=[25469532, 25469767, 25470775], score=None, time=1608312309, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25469200, text='&gt; Property is not afforded the rights of humans and cases can be levied against property directly.<p>This is accurate insofar as it represents the current jurisprudence, but absolutely false in the moral or straightforward reading of the constitution.<p>The &#x27;takings&#x27; clause of the 5th amendment, for example:<p>&quot;nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation&quot;<p>That seems to clearly establish that humans have a right to their private property not being taken from them. Whether the legal fiction is a case against my car, or &quot;a Toyota Corolla&quot; doesn&#x27;t have any practical difference on the outcome. The government can seize my car without due process,<p>Civil asset forfeiture is flat-out unconstitutional. The fact that is exists without due process or just compensation is <i>wrong</i>, and the current jurisprudence on it is <i>simply wrong</i>. It&#x27;s rare for me to be willing to step out on a limb and say the courts are simply wrong on an issue, but civil asset forfeiture is a limb I will happily step out onto.')
