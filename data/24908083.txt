People who just kind of have a &quot;job&quot; and, magically, money comes to them every few weeks, sometimes don&#x27;t appreciate how difficult the magic money is to create. Nor can they appreciate how easily it can disappear.<p>I always look at it as the customer has my money in his or her pocket. As I&#x27;m not, myself, ever going to risk getting that money by calling that guy&#x27;s daughter ugly. I&#x27;m not even going to consider putting anyone in front of that guy if there&#x27;s even the slightest chance that he or she might call that guy&#x27;s daughter ugly.<p>A lot of business success and failure is just common sense stuff like this. That&#x27;s probably at least a part of what gave rise to that blue&#x2F;white division in the first place. The guys at the top simply don&#x27;t want to lose money over something stupid.')
