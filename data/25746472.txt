Worst for me os that the Read&#x2F;Unread status is not replicated correctly between Threema Web and the iOS app, so I always have unread messages everywhere. This is unrelated to notifications, it is just the chat view that shows that some messages are unread, and the accompanying unread message count on the app icon.')
