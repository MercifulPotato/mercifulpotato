Item(by='FooHentai', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603620567, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24884133, text='The article mentions Te Uruwera and the Wanganui river but TƒÅne Mahuta &#x27;Lord of the Forest&#x27; - New Zealand&#x27;s largest known living kauri tree could be argued to personhood more clear-case (IMO) than any river or forest. It&#x27;s not yet been granted such status but watch this space as it&#x27;s somewhat of a no-brainer assuming the old geezer doesn&#x27;t expire from old age&#x2F;Kauri dieback beforehand. The cynic in me believes it hasn&#x27;t yet attained this status only because no individual interests exist to bring the necessary legal precedings.<p>Concepts of personhood and ownership are difficult to pin down in the context of NZ&#x27;s bi-cultural society and history. Spend time sympathetically observing and you&#x27;ll likely come to see everything through a kind of cultural bifocal - The western interpretation as seen in TFA constitute a legal definition of personhood and boards being established to provide a voice for Te Uruwera and the Wanganui river respectively. This might make sense to a western observer but in Maoridom the view is not so prescriptive and any attempt to cement the meaning of (what I understand as) a physical manifestation of the god that birthed mankind itself gets quite weird quite quickly.<p>We&#x27;re yet to fully appreciate the ramifications of this approach because the legal groundwork as mentioned in TFA only really sets the stage for legal challenges - eventually case precedents will follow and they will provide clearer groundwork. My hot take is that we&#x27;re already seeing major flaws with the use of boards to manifest voice and agency - They are vulnerabile to being used to advance the interests of individuals or (at best) whole tribes - These interests don&#x27;t even represent a consolidated will of Maori peoples as a whole (and if such a viewpoint could ever be gathered, the jury is out).<p>It&#x27;s fascinating to see this as a microcosm of fulfilling te tiriti, wherein the duality of interpretation of the founding legal documents of the nation - produced and signed in two different languages, neither of which actually agree with each other (BIG OOF) continue to provide wicked popcorn-fodder even today. At its core as best I can surmise: There is no accurate translation of mana or mauri to be found; all else follows.')
