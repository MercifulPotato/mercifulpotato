Are you legitimately concerned that, unchecked, flat earthers might actually &quot;turn&quot; the entire population? If everyone agrees that the earth is flat it may as well be so.<p>If the concern is that <i>some</i> people will hold mistaken beliefs then I am not sure there is a technological or sociological solution to the problem. I believe there will be people holding mistaken beliefs regardless of whether the world&#x27;s information channels are &quot;decentralized&quot; but I agree with your parent&#x27;s poster that a decentralized approach is the only approach that does <i>not</i> come with a high probability that the majority will be coerced or gaslit into holding false beliefs at some point in time.')
