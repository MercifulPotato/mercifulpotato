If we&#x27;re not supposed to talk about cause of death, then why should the age be mentioned? Why should the location where the person passed away be said? Why include next of kin -- surely that&#x27;s completely irrelevant unless you are part of the family? Every single Wikipedia entry for a person who isn&#x27;t living gives cause of death. If it&#x27;s so bad to talk about causes, then why isn&#x27;t Wikipedia being criticized for this? We need to get over this taboo. It is not gossip. It is relevant and important information.')
