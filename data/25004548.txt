After all, there are <i>always</i> morons out there. Simply consider the alternative: authoritarian and ad-hoc censorship (in this case perpetrated by tech companies that don&#x27;t have the public&#x27;s best interest in mind). You may agree with it <i>today</i> -- in fact, on a surface level, so do I -- but will we agree with it tomorrow? It&#x27;s important not to lose sight of the future and accidentally throw the baby out with the bathwater.<p>I have a feeling you might disagree, but that&#x27;s a hill I&#x27;m willing to die on.')
