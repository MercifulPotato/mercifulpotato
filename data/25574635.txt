We&#x27;re conditioned to eat great tasting food and lots of it. Most American cities have a car-oriented culture, along with sedentary lifestyles; therefore, not much walking or NEAT (Non-exercise activity thermogenesis). It seems over the years, Americans are burning less calories, but consuming more.<p>I usually cook at home now, thanks to the Pandemic. Looking at all the recipes I found online, I realized how much high-calorie ingredients you have to add to make the food taste delicious. I try to limit those ingredient or use lower-calorie substitutes, but it is challenging. I can&#x27;t imagine how much fats and sugars restaurants put in their foods to make it tasty for the general population.<p>Also, food portions have gotten bigger. We&#x27;re used to eating more. Having a great tasting food filled with sugar or fats is not bad by itself, but eating a small portion of it won&#x27;t be satisfying or satiating enough for most people.<p>There&#x27;s a Youtube home cook named Ethan Chlebowski who sometimes does low-calorie versions of certain foods. I think more people need to do that--give great recipes that can taste almost as good as the high-calorie versions.')
