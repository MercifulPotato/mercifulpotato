Some clearinghouses like OCC carry counterparty risk throughout the life of a trade.<p>The counterparty in question is the clearing member, ie Robinhood. If the trade is fully cash-secured then there is no risk that Robinhood will go under because it has 100% of the cash required to make good on the trade (assuming they still make enough from PFOF to cover their operating costs for a couple of days.) And for existing margin accounts, they just have to continue the practice of aggressively closing positions that fall below maintenance margin.')
