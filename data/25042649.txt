Getting charged with a horse would be terrifying (speaking from semi-experience, I&#x27;ve been charged by both bull moose and cattle). Nevermind the animal also having someone on top of it armed to the teeth, I can easily understand running away in terror.<p>From my amateur research, this is one of the reasons the Romans were so effective- they weren&#x27;t always better armed than their opponents, but their culture and training promoted better cohesion. Whereas in the scenario of a medieval peasant facing a knight, even negating the shock value of being charged by mounted troops the knight likely just has far more experience in battle and is less likely to rout. Every peasant revolt I&#x27;ve read about seemed to end with the nobles riding the fleeing peasants down and stabbing them in the backs. Makes one reconsider the modern connotation of the word &#x27;noble&#x27;, although maybe it was a bit of a euphemism even back then. I know chivalry was much more of an ideal than a creed people actually followed.')
