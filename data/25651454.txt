If you have a feeling of service after <i>productively</i> helping someone, that&#x27;s great. But if you have a feeling of service while the actual impact of what you did was negligible (or even negative), that&#x27;s bad. So &quot;service&quot; can&#x27;t be a goal just by itself; it has to be something like &quot;service that actually does help&quot;.')
