Chips are still improving. Theres always new applications to more compute eg: 3D work can be done on laptop now, realistic renders can be ray traced with consumer graphics cards, phones can do voice recognition and so on locally. I mentioned graphics a lot but video games look amazing and some will be photo-realistic in ~10 years.<p>2) Tesla and other car companies. Battery costs have reduced 10x in a few decades, cars now have OTA updates and increasingly sophisticated self driving abilities (already pretty good on the highway). Whole car industry is going to electrify in the next few decades.<p>3) Space X is making space transport way cheaper, and Starlink seems to be a great internet solution for remote areas.<p>3) Open source or donation based projects. Apps such as Blender, VLC, Signal continue to improve. Sites such as Our World in Data and Wikipedia provide amazing value. Open standards such as RISC-V, AV1 continue to push forward.<p>4) Wind and solar. Costs have reduced 10x in a few decades. The tech is being pushed to their efficiency limits, solar can still improve a lot. Of course, the intermittency of renewables remains an issue.')
