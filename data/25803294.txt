I suppose that means that E8 is the equivalent for octonions?  That loses the concept of &quot;prime,&quot; which is no surprise, because the octonions are not a field, but I wonder if one could bring it back by substituting irreducible representations for primes, somehow?  I&#x27;m not sure how to carry this off, because I dropped representation theory in grad school, but it seems like an interesting concept to play with, at least.')
