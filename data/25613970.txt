For the 95% use-case it works better than all of the alternatives for payments in North America.<p>But it&#x27;s the last 5% - 15% that will keep you up at night and&#x2F;or eat up your time. Accepting payments from EU customers and international users. A typical B2B SaaS will eventually end up accepting checks in the mail, bank transfers from a half dozen countries, and (heaven forbid): PayPal.
