As computers continue to be used as appliances, we should expect similar controls over the device to be deployed to minimize the harm a user can cause. This in turn leads to loss of agency by the specialist.<p>Most people can understand the failure modes associated with microwaving metal and such (or if not, it can be a relatively cheap or expensive lesson). But that underscores the commoditization I was pointing at. The dangers of general computing devices can&#x27;t be captured in simple aphorisms like &quot;don&#x27;t leave it on with a vessel that lacks contents&quot; for a stove or &quot;don&#x27;t put metal inside&quot; for a microwave. The warnings that accompany a computer would comprise encyclopedic volumes to encapsulate all the things that could go wrong, like &quot;don&#x27;t install software from someone you don&#x27;t know on a computer through which you access your banking.&quot; There are so many instance like that it&#x27;s unbelievable. Few other devices are so interconnected to so many aspects of our lives. The general nature simply lacks the guardrails and controls of a special-purpose appliance.<p>Put another way, can you imagine the reduction in request volume from your mother if she had a special device for reading the news, and another for banking, and another for shopping? This is the rationale. I don&#x27;t agree with it but convenience seems to trump everything else.')
