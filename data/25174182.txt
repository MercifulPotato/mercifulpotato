Which is true and a fair argument to make in favor of among other things (such as sizes accessable for children, etc)<p>But saying that it&#x27;s the most compelling argument is where it arguably becomes full on sexist.<p>Truth of the matter is most concert pianists and serious competitors have absolutely gigantic hands that most people do not posses. With very few and rare exceptions.<p>And that the current piano size is way too large for most people, esp. if they actually would like to excel at it. Or at a minimum a very large portion of the population, incl. geographic areas where people tend to be shorter on average.')
