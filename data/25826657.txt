The CXL stopped the keratoconus progressing and I only need to wear glasses instead of the more invasive things other patients mention (contact lenses, corneal grafts and transplants, etc).<p>It would be good if this intervention to convince patients to cease eye rubbing was more common in keratoconus patients. There is often a delay of several months between when keratoconus is suspected or diagnosed and CXL is carried out (in my case I had to wait 6 months in one eye and 9 months in the other, during which time it got a bit worse).<p>About eye rubbing, yes there should be more awareness of it! In practical terms, I would recommend that everyone tries wearing an eye-mask when they’re asleep (I recently bought this one, and I&#x27;m happy with it <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.co.uk&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B07DW32QYJ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.co.uk&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B07DW32QYJ</a> ). This is because it&#x27;s more difficult to notice and prevent yourself from rubbing your eyes when you&#x27;re half-asleep.<p>There are several reasons why I like wearing an eye mask while in bed, and some even apply to people who don’t have keratoconus:\n1. It stops me rubbing my eyes when I&#x27;m in bed.\n1. It might stop allergens getting into my eyes when I&#x27;m asleep, for example I notice much less rheum on my eyes when I wake up in the morning. When I’m in bed is when I notice that my allergies are worst.\n3. It helps me sleep better, it&#x27;s like having blackout curtains in my room.\n4. If I want to get up in the middle of the night, I will be able to see better in the dark.')
