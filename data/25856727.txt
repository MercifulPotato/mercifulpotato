I mean, yeah, maybe you can say that it&#x27;s more advanced than &quot;vanilla&quot; Haskell, but how many people use no extensions at all?<p>As for the comparison with Scala - maybe for Scala 2 that&#x27;s true because of union- and intersection-types and Scala 2&#x27;s lack of certain typelevel programming features.<p>But when compared to Scala 3 - is there anything major that you can do with typescript but not with Scala 3?<p>When I looked at typescript, my impression was that it has a lot of special rules and special syntax for certain typelevel programming features. Which is nice in many cases, but it doesn&#x27;t compose and does not age very well. Still, I&#x27;m happy to see this development in a mainstream frontend language.')
