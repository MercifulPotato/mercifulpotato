Cameras give you a 2D colored image from which you essentially guesstimate the distance of objects. Lidar gives you a 2D depth map with much higher confidence in the data that comes out of the stream.<p>Elon has a high incentive to talk down Lidar in cars: He&#x2F;Tesla placed the bet initially on cameras because Lidar is&#x2F;was too expensive, and promised these cars will be able to drive themselves (&quot;regulatory approval pending&quot;). Retrofitting Lidar is not an option (price, sensor&amp;cable placement), so a lot of his (and Tesla&#x27;s) promises ride on cameras working out and Lidar not being necessary. A lot of Tesla&#x27;s (Car&#x27;s and Car company&#x27;s) value rely on cameras working out and Lidar not being necessary.')
