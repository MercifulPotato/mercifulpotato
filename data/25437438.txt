I considered being a little more &quot;both sides&quot; about it but anyone with an objective view of reality can see how far off the deep end of conspiracies the average conservative has gone. My parents believe Obama was a muslim. They believe in a Deep State. They&#x27;re open to conspiracies about every democrat in power being a pedophile.
