Big, known enterprise-friendly companies like Dell and Lenovo will sell you their flagship and business laptops and desktops running Ubuntu, and it&#x27;s not uncommon for engineers at the 8000+ not-a-software-company I work at to casually have a Linux machine instead of a Mac or PC. It&#x27;s not 2010, where you had to be willing to navigate UEFI and &quot;will my broadcom wireless work?&quot; to weed out the casuals from the true-believers.')
