When the client receives that, the client can send the object&#x2F;script back and all the connnected objects back together to avoid multiple round trips.<p>It makes me sad that this still isn’t a thing (server can reply with more than one cacheable url)<p>To work around this we invent all sorts of tools like graphql, webpack with layers of complexity.<p>Sure there is the problem of what if the client already has the resource. Then the answer is the response can optionally send content or just the url. You then have a 2nd roundtrip to fetch the content the browser doesn’t have.<p>At the end of the day, I just want the browser to essentially rsync-ish a bunch of url&#x2F;resources from the server.')
