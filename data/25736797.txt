Parler is a social media site <i>dedicated</i> to extremism. While I believe in their 1st amendment right to exist (not all speech is protected though) I do not like this group. On the other hand I see companies like Signal and CloudFlare as being neutral. They have taken a position that they choose not to be the arbiters of right and wrong. These companies also aren&#x27;t <i>dedicated</i> to extremism. I believe that being able to speak freely and make mistakes is an essential part of democracy. A privacy preserving platform protects this idea. If the service is <i>dedicated</i> to the public (aka neutral) then I think this is the right move. Extremists will (and have) congregate on Signal (as they do on WA, Telegram, Twitter, 4Chan, Facebook, etc). I see encryption orthogonal to the issue of extremism. This may make it a bit harder for security to monitor these groups (no dragnets), but if they are mass groups it won&#x27;t be hard to infiltrate anyways. If a member of the public can get in then why can&#x27;t someone from the CIA&#x2F;NSA? It might as well be in clear text. If they can&#x27;t infiltrate these groups then we have much bigger problems and everyone has been overestimating the power of these organizations for decades.<p>So to sum up. I highly value privacy and security (especially as we&#x27;re adding more to the internet. The danger is increasing). But I&#x27;m against extremism. It is a numbers game that more public members will gain value from privacy than the dozens of terrorists who will. But it is a different situation if someone creates a space <i>dedicated</i> to extremism.<p>(I do think this is a very reasonable question to ask though)<p>Edit: I wouldn&#x27;t say that Signal will be completely unmoderated. Groups still have admins. But you&#x27;re right that Signal won&#x27;t be able to moderate. But this isn&#x27;t that different from any federated platform.')
