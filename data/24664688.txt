It purports to generate <i>a</i> theory of physics without going so far as to claim that that theory coincides with the dynamics of our universe specifically.<p>It is taking the idea of &quot;physical model&quot; and abstracting it to see how flexible of a theoretical substrate can be used to demonstrate certain behaviors within the defined set of axioms which we would expect out of any model of physics, i.e., causality, limits of information propagation rates, etc.<p>In short: it is not a theory of <i>the</i> physics, but just <i>a</i> physics.')
