I&#x27;m a very fast reader and probably need at least 15 seconds to wade through a busy Stack Overflow page.<p>I&#x27;ve found that Slack&#x27;s discoverability is severely limited because it seems to prioritize low-effort input. Here&#x27;s what I mean: in a busy channel, Slack makes it so easy to reply in a linear chain. Unrelated messages get interleaved. Following a train of discussion can be difficult.<p>In contrast, I very much like how Zulip organizes threads. It allows content to be organized both up-front (at posting time) and over time. This feels very natural to me.')
