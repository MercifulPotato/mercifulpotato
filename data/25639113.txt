Item(by='novask', descendants=None, kids=[25639693], score=None, time=1609799033, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25637922, text='I&#x27;ll put my experiences down as a cautionary tale.<p>I&#x27;ve had 3 relatively short stints in tech jobs, but none where I left responsibilities on the table, like leaving in the middle of a project, or promising some work only to bail. Notice was always given, and I made the best effort to transition by completing all work before the end date. My reasons for leaving each are a bit more serious than a lifestyle downgrade, but none-the-less, that doesn&#x27;t matter to future employers.<p>There are lots of sectors to jump between that utilize programming and IT knowledge (DevOps, Cloud roles, security roles), so even when you go to try them out, it&#x27;s being considered a job hop by recruiters&#x2F;hiring managers. If it doesn&#x27;t work out, you&#x27;re now potentially job hopping twice when you try to go back to something you know you can do due to world events.<p>Not only is this the major take-away from the article, it also applies to switching industries, and in my experience for switching industries, it applies <i>even if you have a recent certification in the new industry which gets requested by a lot of companies</i>:<p>&gt;It’s ok to quit after a few weeks (just don’t make it a pattern)<p>Unfortunately, companies won&#x27;t see the notice you gave or the transition work you did. Those companies likely can&#x27;t verify that, so they really only have your employment dates to look at. If they don&#x27;t like it, they just won&#x27;t put you forward regardless of how much they like your skills.<p>For some people, there will be companies where they don&#x27;t fit in with because of personality traits. If you get particularly unlucky, you&#x27;ll run into 2 or 3 of those companies in quick succession, with the latter positions being even worse than the first, and so you&#x27;ll have to stick it out and endure more. This unluckiness doesn&#x27;t do you any favors, though. But it&#x27;s really up to you if those personality traits need to be fixed or not.<p>The only thing that seems to count is your tenure, so don&#x27;t fuck it up. You might not even get to the leetcode step if you do.')
