It is unfortunately too simple as you need 3 inputs and 2 output to demonstrate the effect (aka Mermin device).<p>The way to think about it is a box with 3 buttons.  There is no such thing as &#x27;observation&#x27;, the <i>only</i> way you can interact is to push one of the 3 buttons and as a result the box will output either a red or green light.<p>You must push a button to get the light, but the button may mutate the internal state of the box.  Using this model, there&#x27;s nothing special about human or conscious observation.  Every interaction via a particle or otherwise is simply pushing a button.<p>The crazy thing is.. no matter how clever an algorithm you write to drive the lights from the buttons, you cannot match the observed probabilities.  (100% if the same button is pushed, 25% if different buttons are pushed).')
