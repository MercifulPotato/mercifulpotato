Shot Lister was monitoring the timecode from the tapes and would generate an EDL, or Edit Decision List, for the editor&#x27;s work.  Various manually entered reference IDs plus U-matic tapes frame numbers lead back to the original 35mm negatives.<p>The EDL would be sent off, using a fancy new 3.5inch floppy via a courier, to another company to use the master negatives to &quot;print&quot; the final edit together.<p>I remember someone, often the &#x27;new kid&#x27; in the suite, would be tasked with manually writing down timecodes to clapper board references when the tapes arrived containing the rushes for whatever was being edited.  Overall, remarkably similar!')
