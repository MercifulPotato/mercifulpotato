Item(by='justanotherme', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604939413, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25034571, text='In my opinion this sounds extremely good. They say that 94 people got covid. We do not know how many of them were from the placebo group and how many were from the vaccinated group. But the wording &quot;was found to be more than 90% effective&quot; probably means that much more than 85 of the covid-patients came from the placebo group. The reason is that they need to be a few standard deviations away from the mean to make such assumptions with high probability. I think probably at most 2 patients of the 94 covid-patients came from the vaccinated group (only then you could make such a statement with high certainty). And that means that probably the vaccine is more than 97% effective. This would be extremely good news. But let&#x27;s wait for the data.')
