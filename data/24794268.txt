Is the person wearing clothes? Is the person rambling&#x2F;coherent&#x2F;visibly intoxicated? Are the person&#x27;s eyes shifting around&#x2F;manic looking? Does the person smell weird? (I am making up random examples, but I am sure there are many things that every person will look at to gauge trustworthiness).<p>Most of the above goes out of the window on the internet. Even the shouting part does not usually  manifest itself into a website comment (ALL CAPS is less offensive than someone actually shouting in your ear&#x2F;many people don&#x27;t know the connotation).')
