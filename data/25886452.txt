As far as I can tell from reading articles 1-3 GDPR, the GDPR applies to all processing that takes place within the EU or on behalf of an EU entity, regardless of whether the subject of the data is a citizen or resident of the EU. Same goes for the Swiss data protection act [0].<p>So as a non-American, I have a choice between services located in a country where I have no legal rights and services located in countries where I do.<p>This is also all from a security point of view. From a privacy point of view, I know that American companies have essentially free reign over the data I give them. They can monetize it, sell it, train machine learning models with it or do whatever else they please, regardless of whether they have my explicit consent.<p>Other jurisdictions have privacy protections, so I know I have some basic level of privacy if I choose say a German email provider, while I know I have essentially none if I choose an American one.<p>Really, as a non-American, I see no reason why I should treat American services as being any better than say Russian or Chinese services. I&#x27;m happy to listen if you have any compelling arguments though.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fedlex.admin.ch&#x2F;eli&#x2F;cc&#x2F;1993&#x2F;1945_1945_1945&#x2F;en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fedlex.admin.ch&#x2F;eli&#x2F;cc&#x2F;1993&#x2F;1945_1945_1945&#x2F;en</a>')
