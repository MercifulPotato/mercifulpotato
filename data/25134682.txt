I also do not see how investment is going to fix a lot of the issues - for example in my home town in the SW of England (rural area), the already highly subsidised + regulated bus service was consistently late and unreliable. Not to mention didn&#x27;t actually go to many places in the local area.<p>Perhaps increased public transportation is part of the issue but if you consider the scale of the issue and the numbers involved not to mention the fact you&#x27;re now entirely privileging rich people with off-street parking (class&#x2F;economic issues there) who CAN get electric cars, and do all of this in 9 years (or maybe 19 let&#x27;s say if people are buying 2nd hand) while bankrupting every single (non-electric) car-related industry shortly after one of the biggest economic shocks of the modern era AND you still need to provide considerably more infrastructure no matter how you slice the pie it&#x27;s still equally as huge a logistical challenge.')
