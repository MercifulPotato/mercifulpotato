It&#x27;s monetised through affiliate income, mostly from insurance and banking products. If you move here, you need health insurance and a bank account.<p>It&#x27;s not a very demanding job, since most of the content is evergreen. The website could run for months without attention, but I enjoy making the website a little better every day. I love being able to provide so much for free, and still live from it.<p>In the future, I&#x27;d like to hire someone to write more content. There are topics that just aren&#x27;t interesting to me (like pensions and taxation), and others that I don&#x27;t have enough exposure to (like studying in Germany). However, I don&#x27;t trust others to put the same level of attention into the research and the editing.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;allaboutberlin.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;allaboutberlin.com&#x2F;</a>')
