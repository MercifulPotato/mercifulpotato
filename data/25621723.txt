I&#x27;ve heard about this project by a french local authority that help sync back data from OSM to your own database. Dunno if other similar projects exists.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;Geonov&#x2F;le-bon-tag" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;Geonov&#x2F;le-bon-tag</a>')
