I&#x27;m frequently years late though. It&#x27;s not a thing I think I should track in real time.<p>Infocom games were nice and all but modern IF is where it&#x27;s at. The genre moved forward, there&#x27;s better design, better stories, more interesting mechanics. Gigantic labyrinth worlds that you can&#x27;t win because you missed a one-time chance to pick up bubblegum in the first area of the game isn&#x27;t something that is done anymore.')
