Besides being literally false if narrowly interpreted, this violates the HN guideline, &quot;Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says, not a weaker one that&#x27;s easier to criticize.&quot;<p>Second, because it&#x27;s an attempt to side-load a hot-button topic into a non-political thread, and HN frowns on that.  (Note that the hot-button topic is &quot;Were Connery&#x27;s comments acceptable&quot;, which was contentious at the time he made them and still is today;  it is not, as OP&#x27;s phrasing might suggest, &quot;Is spousal abuse acceptable&quot; which almost no one agrees with)<p>Third, discussion of this Connery interview has been ubiquitous online today (it has been mentioned in every article, Reddit thread, FB post, etc about Sean Connery I have seen today) and I suspect lot of people come to HN to get away with that.<p>Fourth, there is indeed a long, long tradition of people who dislike a celebrity using the occasion of their death to launch one last attack on them, and other people who liked the celebrity indignantly complaining that that&#x27;s a bad thing to do.')
