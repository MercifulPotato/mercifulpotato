I wanted the perfect workout program and wait for my fridge to be stocked with the right foods, the day to be correct so my arms won&#x27;t be tired when driving and my leg won&#x27;t be too sore to push in the clutch. Eventually I just did it and sorted out those other details later.<p>If you&#x27;re in the same position I recommend immediate action. Like just go do 50 squats or 10 pushups or something. It feels good and in a month you won&#x27;t have excuses for why you didn&#x27;t start - you&#x27;ll have progress.')
