You still need out-of-tree drivers to run Linux on a 2017 MacBook Pro, and various things don&#x27;t work at all on Intel Macs from 2016 (possibly earlier) to the present.<p>Sure the M1 is the new shiny, and people will be attracted to it in the short term, which might boost reverse-engineering efforts.  But I expect that to die down as people get frustrated, and we&#x27;ll have the same (or worse) situation as we do running Linux on Intel Macs.')
