The problem is Apple purposely holding back PWAs so they can keep earning their Apple Mafia Cut.<p>I truly belive that for most apps excluding games, PWAs are the way to go. Truly cross platform, low on download speed, and can have almost identical functionality like most of the apps.<p>That is why I am stocked for Flutter Web, when it gets production ready, it can truly be a game changer. \nI am currently forced to make mobile apps, since PWAs are just not that popular nor ideal (Apple problems as I stated above), but I am using Flutter which is honestly fun and the best solution.<p>Make Apple (and Google, although they already have access on most of it) to their API, that is most notably the ability for PWAs to push notifications.')
