Item(by='derekp7', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610386036, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25731965, text='One thing about woodworking is that parts of it are easier for someone who has had a career in thinking logically and several steps ahead.  If you also have had experience laying out user interfaces, that can help too.  However there is the flip side, in that a number of techniques in woodworking aren&#x27;t easily discoverable unless you&#x27;ve been working in the  field for a while, and it is all too easy to get hurt (even when not using power equipment).  I personally love doing projects, but on every single one I end up getting some sort of injury (typically something small like a splinter under the fingernail, or a tool slipping causing an abrasion on my hand, but annoying none the less).<p>But you are right, in that there can be a good bit of coin to be had with furniture building, especially if you can draw on some standardized design principles to output good customized pieces.  Think things like a closet organizer that is &quot;perfect&quot; for a customer&#x27;s bedroom.  Or things like cranking out desks needed by students doing school from home.<p>In fact, I probably could have made a killing in selling &quot;pandemic&quot; desks (there were absolutely no desks to be found at the beginning of the school year).  I made a couple for family members, made out of real hard wood (no partical board) for about $130 in lumber and connecting hardware -- nice 3-drawer desk units.  I basically used rail-and-stile frames to make the back, sides, and drawer box using pocket screws, then 1&#x2F;4 inch plywood tacked from the inside of the drawer box.  Took about 3 hours to cut, drill, and assemble everything but the drawers themselves.  If I was out of work I probably would have made a bunch and sold them for $350 a piece.')
