I had a Miata with 225 wide super sticky tires and I couldn’t go over 60 on the highway without being very nervous. I went down to 205s and it’s way more street friendly.<p>Roads with some gravel, dirt, or otherwise not so perfect are also not great with too big of a tire because the car rolls on the little pebbles or rocks instead of shaping itself around it. The pounds per inch go down enough that the tire won’t get pushed around the rock to contact the asphalt.<p>There is a “safe for the average guy” tire width and a “experienced enthusiast that wants some extra Gs in the turns” width.')
