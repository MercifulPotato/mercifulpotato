It doesn&#x27;t exist in human societies (the closest is what you have between criminal gangs and during civil wars). There is no market in isolation from politics.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like wanting to talk about electric field around a charge while pretending the magnetic field isn&#x27;t a thing. Much like physicists noticed that electric and magnetic fields form a common entity together, perhaps it&#x27;s time more people recognized that market and governance are just as much intrinsically intertwined. Either one needs the other to exist in any but most degenerate form. And both actively try to influence each other.')
