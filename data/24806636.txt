It&#x27;s a number engineered to limit the shareability of subscriptions and purchases to increase revenue and reduce abuse.<p>That&#x27;s probably another good reason why a company like google should be broken up. Nobody cares that spotify limits your family at 5 people, that&#x27;s just your music.
