Which lets me know they hit the target very well.<p>&gt; Our mailing lists are far, far superior, than any alternative forum setups I&#x27;ve ever seen.<p>Taking into account the last time you checked out a forum setup, then your arguments are understandable. If you take phpBB then of course it&#x27;s going to be comparing shit with shit, but that&#x27;s not really what we&#x27;re discussing.<p>&gt; Then why do you even visit HN? There&#x27;s no formatting tools available here, is there?<p>How is HN related to to this discussion? It would be useful if it too had some formatting tools. Was this supposed to be a &quot;gotcha&quot;-moment? Because it failed miserably.<p>&gt;  I do insist it&#x27;s [...] but indeed &quot;far superior&quot;.<p>All that I can say here is that you have made up your mind and you have made your decision in the past.<p>Thankfully more and more projects abandon mailing lists and convert to something more accessible, more usable, they&#x27;re also doing far better, with far more new people joining. Hm, in a sense people can be thankful even, it acts as a signal for people, if the dead hand of the past is there and doesn&#x27;t want to let go.<p>If you wish continue as you have for the past few decades, do so, I can&#x27;t force you to reconsider. But don&#x27;t come crying when you lack new people contributing and maintaining.')
