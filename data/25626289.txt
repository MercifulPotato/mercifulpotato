Tuition costs are already too high and we are calling in the government to pay for student loans. So what do people expect? Obviously with a crystal ball they probably would have kept her funded (if this is even the full story - and it probably isn’t), but we shouldn’t blame them for not having one. 20+ years with no takers sounds like a pretty fair shake. Are they just supposed to fund everyone indefinitely so they can never be accused of missing something good?<p>Not even VCs have a great track record at picking winners, and they do this for a living.')
