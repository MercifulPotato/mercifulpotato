Item(by='at-fates-hands', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607542243, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25358822, text='&gt;&gt; If you are in an environment in which someone else can physically access your device (like an airport), don&#x27;t bring it with you.<p>Agreed.<p>After going to a few infosec conferences and getting flagged on way home, I started doing this now whenever I travel, no exceptions. Full disclosure: I&#x27;m a web developer. I have little if any connections to known hackers or highly public Blue Team members; so I&#x27;m still not sure why I got flagged, detained and all my electronic devices (smartphone, laptops, storage devices) seized and searched.<p>I now use an old windows Lumia 950. No fingerprint sensor, fake email accounts set up for the outlook app and I use a vpn with the mobile IE version on the phone to access web mail accounts. Still get texts ok, but if I need to save something, I just log into my email, copy&#x2F;paste then delete the texts before I get to the airport.<p>If I&#x27;m stopped now, I can be totally compliant and still have somewhat peace of mind they won&#x27;t have anything worthwhile.<p>Since Windows has long since killed off its smartphones, they are easy to get a hold of on ebay and elsewhere. The other nice thing is I&#x27;m not sure Microsoft is even tracking users data on these phones anymore so you might have a nice advantage that way too.<p>Not 100% the best solution, but better than most.')
