Year 1<p>Then weight. Just stop drinking soda or anything sweet and drop all candy. Withdrawal is awful (physically painful) for a week, after a month you won&#x27;t miss it a bit. Forget about candy forever, just desserts in restaurants for special occasions.<p>Lift weights at home, start with water bottles. Just keep at it and try to improve a bit every 2 days, every small improvement is a win. Go for walks.<p>After a year you will be fine, i lost 45 kilos in 2 years whilst still enjoying normal food except candy. Year 2 (will become a habit)<p>Kickstart your career. Learn new tech in your domain and try to apply it in side projects and&#x2F;or give conference talks about things you just learned. Remotely this is easier than ever. Have courage and propose architecture changes etc. If your company is unaccepting switch companies. Year 3<p>Now this one is hard because of covid: Go to meetups, especially gaming &#x2F; board gaming focused ones. Make these social things a priority. If anyone asks you to go somewhere do it no matter what, even if you do not feel like it. Keep doing this, you will build relationships. Year 4')
