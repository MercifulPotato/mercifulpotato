I assume new contracts have an escape clause if underage workers are discovered, but maybe that contract didn&#x27;t.<p>Even if the contract didn&#x27;t have an explicit escape clause, Apple could probably terminate without penalty anyways. Should the supplier sue for nonperformance, Apple could raise the defense of &quot;unclean hands,&quot; arguing that the supplier relied on illegal labor for its side of the contract.')
