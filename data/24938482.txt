I think people just get tripped up thinking about rotation of an object in circular motion and just ascribe one motion for the other.<p>For example, if you imagine a newly reunited couple and they hug each other while simultaneously spinning, this is exactly what the moon and Earth are doing. I think most people would also say that the outside person isn&#x27;t rotating. However, they would also say that the inner person is obviously spinning.<p>Describing in words is often not the best way to impart explanations of physics, but the easiest way to show this concept for me is to imagine both people separately and consider a half turn. The inner person, rotates 180 degrees, simple rotation. What does the outside person have to do to get to the right position? They have to walk around the inner person to the other side and then rotate 180 degrees to see their partner again.')
