Item(by='tcpekin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611490733, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25884019, text='In a very similar situation, I posted a pair of &quot;Waxed Flesh&quot; boots on eBay from my 13 year (albeit rarely used) account. They had plenty of pictures, waxed flesh is a very well known term with regards to boot leathers, but within 2 minutes, my long term eBay account was permanently terminated with no chance for recourse.<p>Besides it being exceedingly difficult to find someone to talk to about this, when I finally did in the chat service they offer, as soon as I brought up my account they terminated the chat with some copy&#x2F;paste message about how they cannot talk to me about it as it might compromise their fraud detection. People I&#x27;ve talked to have mentioned that it might be due to the fact that there was &quot;Flesh&quot; in the title, but that is a valid description of the good I was trying to sell.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say, is that it felt entirely arbitrary, I had no recourse with regards to the discussion, and eBay is similarly shitty with regards to service.')
