Item(by='grecy', descendants=None, kids=[25306902], score=None, time=1607111069, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25306303, text='&gt; <i>When you donate clothes to St Vinny&#x27;s (Goodwill&#x2F; Salvation Army&#x2F; whatever), they keep the best&#x2F; resealable clothes and dispose of the rest</i><p>By <i>dispose</i>, what you mean is send them to Africa or other undeveloped regions. In virtually all of the 35 African countries I spent time in I would see clothes for sale in local markets that still had (St Vinny&#x27;s&#x2F;Goodwill&#x2F; Salvation Army) tags on them.')
