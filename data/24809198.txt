I certainly would&#x27;t recommend it to a programmer starting out today, instead C or Rust would be better places to get an idea of system level programming.<p>Unlikely. The only candidates for replacement are Rust and D, none of these are anywhere near the adoption of C++.<p>What C++ can do is get better at being a language and then maybe give tools for developers to phase out outdated constructs or relics from C. It is not going away cause it&#x27;s the best replacement for C humanity will ever get, at least for the next century.')
