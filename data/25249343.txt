Item(by='NathanKP', descendants=None, kids=[25249409], score=None, time=1606694652, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25249196, text='Just to be clear I&#x27;m opposed to Monsanto as well. I think that Monsanto is likely the company that plans to do some actual evil with GMO. But Monsanto shouldn&#x27;t be the only face and implementation of GMO. We need way more GMO research right now from a larger number of organizations.<p>GMO&#x27;s should be regulated to outlaw things like &quot;plant DRM&quot;, but part of that governmental regulation should be active financial encouragement of more GMO research to develop and propagate hardier, more drought and heat tolerant crops so that we still have food as the world faces global warming.<p>This is why it is a moral issue: the longer we delay and argue about widespread GMO research and propagation the more likely we end up in a world where global warming causes dramatically reduced food availability and variety. The rich will be able to eat food that was grown in climate controlled environments, the poor will either outright starve or adopt a massively simplified and less nutritious diet.<p>I draw the parallels between anti GMO and anti-vaxxers because in both cases there is a hyper-focus on a few potentially bad outcomes while ignoring the massive upside. Just like anti-vaxxers worry about their kid getting autism or getting a microchip injected into them or getting injected with something harmful, I find a lot of GMO discussions devolve into excessive worry about a few edge cases that either have not happened, rarely happen, or can and should be outlawed.')
