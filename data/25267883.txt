Item(by='joseluisq', descendants=None, kids=[25269244], score=None, time=1606846193, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25266995, text='&gt; Very light on specifics.<p>Yeah, especially the &quot;over Linux&quot; part.<p>&gt; This is the most perplexing decision in the article. Why would OP do this? I have FreeBSD running on an old laptop, along side an Ubuntu laptop. There&#x27;s more software ported for Ubuntu than FreeBSD and I don&#x27;t want to rebuild everything for BSD, I have too much work to do. Nobody targets BSD but BSD devs.<p>For instance, I use Arch+KDE  for years in the same laptop and I never had problems with updates thanks to the Arch&#x27;s rolling release approach. That&#x27;s why, for example I don&#x27;t get why FreeBSD over Linux in that particular regard.')
