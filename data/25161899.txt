Even if there&#x27;s a 0.01% chance of negative side effects, the individual benefit of re-opening society far outweighs that risk.<p>It&#x27;s true you can freeload and reap the benefits without the small risk, but if everyone thinks this way, there are no benefits to go around.  Can&#x27;t you just be a team player?<p>To put things in perspective, a 0.01% risk is like going skydiving once, or getting out of bed and doing your usual routine for a week.<p>It goes without saying that if the general public doesn&#x27;t get vaccinated, you should definitely get vaccinated because the risk of catching COVID is worse than the risk of this vaccine.')
