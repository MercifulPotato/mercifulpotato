Did you know? Does he have more dignity to be in there according to your criteria? What is better &quot;Reinassance&quot; or  &quot;Ancient Rome&quot;?<p>You mention that there are &quot;philosophical and practical grounds&quot; to oppose this kind of &quot;restauration&quot;, yet you say that &quot;it&#x27;s a shame&quot; we cannot do it, suggesting we should indeed prefer erasing centuries of Italian history to please tourists and attract more funds.<p>It is remarkably funny how the &quot;return to order&quot;, &quot;purity&quot;, &quot;glory of the roman empire&quot; was exactly the same rhetoric and aesthetic of the Italian Fascist party. I guess this could be counted among the massive missteps you mentioned?<p>I think you would have a much better experience if you just enjoy the stratification of history and art that Rome, Italy and the Pantheon represent instead of projecting a subjective idea of how things should be.<p>And yes, it&#x27;s a tacky mess at times, but is not up to you, tourists, a party or even a government to decide on a scale of dignity of historic periods.<p>edit: added Raphael&#x27;s wikpedia page reference<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Raphael" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Raphael</a>')
