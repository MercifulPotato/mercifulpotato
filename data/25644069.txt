QM, and Copenhagen school in particular, is that we&#x27;re searching for too computationally simple mental models. Most other areas of physics - like GR, SR, thermodynamics - can get away with aggregating matter into points, perfect spheres, etc. because they&#x27;re working in macro scale, but QM is trying to deal with the smallest bits of our reality. Now the boundary between QM and &quot;classical physics&quot; is one where your quantum system will interact with 10^{double digit} amount of other quantum-relevant bits. I have a feeling that searching for what constitutes &quot;a measurement&quot; in such scenario is missing the point, and even talking about the macro system being entangled with the test system is pretty much skipping over all the interesting bits.')
