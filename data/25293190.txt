I want to spend them enjoying myself.<p>But the &quot;point&quot; is that hopefully you find your career rewarding in its own right, and your leisure and family time rewarding in its own right too.<p>Our efficiencies <i>help</i> us enjoy our leisure+family time <i>more</i>. So I&#x27;m not really sure how you&#x27;re connecting this to loneliness and drugs??')
