Their sales tell the true story. That Disney+ crashed when Luke Skywalker appeared tells the true story.<p>My fear is what we see at Harvard and Yale, where Asian applicants are discriminated against to “balance races” or whatever the racist euphemism of the day is just won’t stop. We’ll see a reconstruction of institutionalized racism.<p>I think you’re right that the criticism of Asian media has a racial element — but it’s also about control. As the far left burned down US institutions (eg, Disney and WM), many Americans adopted Japanese and Chinese media as surrogates. (Eg, I watch more anime than Hollywood content.) Understandably, Japan and China told left wing groups where to put their opinions on how they run their own culture. That turned into a full on power struggle. It’s very neo-colonial.<p>I think either we stand up to the racism and gaslighting now — or the censorship is here to stay.<p>I would personally hold the Asian community up as one that <i>has</i> integrated meaningfully into America at large, while not abandoning their own identity. Teriyaki, sushi, and American Chinese food are everywhere; anime and HK martial arts flicks are semi-popular; most Americans can name a few major events in Asia; etc. Personally, I consider “rooftop Koreans” to be an American archetype.<p>Is it so wrong I, as a Polish Jew, want to do the same? ...to celebrate my heritage and discuss the problems I face honestly?')
