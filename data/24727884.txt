Even if they&#x27;re lost some of their lustre (and, if we&#x27;re being literal, could be &quot;on it&#x27;s way&quot; in the sense that it was the most valuable company in the world and might&#x27;ve dropped a few percentage points).<p>Not only the past few years, heck, they launched a phone you couldn&#x27;t hold properly and people lapped it up. That&#x27;s not stopped their offerings not only being the best in their class, but often the only products of note (AirPods, iPads, Watch...).<p>Apple doesn&#x27;t have to beat Apple. They just have to beat the best of the rest - and apart from perhaps Samsung and Huawei in phones, they&#x27;re looking pretty peachy still.')
