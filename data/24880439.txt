The author themself writes &quot;Usability marks potential, and if nobody is using it do we care?&quot; - and why would anyone use it if it&#x27;s not useful?<p>Personally I would reorder this with Useful at the bottom, then Functional, then Usable. It doesn&#x27;t even need to work for you to ask people, &quot;If you had a magic button that you could do this thing for you, would you want it?&quot; Maybe this is edging towards &quot;Product Quality&quot; rather than &quot;Software Quality&quot;, but I think the two are intertwined.')
