I think it probably varies a lot by domain, but if I were to guess I would probably say that far less than 1% of Excel spreadsheets use VBA. And a lot of spreadsheets that do are probably good candidates to be rewritten in some other tool.<p>In my opinion, the reason that Excel has such a commanding lead in that space is more due to familiarity, compatibility, and that Excel is still just one of the nicest spreadsheet apps to use.')
