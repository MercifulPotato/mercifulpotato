Within an evidence-based medicine framework, hardly any nutritional studies qualify as &quot;high&quot; quality. Much of it is barely a step above junk with multiple uncontrolled variables. And in fairness to nutrition researchers, limits imposed by funding and ethics make meaningful large-scale human studies very difficult.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hierarchy_of_evidence" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hierarchy_of_evidence</a><p>In terms of human nutrition we know how to prevent acute diseases caused by deficiencies like kwashiorkor, beriberi, scurvy, Rickets, etc. And we know that excess consumption causes weight gain.
