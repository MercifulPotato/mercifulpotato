The already functional Ethereum 2.0 chain has Bitcoin&#x27;s security guarantees for a tiny fraction of the electricity costs.<p>Bitcoin&#x27;s yearly electricity consumption is now estimated at $3.8 billion.  This must be sustained indefinitely, and is a huge target for regulation and nation state interference.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digiconomist.net&#x2F;bitcoin-energy-consumption&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digiconomist.net&#x2F;bitcoin-energy-consumption&#x2F;</a><p>Bitcoin&#x27;s &quot;store of value&quot; has a forever price tag in the billions yearly.  This doesn&#x27;t make economic sense.<p>If Ethereum can fulfill Bitcoin&#x27;s role as a &quot;store of value&quot; at a much lower yearly cost, I don&#x27;t see how it would not eventually become more attractive as a store of value.<p>For a great detailed explanation on why PoS is better see Vitalk&#x27;s blog. Vitalik views attacks on chains in terms of costs, which IMHO is the proper paradigm to quantify attack costs.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vitalik.ca&#x2F;general&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;06&#x2F;pos2020.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vitalik.ca&#x2F;general&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;06&#x2F;pos2020.html</a><p>(BTW, the TLS cert looks like it has an issue at the moment).<p>In 2011 I assumed Bitcoin would transition because PoW&#x27;s weaknesses were obvious.  Unfortunately, the majority of the leftovers in Bitcoin no longer share my sentiment. Electricity consumption is a reason that PoW is the most likely downfall of Bitcoin if they don&#x27;t transition to another technology.  To keep PoW Bitcoin will need to morph into something else, like a semi-centralized &quot;reserve&quot; asset which is not a technology that excites me.  A scalable ecosystem where large volumes of economic value can be transferred excites me.  Everyday use excites me.<p>You can &quot;hide&quot; an Ethereum PoS server in your basement.  You can&#x27;t hide the massive electricity usage, transportation, and manufacturing of specialized hardware used in a Bitcoin ASIC farm.  The specialization also means there&#x27;s a huge centralization pressure in the Bitcoin network.  I personally welcome (reasonable) regulation, but if I was concerned about regulation as many Bitcoiners tout, PoW would not be an effective way of implementing regulation resistance.')
