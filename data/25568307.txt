A good start (that comes to mind) would be a convention for &quot;body text&quot; allowing a parser to convert a document between formats, or building a good &#x27;standard library&#x27; of common plugins. Its heavy use of macros and non-standard plugins definitely seems like a big problem for conversion, comprehension and even conserving documents. I do find it wonderful for what it is.')
