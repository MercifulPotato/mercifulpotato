(if any)<p>It&#x27;s a topic I&#x27;m interested in. Mainly to see examples (and learn from them) about when people prefer lax licenses on the style of &quot;do what you want with this, including a closed-source proprietary business&quot; (MIT, Apache) which has allowed in the past that big Co&#x27;s. benefit from it without giving back (lots of cases in HN), vs. strong copyleft &quot;do what you want except closed-source proprietary stuff&quot; style (generally speaking, the GPL family -- EDIT: I know that this, being mainly a server-side thing, would be more affected by AGPL than by GPL. Bear with me.).<p>If there are no business &#x2F; commercialization intentions in the foreseeable future, would it make sense to use a GPL license (one of them) to build a strong open-source community?<p>Or it doesn&#x27;t matter in practice? (i.e. it doesn&#x27;t really affect the chances of building a good and strong developer community)')
