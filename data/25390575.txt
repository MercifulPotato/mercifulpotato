Mosfets are small devices, but cables have a lot of surface area and mass, so even dissipating kW into a cable is not an issue and can be solved with liquid cooling.<p>Imagine we used 35mm2 at 0.55 Ohm&#x2F;km and we have 2 poles.\nIf the charging cable is 3m including inside the device, that’s 2x3 = 6m. That’s 6.6 mOhms total, so I2R on that at 500A is only 1.65kW, which is nothing.')
