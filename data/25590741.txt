Basic jobs provide plenty of skills and lessons that cannot be learned while sitting at home, such as dealing with customers, time management, and basic problem solving in a work environment.<p>I think the better option is to guarantee a minimum wage through a subsidy, while abolishing all minimum wage laws. Like a negative income tax. So let&#x27;s say you earn $12 stocking shelves, the government should subsidize $4 per hour to give you a total income of $16 per hour. If you make $15&#x2F;hr, they subsidize $1. If you make $20, they subsidize zero.<p>In this way, the downsides of minimum wages are avoided (cutting back on hours, laying people off, raising prices, and pricing low skill people out of the workforce), while still allowing a decent income for anyone working full time.<p>You can tax the subsidy at a higher rate than your normal tax rate, so that businesses are still dealing with competitive market incentives and cannot pay a $1&#x2F;hr leaving the remainder to the government, and so that employees are always incentivized to take the highest paying job.<p>If you run the numbers, providing every employee in america with a $16 minimum wage, working 40 hours per week, and assuming the average employee making less than $16 makes $12, would cost $500 billion per year. This is not an out of reach policy.')
