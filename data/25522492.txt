Automate it.<p>I used to use three huge monitors at work, but since working at home during Covid I&#x27;ve found that I not only like typing on my HP laptop&#x27;s built-in keyboard better than on my full-sized mechanical keyboard, but I mostly prefer just using the laptop&#x27;s display to using multiple displays, and for exactly the reason you gave -- I&#x27;m better off automating things and serializing work from the command line. I&#x27;ve made aliases for opening the web sites I need from the command line and usually just kill them when I&#x27;m done with them, instead of using tabs. It really does have a kind of head-clearing effect.')
