It doesn&#x27;t from my end.<p>I&#x27;ve done a lot of &quot;surprising&quot; things, healthwise, over the years and there seems to be no means whatsoever to make people on the internet happy with how I talk about it. No amount of bending over backwards to signal &quot;this was something really, really, ordinary, I swear!!!!!&quot; is ever enough to protect me from people reacting with animosity and I almost never know if it&#x27;s because they do recognize me and know something about my back story or if it&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t recognize me.<p>For me, it&#x27;s a no win situation and it&#x27;s not possible for me to guess what the magic words are that will keep everyone happy and get me out of the corner with the dunce&#x27;s cap for the crime of not dying years ago from my serious medical condition because I&#x27;m so incredibly rude like that.')
