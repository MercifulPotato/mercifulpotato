Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602443592, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24743881, text='&gt; If I had to pick a thing to make Google give up, it would probably be YouTube and not Chrome.<p>You don&#x27;t have to pick a thing though. For some reason the article title highlights Chrome, but the article makes clear that they&#x27;re considering many options, only one of which is Chrome.<p>To me it&#x27;s interesting that Google has the #1 or #2 market share in so many different areas: search, advertising, web browsers, mobile OS, app stores, email, maps. There are so many, I&#x27;m surely forgetting some. DNS? Office suites? In almost any area that Google wants to enter, they automatically become one of the biggest players. The only thing they couldn&#x27;t do was make a social network...<p>EDIT: I forgot online video, duh!<p>Maybe we need a bunch of Baby Googles, like the Baby Bells after the breakup of Ma Bell.')
