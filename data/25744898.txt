There will never be a yes&#x2F;no debate about whether or not it&#x27;s raining.<p>There will be a debate about whether climate change is going to cause huge problems and therefore mitigation measures are needed - some of which may lead to higher taxes. For some people.<p>Objectively the answer to the first part of that question is &quot;yes&quot;. At this point there is no plausible argument to be made for any other position. Denying it makes as much sense as claiming that it&#x27;s not raining when it is.<p>But interest groups who are horrified by the second part can use a standard repertoire of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) techniques to persuade less educated voters that it&#x27;s not true., And also that <i>they are being victimised by the people who are saying it is.</i><p>Which is why public debates aren&#x27;t about facts or evidence. They&#x27;re about &quot;<i>Who is the victim</i> - and is it going to be you?&quot;<p>Once that frame has been established it&#x27;s very difficult to break out of it, because the debate is neither adult nor rational.<p>And this is the frame in which public debate has operated in the US since at least the 50s, and probably longer.<p>Which is not to deny that some people are victimised by others, but to point out that it&#x27;s very easy for those who are perpetrators to claim victimhood too - and to do it convincingly, even when it&#x27;s nonsense, by using FUD, lies, and other rhetorical tricks in bad faith.<p>Trying to push for ground truth and pointing out logical fallacies will do less than expected to prevent that, because the rhetorical games that are being played operate on a different level.')
