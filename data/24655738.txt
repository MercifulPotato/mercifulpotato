You can see my work from those projects and others on my Github profile. (I also have some older projects at gitlab.com&#x2F;lawsonpd that I have yet to migrate to Github.) The bootcamp focused on data analysis, machine learning and Ethereum smart contracts. Before the bootcamp most of my experience was in web development. I&#x27;m definitely more of a generalist than a specialist, so I&#x27;m open to any opportunity that encourages learning, experimenting and making things that help people. Thanks for the consideration!')
