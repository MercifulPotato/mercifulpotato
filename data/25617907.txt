So you can use that tag&#x27;s control&#x27;s manually even if they don&#x27;t give a button<p>So for this, something like:\n$(&quot;video&quot;).playbackRate = 2<p>or whatever. It&#x27;s nice even for players with controls (like YT) if you want more than 2x speed<p>Also you can just look at the video tag&#x27;s internal URL and just download and play however, offline :)')
