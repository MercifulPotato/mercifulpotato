Memory limit is 3GB. Payload sizes are 256kb max.<p>If you are used to batch processing large amounts of data, Lambda seems to be the exact opposite of this. I think it is good for &quot;small data, highly concurrent event processing&quot; but this is a very different use case from batch processing data pipelines.')
