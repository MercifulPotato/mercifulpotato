(If I had any, not buying ETH in this situation :)<p>&gt; To add, they did start out providing the software as you say. After a certain point though, their efforts were outpaced by community effort or business opportunities arising in the Ethereum ecosystem.<p>Do you notice that you&#x27;re actually arguing in favor of my point? :)<p>You say that their efforts were &quot;outpaced&quot;, i.e. they failed.
