At this point it would’ve been cheaper just to buy a commercial mount, but it’s been a fun learning experience.<p>I’m using brushless motors in a direct-drive configuration so the ’tracker’ is nearly silent and can track quite rapidly.  Have a 20 hour print running right now, hope to have it running in some capacity in a few weeks and prove to my kiddo that i <i>can</i> finish a project lol.')
