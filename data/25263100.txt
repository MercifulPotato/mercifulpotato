And that’s just what we demonstrated from saati’s comment onwards in the example of Sway: that if you want to go Wayland, you’re stuck with bad functionality. Because graphics cards and computers are powerful enough, many people will be able to live with this crippled functionality and <i>might</i> not even notice it, but compare it with the story for AMD dedicated GPUs, or AMD or Intel integrated GPUs, and the point is substantiated: if you want to actually use the GPU fully, you just can’t do so properly.<p>(And a large portion of the problems people are talking about are with Nouveau; people that <i>can</i> use the proprietary driver—specifically, people using X rather than Wayland—will have a better time of it, though <i>still</i> worse than with GPUs of other brands.)')
