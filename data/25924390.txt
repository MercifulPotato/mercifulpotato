It fills the same role as Twitter, but people&#x27;s posts disappear after a few seconds, making it better than Twitter.<p>I&#x27;m serious here. Twitter&#x27;s a cesspool filled with people venting about random crap. So is Ventscape. We all need to vent sometimes, there&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with that. But the problem with Twitter is that it preserves and amplifies your venting until the end of time, which is the absolute worst thing to do with venting.<p>Similar to the advice that when you&#x27;re angry at someone you should write them an email, pour it all out and then delete that email instead of sending it.<p>Sometimes we need to get stuff off of our chest but the insanity of the modern world is that once we do, it&#x27;s archived and mined and maybe even used against us 15 years later.<p>Ventscape solves that problem (conditional on its privacy and data retention policies I suppose...)')
