The main idea is that we first need to find a problem, then create and market a product promise (landing page), and only after finding a valid interest, start building an MVP.<p>I&#x27;m totally okay with this approach:\n1. Discover a problem\n2. Talk to people by manually posting on Reddit, FB, HN, other relevant communities, making calls on Lunchclub (if you want an invite, tell me), etc. Doing things that don&#x27;t scale but also that costs only your time and $0.\n3. Build an MVP if the problem exists<p>But Gigi suggests that you:\n1. Find a problem.\n2. Describe your solution in words and design. (I guess it means to build a landing page)\n3. Market (he means launch a real paid marketing campaign on FB and measuring CTR and landing page&#x27;s CTA) your product promise until you find a promise that a big enough group of people really want.\n4. Then build your MVP.<p>What do you think? Is it okay to find the first 20-100 people by buying ads or this should be done manually and once you understand that problem exists and you know who has it and what messages work - do marketing?<p>ps. I love everything NFX is doing and posting that&#x27;s why I want to better understand this approach to finding PMF.')
