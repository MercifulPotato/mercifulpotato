I would <i>love</i> to switch my systems off of x86, but I can&#x27;t buy anything performant for a price that I&#x27;m willing to spend on hardware. I might yet try a Pi 4 as a desktop with USB for disk, but that&#x27;s hacky and still suffers from performance problems. Or, I could get something with good performance, either POWER or ARM, but then I&#x27;d have to pay through the nose for the privilege. Now, some of this is market size: I get my x86 boxes at a huge discount by buying used, and high-end ARM&#x2F;POWER machines aren&#x27;t popular enough to really show up on eBay (yet). But in practice, there&#x27;s just no good options.')
