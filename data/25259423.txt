That&#x27;s what Americans do, we kill muslims in the name of Jesus. That&#x27;s all we know how to do anymore. I can&#x27;t stop that.<p>However, I paid $60k in taxes last year, and I basically will not be able to find work this year thanks to covid.  I&#x27;m struggling, and NONE of that money I&#x27;ve given is coming back to me. I&#x27;ve been paying taxes on income since I was 15, 26 years, and my government basically told me to go fuck myself.<p>I&#x27;ve also generated many millions of dollars for YC startups, helped them get funding, helped them get employees. Now that I can&#x27;t find work, everyone who used to call me up constantly asking me for help has fucked off.<p>BTW, Alex from Pagerduty, I hope you get covid and die you greedy piece of trash! You should have been kicked off the internet for ignoring someone trying to rape one of your employees.')
