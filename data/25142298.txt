It can be slower but even on low end devices, CSS is so insanely fast, you would need an HTML source in the tens of MB&#x27;s range to cause noticeable performance problems. Also, CSS classes do make that even less of a problem. Inline styles are fast enough, and classes are faster by default, so Tailwind wins there.<p>Page load times are interesting, but again, unless you&#x27;re loading an insane amount of data from the server, it will never be a real issue.<p>Some sort of component architecture solves the problem you bring up w&#x2F; duplication. You should never be writing the same thing 100x over. JS frameworks all render 100&#x27;s of the same component with the same attributes and performance is fine for 99% of real use cases.<p>The downsides for Tailwind all revolve around personal preference and how your team organizes a project. There is no performance hit (unless you ship the entire un-purged CSS file to production, even then, it&#x27;s minimal).')
