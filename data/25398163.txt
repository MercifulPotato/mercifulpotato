Microtransactions can be purely cosmetic like skins, so it doesn&#x27;t matter when it comes to gameplay, or extensions which had levels&#x2F;story&#x2F;whatever to an existing game. So microtransactions aren&#x27;t bad, especially in a free 2 play game. What EA and co are doing on the other hand is different, it&#x27;s called &#x27;pay 2 win&#x27;, the more you pay, the easier it gets to win whatever you have to win in that game (or progress faster). The latter is a questionable practice.<p>Pay 2 win games should absolutely be regulated and be 18+ only.')
