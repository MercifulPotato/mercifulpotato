Also sometimes when you feel this way, your brain trying to tell you something - useally something about your health. So make sure you visit a doctor or at very least talk to one on video chat. And I agree with others here, no point in worrying over something you have no control over. And finally find something that will help you forget about this. Like reading, watching something, working etc. Hope it helps! (EDIT) This is just a tought, but sometimes living in a partical place can cause this too. Especially if you are sensative emotionally and have health problems. Hunted house comes to mind...')
