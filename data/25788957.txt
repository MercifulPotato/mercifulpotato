Most installers also add their tools to that same PATH, so on Windows this is all pretty easy to accomplish. The problem is, if you don&#x27;t know what environment variables are, the GUI won&#x27;t be of any use to you.<p>You shouldn&#x27;t need one though. Environment variables are one of the core basics of any program, and you&#x27;ll need to learn about them eventually. The same thing is true if you can&#x27;t deal with the terminal; there&#x27;s a few &quot;magic&quot; commands to learn but most of the terminal stuff is just &quot;how does this computer thing even work&quot;.<p>Most programming tools and languages, as well as their documentation, assume you know how to manage your computer when you start programming them, as well as some basic knowledge of how an operating system works. These tools and their getting started guides are written for people who know the basics of their computer and programming, and want to try out a new language like JS. If they&#x27;re too technical for you, you&#x27;re not the target audience. You&#x27;d get much more out of a book explaining you the basics step by step.<p>The terminal is everything but opaque; you tell the computer exactly what you want rather than clicking the &quot;just make it work&quot; button. You&#x27;re in control instead of letting some tool assume what&#x27;s best for you. In my experience, the &quot;one button to fix all&quot; systems will work for a while but once they break (and they will) they&#x27;re basically unrepairable without deep knowledge of the tooling and its configuration as well as the defaults the installer chose for you and why they&#x27;re now messing up.<p>A problem with Javascript and Python development is that the setup is very complex and that guides become outdated (especially for web dev). There&#x27;s loads of edge cases to deal with so there&#x27;s loads of configurations and options most tooling supports. The magic install button would lead many to ruin their operating system configuration because they&#x27;ve already installed another tool that might also have had a magic install button. These tools don&#x27;t operate in a vacuum, they influence each other.<p>If you just want to program code, grab a great big IDE like MS Visual Studio on Windows (the full one, not Code) or XCode on Mac (no experience there, but it&#x27;s trivial to install at least). The experience of getting started programming in C# is very easy, just select the types of program you want to be able to make (or &quot;all&quot; if you don&#x27;t care) during setup and your tool is set up. No fiddling with the command line, just a shortcut on your desktop. You won&#x27;t be making any websites in them from the start, but they&#x27;ll provide you with an environment that Just Works for writing your first program, moet likely a console window that says &quot;hello world&quot;.<p>If you want to get started in web dev, you don&#x27;t need node or any terminal work, just a good text editor to write your own HTML, CSS and JS files in. Sure, node is what people use in production, but it&#x27;s only complicating things if you&#x27;re just getting started. Guides from ten years ago on how to write HTML and Javascript are still perfectly functional if you&#x27;re just starting out.<p>If that&#x27;s still to much to grasp, there&#x27;s kits out there for Raspberry Pis that come prepackaged with tutorials and with exercise books for programming in scratch and Python. Your only barrier to entry there is the money to buy the kit. You&#x27;ll still have to learn everything and work through stackoverflow or technical documentation all the time, but you won&#x27;t need to bother with any terminals at least.<p>Complaining that programming is too hard because there&#x27;s no fancy GUI for every tool is like me complaining that finances are too hard because I can&#x27;t walk into a bank and start making money without reading all kinds of boring books about finances. There&#x27;s easy ways to get started if you know where to look, but in the end you&#x27;ll always need some knowledge about the field you&#x27;re entering to get started without paying someone to teach you directly.')
