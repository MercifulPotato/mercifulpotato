Item(by='breck', descendants=None, kids=[25781640], score=None, time=1610653834, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25781331, text='&gt; You quote one of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s most famous lines, and\nyou&#x27;re telling the reader they missed your point if they\ndidn&#x27;t take it to be about copyright? Did I miss the real\n&quot;&#x2F;s&quot;?<p>The OP wasn&#x27;t paying attention to important context.\nIt would be like if someone at Reagan&#x27;s speech said,<p>&quot;There&#x27;s no substance to that line. It wouldn&#x27;t have been\non TV except for the person who said it. It&#x27;s hard to see\nhow something like this is going to generate useful\ndiscussion. Is it the color of the wall or the dimensions of\nthe wall that he has a problem with?&quot;<p>PG, a man with a huge reach, nothing to gain (and a lot to\nlose) from taking a stand on such a controversial issue that\nthe public is far from knowing what the just side is, who\ndoesn&#x27;t mince words and thinks deeply about topics until he\narrives at the truth, just came out and stated his support\nfor Sci-Hub. Beyond the practical matter that he is at least\nan acquaintence of @jack&#x27;s, perhaps even a friend (I have no\nknowledge of their relationship, other than I had a YC\ndinner a long time ago with them), and this might lead to\n@Sci_hub&#x27;s reinstatement, it is an inspirational message for\nthose of us who are fighting so that every child has access\nto the world&#x27;s best information. YMMV, but I personally would consider the abolition of copyrights and patents to be bigger than the reunification of Germany in the long run.<p>Context matters. The substance is deep.')
