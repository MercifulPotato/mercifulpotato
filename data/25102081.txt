Different places banning different things. But they need to be honest so people know what they&#x27;re getting into. Twitter is a progressive space.<p>I&#x27;m curious if Gab bans support of antifa. They couldn&#x27;t claim it&#x27;s about indirectly inciting violence, because they come close to the line when it comes to Nazi opinions. They do ban porn, which is fine with me. There&#x27;s plenty of porn and it doesn&#x27;t benefit from a network effect the same way. And I&#x27;m glad every place bans spam.')
