I already brought forth a comparison between traditional and internet advertisement that you have not disproved. How would you get your customers for your one-person business without internet ads?<p>&gt; the harm Facebook has created<p>You keep claiming it, and yet I&#x27;m to see any examples of that harm. Internet, including Facebook and Youtube enabled wider political discourse that existed before, all around the globe. If you happen to dislike some of that political discourse, then your problem is with other people&#x27;s political opinions, not with the medium that they choose to exchange it.<p>It&#x27;s like being mad at a printing press because you don&#x27;t like what&#x27;s written in the paper.<p>&gt; the internet as a whole is what lowers the barriers, not Facebook ads per se.<p>What is the internet if not the websites hosted on it? Facebook IS a part of the internet, so distinction between it and the internet &quot;as a whole&quot; is quite meaningless here. All properties that Facebook and Google have that we are discussing, are logical consequences of the internet. If it would happen to be Altavista and Livejournal, we would still have a pretty similar conversation about the very same software engineers working to optimise CTRs.')
