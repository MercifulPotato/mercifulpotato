Those who are concerned with running their workloads in Kubernetes, anyway.<p>The part of Kubernetes that runs containers has had a shim for docker along with an interface for runtimes to use. It&#x27;s called the Container Runtime Interface (CRI). The docker shim that worked alongside CRI is being deprecated and now all runtimes (including Docker) will need to use the CRI interface.<p>These days there are numerous container runtimes one can use. containerd and cri-o are two of them. Container images built with Docker can be run with either of these without anyone noticing.')
