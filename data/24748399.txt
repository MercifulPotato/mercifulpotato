I&#x27;m not sure whether it uses GraphHopper or not.<p>But, when routing from Santa Cruz to San Francisco, every time there&#x27;s a freeway offramp that parallels the freeway and then rejoins it, the osmand routing wants me to take that offramp. So that I can then, just a few seconds later, get back on to the freeway.<p>This isn&#x27;t just annoying, it&#x27;s dangerous. If that&#x27;s you, can you fix it? And if not, can you make sure you don&#x27;t do the same thing?')
