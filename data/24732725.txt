It&#x27;s value is on it being equally foreign yet approachable for all the salient parties and therefore a conceivable acceptable neutral turf for everyone to share.<p>Ironically, the case for Dvorak keyboards is kind of the opposite: QWERTY was intentionally designed to avoid jams, which if anything biased towards making it more difficult.<p>It&#x27;s not so much technical superiority as having a design objective that is more appropriate for the problem space.<p>One can similarly argue about whether &quot;QUEL&quot; is really technically superior to &quot;SQL&quot;, but the design objective is (at least as perceived by the author) better aligned with the solution space.')
