Our version of CDC agency have clearly stated all along that herd immunity is not the goal.<p>Life in Sweden changed dramatically with the outbreak and the number of deaths have a few reasonable explanations, IMO.<p>The Swedish “CDC” have pushed for long term resilience and believe that strict prolonged lockdowns will be impossible to maintain.<p>Other countries have had a far more political response to this pandemic.<p>Second wave obviously pushing forwards - other Euro countries locking down again.<p>This is kind of ironic as Swedes probably would put up with being locked down better than most other populations. We’re famous for “waiting in line” and following signs and directions - we would suffer lockdown, but in general we simply follow directions, so the idea was it would be ineffective.')
