Item(by='garmaine', descendants=None, kids=[24798704, 24798546, 24796724], score=None, time=1602812343, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24796215, text='&gt; MDMA can be a shockingly mind-altering drug for some people, and usually in what they self-report as a good way.<p>The problem is self-reporting as a good change means nothing here. What you really want to know is if the original person, knowing the full transformation, would prefer the outcome. You don&#x27;t get that because the person making the self-report is the person that already underwent the change.<p>For example, if I had a pill that made you a serial killer, but nevertheless very good at it, enjoying it, and totally lacking empathy for your victims, you&#x27;d probably self-report as being happier too.  But the you of today would be horrified.<p>If I held conservative Catholic views, that&#x27;s probably what MDMA would seem like. I&#x27;d be happy with who I am with strong moral values, but there&#x27;d be this scary pill out there that could make me give all that up, destroying what meaning my life had previously. It&#x27;s not much consolation that I&#x27;d later self-report it as a positive change.<p>Lobotomies used to be justified based on self-reported outcomes. Is there anything objectively different here?')
