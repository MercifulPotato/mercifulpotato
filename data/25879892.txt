I borrow a share from Person A, and I sell it to Person B. Person A and Person B now both own 1 share, and I own -1 shares. The total shares outstanding is still 1 share (2 + -1), but the float has increased. The short interest, as commonly reported, will be -100%. But it&#x27;s actually only 50% of the shares that could trade. The effective float has increased by the size of the short interest.')
