In fact, some of the bugs you posted are alread solved and I can&#x27;t find one bug related to displaying. Giving the display to the user could also lie in other code parts. We&#x27;ll see how this ends, but it&#x27;s already a huge gain that not every Everyday Linux user has experienced such things by themselves.')
