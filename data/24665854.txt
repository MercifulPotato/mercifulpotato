Sigmoids don&#x27;t have hysterisis, and you have to backflow a memristor for it to recover which is not true of biological nuerons.<p>(The activation function <i>is</i> the neuron(&#x27;s mathematical model) - we elide everything that happens internal to the neuron and model it as only its inputs and outputs.)')
