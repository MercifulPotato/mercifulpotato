Who are you arguing against? Still, the scale of GPT-3&#x27;s model makes it novel, useful, and interesting.<p>&gt;GPT-3 doesn&#x27;t have any knowledge of how the world actually works.<p>I agree, it lacks what we&#x27;d consider robust, semantic models of common sense knowledge. However, my dog doesn&#x27;t understand how the world actually works either, yet he can do many things most people would consider intelligent. Besides, most people are able to operate mobile phones, play computer games, operator automobiles, and turn on the lights without knowing how these things &quot;actually&quot; work. So is that even a prerequisite for intelligence?<p>&gt;Some people<p>Who specifically? I have to admit, the views you are criticizing are preposterous but then what I want to know is why you&#x27;re wasting your time and ours criticizing such junk?
