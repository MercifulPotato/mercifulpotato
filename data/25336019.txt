Pretty much any guy can improve his dating outcomes by moving from SF to NYC, no matter what his standards are and what he&#x27;s looking for, mostly because you can actually get regular dates with the accomplished, independent women there.<p>I have one friend who lived at a base in Antarctica for awhile, and he favorably compared the dating scene there to what&#x27;s in SF.')
