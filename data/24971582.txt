A t3.micro works out to $3&#x2F;mo. Storage and bandwidth, for my use-cases, amount to less than a dollar a month.<p>Are there any other providers that compete on the low end like this? The common suggestions (DO, Linode, etc.) all cost at least twice as much.<p>I buy the author&#x27;s argument for &quot;real&quot; use-cases where you need one or more expensive servers. But I also see this argument made to people using AWS for personal use, and I&#x27;ve never understood it. Am I missing something?<p>I don&#x27;t need a massive server, I need something that can run code, and that&#x27;s always on. AWS <i>seems</i> really cheap on the low end, and those machines are more than powerful enough to host your own email, files, projects, etc.')
