What are relevant criteria to assert that a liberal democracy has been organized in &quot;the best way&quot;? Is it possible to agree on a fixed set of criteria? Is it possible to draw a model that matches reality? What game rules are you going to feed your model? Can you discern first principles that you&#x27;re going to agree on and keep to build on top of?<p>The more questions and follow up questions you ask, the more concrete&#x2F;tangible your answers will become.<p>Also, ask questions about yourself too. For instance, which biases can you identify with yourself? Are you able to avoid them?<p>In this case: how do you want to answer &quot;best way&quot;? If you are seeking an answer in absolute terms, then you may risk ending up in a logical tarpit discussing the existence of objective truth. Here you have a red flag: Is this question even a complete or answerable question?<p>So, it helps to question the question itself too. Maybe you need to bend the question before it can yield a worthwhile answer?')
