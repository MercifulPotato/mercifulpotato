Does anyone know what those tweets were?<p>Edit: Oh, damn, I had just seen the Twitter Safety and just assumed that this was linking to that, not to a separate blogpost. As many people have pointed out it was for these two tweets:<p>On January 8, 2021, President Donald J. Trump tweeted:<p>“The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!”<p>Shortly thereafter, the President tweeted:<p>“To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.”')
