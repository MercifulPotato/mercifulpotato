I saw her in constant pain and it really hurt. She used to get physical therapy, tons of professional heat therapy and forced stretching as well. It lasted for about a year and it went away. She is much older now but that thing hasn&#x27;t come back yet. I can understand his pain even though I cannot feel it.')
