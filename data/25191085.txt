There&#x27;s a fairly large gap from &quot;there is a security exploit being used in the wild&quot; to &quot;this exploit was intentional.&quot; This seems much more like the software equivalent of Chinesium.<p>This really reeks of corner-cutting and negligence. The only way around corner-cutting is to make it expensive and make &quot;doing it right&quot; the cheapest, most profitable way to build something. We can do that with hefty fines for retailers selling this garbage (I think there needs to be more onus on domestic businesses shoveling shit without smelling it first) and creating open hardware&#x2F;software stacks that are easy to put in a box and sell for $20 on Amazon without hiring any software developers that could screw it up.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cybernews.com&#x2F;security&#x2F;walmart-exclusive-routers-others-made-in-china-contain-backdoors-to-control-devices&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cybernews.com&#x2F;security&#x2F;walmart-exclusive-routers-oth...</a>')
