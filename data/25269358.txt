That&#x27;s what happened with Ethereum Classic and it could happen again. I think less likely unless there&#x27;s a vulnerability discovered in Eth2, though.<p>Also less likely because in some ways the Ethereum Classic incident helped cement Ethereum&#x27;s place by scaring off all the ideologues and keeping the participants who were more pragmatic.')
