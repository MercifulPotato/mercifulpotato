I can empathize with that expression of anger even if it is ultimately misguided, counter productive, and ultimately probably feeding and perpetuating the racist stereo type.<p>While the Japanese person in Japan being racist against this non-Japanese person and seeking him out to beat him up deserves no such empathy.
