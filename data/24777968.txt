Item(by='mindslight', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602690510, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24777401, text='&gt; <i>3rd party web services easily discovering when I need an oil change, or what days I&#x27;ve been driving aggressively ... is the kind of hypothetical I would want laws actively preventing.</i><p>But <i>why</i>, if it would still require your consent? Not faux consent based on click through or economic pressure, but real consent in the way the GDPR is getting at.<p>&gt; <i>But at least manufacturers have national brands which could be hurt by selling or leaking massive amounts of data about their customers. Perhaps some brands could even make privacy a selling point.</i><p>This doesn&#x27;t seem to be playing out for any other industry, even ones with much lower barriers to switching (eg cell phones, supermarkets, credit cards). Privacy just does not seem to be a market differentiator. Car purchase timeframe is on the order of a decade (especially for the type of people concerned with autonomy that don&#x27;t lease). So you buy a car from a brand that isn&#x27;t selling your data, and a few years later they turn around and sell your data anyway. Then do you grin and bear it, or sell your car at a loss and go back to the market just to get screwed again? Until there is a privacy law, self help to prevent anyone getting your data in the first place is the only real option here.<p>&gt; <i>But best I can tell, no other law covers it in MA. It is perfectly legal for 3rd parties to sell this and other data without my explicit consent or even an opportunity to opt out</i><p>Yes, this is the root of our society&#x27;s privacy&#x2F;surveillance problem. The CCPA is relatively recent, and even that has been neutered to appease entrenched interests.<p>Companies want to hold power over you by selling your data, and also by withholding your own data from you. Being hesitant to address the second problem because of unknown unknowns about the first problem seems like the path of self-defeat. I&#x27;d love to see another ballot initiative that addresses privacy by retaining control of our data, but this is orthogonal.')
