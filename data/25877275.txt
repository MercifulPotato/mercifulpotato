For any kind of scrolling I just hold a sidebutton down and roll the ball, it&#x27;s very handy and feels better then using a wheel, even if imprecise.<p>For exact scrolling I&#x27;ll use the scroll wheel or dive for the scrollbar.<p>What I really want is a toggle bound to a button for enabling&#x2F;disabling drag scrolling. Most of my flow is keyboard based so being able to toggle that on&#x2F;off for a dedicated stroller would be great.')
