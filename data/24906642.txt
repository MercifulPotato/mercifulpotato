This repo even has the following caveat:\n(2) These usually end up becoming a custom micro-framework, thereby questioning why you didn&#x27;t use one of the established and tested libraries&#x2F;frameworks in the first place.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t hate it. For quite some time, I&#x27;ve taken the stance that a web development team needs an opinionated framework, but it&#x27;s fine for it to be a bespoke creation rather than off-the-shelf. The biggest value of choosing React, Vue, Svelte, etc is, in my opinion, less about it doing the heavy lifting for you with the DOM and more about adopting an established valid opinion to guide the team&#x27;s development.')
