Dates were represented as strings in &quot;YYYYMMDD&quot; format (so today would be &quot;20210113053923&quot;) instead of UNIX timestamps, certain fields were duplicated for no reason (e.g. every object would have an identical &quot;id&quot; and &quot;_id&quot; key), counts of impressions&#x2F;comments&#x2F;etc would be the display strings rather than raw numbers (so &quot;2k&quot; or &quot;5m&quot;), and various moderation flags were in place like a boolean &quot;sensitive&quot; which was always false, even for posts that had been downvoted significantly.')
