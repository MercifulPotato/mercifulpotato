No, a few racist individuals don&#x27;t count, we&#x27;ll always have plenty of those.<p>The status quo doesn&#x27;t favour white men, it favours old white men who were doing business 50 years ago and made a fortune.\nIt&#x27;s not white male privilege, it&#x27;s a minority of old white men who made more money compared to other social groups, because of racism and because women were spending their time growing children and nurturing society instead of working.<p>There is plenty of poor white men.<p>And I&#x27;m not mentioning men soldiers, men doing dangerous jobs, men in prison, men who lose everything because of a divorce or men who commit suicide.')
