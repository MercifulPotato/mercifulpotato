Maybe everyone had skeletons in their closet, but if you have email proof of skeletons I&#x27;m starting to wonder if you&#x27;re such a good person.<p>Also there&#x27;s an argument that &quot;good people&quot; can be blackmailed for INVENTED misconduct, but wouldn&#x27;t such fake emails be more convincing without the ability to verify their origins? Making real emails and fake emails more similar protects people who have their incriminating emails leaked, but it also harms the defence of people who have fake emails targeting them &quot;leaked&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s a high bar for obfuscating truth and I don&#x27;t believe this argument meets it.')
