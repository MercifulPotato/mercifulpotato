Do they also not have a pension or a job at a publicly traded company? Have they never bought insurance or opened a bank account.<p>What most people don&#x27;t get is that they rely on financial markets 100 times a day. That&#x27;s why when markets wobble there is a shit storm. That&#x27;s why they get bailed out.<p>I&#x27;d like a more equal distribution of wealth. I&#x27;d prefer that doctors and teachers got paid more rather than traders. But ultimately there are very good reasons things are the way they are.<p>You can say Fuck them all, but then we&#x27;ll have to go back to living like people in the second world.<p>This is WHY ordinary people need to understand things like finance (or trade or geopolitics). They watch the TV, they see something they don&#x27;t like, and instead of understanding its a least bad outcome (eg 2008) or that their behaviour in part caused it (eg 2008) they just write it off as a conspiracy.<p>If they&#x27;re lucky it ends there. If not, some liar comes along and capitalises on their belief (eg trump) promising to &quot;bring back out jobs&quot; &quot;drain the swamp&quot; &quot;make the elite pay&quot; etc. Since he&#x27;s a liar only peddling convient but untrue stories, he won&#x27;t deliver. Which is disappointing but actually better than if he did.')
