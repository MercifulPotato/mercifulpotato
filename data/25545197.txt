Item(by='deeviant', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609006380, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25544432, text='&gt; Transferring 2700 megajoules of energy to an f150 via gasoline in a few minutes is very convenient, something that would take a Tesla a few hours.<p>A 75% charge can happen in ~20 minutes on something like a 250kw Telsa super charger. Battery tech and battery charging tech will only get better&#x2F;faster. Also the vast majority miles driven on the road aren&#x27;t &quot;road trip&quot; miles in which you would see the drive-to-fuel&#x2F;energy exhaustion over and over for days on end scenario. When a Tesla plugs in at home and charges over night, that&#x27;s actually <i>more</i> convenient than having to go to a gas station.')
