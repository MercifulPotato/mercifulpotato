My point is that assuming what folkhack says is true, then the &quot;we&#x27;ll just educate people&quot; idea might just not be feasible -- maybe it just straight up requires laws that force businesses to care.<p>At least for websites in general we can do things outside of the law that force people&#x27;s hands. Google can deprioritize search results for pages that are inaccessible, but that won&#x27;t really affect web apps. Maybe there are non-legislative technological penalties we could impose there as well; if there are certain things that <i>only</i> buttons can do, or if browsers start identifying pages&#x2F;apps that are inaccessible and displaying warnings on them, or locking certain features.<p>SSL didn&#x27;t really get solved until browsers started putting a big scary warning next to the URL bar that said the page was insecure. All the education and tooling was helpful, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to make businesses care until their customers started asking them why Chrome&#x2F;Firefox was saying that their app was insecure. It&#x27;s tricky. I don&#x27;t want the accessibility community to be the villain here, but it does kind of sound like commercial businesses need to be dragged into an accessible world even if they&#x27;re kicking and screaming about it.')
