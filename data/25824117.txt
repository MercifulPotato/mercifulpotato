Let’s posit that laws against spousal rape and gender discrimination are good things. Are those the only things that have changed in our culture and in the laws? Can we have laws allowing people to escape abusive marriages, while discouraging the vastly larger number of divorces that don’t involve those things?<p>More than half of Americans, including over 40% of <i>Democrats</i>, disagree with the proposition that “changing gender roles have made it easier for women to live satisfying lives.” <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewsocialtrends.org&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;18&#x2F;wide-partisan-gaps-in-u-s-over-how-far-the-country-has-come-on-gender-equality&#x2F;psdt_10-18-17_gender-00-01" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewsocialtrends.org&#x2F;2017&#x2F;10&#x2F;18&#x2F;wide-partisan-gap...</a>. By contrast, just 10% think that contraceptives should be banned. There is clearly a significant number of people who think the changes you list are good things, while disagreeing that all of the social changes that have happened are good.<p>There is in fact widespread discontentment about the status quo among women. Women report wanting more kids than they end up having. Women report wanting to get married but being unable to do so. Many women aren’t super thrilled about a culture where people call them “crazy” for wanting normal things like a marriage and kids at the biologically normal ages (20s) for having those things. (This is completely unsurprising, because women disproportionately bear the burdens of our social changes that have freed men from the responsibilities of fatherhood.)<p>As to Bangladesh—it’s a poor agrarian society that suffers from the problems endemic to poor agrarian societies. In particular, strong economic incentives to marry off girls. My dad, in fact, works on public health programs to discourage child marriage in Bangladesh. But there’s a pretty big gap between child marriage (something most Bangladeshis agree we should eradicate) on one hand, and normalizing and enabling pervasive divorce and out of wedlock childbirth on the other.<p>But on the flip side of all that, Bangladeshi society is at least somewhat functional despite crushing poverty. What would Bangladeshi villages be like if men could decide, like in America, that they don’t want the responsibilities of fatherhood and it was socially acceptable for them to abandon their families? The society would break down completely. Death and calamity would result, because unlike in America the government can’t afford to throw money at the social ills that would result.')
