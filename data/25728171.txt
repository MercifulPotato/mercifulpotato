I prefer it because if I get a newer iPhone tomorrow I still want all of my conversations and all history to be there. I question how many people can to a SIM takeover. No, it&#x27;s not &quot;everyone&quot;. Very few will actually do it and it seems it was a marketing tradeoff. Quite a normal practice and Telegram is not an outlier in this case.<p>&gt; <i>You think the UAE is better? I live here, it’s not. If the US government wants access to telegram conversation logs, the UAE government will happily retrieve them.</i><p>Sigh. Suspected, but never knew for sure. Thanks for letting me know. Now &quot;all&quot; that remains is for somebody to both incorporate end-to-end encrypted chats and allow synchronization of history between devices without a central server, in a single app, I suppose. But Telegram isn&#x27;t that app and I am aware and okay with it.')
