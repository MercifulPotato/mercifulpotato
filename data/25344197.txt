Ubur&#x2F;Lyft are somewhat close, but that market platform and co-ordination would never have happened without them.<p>Hotels &#x2F; housing are an issue because of predatory monetary practices.  As a society (at least in the US) we don&#x27;t have planned community retirement, so anything expensive becomes a defacto investment vehicle.  This leads to a preference for any policy that inflates the cost of housing, which directly leads to NIMBY and combines with anti-sprawl measures to constrain supply.  At that point basic econ101 applies and prices just keep going up without ever correcting (anywhere jobs exist).<p>Social media and the other MITM attacks are probably symptoms of the same issue; yet I&#x27;m not quite sure what a true root cause and solution are.  It might require personal AI secretaries or something similar that are interest aligned with the individual users, rather than any corporation or government.  (To facilitate schedule arrangements that are optimal.)')
