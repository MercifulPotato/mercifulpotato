(Or correct me if I&#x27;m asking the wrong question).<p>I used to love using lambdas in Python, along with map&#x2F;reduce&#x2F;filter but for whatever reason the Python community has turned against it. Map and filter can now be nicely done with list comprehensions, although I still haven&#x27;t found a decent one-line equivalent for reduce (other then importing functools).')
