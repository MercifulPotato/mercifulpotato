Projections of up to 50M delivered worldwide by the end of the year.  We&#x27;re on a crazy ramp.<p>If you want to complain about a misallocation, a key complaint would be that they&#x27;re holding slightly more than half the doses back to ensure everyone dosed can get a second dose... but with rolling production such a large holdback isn&#x27;t necessary.<p>&gt; What could matter is if delay increases the speed at which you can ramp up.<p>All the jurisdictions I know will blow through the entire supply of existing doses allocated to them very quickly.  It doesn&#x27;t go on a slow distribution ramp gated by approval like your ridiculous source suggests.  What governs the ramp is production rates, which have been running flat-out irrespective of this decision.')
