This isn&#x27;t a counterpoint.<p>I might be running long-running computations which take several days.  I might be performing time-critical data acquisition which is going to run overnight.  Hell, I might even just put the system to sleep expecting to pick up in the morning where I left off.<p>The computer&#x27;s sole purpose is to perform tasks <i>for me</i>.  The software vendors desire to push updates is of lower priority than my own needs.  Deciding that it is acceptable to reboot the computer without any acknowledgement or permission from myself is completely and utterly unacceptable.  You are correct that applications could be written to restore their state after a reboot.  But it&#x27;s of critical importance to note that:<p>1) most applications are not written to do this<p>2) not all application state is restorable<p>so to do this on Windows is guaranteed to break important workflows.  People use Windows for actual important work, and this unscheduled reboot nonsense makes it impossible to rely on the system to function reliably.')
