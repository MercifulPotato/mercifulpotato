Embedded in the concept of Democracy is the fact that there is a rule by which a decision is made and once taken it impacts everyone lives.<p>Just try to look from the other side of the fence. I can rephrase your question as:<p>&quot;So the few individuals living in rural areas should have the unopposed power to decide all of the federal policies that could impact the lives of the vast majority of the people in the USA?&quot;<p>So yes. I am sorry but with a democracy, you sometime lose and have to accept that the decision is different from your preference.<p>In the US this only applies to federal, how much federal laws should impact states is not really in discussion here (and honestly I have no opinion on the matter. I am originally from Europe and have limited understanding of a lot of states laws and structures).<p>Also, you are confirming my point that rural areas are over-represented.\nYou seem to intend that it is rightly so, but I do find this criteria unjust, just like your example of voting power coupled with amount of friends is.<p>To me, the only criteria that I find just is &quot;every person has one vote with the exact same power&quot;.
