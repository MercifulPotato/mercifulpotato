Item(by='Booktrope', descendants=None, kids=[25935527], score=None, time=1611786506, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25933564, text='Google and FB have a huge share of the internet reading market; polls repeatedly show that over 30% of the population gets its news from Facebook posts, and another large share get info from Google searches. Twitter also plays a huge role, and soon to be added, stuff like Gab where no you will not be served up any liberal stuff. With the market dominated by a few &quot;aggregators&quot; it&#x27;s not quite accurate to say, oh, news sources can just get their own following. Of course they can get some market share; the NYT has done better than most newspapers at that, and Breitbart even better, due I think to its much better alignment with social media (sensationalism, tribalism, etc.)<p>Just because you can find CNN(or even MSNBC) on your TV or go to their website, doesn&#x27;t address the role of FB and Google in dissemination of news. Let me repeat, over 30 percent of Americans get news from their Facebook feeds. Facebook uses these feeds to attract advertising on a scale no media producer can even dream of, and it comes from the same advertising budgets.<p>I have to say, when you name call people who disagree with you (very stupid or disingenuous), it&#x27;s a good indicator, your argument doesn&#x27;t have a very solid foundation.  You say, it&#x27;s &quot;ludicrous&quot; to say news outlets need visibility in Google or FB for people to know what they&#x27;re saying, you totally miss the point. Yeah, I can set up a web site with my opinions, and anyone can come and find out what I&#x27;m saying too. We&#x27;re talking about how to make economically viable newspapers that provide fact-based reporting (no, not perfectly factual or &quot;true&quot; but a serious effort), and that does require having a presence where a huge share of the potential audience finds their news sources.<p>If someone could actually build a successful media business on the scale of a serious newspaper without relying on social media to send readers in today&#x27;s market, why, they&#x27;d be the most successful newspaper exec since, oh, I dunno, Joe Pulitzer, who incidentally was famous for something called &quot;yellow journalism,&quot; meaning sensationalized, not very factual stuff.<p>No, NYT isn&#x27;t some paragon of &quot;truth&quot;, but it does make a much more serious effort to report facts than the non-fact based media. Yes there&#x27;s some slant to its reporting, but its not always the same (news tends to be less liberal than editorial, for example, and they publish quite a few right wing op ed pieces for variety.  If you think the quality of journalism on Brietbart and NYT are equivalent, well, you must not think of &quot;facts&quot; in quite the way I do, you know, stuff that actually happened and can be verified.')
