Item(by='gwd', descendants=None, kids=[24775058], score=None, time=1602669043, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24774534, text='&gt; In Ip Man, there&#x27;s a gang of Mandarin speakers who show up in Ip Man&#x27;s Cantonese world. They somehow are able to speak to each other, and I find it unlikely. Perhaps it&#x27;s because my Cantonese is mediocre. But it just doesn&#x27;t sound like you could have a casual conversation across the languages.<p>So the mixed Mandarin &#x2F; Cantonese conversations actually do happen.  My wife&#x27;s family are all native Cantonese speakers, but her uncle married into the family from another part of China.  He understands Cantonese perfectly but is more comfortable speaking Mandarin; and everyone else understands Mandarin to various degrees but prefer to speak in Cantonese.  So he just speaks Mandarin while everyone else sticks to Cantonese; and it&#x27;s quite a fluid back-and-forth.<p>That said, for that to happen so naturally the way it does in the Ip Man movies is really unrealistic.  First of all, Mandarin wasn&#x27;t as well-known in Guangdong in the 1930&#x27;s as it is now; and there&#x27;s no way someone from another part of China could just show up and magically understand Cantonese: It would take at least a few months of immersion to be able to &quot;listen&quot; fluidly enough to have that sort of a mixed conversation.<p>Even more unrealistic is Ip Man 4, where he shows up in San Fransisco, and starts talking in Cantonese to people who have immigrated from Beijing -- including one of the character&#x27;s 12-year-old daughter who grew up in San Fransisco.  Yeah, that&#x27;s not going to happen.<p>[Minor grammar edits.]')
