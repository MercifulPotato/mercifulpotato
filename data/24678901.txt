Just because a common data format doesn’t support those types doesn’t mean other formats have to do the same mistake (and given that JSON lacks comments and an official formal spec, its design is questionable to begin with). If interoperability is needed with JSON or other formats not supporting date or uuid, such data type can be serialized as strings.')
