A company could probably get a few hundred customers the first year and tap out at a few thousand within 5-6 years.<p>&gt; I would happily pay, say, $300-500&#x2F;mo for the convenience of a SaaS solution, but ~20K&#x2F;yr is what I pay for things that actually serve a meaningful purpose for the business.<p>At this price point it would require too many customers. All of these customers will think that the cost of dealing with their headache is only worth ~$400 - $100&#x2F;mo. These are terrible customers to base a business on.')
