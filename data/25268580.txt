I&#x27;ve never really understood using Serverless platforms for websites and things that process web traffic as there&#x27;s almost always enough that a &quot;real&quot; webserver is quicker, easier, and cheaper.<p>However, I&#x27;ve seen many things that run a couple of times a day, or in response to a deployment, or things like that, which often need some compute behind them, but for which setting up a little server and hosting it somewhere just to call it once a day feels like so much unnecessary ceremony.<p>Does this have a maximum function duration? If so this could still rule out this approach.')
