The claustrophobic hell that is Descent (Interplay 1995).<p>In order to complete a level, you need to make your way through a maze with 6DOF fps camera, while enemies jump out from all directions and no way to tell which direction you are taking damage, and finally blowing up a reactor <i>and</i> having to find an exit that is located in an unknown place while the cliche 90s computer female voice begins a countdown and the lights start dimming on and off making it even harder to make your way to the exit.<p>Fuck that game. Used to have nightmares playing that game as a kid I still won&#x27;t touch it.')
