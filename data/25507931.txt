I was thinking about buying a whiteboard when I it occurred to me I was sitting in front of a large flat board all day. I took a screenshot, opened up Paint, filled it with a pleasing solid color, made some notes in Paint on it. Drew some boxes and bubbles and a few connecting lines, and made it my desktop background. I keep the screen open in paint so I can easily drag things around and save it again as my desktop background. Every few days I save the current screen in a folder, date it and start a new one, so I have a record of my thoughts. It&#x27;s so simple that I not only do I actively use it, I enjoy using it and it&#x27;s been amazingly helpful for organizing my thoughts and staying on track. I&#x27;m already looking at it all day. I paste some art on it to beautify it up.<p>Edit: I found out later conservative historian Niall Ferguson does this with PowerPoint. I tried PP. I like my system better because there&#x27;s no structure to it. Good for brainstorming.')
