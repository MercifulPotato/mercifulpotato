Someone shorting a stock has an incentive to see a company fail.  Sometimes people will put out rumors or even go on fiance shows talking about how poorly run some company is.  Maybe they make a discreet call to their buddy at the ratings agency and have them downgraded a step.  If the market&#x27;s stated purpose is to help companies find the capital they need to succeed, then short sellers run counter to that purpose.<p>If however the purpose of the market is to be a big game for people with huge amounts of mostly virtual currency to gamble with then short selling is a vital instrument.<p>One problem with the market is that value is not based on what a company is worth, it is based on what investors think it might be worth in the future, which is largely just a guess.  So the whole thing becomes divorced from reality while investors play games with each other to try to make the numbers go up as fast as possible.')
