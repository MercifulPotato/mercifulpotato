I don&#x27;t think I could even name a single HR person I&#x27;ve ever met. They tend to be there to hand me the benefits literature, then at the end I give my badge back to them, and that&#x27;s it. What on earth is happening in companies where HR is part of the daily life of a standard &quot;3rd engineer from the left&quot; employee?')
