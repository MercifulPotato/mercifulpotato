I.e. architecture, how it all hangs together, how data is stored and transmitted etc.<p>But do I need to search specific arguments for a library function call, some DSL syntax, or other reference material?  You bet I do - time is too short to memorise that sort of thing, and totally not worth it IMO (especially since tech moves fast - what is relevant today, is obsolete and dead next year)')
