The ban hammer <i>is not</i> applied equally.<p>I see unbelievable insults, direct calls for violence (from both sides), acrimonious, spiteful and hateful posts - with zero consequences.<p>But Trump posts &quot;go home peacefully&quot; and he&#x27;s banned?<p>I don&#x27;t know about you, but I&#x27;ve actually spent a lot of time reading Trump&#x27;s Twitter feed. While I&#x27;m personally embarrassed about his lack of executive poise, and I disagree with most of what I&#x27;ve read, I&#x27;ve never seen anything that would come close to a call for violence, or many of the other things he&#x27;s been accused of.<p>Happy to read examples if you have some and I&#x27;ve just missed it.')
