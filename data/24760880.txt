He actually goes on to say that he&#x27;s &quot;marketing his frustration&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;hhariri&#x2F;status&#x2F;1314287590523236352" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;hhariri&#x2F;status&#x2F;1314287590523236352</a>)<p>It&#x27;s also equally ironic that it&#x27;s a &quot;developer advocate&quot; from JetBrains that&#x27;s calling out an open source projects usability. A first step might be that he and JetBrains try contributing to git or trying to build new porcelain on top of git.<p>That said, this is par for the course of the kind of user that resides on Twitter. Twitter is mostly used by toxic people who like to air their grievances before the world and then try to convince the rest of us it&#x27;s healthy.<p>We need to stop encouraging engineers to use Twitter to communicate, imo. It enables this armchair quarterback behavior while having zero investment in the production of the desired result.')
