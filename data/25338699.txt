It was officially inaugurated on NYE 2000, and has since been filled with all sorts of interesting things. 9&#x2F;11, that started the 21st century&#x27;s great fear, and security obsession. The 2008 financial crisis, started off the 21st century&#x27;s fury at the fraudulent capitalist finance system. iPhone &#x2F; android facilitated the 21st century&#x27;s incessant protest. Trump and social media showed us some gaping holes in democracy, and the allowed an inherent fascism to reveal itself. COVID revealed to us problems of over population, easy travel and access to healthcare. And then? Clearly it&#x27;s just the beginning, but there was no point when anything started or ended, other than the date. My only speculation is that the 21st century is as it is because of an appreciation for round numbers, and words like millennium. Or that we are definitely not base reality.')
