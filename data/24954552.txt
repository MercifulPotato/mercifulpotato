You started decently but ended up just saying more random biased points. I also do not know where you get the idea USA is anti European. I don really get that anywhere. I will tell you for a fact that many Europeans spend their entire life ignoring their own countries politics and only comment on Americans and the politics of America ( another separate problem) there is no stereotype of a European for an American but there 10000 percent is the other way. All these comments about America vs USA just expose commentators with their random assumptions about how other countries are.')
