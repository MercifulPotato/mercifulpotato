It’s a playground insult to call someone “retarded” because they’re “stupid”. It could just be an American thing, but using it like that is very common.<p>I think a good comparison is “fag”. Sure, it means a cigarette, but it is (was?) a common insult towards gay people.<p>Should we not use the word? I don’t know. I’m just explaining why dpeck wrote their comment.')
