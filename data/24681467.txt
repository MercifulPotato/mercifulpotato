It might also be just to suppress radiation from the cable which could affect other devices. Though I&#x27;m not sure you really need it on USB2. I&#x27;ve built custom totally unshielded USB2 cables that have been put on drones. The important thing is that the differential pair is twisted, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t work at all. We never had any issue with EMI from the motors, which can be quite bad on quadcopters. This obviously isn&#x27;t something that might pass CE testing, but my point is differential cabling is fairly noise tolerant. I&#x27;m fairly sure you could run USB2 through a coat hanger and it&#x27;d be OK.<p>Most USB application notes also specify a small ferrite bead, so there is normally something on the PCB for filtering as well. Wurth have a nice app note on this (search for ANP024).<p>USB3 though, is particularly bad for radiating with low quality cables. My logitech mouse dongle will drop if I connect a high bandwidth camera over a poorly shielded cable.')
