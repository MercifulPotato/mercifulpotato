You tell them you don’t have sufficient resource to provide the level of support you would want to put on the project, or that you don’t feel you can be price&#x2F;quality competitive because of some factor and don’t think you are a good fit compared to your competitors.<p>I would never tell a client that their website “doesn’t meet our quality bar” - that’s basically saying “we are too good for you” and I would personally think it’s incredibly condescending - just look at Berkshire Hathaways website!')
