I just gained <i>so much</i> respect for you as a moderator (and therefore participant) in this community.<p>Taking the time to write out this very thoughtful, insightful reply to someone who may be knowledgeable but was throwing out hostile one-liners, that is impressive and gives such a great deal of credibility to the work you&#x27;re doing here -- work that largely goes unseen, of course.<p>Amazing.<p>(I actually put down the piece of food I was eating, mid-bite, to write this out.
