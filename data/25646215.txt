If this was not an unfortunate incident&#x2F;mistake, then GitHub&#x2F;Microsoft has become quite the active enforcer of US (legal) foreign policy.&quot;<p>I am not sure if most people realize this, but OFAC compliance is rather rigid with no room for error (&#x27;strict liability&#x27;). And US treasury enforces it hard. Recently, Amazon got caught in its cross-hairs ( though it managed to get away with a low fine relative to its size ).<p>I guess what I am saying, according to OFAC, everyone is responsible for enforcing US foreign policy.<p>edit: Everyone as in US person, person on US soil or someone using US dollar. I really should avoid exaggeration.')
