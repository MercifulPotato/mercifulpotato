Add a little box with powdered olivine and some extra chemical bits to capture a higher % of co2 than absolute 0?<p>Catalytic convertors already use finely coated incredibly expensive platinum to break down complex molecules, and it is certainly easier to capture co2 near the source than when dissipated in the atmosphere')
