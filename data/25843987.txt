You would not want a fire brigade that&#x27;s only theoretical about putting fires out.<p>It seems that the occurrence of people who bemoan that social scientists are activists, that they are not supposed to actually develop solutions to what they study, has increased in recent years. It&#x27;s bad logic. A sociologist studying the effects of poverty shouldn&#x27;t be interested in solving poverty is a mind-boggling idea.<p>There&#x27;s something more pressing, now. People can concur here. I&#x27;ve found that this line of thought, that social scientists shouldn&#x27;t be activists, is an idea that&#x27;s been drummed about by the so-called &#x27;intellectual dark web&#x27;. This rag-time team of pundits propagated a lot of conspiracy theories about the &#x27;cultural marxism&#x27;, the &#x27;Frankfurt school&#x27;, etc. It feels like an attempt at policing the content of social research under the cover of conservative&#x2F;christian propriety.')
