That&#x27;s still way too low if you actually want to fly anywhere. Benchmark value of points when redeeming for economy is between $0.01 and $0.015. When redeeming for business its $0.03-0.06. When redeeming for first, its $0.10-$0.20<p>In general rule of thumb is Alaska miles are worth $0.02, American are worth $0.013, United are worth around $0.013, Delta are worth $0.01 (since you can redeem them for $0.01 as cash towards paid tickets if you have one of their credit cards).<p>Hotel points are different, Hilton, IHG and Club Carlson are around $0.005, Marriott are worth around $0.009, and Hyatt are worth $0.016.<p>But I digress, that&#x27;s value to the end user. We&#x27;re debating what the credit card company pays the airline for it.')
