I would really like a to make an affordable monocular. It seemed like the image quality was quite low even for the 160. I&#x27;m not sure if adding some lenses for magnification would improve them or not. The refresh rate is pretty slow too. I&#x27;d love to experiment with it, but $200 is a lot for a project that might not be usable.<p>The Boson seems like it has great clarity and refresh rate, but at that price I might as well just buy a purpose made device (outside my price range).')
