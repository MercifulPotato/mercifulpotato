As Harlan Ellison so eloquently put it: &quot;I&#x27;d gotten all the literature I could handle on the subject from a certain Thomas Aquinas&quot; in regards to the god hypothesis. More often than not, &quot;close-minded&quot; is a conversation <i>stopper</i>, designed to deflect from the accuser&#x27;s very own ignorance and credulity.<p>Same thing goes for creationism, AGW denial, anti-vaxx, anti-mask, the QAnon cult, trickle-down economics, etc.')
