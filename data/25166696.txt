Item(by='jjk166', descendants=None, kids=[25166760], score=None, time=1605917471, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25166254, text='Hand eye coordination isn&#x27;t really the issue.<p>When welding, you put an incredible amount of heat into the material. This causes it to move in real time. A welder needs to predict how it will move ant actively account for this so that the final piece winds up in the right condition. The tolerances depend on the application - for furniture who cares if it&#x27;s out a bit, for a coolant line to a reactor you need it to be damn near perfect.<p>Then there&#x27;s heat penetration - adding heat to the material changes its material properties. Go too slow and steel becomes excessively weak, go too fast and you don&#x27;t form a strong bond. Again, big differences between &quot;probably won&#x27;t break if you sit on it&quot; and &quot;this will kill a dozen people if it fails&quot;<p>Finally, there&#x27;s just plain old margin for error. If you&#x27;re welding together consumer products, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you scrap one every now and then. However if you&#x27;re trying to join together two multi-million dollar custom fabrications, you need someone who&#x27;s going to walk up to this and get it on the first try every time.<p>I&#x27;d compare it less to being a major league baseball player and more to being a professional musician - you can&#x27;t determine that someone could never do it, but some people are certainly born with a knack for it and you can&#x27;t simply churn out more on a whim.')
