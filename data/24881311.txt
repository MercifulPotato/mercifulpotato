Or at least that you shouldn&#x27;t walk around a building you&#x27;re not familiar with at night.<p>Looking at the pictures, I&#x27;d vote for another option.  The roof of that building isn&#x27;t designed for casual use.  The wall around the edge of the building is calf-height with no railing.  What they&#x27;re doing is likely trespassing, and they chose to accept the risks.  The meaning to take from this experience is that you should be extra careful when you go places that are clearly not meant for you to be.')
