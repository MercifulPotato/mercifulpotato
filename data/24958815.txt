Everything was an unknown, and most people didn&#x27;t get tested unless they showed serious symptoms and were close to hospitalization.<p>The current assumption in Norway, based on testing and WHO guidelines) are that we detect about 1&#x2F;2 of the active cases through testing now, compared to 1&#x2F;10 back in March. Applied to your numbers, the current outbreak in Germany is about a fifth of what it was back in March.<p>Be careful about assuming the numbers represent the same thing over time and between countries; in general the ratio of positive cases compared to the number of tests has changed a lot during the last eight months.<p>Some of the reports from the Norwegian health authorities has explicit notes about where reporting and testing criteria changed during the timeline.')
