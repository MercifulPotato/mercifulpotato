Hotwire is the evolution of that: Turbo Frames let you dynamically replace certain parts of the page on the frontend, rather than having to throw the baby out with the bathwater on every page action. If you&#x27;re used to developing server-rendered applications without much JavaScript using Ruby on Rails, Django, or a similar &quot;batteries included&quot; backend framework, then you&#x27;ll be able to add a more dynamic feel to your web app without much of a mental shift: certain template partials (basically the components of your frontend) will be wrapped in this `turbo-frame` HTML tag, which will be slotted in to your page dynamically by Turbo.')
