When you dehumanize others, you give up some of your own humanity.<p>It is one thing to make a stand and say something is wrong, it is another to give in to tribalism and lose perspective.<p>&gt;I’m sure there’s more nuance in the article but I honestly couldn’t get past this passage. And I’m comfortable with the fact that my tolerance has limits, including not treating nazis and German Jews as somehow morally equivalent in conflict, even rhetorically.<p>The article did not touch on moral evaluations. It explored tribalism as a human tendency, how it manifests, and it who it targets. The example of Jews and Nazis illustrates this point.')
