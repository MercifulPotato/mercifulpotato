Of course if you need a function for a <i>different</i> purpose then it makes sense to make another one.<p>Of course mathematics is always an endless game of expanding and contracting definitions so might need some additional versions anyway (most commonly something like f(x) = log(1+x)), though if you&#x27;re clever about it you can rephrase most of what you want with existing functions.')
