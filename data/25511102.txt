There’s no accountability to core competency: teaching and learning.  We are merely stakeholders at an equal level on the org chart.<p>Contrast this to when I was a FAANG SWE, when every function at the company — including IT — was subordinate to those who built the actual tech: Engineering.<p>The flip side is that as a teacher I have complete autonomy over anything that <i>does</i> fall to me; namely the bulk of the CS curriculum and the way it is taught.<p>(Tools like repl.it are wonderful for completely side stepping any involvement with bureaucracy.  Invite the kids to sign up and just <i>get stuff done</i>.)')
