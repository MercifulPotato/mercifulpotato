The ADA basically tries to minimize the burden of having a disability. So there are no licensing fees or registration or anything related to having a service animal by the government and as such businesses, landlords, etc. can&#x27;t ask for something like a license or registration of a service animal as verification.<p>The key difference between an &quot;emotional support animal&quot; and a legitimate service animal is that service animals have training that directly assists with the person&#x27;s disability. Easy examples are seeing-eye dogs, dogs that are trained to smell&#x2F;detect low blood sugar in diabetics, and dogs that are trained to protect their owner if they have a seizure or similar.<p>Emotional support animals are just...emotional support and aren&#x27;t trained to really do anything.<p>It seems like businesses were just too scared to go to battle over people bringing their pets places for fear of being accused of violating the ADA.<p>To be clear, I think emotional support animals are ridiculous, but the &quot;no registration&#x2F;license&quot; piece is a very critical part of the ADA. Finally, businesses are allowed to ask what tasks a service animal has been trained to do as verification and that allowance doesn&#x27;t even extend to service animals in training.')
