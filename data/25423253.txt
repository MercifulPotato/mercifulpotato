My personal take is that this is a ridiculous amount of homework to do in 45 days, and is essentially the FTC asking for not only these companies&#x27; &quot;secret sauce&quot; but also their confidential bookkeeping. I would be astounded if none of them challenged this order.<p>For example, requirement 12.d.: &quot;Submit all documents related to the Company&#x27;s strategies or plans, including but not limited to research and development efforts.&quot; It is not clear the FTC has this kind of authority to essentially demand &quot;what are your trade secrets and future business plans?&quot;')
