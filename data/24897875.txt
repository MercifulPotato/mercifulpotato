If a product has more value to a person than the price of the product, assuming they have correct knowledge, that is the creation of value. In high frequency trading, or stock trading in general, people may be willing to pay more than the listed price, but I don&#x27;t think value is created because this is generally due to incorrect knowledge. I think stocks are pretty much a zero sum game. If one person is making money, someone else is losing money.<p>As I mentioned, I&#x27;m not an economics or finance expert, so I&#x27;d be interested to hear what more experienced people would have to say.')
