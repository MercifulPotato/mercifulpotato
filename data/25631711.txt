Item(by='mattzito', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609770477, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25630456, text='I&#x27;m as pro-union as they come, but let&#x27;s not pretend that the film and theater unions are an unalloyed good.  It&#x27;s true that the top is not limited for people who make millions of dollars, but the bottom is fairly restrictive, and that has a negative impact on many many actors&#x2F;performers.  For example, once you are an Actors Equity member, you can not do non-Equity work, except with special exemptions.  You are also required to join equity once you do a certain number of Equity weeks - this means that I know people who luck into one Equity show early in their career, have to join Equity, and then are locked out of swaths of theatrical work because they&#x27;re Equity.  At the same time, though, they don&#x27;t have enough of a resume to keep getting Equity work.  SAG and AFTRA have similar policies.<p>I agree they&#x27;ve done a good job at curbing abuses, and again, I&#x27;m pro-union overall, but the film&#x2F;tv&#x2F;theater unions definitely force some tough decisions for the lower end of the worker spectrum')
