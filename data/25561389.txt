It keeps them the same, at best. It&#x27;s a way to protect <i>current</i> tenants, which is good, and we should support, as an &quot;ownership-lite&quot; model of residency.<p>But it&#x27;s only one, very small, tool in the arsenal to make cities work for the people. It must be accompanied by robust protections to <i>new</i> people as well. The flaw with rent control in isolation is that it assumes that people never move, are never born, and never die, and that cities never change. In order for rent control to be a useful tenant protection, it must be accompanied by robust rebuilding when more people need to live in the city.')
