Only Qt, not KDE Frameworks.<p>- PyQt&#x2F;QtPy&#x2F;PySide2&#x2F;Tkinter (for Python apps)<p>- Xlib + custom widget sets (for C apps)<p>I&#x27;m involved in few Qt&#x2F;C++ and Xlib&#x2F;C projects, but for my personal needs PyQt &amp; Tkinter is enough.<p>Also I use some 3rd-party GTK2&#x2F;GTk+3 (GIMP, Inkscape, LibreOffice), but actually trying find its Qt alternatives as well (and there are NO place for Electron apps on my PC).<p>Additionally:<p>- SDL 1.x* also may be useful for C apps, due to its high portability; <i>SDL2</i> is less portable.<p>- OpenGL (for C++&#x2F;C&#x2F;Python apps)<p>- wxWidgets (for C++&#x2F;C&#x2F;Python apps)')
