The EU Human Rights Court has not stepped in to overturn those bans: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eclj.org&#x2F;marriage&#x2F;the-echr-unanimously-confirms-the-non-existence-of-a-right-to-gay-marriage" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eclj.org&#x2F;marriage&#x2F;the-echr-unanimously-confirms-the-...</a>. In 2016, it held unanimously that the European Convention on Human Rights doesn’t protect same-sex marriage. In the EU countries where it has been legalized, that was done by statue.<p>In the US, those issues are handled through court cases, regardless of where public opinion stands. For example, elective abortions (without health risks or something else) in the second trimester or later is very unpopular in the US and the EU. Only about a quarter of people think it should be generally legal after the first trimester: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;poll&#x2F;235469&#x2F;trimesters-key-abortion-views.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.gallup.com&#x2F;poll&#x2F;235469&#x2F;trimesters-key-abortion-...</a>. That matches up with the law in most of the EU, where the limit for elective abortions is 10-14 weeks. (As I recall, the UK is the exception at 24 weeks.)<p>The US constitution doesn’t say anything about abortion, or anything that could really be construed to be about abortion, but the Supreme Court has interpreted it to protect abortion up to viability, usually 22-24 weeks. So the Supreme Court has interpreted the constitution, which says nothing about abortion, to create an abortion right so broad France or Germany’s or Denmark’s abortion laws would be invalid in the US.<p>The topping on that cake is that the US is that the US is the most religious developed country in the world, more so than countries like Poland.<p>Which is why Supreme Court appointments get so heated here.')
