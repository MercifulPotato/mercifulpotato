Coincidence? I contacted amazon and was kindly informed that there are no authrized repair facilities and amazon does not fix it.   Was offered  $5 to return it and 15% discount.   Had to do a bit of research online but it turns out one can take it apart.  I disconnected battery and reconnected it and it started charging again. Iâ€™m not a conspiracy theorist but this felt like amazon would software brick the device so I would buy new one due to timing of warranty. Disconnecting battery literally reset device.  Anyone experience this?')
