Item(by='adventured', descendants=None, kids=[25439259], score=None, time=1608094086, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25439122, text='&gt; is it not more effective altruism for people like Bezos and Scott to keep their wealth compounding as effectively as possible, and then donate it much later on, perhaps in a few decades?<p>The caveat to that is the Steve Jobs outcome - that that time isn&#x27;t guaranteed to anyone. Jeff Bezos for example nearly died in a helicopter crash. Steve was fortunate he had Laurene to handle philanthropically disposing of the now $37b family fortune responsibly (presumably).<p>Also, you may just run out of time if you wait too long, even if you live a very long time. Buffett was aiming to discharge most of his wealth before his death and they thought they had a solid timeline for doing it. He won&#x27;t come remotely close to that as the wealth piled up even faster than expected ($84b remaining and he&#x27;s 90, after giving away near $40b so far in 14 years). The Gates Foundation can&#x27;t give it away fast enough. The Gates family was initially aiming to get rid of their wealth in their lifetime, then they shifted that to within N decades after their death. They have to give away at least $250 billion yet (with Buffett&#x27;s wealth taking priority, which has slowed their ability to discharge their own pile of wealth) - it may require another lifetime.')
