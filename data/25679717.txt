The only way to know would be to personally verify the voter&#x27;s driver&#x27;s license, watch them vote and submit their ballot, count their ballot, and repeat for every single voter in the United States.  Since this will never, ever happen, one could always make vague claims about authenticity.  But without concrete evidence of fraud, it doesn&#x27;t matter.')
