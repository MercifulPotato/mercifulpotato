I prefer the 2nd approach every time.<p>This is exactly why I like DDG way more than Google and why I love to use Alfred instead of Spotlight on my Mac. With DDG you have !bangs and with Alfred you also can tell him what you’re looking for. 99.9% of the time I know I’m looking for a file or a folder or a definition of a word or want to open an app or want to search the web etc. With Spotlight you’re stuck to the order Apple designed the results to show up')
