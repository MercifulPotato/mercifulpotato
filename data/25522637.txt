This is a very CS thing to do, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really a very good way to look at this business situation.<p>From what little I&#x27;ve read here it seems that there is a continuum of different business strategies in which brokerages use their customer base and clout to negotiate PFOF deals that simultaneously (1) produce revenue for the brokerage, and (2) produce better prices for their customers. Since exchanges have finite financial resources, there is some tension between these two goals, which means that at some point brokerages are essentially trading their own interests against their customers&#x27; interests. This creates a power and information imbalance that can probably harm  customers if the exchange behaves in ways that maximize (1) at the cost of (2). (RH is alleged to have pushed this balance much farther than common industry practice.) But that <i>does not mean all PFOF deals are definitionally bad</i>.<p>The question in this case is not &quot;is PFOF always bad&quot;, but rather &quot;is there some point at which brokerage-revenue-maximizing PFOF negotiations actually harm customers by overcharging them compared to a more transparent system.&quot; The answer to that question is simple: <i>almost certainly there does exist such a point</i> and when a brokerage reaches that point, customers probably won&#x27;t be able to tell that the point has been reached. Moreover, brokerages with no commissions seem clearly incentivized to optimize towards or beyond that point. Maybe you could argue that RH  hasn&#x27;t reached that point in this specific case, but this does not seem to be your argument.<p>The question then is: what do you do about it? Should all PFOF be disallowed? You seem to be making a compelling argument that this is not a good solution. Should there be some kind of standard for how much that brokerage&#x2F;customer balance should be allowed to stretch? Plenty of business practices are regulated along lines like this, where the regulation doesn&#x27;t outright ban the practice but instead provides some guidelines and standard practices to prevent abuse of weaker parties like customers.<p>I&#x27;m not here to give an answer: I&#x27;m just pointing out that eventually if you allow brokerages to keep optimizing for revenue, customers will be harmed. Maybe they already have. At that point it&#x27;s up to the regulators to do something, because that&#x27;s their job.')
