Item(by='snakeboy', descendants=None, kids=[25962011], score=None, time=1611879155, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25945501, text='&gt; Saying that there&#x27;s wealth deficit for millennials&#x2F;genx because boomers have accumulated more wealth later in life is a little handy-wavy.<p>That&#x27;s not what the chart I linked is claiming.  The Boomer \nline goes back to when they were 35.  Not sure what the data limitations were preventing it from going back further.  Meanwhile all age data is shown for Gen X.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you mean about the future chart? I guess we&#x27;ll have to wait and see :-)<p>But anyway, this chart appears to answer the question: &quot;which generation had more relative wealth in its early 30s?&quot;')
