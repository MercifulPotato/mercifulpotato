You&#x27;re not really offering any evidence to counter the other user, you&#x27;re essentially just saying &quot;you&#x27;re wrong, just stop questioning things and get in line.&quot;<p>Your argument is like saying Mandarin must always be written in traditional characters because it&#x27;s just complex, it&#x27;s as efficient as it can be. Yet China went from traditional to simplified characters, and Vietnam abandoned characters altogether and uses an alphabet, despite having one more tone than Mandarin.<p>You&#x27;re allowed to say you just personally aren&#x27;t interested in new notation or theory verbiage. But you need some pretty strong evidence if you want to claim that the current methods are as efficient as they can be when human history shows that most times, lack of innovation is due to cultural and political factors rather than lack of opportunity for improvement.')
