I often have to typically follow it by &quot;Really, there&#x27;s no subtle trick, just find the max...&quot;.  The number of people who use a &#x27;sort&#x27; and take the first element is definitely non-zero.  It&#x27;s also astonishing the number of buggy implementations there are.  (Well in fairness there is one buggy implementation which everyone who gets it wrong typically makes -- initially setting the max to 0)<p>I&#x27;m not sure if this is an argument for or against coding exercises in interviews -- it was just a surprising experience for me.')
