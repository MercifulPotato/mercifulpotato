It lies right on the French border. At least one dialect has heavy French influence and one does not.<p>Most of the local students I talked to spoke German that was very close to Hochdeutsch plus some linguistic peculiarities and slang terms. As far as I could tell this was the dialect they used at home, when drunk, talking with childhood friends, etc., and I could understand it easily.<p>Every once in a while, though, I would meet someone (usually of a slightly older generation) whose dialect I found completely unintelligible.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how easily the average local German could understand the different dialects. Most of the local people I talked to regularly were computational linguist students, German teachers, or worked in the international student office, so they had a particular interest in learning languages.')
