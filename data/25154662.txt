I think in the US some places must be much worse than others.  Here in Portland, Oregon, on a 7 mile round trip (without much overlap) through the urban core that I make regularly by bike I only see maybe four billboards, and all but one (a not too large sign of a stadium that mostly advertises events there) are the traditional paper type (or whatever it is that they use).  Most are near highways or highway access so I assume anyone who uses highways regularly will see more of them.  There are also some small advertisements (also not LCD) on bus shelters, although there aren&#x27;t many bus shelters.  I rarely notice any of them unless I am stopped at a traffic light near one.  It took me a while to even remember most of them.  I&#x27;d still prefer fewer of them, but it isn&#x27;t at all comparable to using the web without an adblocker.  Additionally, there is no chance that the billboards will install malware on my computer.')
