The carriers in those countries will make more money by using RCS, because it will use cellular data (at least if I understand it correctly), which isn&#x27;t free.<p>My point being that I don&#x27;t think many carriers care about text messaging, or phone calls. They sell you a fixed cost plan for those. The only thing that can really affect your price is data usage. If Google wants to deal with the hassle of managing a messaging platform, great, that&#x27;s money save on running a service that isn&#x27;t making money anyway.')
