Some of the earlier applications of geometric algebra to computer graphics were based on conformal geometry (eg <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rjw57.github.io&#x2F;phd-thesis&#x2F;rjw-thesis.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rjw57.github.io&#x2F;phd-thesis&#x2F;rjw-thesis.pdf</a>) because it can model more interesting things than projective geometry, but it is more computationally expensive than projective geometry.<p>WRT community, the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bivector.net" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bivector.net</a> web site has a discussion forum for people interested in geometric algebra. I’m still a newbie so I don’t know the territory very well, but it is still fairly hard to get to grips with geometric algebra: there isn’t a lot of tutorial material and there’s still a lot of variation in details of notation and choice of basic operators, which is confusing for a beginner.<p>I have been collecting links recently: see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dotat.at&#x2F;:&#x2F;?q=geometric+algebra" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dotat.at&#x2F;:&#x2F;?q=geometric+algebra</a>')
