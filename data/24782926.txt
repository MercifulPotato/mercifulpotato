RF circuits.<p>If superconductors were feasible on integrated circuits, I&#x27;d expect the TDP to get lower, enabling higher frequencies and integration (3D?). Frequencies would still be limited by propagation delay, but we have some room to grow. Classic FET wouldn&#x27;t work, I think, at least not without bringing back switching losses, but there&#x27;s probably a way to create a magnetic transistor using a few superconductor wires (locally increasing resistance above 0, for instance). Or use FETs with adiabatic computing, who knows? Future seems bright, and applications for room-temperature superconductors are aplenty. It&#x27;s just that everyone thought of them as a pipe dream, so they aren&#x27;t really being investigated that I know of.<p>I wish that link had a better list:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Technological_applications_of_superconductivity#High-temperature_superconductivity_(HTS)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Technological_applications_of_...</a><p>At least with a PoC, we might see a revival of real interest in them. Not sure how long it will last, though.')
