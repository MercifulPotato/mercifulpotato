Therefore it’s missing some details. Probably the website is mostly targeted at people who already know what pijul is.<p>Here are some attempts at short descriptions of what I think this aims to achieve:<p>- pijul 1.0. A stable repo format with performance problems resolved and a good foundation for further work<p>- darcs except the algorithm is more convincingly correct and merges don’t take exponential time<p>- A version control system where certain things behave in reasonable ways avoiding potential strange behaviour, eg it doesn’t matter what order you merge things in, you always get the same result.<p>- A version control system that provides a good user interface to humans, a simple mental model, and asymptotically good performance.')
