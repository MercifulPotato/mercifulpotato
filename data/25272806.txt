Kalepa&#x27;s AI-powered Copilot enables underwriters to rapidly evaluate and optimally select risk. By analyzing trillions of points of structured and unstructured data, Copilot augments underwriters with insights and recommendations on every risk: is that business a family restaurant or a dive bar with a mechanical bull? Does that contractor have an excellent safety record and merits a better rate? Does that motel represent a sex trafficking and prostitution risk? Copilot answers such questions for underwriters in seconds through a battery of NLP and computer vision models on a massive, and fast growing, data set of businesses in the US.<p>Kalepa&#x27;s team members bring experiences from Facebook, Google, Amazon, ClassPass, Atlassian, APT (acquired by Mastercard for $600M in 2015), MIT, Berkeley, UPenn, NYU, and the Israel Defense Forces. Kalepa&#x27;s HQ is in New York City and we have team members around the globe. We are backed by IA Ventures, investors in Datadog, TheTradeDesk, Transferwise, Flatiron Health, and others.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;company&#x2F;kalepa" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angel.co&#x2F;company&#x2F;kalepa</a><p>Contact: paul.monasterio@kalepa.co')
