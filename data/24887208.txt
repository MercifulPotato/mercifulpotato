I maintain code that was originally written almost 20 years ago.<p>I&#x27;m extremely conservative in my technological choices for this reason. Whatever I&#x27;m using today needs to keep working if I (or my successors) have to unearth the project in 10 years.<p>And you&#x27;re right that the vendor-provided tools are often pretty bad, but that&#x27;s one of the main reasons I personally don&#x27;t care for IDEs and deep integration with the environment. FZF works reliably everywhere, dummy (non-syntax aware) completion works reliably everywhere etc...<p>Would I be more productive with fancy-pansy code completion? Probably a little bit. But having a simple, agnostic, portable and stable development environment is well worth the trade-off IMO.<p>Not that I think that people are wrong for preferring IDEs, they&#x27;re just a different set of trade-offs.')
