The Marvel Cinematic Universe was able to successfully put a capstone on a cinematic project on the scale that had never even been attempted before.  It was impressive enough to end a single story like Harry Potter in a satisfying way.  The MCU was able to do the same for a wide variety of stories, dozens of characters, and over twenty movies.<p>Also it doesn&#x27;t hurt the MCU&#x27;s legacy that there is the obvious comparison with Game of Thrones that magnificently failed a very similar task the exact weekend that End Game came out.')
