Again, it all comes down to time, cost, simplicity.<p>Lastly, I have to say, after using futures in Java&#x2F;Scala, async&#x2F;await in JS, Kotlin got it right with coroutines, channels and flows. I’m not exactly sure what the roadmap for concurrency looks like in the Java world(even with project loom, etc). While Java is moving fast(finally), I think it’s still weighed down by legacy stuff (nulls, mutable code, lack of expressions and more)')
