Where are you getting the denominator for total number of black employees in 2019?<p>There&#x27;s a data mismatch between the CB blog post and the article. CB cites that only 2-3 formal complaints were filed iirc.<p>11 employee complaints matches pretty closely with the PDX group.<p>--<p>FWIW I&#x27;m not dismissing the complaints. I&#x27;ve worked and studied in places where I&#x27;ve felt like an outsider; I&#x27;ve seen people make inappropriate comments about race+stereotypes in past work environments; I&#x27;ve also seen people make fishing claims of racial discrimination.<p>I wasn&#x27;t on those teams in 2019, so the truth is I simply don&#x27;t know.<p>From what I see today and the lack of concrete evidence in the article, I do have some doubts about the overall impression the article tries to give. I have the sense that certain information might have been omitted that might paint a clearer picture. I could totally be wrong as well.')
