I’m Ido, I’ve been working on this thing for quite a while now.<p>HackerList turns your public work (GitHub and StackOverflow, for now) into a profile page with skills ranking, like these ones -<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackerli.st&#x2F;@robindaugherty" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackerli.st&#x2F;@robindaugherty</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackerli.st&#x2F;@thamaraiselvam" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackerli.st&#x2F;@thamaraiselvam</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackerli.st&#x2F;@potherca" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackerli.st&#x2F;@potherca</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackerli.st&#x2F;@aisrael" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackerli.st&#x2F;@aisrael</a><p>It’s free, fully automate, and takes literally two clicks to join.<p>Ranking (in essence):<p>1. Each repo gets a score based on various factors.\n2. The score is factored by the amount of work contributed.\n3. Each language that is used in that repo is weighted by its relative share.\n4. Points gained in each language are summed over all repos and ranked by their percentile across all members.\n5. StackOverflow tag points are factored-in similarly to form final ranks.<p>I have two goals here:<p>1. Provide hackers with a measurable way to grow, improve and collaborate (WIP)\n2. Make hiring easier and more predictable for both ends. Ideally, by eliminating the whiteboard&#x2F;do-a-mini-project-\nat-home-without-payment part of the process altogether.<p>(If you’re hiring and want to participate in the pilot, hit me up at hire@hackerli.st or DM <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;hacker_list" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;hacker_list</a>)<p>I’d love to hear your thoughts!')
