I&#x27;ve recently lost much of my professional ambition and now feel a bit more of the competition aspect. I&#x27;m clocking out at 5pm and ignoring after hours requests and anything that would impeded on my personal time. However I know there are so many of my peers who are putting in that extra effort and when it comes to review time they&#x27;ll be preferred over me.<p>It seem difficult to find a job where I&#x27;m not expected to be &#x27;striving&#x27;. Where I can get in a position and just say &quot;i&#x27;m good here&quot; and simply maintain my position.')
