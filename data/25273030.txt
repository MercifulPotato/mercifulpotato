Smart move to decouple yourself some, especially from a term that is synonymous with bland indistinct elevator music or on hold music, and it&#x27;s probably hopefully all good these days, but there&#x27;s still plenty of room for this company to perhaps be trying to push trademarks or harass other folk who use the word &quot;muzak&quot;.')
