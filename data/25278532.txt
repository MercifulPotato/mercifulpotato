So basically you create a smart contract that will call all the DEX&#x2F;loan platform&#x2F;other contract functions necessary to obtain the loan, carry out swaps and pay it back.  You then deploy that contract.<p>Then you would have a separate program running on your client machine to scan for market opportunities, and when it spots one, have that program send a transaction to your deployed smart contract to initiate the loan and set into action whatever logic you programmed into the smart contract that will yield a profit.<p>Yes, itâ€™s quite a rabbit hole indeed.  It is hard to believe that something like this is even possible, let alone profitable, but it really can be.  I have seen single flash loan transactions yield up to $46k in profits.  That profit is irrevocably delivered back to you in a couple of seconds.')
