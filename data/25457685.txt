The value is really in simple stuff like this, where having something in your mental toolkit makes the difference between a problem requiring a trivial application of something you know versus requiring thought and creativity.<p>A particular example I remember was a poorly architected system that was essentially two systems connected like queues in sequence.  The first one was fast and lightweight, basically a gateway&#x2F;hydrator for the second one, and could handle a very large backup with no ill effects.  The second one was very slow and fell over quickly if too many items accumulated in the queue during a load spike.  An easy short-term fix to make the system stable in production was to introduce artificial slowness in the first queue to buffer load spikes and prevent backups in the second queue.  Little&#x27;s Law points straight to this solution, but people who didn&#x27;t have queueing theory in their mental toolkit had not considered fixing the system by slowing part of it down.  It looked like a big leap of imagination for them, even if they found it intuitive to understand after it was pointed out.')
