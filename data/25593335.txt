She doesn&#x27;t love cold but it seems to get to her less. I can handle either extreme but prefer high heat to low cold. I&#x27;ve also been told I radiate a surprising amount heat (by multiple people), so that could be part of it. My core temperature is normal but my surface temperature runs hot. When I&#x27;m cold though, I&#x27;m cold to the core and can&#x27;t warm up.')
