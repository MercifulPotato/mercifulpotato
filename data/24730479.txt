They always have allocate massive budget portions for such projects, especially for renewable ones. \n- Wind power - more wind turbines will be shut down than new built in Germany in 2021. They don&#x27;t store energy, people living near wind parks hate them, and the government need to buy up power from the wind energy companies. \n- Biodiesel&#x2F;ethanol fuel production - can&#x27;t be made profitable without heavy state subventions, takes land that&#x27;s used for food agriculture, in tropical states responsible for biohabitat loss.\n- Small hydro projects - probably one of the worst green energy initiatives, they destroy often all life in small rivers and creeks.\n- Solar energy  - low efficiency, takes up land for farming, recycling issues. \n- Hydrogen power  - we&#x27;ll probably see excess wind power being used for hydrogen production, but still not really a viable alternative compared to lithium batteries. The EU can&#x27;t make it cheaply, they&#x27;re kind of relying on gigantic solar farms in Africa to make it in large quantities.<p>Good thing they&#x27;re keeping on shutting down of coal power plants.')
