I brush them aside because they usually drag in a few MB of dependencies, and melt my (mid-level) computer with compilation (often OOM-killing everything else I&#x27;m doing on the machine, before dying to the OOM-killer itself) – but for all that, I then need to keep the <i>entire thing</i> on my hard drive because the compilation was mere caching, and hasn&#x27;t given me an executable; I&#x27;ve still got the runtime overhead of Node, and everything that comes with it.<p>There are a few Python programs I also brush aside for this reason, though substantially fewer. Virtually every Node project I&#x27;ve seen is a spidery mess of dependencies bringing in dependencies bringing in yet more un-auditable dependencies; the worst Python tends to get is Tensorflow, and it&#x27;s ready to run immediately (compiling C modules aside – though pip does that at installation time, making that a one-time annoyance for all but obscure C packages).')
