The huge advantage the shipping companies had, was relocation. But, the fact remains a rational negotiation worked. This single fact (relocation) does not explain why.<p>For some reason, rational negotiation with the workers in the US tunnel boring community doesn&#x27;t work. Given the amount of excess cost, I think it is very likely better negotiating could work. The question would be, why there hasn&#x27;t been a rational negotiation. I would argue, the highly intermittent nature of tunnelling, and tunnel work, has made the entities involved (the employers, the state, the city, the corporates) reluctant to do the negotiating.<p>You talk to consequence: behaviour on the job. That doesn&#x27;t have a lot to do with negotiating. Negotiating is done behind closed doors.')
