Of all my computers it is only my 2 windows machines that have trouble sleeping and waking. All of my linux machines sleep no problem and only wake up when I have scheduled it. I even have them set up to receive sleep and wake commands from my phone from anywhere. Windows doesn&#x27;t play nice with that type of setup either.<p>My windows computers will wake up less than 5 minutes after going to sleep but I&#x27;ve left my linux systems on sleep for days and sometimes weeks at a time with no problem at all.')
