If you asked them, most people are probably fine with vaccines. There&#x27;s a small portion of very vocal people on both sides who you could describe as &quot;antivaxxers&quot; or people skeptical of vaccination. Now, the thing is, I imagine if you asked most people if they would be up for government-mandated, no-questioning forced vaccinations, I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s how you&#x27;ll get bipartisan support AGAINST  vaccinations and even further light the fire of antivaxxers in this country. Be careful with what you wish for.')
