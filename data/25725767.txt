I said I don&#x27;t give a mosquito&#x27;s dick about either of you. If you want to burn down your neighborhoods, go right ahead. You go to the Capitol to commit violence, it&#x27;s an entirely different story. A coup is orders of magnitude more serious than street violence. You act as though thugs beating each other up in the streets is the same as thugs coming to the capitol to beat up our senators in an attempt to thwart the Constitution. It&#x27;s not. I don&#x27;t care whether or not you understand that it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s gone way too far, and it&#x27;s time to bring things back in hand. Be mad if it brings you comfort, but keep your thugs in the streets and away from our capitol and political leaders.<p>You seem pretty bothered by the street violence, I would advise you to stay away from the Capitol and instead report the street violence to your local constabulary. That&#x27;s the best I can do for you.')
