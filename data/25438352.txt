If they were bad reasons somebody else would have made something that makes signal redundant.<p>Somebody will make signal redundant one day. When I look at it I see that day has not come. When it does the world is a better place for the advances made by signal.<p>The decisions they&#x27;ve made are &#x2F;why&#x2F; signal is the leader of the pack by a margin. But please do make better ones. Please do give us something better than signal. Their libraries are all capital F Free. Go for it.<p>Crapping on them from the sideline, sure, go ahead but acknowledge they&#x27;ve done rather better than &#x2F;anyone&#x2F; else in this space. It&#x27;s not even close. So maybe their decisions are worth considering as having some merit? Disagree sure, but really. They&#x27;ve done it. Well. I haven&#x27;t. Nobody else has.<p>I don&#x27;t like electron.

Straight to heaven for achieving that, for mine.')
