It took time to learn how to accept &amp; adapt to the  changed mindset.<p>I eventually learned to redirect myself - which Adderall enabled me to do.

That helped me redirect away from counterproductive behaviors - not just revived behaviors but also the persistent ones. Making progress on those was huge.<p>During this process, the messy, euphoric edges smoothed themselves out.
