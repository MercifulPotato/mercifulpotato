Contract law should cover that (I&#x27;m def no expert).  Does it?  Like, if Amazon decides to cut me off from hosting, and I haven&#x27;t broken any laws, rules or ToS, they should have to pay for me to be up-and-running elsewhere.  In other words, AWS can&#x27;t boot someone without establishing wrong-doing.<p>It feels like this wouldn&#x27;t require much more than tighter contracts, handing more power to the customer.  I&#x27;m in favour of that.')
