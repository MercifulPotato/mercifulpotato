Now, granted, AT&amp;T fiber is slow to come here, but it&#x27;s hard to know if the fact that the infrastructure is buried is the main reason. They are in some areas of town but not others.<p>You can bury conduits, by the way, and not cables or fiber directly. This allows you to avoid digging again just to install fiber, for example. There are ways to do it right. And having the infrastructure on poles is not a panacea either. New providers are not necessarily allowed to use the poles. The weather might not be crazy, but the poles are already overloaded and a little windstorm will disrupt electricity, coax cable, or fiber. And of course, those overloaded poles are crazy ugly.')
