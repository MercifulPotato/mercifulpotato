It&#x27;s still a straight line, just along the geodesic of the local spacetime. It looks curvy if you bend and flatten spacetime into a Euclidean space, but that&#x27;s because you bent it! Light in a vacuum always travels in straight lines. Gravitational lensing isn&#x27;t gravity bending the light, it&#x27;s the light traveling in straight lines through highly curved space.')
