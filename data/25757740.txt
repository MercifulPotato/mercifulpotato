Phoronix even have GCC faster than Clang at building the Linux Kernel, even in an (according to a comment) biased sample where GCC wasn&#x27;t built with lto enabled. GCC also (last time I tried) does better debug info.<p>It&#x27;s entirely possible that the only reason GCC &amp; Clang are so close is that both projects focused on places where the other project beat them &amp; so have converged. Certainly the LTO work that&#x27;s been going on is an obvious example where the two projects have learned &amp; pushed each other. GCC&#x27;s original LTO implementation was basically unusable. Then Clang released ThinLTO &amp; GCC scrambled to add WHOPR (&amp; by my reading of the blog posts the engineer(s) on it have done some amazing work to pull ahead of the Clang team at times).')
