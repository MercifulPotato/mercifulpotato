Wikipedia says there are 21 &quot;districts&quot;, so that works out to a 500 Mb&#x2F;s link per building, which seems pretty modest for a institution.<p>&gt;20 petabytes stored at any moment if you&#x27;re holding everything for 180 days.<p>If it&#x27;s being stored using aws glacier deep archive, that&#x27;s only $20k&#x2F;month. That&#x27;s probably a drop in the bucket compared to the rest of the costs associated with running such a service.')
