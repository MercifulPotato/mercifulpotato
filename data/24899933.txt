It&#x27;s similar to how sometimes people suggest dropping yaml&#x2F;json for a &quot;simple ini file&quot;: it quickly breaks down and you end up with a custom ill-defined mechanism for nesting values.<p>TCL can handle more than just string variables: you have arrays, dicts and a bazillion libraries implementing object orientation. The result is that manipulating structured data is still more awkward than in any other modern language, except perhaps shell scripting.<p>Unless you&#x27;re interfacing with a legacy or third-party system please don&#x27;t use it. If you think you need expect please just use pexpect.')
