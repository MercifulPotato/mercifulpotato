Then one is left with reverting to positional formats. Mixing positional and named formats is less than robust. One of the common cases for function output is using pprint. As someone who has been using Python since 2.4 print formating using pprint is robust. Over the years I&#x27;ve found it a best practice to only use positional formatting so as to have the format string be stable when switching between usuing a variable or pprint of the variable, especially when debugging. So, I am not using f strings. Another thing is that as a decades long PERL developer I observe Python is becoming the new PERL in having fifty ways to do something. All of these ways will have small-to-large performance differences. Because of this then soon we will all have the Python Cookbook on our shelves to document them so one knows when to part ways with less optimal usages. It is always faster to print an unformatted list then a format string and in fact pylint will ding your code if logger uses a format string and not a list of strings and variables in print order. Then one begins to wonder if this is the case for logger then why not for every print statement? And thus Python is quickly degenerating into PERL code readable territory with each new version.')
