The rationale is that functional code can be really difficult to read if you aren&#x27;t already familiar with the idioms and terminology, whereas it&#x27;s pretty easy to mentally parse and understand a `for` loop. So in that sense, list comprehensions are about as far as Python goes in that direction; there is no syntactic equivalent to the pipe operator, and no way to write reduce or similar operations as succinctly as you can in functional languages.')
