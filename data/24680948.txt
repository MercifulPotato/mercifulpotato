I think &quot;defensive writing&quot; is better understood as &quot;good writing&quot;.<p>I agree 100%.<p>One thing I HATE HATE HATE is when research articles use unnecessary synonyms. Ie, <i>plasma membrane</i> in one sentence and then <i>phospholipid membrane</i> in another and then <i>cell membrane</i> in another. For someone just trying to get a grasp on a topic, it is REALLY fucking confusing. And even if you&#x27;re an expert on the topic, it&#x27;s still annoying. Just pick one and stick with it.<p>OR uses stupidly complex words just to appear smart. Ie, ameliorates, a term I&#x27;ve ONLY ever seen in biology research articles and yet is a completely unscientific&#x2F;unnecessary word. This isn&#x27;t your creative writing class. Just fucking say that you found that your drug decreases lipid synthesis, NOT that it <i>ameliorates</i> it you big dunce.<p>ALSO one more thing that annoys me - when people only use a term 3 or 4 times in a paper, but still INSIST on using the acronym. Ok, I get it - if it&#x27;s something WAY more commonly referred to by its acronym like DNA or COPD, it&#x27;s acceptable and probably preferable. But if it&#x27;s central pontine myelinolysis, just fucking type it out instead of writing CPM so I don&#x27;t have to waste mental energy trying to decipher what it means.<p>If anything, scientific writing should be dumbed down more.<p>PS. While I&#x27;m on my biomed-academia soapbox, I&#x27;d like to point out that the correct pronunciation of <i>constitutive</i> is just as it&#x27;s written - similar to constitution. It&#x27;s TUTIVE not TUITIVE.')
