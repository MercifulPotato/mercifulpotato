I started showing symptons when I was 14.<p>Completely by coincidence I found out it was the government&#x27;s fault, a lot of people, me included, developed the disease suddenly, at same time, and what happened at that time was that the government increased mandatory iodine levels in the salt, it caused an explosion of hypothyroidism cases, they then scaled it back and new cases returned to the average.<p>Problem is that people that had the disease triggered by Iodine never come back to normal no matter what.')
