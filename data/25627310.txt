I&#x27;ll add briefly to point (1) and (2).<p>(1) vaccine manufacturing was very much blocked by approval. For example, instead of having 30M doses of Astrazeneca in December, because of approval delays they delivered 5M instead. Companies also cannot produce too much of vaccines that might spoil. Letting them distribute even a nominal amount (say 1M&#x2F;mo since June) would have learned us many valuable lessons by now and allowed many more vaccines to be manufactured.<p>(2) they discussed long term side effects on the approval calls. There has only been 1 side effect after 6 weeks ever recorded in history. It was a long time ago with a live virus polio vaccine on an immunocompromised person. Given the many billions of vaccines given in history, the odds of a long term side effect are not literally impossible, but as close as we get in medicine.')
