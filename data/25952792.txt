The fact that you haven’t is a perfect commentary on why mainstream media is failing the American people when it comes to exposing Wall Street’s serial looting of the little guy.<p>This is some fluff piece trying to make out typical Wallstreet plays into more than they are. This isn&#x27;t a special event which is newsworthy, but there&#x27;s nothing left about Trump so the news outlets are latching on to anything that has a catchy narrative.<p>The big money is being very efficient about profiting from a number of coinciding events, which again, has been baked into our economy forever. You need money to make money. This is what you get from the kind of (bench) legislation and corrupt political parties...but I repeat myself.')
