That is the same situation as the U.S. except we&#x27;ve got 10x the population as Canada...so we&#x27;ve got more people in more places. As for Australia, a huge chunk of the country is desert, and most people are situated along the coasts.<p>The U.S. doesn&#x27;t want urbanism. People by and large do not want to live in dense urban areas. Some people like it, but it&#x27;s not everyone&#x27;s cup of tea. With the remote work revolution, it&#x27;s going to become even less appealing to live in a dense urban area.')
