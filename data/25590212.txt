Either it&#x27;s done in bad faith, or it&#x27;s ignorant of how corporate taxes work (and why).<p>If you don&#x27;t earn a profit, there&#x27;s nothing to tax. Amazon has been (to the credit of their extremely patient investors) funneling their revenue back into growing the company instead of giving it to investors and the government.<p>Amazon could jack up its prices, stop hiring, cut wages, lay off tens of thousands of workers, slash investments that grow the company, and they would realize a tidy profit. Now they are paying corporate taxes. I guess that would make populist politicians and pundits happy?')
