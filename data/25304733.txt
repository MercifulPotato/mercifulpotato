All I said was that the Republican Party (in Congress) seems to believe that <i>any and all</i> is bad while Democrats believe in some or more (depending on how you feel).<p>It also doesn’t help that people want to label everyone so much to fit into just two categories. Feinstein (D-CA) is <i>very</i> pro-surveillance while some of the party (in congress) believes otherwise. Romney (R-UT) voted to convict Trump while every other Republican voted to acquit.<p>I’ll admit it is a bit hypocritical of me to lump all Republicans together, so I’ll clarify with: it’s where the party (in congress) seems to be heading (or already is). Obviously not all Republicans support that idea.')
