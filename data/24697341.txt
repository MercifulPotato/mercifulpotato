I wouldn&#x27;t use the word `inefficient` so heavily. They are really good at bringing you some kind of products, not the home grown quality kind though.<p>&gt; This system spends incredible amounts of resources (time, energy, labor) which you can save by simply growing your own food.<p>No, growing two potatoes only or a bunch of tomatoes take up time blah blah scale blah blah time money salary blah blah.<p>I am hooked anyway, I always wanted to try to grow something and if filling up an ikea bag with dirt and some seeds is enough to watch green stuff grow I&#x27;ll be happy to try that as an hobby !')
