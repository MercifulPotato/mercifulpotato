Item(by='valldrac', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610494655, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25753520, text='&gt; “Stolen or searched” isn’t a very specific description. Does the attacker have the screen lock? Or is the screen unlocked but they don’t have the screen lock factor?\n&gt; Does the attacker have the ability to inject code into the running OS, or only to read memory contents?<p>As long as Molly is locked, it doesn&#x27;t really matter. It offers protection in the worst case scenario, under the premises I noted before.<p>&gt; This can increase safety, but at cost of features or usability (as you noted) or complexity.<p>You are right. Just keep in mind not everyone need a safe, but the people who need it appreciate having the option to buy one.<p>&gt; why wouldn’t I just use the lock screen?<p>Because you know there have been working exploits in the past to bypass the lock screen, or to read physical RAM directly from the USB port of a locked phone (1). And thus it is reasonable to believe there are still more vulnerabilities to be discovered and patched in Android.<p>(1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saltaformaggio.ece.gatech.edu&#x2F;publications&#x2F;DIIN_17.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saltaformaggio.ece.gatech.edu&#x2F;publications&#x2F;DIIN_17.p...</a>')
