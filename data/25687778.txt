I own multiple smart phones (work and personal), iPad, and two computers (windows and Mac). So far Facebook messenger is the only reliable way to do messaging across all of them, which is a shame because I hate Facebook and I don’t particularly like messenger. But I have not found a single other solution that works cross-device and cross-platform. It also helps that basically everyone is on Facebook messenger, but I’d be willing to put effort into trying to migrate people to other chat solutions if there was literally anything else out there that works well on multiple devices.')
