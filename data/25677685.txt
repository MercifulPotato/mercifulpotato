Simple as a bank is probably one of the worst banks I have ever tried to deal with. I very regularly wish that their app was a layer on top of other bank accounts, such that I could view my Chase account but from the Simple app.<p>Unfortunately, their banking business (not the app) was their core business, and they were absolutely awful at banking.')
