This is awesome, because thumbs are strong and relatively quick.<p>However: with the exception of those sculpted keyboards (Dactyl-ManuForm et.al.), the thumb keys are triggered by lateral thumb movement, which can be troublesome.<p>I had absolutely no problems using traditional keyboards for ~30 years, but decided to proactively switch to a split keyboard (ReDox) nonetheless.<p>Mostly it&#x27;s great, but I developed pain in my thumbs from the constant uncommon (to me) lateral thumb movement.<p>I replaced the thumb switches with lighter ones and remapped my keyboard layout to use only 4 of the available 12 thumb keys, but it&#x27;s still not ideal.<p>I&#x27;m thinking about building one of those sculpted keyboards now.')
