Eg paying for a pack of gum with your Mastercard<p>Edit: This wasn&#x27;t intended to be a hypothetical- I agree BTC uses significantly more per transaction, but I&#x27;m curious how it compares to the entirety of a system like Mastercard divided by number of transactions (including all employee&#x2F;office space&#x2F;commute&#x2F;etc energy consumption). There are clearer&#x2F;fewer inputs for Bitcoin for sure but that doesn&#x27;t mean we shouldn&#x27;t account for the total environmental cost of a behemoth like Mastercard.<p>Bitcoin can never and should never replace our current payments network as it simply cannot scale in its current form. But, I do think people simply look at the cost to run the technology itself and assume that&#x27;s the total environmental cost of a system.')
