I had an MSX from 1985 on which I learned BASIC, then wrote my own assembler (because commercial ones were too expensive).<p>Some years later, having busted in University, I was an unpaid intern assistant sound engineer in the studio that recorded my band&#x27;s album (we didn&#x27;t sold it much). I&#x27;ve started working with digital audio (Sound Designer II, anyone? then Opcode Studio Vision).<p>At some point for some reason the studio started contracting development work. We were supposed to do the sound design and music for some interactive touch-screen kiosk systems (around 1994), and for some reason (maybe some failed contractor) we finally took care of the whole development, using Scala (not the same as today&#x27;s Scala, but some sort of Macromedia Director predecessor) on Amiga machines, which I did.<p>Then I had my first contact with Unix when we developed an Interactive Voice Response program (those were all the rage in the mid 90s). We did the audio part, then the programming itself. It was running on a SCO Unix machine (1995) and the logic used some sort of weird BASIC.<p>Fast forward to 1996. I was working in TV still as an assistant sound engineer (but paid, this time). I discovered SGI IRIX and fell in love at first sight. I then installed Slackware Linux 2.x on a spare PC found at work.')
