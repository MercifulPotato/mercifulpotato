Vanguard for example it took less than a minute to set up.  I don&#x27;t have an &quot;application&quot; installed locally for the Yubikey, it was plug &amp; play.  No special software needed.<p>I honestly think Yubikey type devices&#x27; largest problems are -\n1. Marketing.  People simply do not know they exist or how they work (simple or not).\n2. Support - Many websites do not support Webauthn yet.  We really need developers and businesses to consider this a priority.<p>I have bought some keys for my family members and they love them once I demonstrate how they work.')
