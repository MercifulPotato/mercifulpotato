Apart from the cost, I wonder if it wouldnâ€™t be more convenient to have identical machines at work, home and for travel but they all use the same removable (SSD) hard drive, which contains not just data but the whole setup incl OS, installed software and settings etc<p>So say I work at home, then go to the office. Instead of bringing the laptop, I just remove the hard drive, go to the office, plug it into and identical laptop there and continue working where I left off.<p>Has anyone tried this?')
