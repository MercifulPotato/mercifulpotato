Item(by='phailhaus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608301692, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25462383, text='&gt; They&#x27;re not thinking of cases the system must handle<p>That&#x27;s not their fault; git&#x27;s CLI attempts to abstract away the details and presents a falsely simple view of the world with &quot;checkout&quot;, &quot;add&quot;, &quot;commit&quot;, and &quot;push&quot;. This works for a while, until it doesn&#x27;t, and then you have to face the complexity of the graph all at once. If I was going to redesign its CLI, I&#x27;d make the graph as transparent as possible.')
