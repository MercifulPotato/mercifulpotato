That&#x27;s why I dispute that it doesn&#x27;t have the same traps.<p>I agree that if you program C by emulating higher-level object systems, it becomes unmanageable and a lot of bugs around object lifetimes appear, and they&#x27;re very hard to fix.<p>I personally don&#x27;t have a great interest in such object systems, but fail to see how C++ should be any worse than Pascal in terms of perceived safety resulting from the higher level of abstraction.')
