Researchers are often unable to demonstrate or\nevaluate new techniques beyond small toy applications, and\npractitioners are often unable to adopt methods from the\nliterature in new and existing applications. This position\nstatement examines a vision in which anybody can modify\nany GUI of any application, similar to a scenario where\nevery GUI of every application is open-source. We are\ncurrently working to enable this vision through our\ndevelopment of Prefab, using pixel-based interpretation of\nGUIs to enable modification of those GUIs without any\ncooperation from the underlying application. We see\nparticipation in the FLOSS HCI workshop as valuable in at\nleast two regards. First, fully realizing this vision will likely\nrequire a community-based approach, so we are interested\nin Prefab as a platform for collaboration between HCI\nresearchers and the FLOSS community. Second, enabling\narbitrary modification of any GUI would seem to blur many\ncurrent distinctions between open and closed applications,\nintroducing new research questions and further magnifying\nthe importance of the workshopâ€™s focus.<p>I wrote more about it here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11520967" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11520967</a>')
