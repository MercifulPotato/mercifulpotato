We tried it out in an isolated project, and it worked very well, so we went ahead and used it in more projects.<p>There&#x27;s always the issue of &quot;where will we find people who know Scala?&quot; of course. I can&#x27;t tell if it matters; certainly, there are fewer people with that skill, but they are also competing for fewer jobs.<p>Later on we started a company together and went all in on Scala. It&#x27;s served us very well over the quite a few years we&#x27;be been going now.')
