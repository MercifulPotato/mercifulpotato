Item(by='sulam', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607376340, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25334218, text='&gt; Tech in SFBA reminds me of the Resource curse (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Resource_curse" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Resource_curse</a>).<p>Okay, I&#x27;m going to give you the benefit of the doubt here because you said &quot;reminds [you]&quot;, not that it _is_ in fact the Resource curse. However, you must acknowledge that the Resource Curse doesn&#x27;t describe the SF Bay Area _at all_.<p>We have the richest real estate in country, some of the highest earning zipcodes in the country, employment rate most of the country would love to have, etc. There&#x27;s no &quot;curse&quot; here, as defined in the economic sense.')
