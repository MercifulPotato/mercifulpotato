Legislators will write a law (primary legislation) via an Act (of parliament) and powers are delegated to a regulator (or minister) who will then set regulations (secondary legislation) that fit within the power of the Act.<p>The secondary legislation is the bit that can be updated without requiring a new Act. If EU law is set up in the same manner, (and no doubt it will be similar as not only is this method good when meeting the ideal but useful for corrupt politicians to write law with less scrutiny) then the copy and paste is from secondary legislation. It may well need an update but that doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t be updated in the manner you advocate.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Delegated_legislation_in_the_United_Kingdom" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Delegated_legislation_in_the_U...</a>')
