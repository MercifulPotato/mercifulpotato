It states the issue at hand and gives the facts available to us.<p>The item you&#x27;ve linked (the filing by the Texas AG against Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, and Wisconsin) is weird.<p>It seems to think there&#x27;s some serious difference between mail-in and absentee voting in GA. In GA, the term absentee voting encompasses both early voting and mail in voting. The only absentee voting that has signature verification is the mail-in component (IDs are checked instead for early voting).<p>And it appears to make the same &quot;error&quot; you&#x27;ve continued to make: it conflates rejection for signature mismatch and rejection for all reasons, when the signature mismatch rejections are a subset of all reasons.')
