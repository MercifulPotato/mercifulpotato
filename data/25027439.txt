Let&#x27;s face the facts - the current conservative media environment (Fox, etc) is deeply distorted.<p>I&#x27;m not making claims based on bad information, or making untrue claims.<p>Let&#x27;s also bear in mind that, as much as networks like Fox distort and manipulate the truth, I&#x27;d bet plenty of people in these distorted media environments have a degree of understanding that what the Trump administration has done is wrong.<p>But people (all people) hate the discomfort of cognitive dissonance and look for any reason to avoid it.<p>To circle back to the main point, people making false claims (even if they are unaware of the falsehoods their claims are based on) is not the same thing as someone else pointing out the falsehood itself.')
