Just 100 years ago, people were being forced to work on ships, in factories, on farms, in wars and 3-4 generations living in one home was normal. Just 60 years ago, many people were heavily discriminated against and had little freedom.<p>Imo, these &quot;more effective social associations&quot; just lead to an increase in mental problems and perhaps ultimately, to the unraveling of such societies. Long term *ships are good, the focus on hyper efficiency just means more and more people are being left behind, and groups simply have no idea what other groups are thinking or how to work with them.<p>See all the antimaskers, antivaxxers, authoritarian supporters. All dismissed as stupid&#x2F;irrelevant and considered a minority by the other side. And vice versa. The reality is different, but there&#x27;s such a disconnect that no one knows how to fix this.')
