I mean dotnet basically has no good pdf library like pdfbox. of course there are thousand commerical vendors but some of them are either bad, some have stupid pricing (itext, lul) or don&#x27;t have modern features and basically are only money grab.\nthe good thing is, is that microsoft provided tons of libraries upfront and that linking with native code is simple.')
