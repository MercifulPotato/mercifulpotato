I suspect this is so people don&#x27;t try to run their own bots because they think they have signed up for a service to run one for them, but it may also just be because they&#x27;re so huge and have many thousands of emails to send.<p>I am not planning on advertising this anywhere so feel free to sign up and get notified as soon as my bot sees something :) I&#x27;ve already got a 3080 from it. My friend wanted to use it so I figured I&#x27;d make it usable to anyone.')
