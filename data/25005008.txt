It&#x27;s 8 stage, dual core (with SMT) targeting 1.2GHz on 16nm. It seems likely to be between an a35 (wearable) and a55.<p>With those chips starting at around $10 and around 100m units per year, it&#x27;s easily 11-30 million per year but including the fact that integrating the arm core is also expensive and requires engineers. That money represents 22-60 full time engineers at $500,000 each. They also have a m4 sized chip too which is another big chunk of money<p>These big companies stand to save a lot moving to RISC-V.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.neowin.net&#x2F;news&#x2F;arm-reportedly-hiking-licensing-fees-of-its-chips-by-four-times-for-some-customers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.neowin.net&#x2F;news&#x2F;arm-reportedly-hiking-licensing-...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;riscv.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;12.11-14.20a3-Bandic-WD_SweRV_Cores_Roadmap_v4SCR.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;riscv.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;12.11-14.20a3-B...</a>')
