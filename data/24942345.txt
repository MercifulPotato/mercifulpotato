If I do go back to streaming service, that&#x27;s a fair price.<p>As a single person, I&#x27;ve watched as most of these services have increased their prices for single users but made it much more reasonable for a family.<p>Why am I paying the same price for Amazon Prime as a family of 5 with a 3K square house who orders from Amazon 2x&#x2F;day and watches 5x the video?<p>Why am I paying $70&#x2F;month for cable for maybe 7 hours&#x2F;week when some family is watching 100 hours combined per week?<p>Why am I still paying a premium for AT&amp;T post-paid mobile service when a family who is constantly adding and changing new lines for the kids gets a brand new IPhone or two each year during their upgrade deals, yet AT&amp;T won&#x27;t ever offer an existing user a discount on a new phone?<p>Same with Spotify, Apple Music, HBO, etc.')
