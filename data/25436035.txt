Decentralized protocols that operate at the internet layer above the interference of nation states are being built and deployed today and while they are still in their infancy they have a clear path to providing a neutral, private, and reliable platform for people from around the world to work together, build together, and coordinate more easily without any big corporations or authoritarian governments corrupting the systems.<p>Facebook&#x2F;Twitter will be turned into a protocol within 10 years that anyone can use. Permissionless systems like the internet always win over centralized systems over time. Big tech will eventually be remembered the same way as we remember AOL.<p>The future is bright and I&#x27;m fairly optimistic. I will enjoy living in a post-nation state driven world where humanity works together as a whole towards our common goals.')
