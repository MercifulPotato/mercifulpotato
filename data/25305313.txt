Item(by='majormajor', descendants=None, kids=[25306854], score=None, time=1607103648, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25304470, text='&quot;He&#x27;s talking about billionaires but he&#x27;s REALLY talking about something else that people in the right audience will get, and just filter out the noise&quot; sounds fairly out of touch, if he can&#x27;t see that the framing he&#x27;s using is needlessly complicating the issue. Or if he wants to connect to a larger political discussion about global economic systems but only has substance to discuss related to a narrower &quot;building a business&quot; question.<p>Would be easier to just talk about what he&#x27;s actually talking about, then.')
