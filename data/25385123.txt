Surely they would prefer mobile devices model in which many people switch device every 2 years.<p>I bet there are some higher ups in Dell, HP counting how wonderful it would be to force people to switch to the new model more often. Or maybe even sell hardware subscription.<p>This would be terrible for the environment, but who cares (never heard Tim Cook or Bill Gates going on the stage and saying, hey, we have a new fancy model (i-whatever or Surface), but your 2 years old one is also great, so keep using it, this would be good for the environment).')
