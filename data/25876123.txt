It’s unclear to me what organizations would have the resources to develop something like the A78 for RISC-V and would also be happy giving it away for free.<p>Note that in the ARM world everyone except Apple and Nvidia have given up on developing their own microarchitectures - they all just license one from ARM and maybe apply some customizations on top.')
