They&#x27;ve said they were migrating their entire product line within 2 years. The Mac Pro is part of that product line. The only questions are <i>how</i> Apple is going to get there and on that front it&#x27;s pretty clear this article is pure speculation.<p>Will the Mac Pro have integrated graphics or a discrete GPU? Maybe someone at AMD knows this based on order volume? Likewise, are they using external RAM, soldered on the logic board, or user-serviceable RAM?<p>How is performance going to compare to current top end processors?<p>Those are the only questions, and the answers here are pure speculation. It&#x27;s likely only a handful of people at Apple even know the answers to these things.')
