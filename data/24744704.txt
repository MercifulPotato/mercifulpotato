Around here, I&#x27;ve never seen stuff that low - here, it&#x27;s Euro95 and Euro98. I&#x27;ve been told a real long time ago that the 95 and 98 in there were octane numbers.<p>Anyone any idea if octane numbers are calculated differently in US vs EU? Or if someone lied to me? Or if the US is really using much lower-grade petrol than is Conon in the EU?')
