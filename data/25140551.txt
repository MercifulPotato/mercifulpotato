In theory, sure, a python script should be portable, but in my experience the level of dependency hell involved can be extreme, and it&#x27;s not uncommon with what I&#x27;ve done to see a developer specify some baroque stack to get something to work. This in fact is one of the reasons I&#x27;ve seen for using things like conda, so that you can create different environments with different versions of different packages for different applications. This just gets worse when you consider the edge cases for things like pypy etc.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this to slam python, as I use it, but it&#x27;s one thing I find attractive about certain other languages (such as those described as more portable in the linked piece).<p>There&#x27;s a certain honesty about the linked piece that in the very least seems reasonable, even if you disagree with it. As you say, it depends on your idea of &quot;portability.&quot;')
