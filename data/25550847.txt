Which has had the same level of annotations previously by Anantech.<p>Sure, the DFR in early 2021 will be much more detailed, but also expensive to the point 0.001% of HN viewers will actually be able to see it. As such, I think your skepticism of this being worthy of home page billing is not out of line.<p>For the record, this is not meant to be a dig at TechInsights. I’ve seen a DFR before and they really are good for what they are, it’s just not something most HNers would gain value from, even if it were free.')
