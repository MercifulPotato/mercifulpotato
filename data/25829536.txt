We also have a whole category for animals which don&#x27;t practice locomotion, sessile.<p>I would say the most central distinction between animals and (plants|fungi) is that animals have a definite body shape, while the other two have indefinite body shapes.<p>That isn&#x27;t a perfect distinction (the occasional gecko will regenerate two tails where it had one before), but it&#x27;s very good, in addition to being striking &#x2F; obvious.')
