I consider this delay not just an ergonomic limitation but also a definite design fault (i.e.:  the DVB standard allows the delay to occur).  The fact that regulators authorized DVB&#x2F;TV digital services with this fault speaks more to me about the commercial pressure brought to bear on the regulators (to accept the limitation) than it does about any proper consultative&#x2F;evaluation process (user ergonomics evaluation)  having been properly undertaken before these services were introduced.<p><i>(…But then, I suppose we can&#x27;t have expected much better from DVB standards given that in the 1980s many governments around the world essentially nuked their spectrum management departments and outsourced much of the work to commercial organizations that had vested interests—thus, effectively they were committed to lower standards.  [This is a long sad story which, unfortunately, is much too involved to discuss here.])</i>')
