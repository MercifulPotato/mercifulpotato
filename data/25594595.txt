They don&#x27;t care about justice, and they aren&#x27;t incentivized to prosecute tough cases where rich companies have dozens of lawyers and present roadblock after roadblock through legal defense. We literally need robot lawyers that will prosecute and convict people tirelessly and fairly.\nThere are hackers who did much less that got the book thrown at them and actually spent time in jail. Weev&#x27;s case (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;deeplinks&#x2F;2013&#x2F;07&#x2F;weevs-case-flawed-begi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;deeplinks&#x2F;2013&#x2F;07&#x2F;weevs-case-flawed-begi</a>...) is disgusting even though he was using AT&amp;T&#x27;s own APIs and actually didn&#x27;t hack anything. Yes, Weev appears to be a horrible person but that isn&#x27;t the point, the point is the law should be fair to everyone. If the Ticketmaster execs and those that hacked CrowdSurge don&#x27;t see a sentence much harsher than this, it will be an attack against justice. But again, I don&#x27;t think justice will be served because the prosecutors literally don&#x27;t care about justice.')
