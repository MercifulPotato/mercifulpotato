It reviews probably 30 prominent philosophers from the Western world, starting with the ancient Greeks and coming to modern day.<p>It&#x27;s not comprehensive, and Russell isn&#x27;t focused on staying completely objective on each subject. But it&#x27;s a great overview, and in my opinion the subjectivity from Russell adds a bit of personality that makes it easier to read.')
