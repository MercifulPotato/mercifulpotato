Only the tool&#x27;s users actually do download stuff or attempt to.<p>Also you&#x27;d be hard pressed to prove such specific intent from some random testsuite url, added by one or two authors, when the tool has very many authors&#x2F;contributors and the README&#x2F;manual for users just has non-copyrighted material sample urls, anyway.<p>RIAA just tries to make it harder to preserve regularly disappearing youtube content, like war crimes evidence, just to make some people richer on some stupid music. I can prove their intent, because that&#x27;s what this tool is used for, and they&#x27;re trying to remove the tool from the internet. &#x2F;s This is the same stupid argument they&#x27;re using. They will fail, but why not try to make other people&#x27;s lives harder, right?')
