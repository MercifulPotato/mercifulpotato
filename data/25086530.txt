From the slides:<p>Key goal: Representative sample of on-demand _work_ being done in \nthe city, not of all on-demand _workers_. (emphasis not mine)<p>The team making the study has selected parameters to examine basically exactly to produce a number where the majority of rideshare is full-time. So is it clear that most rideshare workers are full time? Definitely not. And the fact that the team has weighted their sampling in such a way makes me even more skeptical about the veracity of that fact when taken across the whole population of drivers.')
