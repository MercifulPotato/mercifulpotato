Imagine that there is a bill that D&#x27;s want and R&#x27;s prefer not. Assuming a somewhat even split in Congress, it will be hard to pass that bill. However, let&#x27;s say that there was a bill that R&#x27;s wanted, then D&#x27;s could make a bill that includes both measures. Now the bill includes things that both R&#x27;s and D&#x27;s want and a few things they prefer not to have. That bill will most likely pass and both sides will be happy.')
