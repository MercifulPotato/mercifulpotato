Carrefour is everywhere (though their market strategy changes a lot from country to country) and Spar&#x27;s operations are kinda spotty but also kinda everywhere.<p>Auchan is everywhere, but in heavy decline because they&#x27;re basically the Walmart (supercenter) of Europe and people don&#x27;t like to drive to a hypermarket that much anymore. Almost their only profitable branch at the moment is their Chinese one.<p>Lidl and Aldi&#x27;s presence is very spotty outside of Germany. Many countries copied their hard discount model so they have to fight with local companies that have a cultural edge (Lidl and Aldi tend to have tons of German products no matter the host country).<p>Tesco is a leader in the UK, then kinda common in Central-Eastern Europe, but then almost universally unknown in Germany-Austria-Italy and westward. There are more Tesco in Thailand than in the whole of Continental Europe, to put it in perspective.<p>Rewe is just in Germany, Austria and Eastern Europe (under different names and with wildly different marketing).<p>Iceland I never heard about, but it&#x27;s overwhelmingly a UK operation from a quick search.<p>From your mentions I&#x27;d take the wild guess that you live (or have lived) a significant amount of time in the UK ;)')
