While &quot;Telegram&quot; might refer to &quot;the Telegram app&quot; or &quot;the Telegram service&quot;, when talking about open-source, it nearly always refers to the service. Of the two, the source of the central server is arguably much more important, since it&#x27;s possible to at least track if the app tries to exfiltrate any data.')
