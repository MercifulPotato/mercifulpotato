Black Lives Matter is more of a slogan than an organization or a movement.  Many if not most of the BLM related protests were peaceful.  There were many events such as police making a show of taking the knee in front of protesters that have no comparison.  Where in the capitol actions did police take the knee as a show of empathy?<p>And there was a great deal of push back against BLM related protests.  Near me in Oakland, California the discount grocery store that serves a mostly black and largely poor neighborhood was ransacked and this caused a huge uproar and major social upheaval.  There was considerable resistance against the rioting at that time.<p>But all we heard from the right was a wretched flow of lies.  Democrats do nothing to stop violence they said, even when police were hurting from attempts to bring peace.  And then the same lovers of political theater cheered on an attack on the capitol.')
