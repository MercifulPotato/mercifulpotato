Now, he didn&#x27;t make it clear that he had made copies in the segment, but in other venues he did assert that copies were made.<p>UPS also acknowledged that the package was indeed opened and the contents missing (though they did find them later).<p>The point, as he admitted in a text to journalist Roger Sollenberger, was that he was convinced that someone was monitoring his texts.
