Diesel, warp, rocket et al are great but the DX and feature completeness aren&#x27;t there yet.<p>That said, with Cargo using the unreleased version is as simple as changing `rocket = &quot;0.4.5&quot;` to `rocket = { git = &quot;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SergioBenitez&#x2F;Rocket" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SergioBenitez&#x2F;Rocket</a>&quot; }` so it&#x27;s not like you even have to clone it manually. You can even specify branches if you urgently need a PR and patch entire workspaces with forked versions and so on.')
