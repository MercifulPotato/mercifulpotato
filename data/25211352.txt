It&#x27;s an incredibly powerful machine that can handle the most intensive of tasks. Software development is generally not such a task, unless you&#x27;re frequently re-compiling LLVM from source or something. (And even then, it&#x27;s a world of difference.)<p>Apple&#x27;s software developers, like most software developers who use Apple machines, use MacBook Pros (for the most part). Sometimes Mac Minis if they need multiple test machines, and I&#x27;m sure there are some who also have Mac Pros. But overwhelmingly, development is done on laptops that they dock while at work and take home with them after. (This was my experience when I interned there, anyway.)')
