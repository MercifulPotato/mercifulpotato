They&#x27;re valued not at all, because they&#x27;re reliably either Republican or Democrat [...] The only way I know how to put urban voters at parity with rural voters and rural voters at parity with urban voters is to make every voter in this country politically relevant in presidential elections.&quot;<p>The way to do that? A national popular vote that would require candidates to campaign in all 50 states. The effect would be that every voter would know their vote matters.<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re in the heart of Manhattan or in the outskirts of Helena. When you go vote for the American president, you know what&#x27;s going to count toward the final result in a national popular vote election. And you&#x27;re not going to be treated like a second-class citizen.&quot;')
