I can&#x27;t speak to the new hotwire stuff, other than the relatviely minor Stimulus2 changes.<p>Honestly it&#x27;s pretty straightforward and the API is tiny. It&#x27;s great for that grey area between serving server-loaded static pages and full-blown SPA - for example CRUD apps (and lots of things are pretty much CRUD apps).  Turbolinks gives you a &quot;poor man&#x27;s SPA&quot; for little effort (albeit with some gotchas) and Stimulus is fine, although it gets tedious for when you have to work with a lot of DOM elements e.g. &quot;when I click the Subscribe button, change it to an Unsubscribe button&quot;. Maybe a less imperative framework like AlpineJS might be simpler.')
