Let’s see.<p>First of all..this is a political hit piece. Secondly, it is untrue. The world has eradicated crippling poverty due to trickle down capitalism. Anyone who denies this is purposefully being dishonest.<p>Having said that..why it’s political..<p>&gt; That will be comforting news to U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak, whose hopes of repairing the country’s virus-battered public finances may rest on his ability to increase taxes, possibly on capital gains -- a levy that might disproportionately impact higher-earning individuals.[..]<p>Rishi Sunak is the husband of Akshata Murthy and son-in-law of Narayan Murthy.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tribuneindia.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;diaspora&#x2F;narayana-murthys-son-in-law-rishi-sunak-in-row-over-not-declaring-wifes-wealth-in-uk-ministerial-register-report-177136" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tribuneindia.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;diaspora&#x2F;narayana-murthys-...</a><p>[..] Akshata Murthy, who married Sunak in 2009, is the daughter of one of India&#x27;s most successful entrepreneurs. Her father co-founded the technology giant Infosys, and her shares in the company are worth £430 million, making her one of the wealthiest women in Britain, with a fortune larger than the Queen&#x27;s, The Guardian reported.[..]<p>[..] But Sunak&#x27;s entry mentions no family members other than his wife, and only refers to her ownership of a small, UK-based venture capital company.<p>Research by the Guardian shows that Murthy and her family hold many other interests, including: * A combined £1.7bn shareholding in Infosys, which employs thousands of staff in the UK and has held contracts with government ministries and public bodies.[..]<p>[..] The Guardian reported that after becoming chief secretary to the Treasury in July 2019, Sunak revealed for the first time that he was the beneficiary of a blind trust. He also included Murty for the first time, stating: &quot;Mr Sunak&#x27;s wife owns a venture capital investment company, Catamaran Ventures UK Ltd.&quot;[..]<p>While the wealth of the Murthy clan is staggering and Akshata Murthy(and the Sunak family by extension)‘s inherited riches are impressive making her ‘richer than the queen’, Infosys has also created a new middle class for the millions of educated youth who came out of educational institutions and ended up being gainfully employed. Everyone climbed a couple of rungs in India due to companies like Infosys. I don’t think anyone can deny this. What a bafflingly blatantly dishonest article&#x2F;study.<p>Nothing to see here. Ok to move on.')
