What I really want, though is a CLI calculator (something like bc or ipython) that would be clever enough to handle stuff like 1000!&#x2F;999! (increase the number of digits if python will be able to do that: I hope you get the idea). I cannot treat seriously a calculator in 2020 that actually tries to evaluate expressions numerically, while representing numbers as floats or int32.<p>Multiplying matrices and stuff is nice, but I don&#x27;t think I really ever needed that. But simple combinatorics and other calculations that involve large numbers and lots of simple operations (like powers), but are perfectly calculatable without losing precision on a piece of paper â€” plenty of times. It&#x27;s annoying that I can calculate on a piece of paper something my calculator cannot.<p>Other than that, maybe some operations over physical units&#x2F;unit conversion and some embedded city&#x2F;timezone DB, and I don&#x27;t think I can ask more of a calculator.')
