I&#x27;ve done events that other ultra-endurance athletes called &quot;insane&quot;. I wasn&#x27;t at the front of the pack, but I was at the front of the middle of the pack.<p>These days, I&#x27;m not interested in racing. I&#x27;m not even interested in training. But if I do think about &quot;fitness&quot; or &quot;health&quot; goals, it&#x27;s definitely structured around what I&#x27;d like to be able to do, rather than specifics of my body.<p>For example, one standing goal I&#x27;ve had for a long time is to remain fit enough be able to go out and run a half-marathon more or less on a whim, and still finish in 1:45 or less   without hurting too much.<p>More recently, having moved to 6000&#x27; as a home elevation, as well as being very sedentary from work&#x2F;life stuff, I&#x27;d like to be able to keep up runs uphill without stopping, regardless of the pace I&#x27;m moving at (currently impossible).<p>I think structuring things around &quot;what I want to be able to do, and how I want to feel after I do them&quot; is an excellent framework, and far better than &quot;lose N pounds&quot; or &quot;cut X minutes off my time for Y&quot;.')
