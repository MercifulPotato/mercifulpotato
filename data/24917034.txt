Markets tend towards monopoly, or at least an oligopoly. Market &#x27;equilibrium&#x27; where prices are &#x27;right&#x27; is an ideological fantasy.<p>That said - this is an example of how the legitimacy for private commercial corporations being run dictatorially based on formal property ownership kind of blows up in people&#x27;s faces when such corporations grow to the level of encompassing a significant part of some sector of the economy, or a significant part of social interaction altogether.<p>As for government intervention - the government is involved: Its basic role is to set this up and support it. Government checks corporate&#x2F;capitalist power mostly in the face of very strong public pressure and the threat of uprisings &#x2F; mass strikes &#x2F; violent redistribution etc.')
