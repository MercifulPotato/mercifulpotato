I tried to delegate as much as I can as that was too much for me and half year later only the &quot;project manager&quot; hat remained. I&#x27;m not yet sure I like that.<p>I can second the book from Camille Fournier. I&#x27;ve read multiple manager books and her book is the best I&#x27;ve read. Very practical and dense without bullshit.')
