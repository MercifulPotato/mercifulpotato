We still use Stripe as a Payment Gateway but we migrated off of their &quot;Billing&quot; product.<p>I think a lot of those problems related to us being a European business and Stripe not quite being there yet in regards to Tax and Invoicing but now we have switched it&#x27;s really shocking to me how steep of a price Stripe is placing on a somewhat lacking billing system here. I always assumed their Billing product was there to lock people in to the payment gateway and make it harder to have Interchange++ pricing negotiations.<p>What&#x27;s particularly sad is that I have fond memories of the early days of Stripe when I was genuinely excited to use their recurring charge product because the developer experience was so nice.<p>Today with VAT MOSS, SCA and a larger team the Billing product is neither easy nor powerful for us.<p>One saving grace for anyone else who finds themselves with an expensive &#x2F; insufficient Stripe integration is that they make migration out very easy. We were able to get the whole process done with no downtime or missed billing - so it&#x27;s definitely possible even when dealing with complex billing arrangements.')
