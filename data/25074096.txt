I never had issues, and my tenure began at Tiger. Everything was smooth sailing â€“ perhaps because I made sure to take a backup before every upgrade which might have protected me from Murphy&#x27;s law.<p>I am also sitting still on Mojave. In the past there were usually compelling reasons to upgrade - in terms of quality of life and performance. Catalina, in my use cases, doesn&#x27;t really do a whole lot for me. I can&#x27;t think of a single feature that I want aside from perhaps the standalone Podcasts app. But because of all the noise raised during the last upgrade season from Mojave to Catalina I decided that the juice definitely wasn&#x27;t gonna be worth the squeeze.<p>So now I have pretty much decided to just cruise this 2018 MBP along on Mojave until I replace the machine entirely. If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.')
