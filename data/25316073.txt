She was an employee who sent in her resignation&#x2F;ultimatum letter and then blasted an unprofessional message to a bunch of her colleagues.<p>She is obviously doing good research, but I could also see why she wouldn&#x27;t be a good fit for Google (or really any other large tech company).<p>I really don&#x27;t see why this isn&#x27;t a win for everyone.  She said she didn&#x27;t want to work there under current conditions, now she&#x27;s not.  I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll get a job in academia or at a think tank where she&#x27;ll be able to be much more critical of Google and big tech.  The world will better off because her voice and research won&#x27;t be toned down by a Google internal review. And Google gets to get rid of a problematic employee.  It&#x27;s a win-win-win.')
