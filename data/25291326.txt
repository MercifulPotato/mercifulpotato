The revenue from alternate clouds will be tiny compared to running in AWS, so there&#x27;s not much motivation internally to follow through. Also, to make money on other clouds you have to go deep on the products and offer value adds on top. That&#x27;s not the Amazon model and anyway would be difficult to implement outside of a small number of products. Ergo, this is not something they are really going to do in a meaningful way.<p>MS SQL Server is a historical analogy. Microsoft could have run the table in the database market by porting to Linux but took years to overcome internal inertia required to run outside Windows.')
