Item(by='lordnacho', descendants=None, kids=[24774872], score=None, time=1602665381, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24767706, text='Heh, this is the perfect place for me to jump in with some movie trivia.<p>Have you ever watched either Ip Man or &quot;The Bridge&quot; (Danish&#x2F;Swedish cop show)?<p>In Ip Man, there&#x27;s a gang of Mandarin speakers who show up in Ip Man&#x27;s Cantonese world. They somehow are able to speak to each other, and I find it unlikely. Perhaps it&#x27;s because my Cantonese is mediocre. But it just doesn&#x27;t sound like you could have a casual conversation across the languages.<p>A similar thing happens in The Bridge. There&#x27;s two cops solving a crime on the bridge connecting Denmark with Sweden, and they just talk to each other in their own languages. My guess is most people who didn&#x27;t study the other language would not know all the slang, as importantly the simple expressions. Though I guess it could be learned easily; I can read a Swedish newspaper, just not process it fast enough to have a fast conversation with a colleague.<p>Similarly with German and Swiss German. Something about the way the sounds are different makes processing the other one a bit slow if you&#x27;re not used to it.')
