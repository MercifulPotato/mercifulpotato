The relevant part is the quality, methodology of testing, existing written policy and technical requirements for the software. That you at the end deliver it in a deb, rpm or what have you, amounts to little.<p>Debian Stable (with its quality, Debian policy, testing, and stability of package major versions) is closer to CentOS. Fedora would be, as Debian Unstable, too fast moving for CentOS usecases.')
