And we don&#x27;t bother with a firewall at our office -- the only things on the office network are laptops, phones, printers, and sonos.<p>Basically, if you model senior eng time as $5k&#x2F;week -- not even counting the opportunity cost -- you&#x27;ll understand why AWS.<p>While I definitely think AWS is very expensive for the servers, they are not overall expensive.  Again, setting up CloudWatch in an afternoon or dumping tons of heterogenous logs into S3 and querying them with Athena or spinning up full environment stacks (front end pool, back end pool, load balancers, databases, vpcs, vpns, etc) is an enormous cost savings vs finding, installing, configuring, and maintaining batches of software to do the same.<p>edit: pay an eng $180k.  Fully loaded, you&#x27;re looking at $220k plus.  Add in either recruiting time or a recruiting fee that probably runs us $2k&#x2F;mo amortized over the first year on the low end.  Add in the fact that the first 6 weeks weren&#x27;t super productive, and also absorbed tons of time from other SE to get this person up to speed.  Add in PM time bringing this person up to speed on our product.<p>Yup, $5k&#x2F;week.')
