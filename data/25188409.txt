I make sure that I have a range of activities to do depending on energy level (writing about my research &#x2F; hacking on something &#x2F; reading nonfiction &#x2F; reading a &quot;brainless&quot; book &#x2F; surfing through HN or reddit), have pre-meditated that it&#x27;s okay to pay airport prices on a fancy coffee drink or a beer or whatever, have pre-meditated that I should have no expectations about productivity, and then just hunker down in a chair with my computer&#x2F;phone&#x2F;book and a drink and chill out. It feels very removed from the pressures of everyday life, which I likeâ€”I wouldn&#x27;t be able to chill half as well if I were at home and felt like I was supposed to be doing something more important.<p>On an airplane you lose the internet, but the same general strategy works for me. Re. sleeping, it works for me to sleep when I&#x27;m able to and say &quot;well if you can&#x27;t sleep right now, read your book. Oh, you&#x27;re too tired to read your book? Maybe it&#x27;s time to sleep&quot;')
