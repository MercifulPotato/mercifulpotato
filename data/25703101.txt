Old data will naturally be paged out. To put it directly the answer is each mmap file will need 1 page of physical memory (the area currently being read&#x2F;written). There may be old pages left around since there&#x27;s no reason for the OS to page anything out unless some other application asked for the memory. But if they do mmap will go to 1 page just fine and there&#x27;s zero cost to paging out.<p>I feel mmap gets a bad reputation when people look at memory usage tools that look at total virtual memory allocated.<p>I can mmap a 100GB of files, use 0 physical memory and a lot of memory usage tools will report 100GB of memory usage of a certain type (virtual memory allocated). You then get articles about application X using GB of memory. Anyone trying to correct this is ignored.<p>Google Chrome is somewhat unfairly hit by this. All those articles along the lines of &quot;Why is Google using 4GB with no tabs after i viewed some large PDFs&quot;. The answer is that it reserved 4GB of &#x27;addresses&#x27; that it has mapped to files. If another application wants to use that memory there&#x27;s zero cost to paging out those files from memory. The OS is designed to do this and it&#x27;s what mmap is for.')
