It would go to market later to be bought in smaller volumes by pickier customers.<p>Usually, this is a good strategy. Scaling is expensive. Starting small at the highest unit volumes subsidises scaling. But Apple is uniquely unconstrained here. Starting with the most technically forgiving makes sense.<p>You may not buy an Apple product now. But you will wonder &quot;what will Apple&#x27;s high end product be&quot; when weighing a competitor&#x27;s offerings.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Innovator&#x27;s_Dilemma" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Innovator&#x27;s_Dilemma</a>')
