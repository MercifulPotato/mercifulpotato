If this is what you care about, why don&#x27;t you actually try to make electricity cleaner. Realistic, that&#x27;s a much more effective way to address this tiny issue, together with the grand total of 50% of humanity&#x27;s CO2 emissions on top. To me it always seems like virtue signalling, showing that you &quot;care&quot;, while not having to actually make any realistic progress. Go build nuclear power plants, or at least prevent them from shutting down, if you want you&#x27;re electricity to be at 12 g CO2 &#x2F; kWh rather than 500 from natural gas or 800 from oil (you can also move your servers to France or Ontario). Do not focus on tiny, 10% efficiency gains in NLP. That&#x27;s a marginal gain within a miniature cause to start with.')
