Massive health costs to the workers and even people just living near coal extraction. Massive devaluation of land near the coal mines. Huge issues with <i>non-carbon</i> solution. That&#x27;s all before the concerns about climate change. Few people were compensated for the massive destruction of wealth&#x2F; health &amp; quality of life in the region. In many places the companies extracted every ounce of coal then when the lawsuits started pouring in, the company went belly up.<p>Once you take into account all the costs <i>outside</i> the costs of acquiring the land and extracting the coal, coal is vastly more expensive.')
