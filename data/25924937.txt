Most distributions push the &quot;get a signed RPM&#x2F;DEB&#x2F;etc from our repository&quot; model, whose trust would be shredded by jumping out to download from Google, so they supply what they can package themselves: Chromium.<p>Builds: I recall for years the sales pitch of distributions like Arch and Gentoo was &quot;everything ends up compiled with the exact optimal flags for your machine, so it runs faster than the generic x86-64 build that has to run on a first-generation circa 2005 Athlon 64.&quot;  That&#x27;s only supportable with the Chromium source package.')
