They said “the use case includes” which doesn’t exclude other possibilities.<p>There are many great options for charging if you choose your car wisely.<p>Our apartment building with six parking spaces has three Teslas and no charging on site. We do just fine.<p>Charging takes about 15 seconds of my day on work days. And on the occasion when I need more, it’s quick and I can grab a few minutes (like, 10 or 15) of a youtube video or Netflix while charging. Or step into a store and do an errand while charging.<p>In 10 minutes I can get about 100 miles of charge. I often go to our nearby Target (a store in the US) which has a supercharger right in the parking lot, and I don’t charge, even though I’m already there shopping right where the charger is. Why? No need. Already charged. It’s not that difficult.<p>Notice I never said this will work for everyone. But it works for some, with no assumption about having chargers at home.<p>&gt;Who’s going to pay?<p>Sometimes you pay per kilowatt. Other times you’re charged per minute, like 3 cents a minute or so which includes parking. Other places it’s free and advertising on nearby signs subsidies for it. Or employers pay for it as a work benefit. One network (Chargepoint) covers most of this stuff.')
