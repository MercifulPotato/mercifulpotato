The professor who introduced me to Octave some 15 years ago was quite the free software activist and did not even tell us that it was a clone.<p>Today, I am a heavy user of Octave&#x27;s linear algebra algorithms for large sparse matrices.  I also use Python&#x2F;numpy for other things, and sometimes for linear algebra too (due to the insistence of my coworkers), but it is much less pleasurable and quite annoying.  Also, the linear solvers in scipy are sub-par compared to the state of the art solvers in Octave.  Once, we found a well-conditioned 6x6 system that linalg.solve failed to solve!<p>As an aside, I have never used Octave for plotting, and I hate the gui interface; my use case is 100% non-interactive, using scripts.')
