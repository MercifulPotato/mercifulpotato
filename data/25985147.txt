And Blender 3D, Gimp, Dark Table and other open source Graphics applications that need OpenCL will have to wait for that for me.<p>So Compelling for gaming maybe yes but compelling for GPGPU compute workloads that rely on OpenCL not so much compelling on the newer Razen APU based hardware and AMD&#x27;s Instructions and not as polished as some of the Intel&#x2F;Linux related instructions.<p>But really most laptop OEMs are still not tuning their laptops firmware for Linux except system76&#x2F;other linux laptop OEMs!  But that ASUS TUF FX505DY laptop was on special sale pre pandemic for $499 so not a bad deal but with loads of special issues to surmount just to get a Linux Mint 20.0 Live USB to even boot to install Mint 20 in a dual boot configuration alongside Windows 10 10&#x2F;1909 Home.<p>But Blobs and out of tree Wifi drivers and that laptop&#x27;s getting a Samsung M.2&#x2F;NVMe to replace the WD Black M.2&#x2F;NVMe that shipped with the laptop and the Realtek WiFi card sits right under the M.2&#x2F;NVMe SSD slot so that&#x27;s getting a more Linux Kernel out of the Box friendly WiFi card with better features as well.')
