Look at the way a lot of older music has been preserved in modern times, through the use of sampling, covers and other things.<p>The Beatles, Elvis, even Dylan played a lot of covers of old blues tunes or other songs that had been lost by that current generation and were made popular again.<p>The way laws work now, that&#x27;s not really something people can do any more without being sued or paying licensing fees. I don&#x27;t see a lot of Beatles songs being sampled, because it costs a lot, so a lot of young people who might have heard some of their music won&#x27;t really get the chance.<p>I know me personally, i&#x27;ve only discovered a lot of older music after hearing a cover or a sample in a song that&#x27;s made me go back and look for the original.<p>Look at reggae music to see the difference. Songs from the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s are still being remade, covered, remixed and used in modern songs. A lot of reggae fans still know the big names from that time because you still hear their songs.')
