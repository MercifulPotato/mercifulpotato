This is really hard work.  He seems to work 7 days a week from late morning till after midnight.<p>Restaurants are a really nice to have thing when your worn out from work and you do not want to have to think about cooking.<p>I think there is another aspect to this that goes beyond restaurants and more towards small businesses in general.  If we consider that Yelp does more than just restaurant reviews, this fact of 60% closures is going to have a huge impact on state budgets with the loss of tax revenue.')
