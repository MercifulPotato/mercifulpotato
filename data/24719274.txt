All this hateful fake news makes me (pronouns he&#x2F;him) feel unsafe about the future.<p>The other day, my Fitbit indicated to me that my heartbeat was abnormally high; I was panicking and hyperventilating... Thankfully Alexa automatically ordered me a puffer from Amazon and I was able to calm myself down. That&#x27;s how unsafe all this fake news makes me feel. Someone needs to take a stand against Trump&#x27;s basket of deplorables. They&#x27;re hurting my democracy.<p>I&#x27;m so pleased that Biden is taking a lead in all the polls. These deplorables are not qualified to vote, they don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s good for them so we have to choose for their own protection. I know how important it is that we can all feel safe. Biden is the only way to feel safe.')
