For this reason, I would assume you are still writing a DSL within Rust which can use Rust&#x27;s type checker to help you figure out what to write and how, but Rust in itself cannot represent the same semantics as-is that is required to write efficient parallel code. So, you still need to be a domain expert. But, automating the bytecode writing is alleviated by Rust&#x27;s ability to provide packages etc.<p>I refactored some OpenMP code to run on SPIR-V using the Vulkan API the OP project uses, and I must say that I cannot see myself doing it in any other language than Rust.')
