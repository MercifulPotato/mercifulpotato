Companies that don&#x27;t pay subsistence wages leave employees to collect public benefits to make up the difference. The businesses are being subsidized by the taxpayer. All setting a minimum wage at a subsistence pay does is stop the companies from mooching off the taxpayer.<p>&gt; Itâ€™s just as likely to kill jobs.<p>And that&#x27;s fine, there&#x27;s no reason that all jobs have to be done by humans. This is why wholesale reform needs to take place as well, including basic income. Not leaning into robotization of low-skilled jobs amounts to turning America into a renaissance faire as a make-work project.')
