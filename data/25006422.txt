Item(by='toyg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604656142, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25000229, text='The European Arrest Warrant effectively supersedes any constitutional right to non-extradition: &quot;EU countries can no longer refuse to surrender [to other EU members] their own nationals, unless they take over the execution of the prison sentence against the wanted person&quot; [1]. EU members with extradition impediments like France are left with a right to get back prisoners after conviction, to spend the punishment in their own country. There are exceptions and rules but &quot;constitution says no&quot; is not one of them (or at least I could not find it even in the proper text of the Decision [2], and is not mentioned in any note on the matter).<p>This said, a &quot;bad&quot; EU members might well choose to extradite further, once a prisoner is obtained from France. I expect this would trigger appeals at the ECJ and possibly repercussions for the &quot;bad&quot; country, but in the meantime the prisoner might well be gone. I also don&#x27;t know what the &quot;punishment&quot; would be for a country that refused to execute a valid EAW. I guess this sort of thing is left to ECJ judges.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;info&#x2F;law&#x2F;cross-border-cases&#x2F;judicial-cooperation&#x2F;types-judicial-cooperation&#x2F;european-arrest-warrant_en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;info&#x2F;law&#x2F;cross-border-cases&#x2F;judicial-co...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eur-lex.europa.eu&#x2F;legal-content&#x2F;EN&#x2F;TXT&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;?uri=CELEX:32002F0584&amp;from=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eur-lex.europa.eu&#x2F;legal-content&#x2F;EN&#x2F;TXT&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;?uri=CEL...</a>')
