I live in a medium cost of living area. I make enough so that I can own a house, 2 cars (both paid off), and have a nice retirement account.<p>For the most part it is pretty low key. If the build breaks close to a deadline, there is some pressure to get it fixed, but that doesn&#x27;t happen often. Most of the time it is just working on my projects that have realistic deadlines.<p>Every once in a while I get a little bored, but then I remember those past jobs where everyone&#x27;s hair is on fire. The thing I like is that I get to work at my own pace, and spend most of the day writing scripts. I enjoy writing scripts more than I do application programming. I consider my scripts to be my minions that I send off to do my bidding.')
