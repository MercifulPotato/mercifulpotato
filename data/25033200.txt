Wouldn&#x27;t this proposal violate this? If you spy on someone&#x27;s communication you essentially change the audience to whom the accused may not wish to speak to. \nI understand that the authorities want to catch the bad people, but where does it end? Should we accept having a civil servant and their handler in our homes? Should we have weekly polygraph testing? What if someone speaks in a code, that is the spoken sentences will have a different meaning than what language would suggest? What if someone speaks their mother tongue, is that going to be classed as circumvention of surveillance?\nWhy this is even an official proposal?')
