And that group is the government.  And the secret would be that highly classified information.  In my mind we are seeing things the same, but I can see how the words I put to it might give a different impression.<p>I really don&#x27;t like the current &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; understanding in modern usage.  It completely screws over the literal usage of those two words together.<p>If you wish to, please reread my comment without the common connotation of &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; and see if we then agree.')
