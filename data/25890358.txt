Item(by='toast0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611476761, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25888054, text='&gt; Most software is a hogpile of sh*t destined to rot. It simply won&#x27;t last. Those sections that do (if it never has to be touched, it also didn&#x27;t last) are usually subpar.<p>Look, most of my code is shit. I expect the requirements to change sometime in the next two weeks. The code isn&#x27;t expected to rot, it&#x27;s expected to be thrown away.<p>Anything that sticks around longer than that isn&#x27;t subpar, it managed to actually meet the underlying requirements.<p>Anyway, if my shitty code ends up becoming a problem later; I don&#x27;t have any qualms about sunk costs, because I didn&#x27;t build a pinacle of architecture; and I&#x27;ll probably have a much better idea of what the requirements and use-cases are.<p>Mostly, the important thing is to reduce the amount of layers. It&#x27;s a lot easier to make changes to shitty code without too many layers than polished code that has wrong or inconvenient abstractions. Of course, shitty code that&#x27;s over abstracted is even worse.')
