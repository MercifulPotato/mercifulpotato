The “unreal mode” used by Ultima VII offered the same flat memory access, but without the slight performance overhead of running the CPU in actual protected mode.<p>Considering that literally every other high-performance game of the era (e.g. Doom) used protected mode, I’m inclined to think U7 would have been just fine. Maybe the unreal mode made a slight difference on an older 386, but was it worth the configuration headache of having everyone edit their CONFIG.SYS? Probably not.')
