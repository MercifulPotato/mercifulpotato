Some roads were rather hairy and frightening. I&#x27;ve also bicycle commuted to my work across various jobs over 30 years, from Philly to San Diego and points in between (not religiously in all weather but probably 30% of the time). I tell folks my most important safety item for bicycling is my rear-view mirror, I don&#x27;t leave home without it. I don&#x27;t mean one of those little things attached to the helmet, I mean a nice stable one attached to the handlebars. You may see me on occasion (especially on hot days) bicycling without a helmet, I almost never use my lights, but you&#x27;ll never see me on a bicycle without a rear view mirror. I&#x27;ve never had to ditch because of what I saw coming at me, but many times I pull farther onto the shoulder or even stop and pause given what I saw coming from behind.<p>You can see my 2007 X-country day-by-day diary here:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crazyguyonabike.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;?o=1mr&amp;doc_id=2579&amp;v=LL" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crazyguyonabike.com&#x2F;doc&#x2F;?o=1mr&amp;doc_id=2579&amp;v=LL</a>')
