But GA itself isn&#x27;t actually that interesting or useful. It&#x27;s not like GA is being used to prove new math theorems or new calculations. But I do like being able to talk about &gt;3 dimensional geometry with more people so that&#x27;s a win. It&#x27;s almost like GA is a marketing pitch for Grassmannians&#x2F;Flag Manifolds&#x2F;Clifford Algebras.')
