The fitness tracking has gotten good enough that I would use it over my Garmin for tracking runs and cycling, and I can enjoy the extra features it has over the Garmin.<p>But...it&#x27;s a nonstarter because it <i>requires</i> you own an iPhone. Even for cellular models. I have no desire to buy an iPhone.<p>I wonder how many sales they are missing to non-iPhone owners, or if they really just don&#x27;t care. I don&#x27;t personally think the Apple watch is good enough to be a system seller...but it is yet another entry into their entirely locked up, vertically integrated ecosystem. More than any other company, the lock-in with Apple is real.<p>And IMO it&#x27;s a shame they limit the potential of their products so much.')
