It was $500&#x2F;month in New York, which dropped to $250&#x2F;month in Massachusetts.<p>In 2019 and 2020, it dropped to only $50&#x2F;month because my income was low enough that I qualified for state-subsidized insurance.<p>I felt a little weird about essentially drawing on welfare when I&#x27;m choosing to earn less than my maximum, but I also feel like there&#x27;d be an arrogance in rejecting it like I&#x27;m somehow too good for welfare. In the end, I decided I met the requirements of a government benefit I want, so there&#x27;s no reason to turn it down.')
