Item(by='moioci', descendants=None, kids=[25340635, 25340790], score=None, time=1607386992, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25338316, text='&quot;Up and out.&quot; Nothing to do with Titanic, but based on reading disaster articles on Wikipedia, my advice is, if a ship you are on takes on a noticeable list, get to the high side immediately.  If the list worsens, get outside on the deck. Beyond a certain point, a list has a way of accelerating, and interior corridors become canyons and floors become walls, dooming everyone on the low side.')
