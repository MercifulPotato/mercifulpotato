A few questions:<p>Do you plan to offer Stripe Treasury to non-marketplace small businesses &#x2F; individuals?<p>I ask because the #1 thing I&#x27;ve been wanting for the past few years is basically Stripe Bank :) I hate Bank of America.  I&#x27;m not happy with any of the other startup banks.  And honestly, at this point my first instinct when seeing Stripe Treasury is &quot;Imma just build my own bank for myself!&quot; (and that actually looks like a real possibility, at least technically).<p>If not, do you plan to offer a retail product for individuals?')
