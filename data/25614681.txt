I don&#x27;t think the majority there enjoy torturing colleagues or subordinates (although it certainly can happen). That being said, the story to me sounds entirely or at least partially made up. In this story, everyone at Apple seems to have only the goal of psychologically abusing OP. Especially the passage &quot;the note section of a hidden slide on a deck that she had uploaded and it was an indirect suicide&#x2F;murder threat&quot; sounds absolutely implausible, why would someone put a death threat in a slide deck which clearly documents said threat?<p>My serious (and absolutely not mean-spirited) advice to OP: see a psychologist and talk to him about it, especially about all the &quot;hidden signs&quot; you supposedly received from colleagues.')
