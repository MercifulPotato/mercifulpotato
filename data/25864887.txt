It&#x27;s unclear to me if BTC will work in the long run, but it would be nice if all the people claiming it&#x27;s going to crash would put their money where their mouth is. It&#x27;s possible that the BTC market &quot;can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent&quot;, but people have been saying this for the past decade and it&#x27;s boring to see people make claims without updating their beliefs based on new evidence. At least the TSLA bears are investing money into short positions as a demonstration of their beliefs.')
