Also got ads for things I would definitely like. 100% of them were cheap crap that actually did not work at all. Stopped using Facebook because I got tired of the deceptive ads, lack of accountability, and invasive profiling<p>And, yes, I do think Facebook should take responsibility for the content of their ads and products sold through them.
