And remember that this doesn&#x27;t just apply to one user - it affects <i>all</i> users of a platform at the same time if you allow nonsense like this.<p>There&#x27;s no trade-off to be had there - you either offer a more secure identification method or you don&#x27;t.<p>To put it in a different and simpler context: a safety gate has to have certain properties. If you remove one or more of these, it ceases to be a safety gate and becomes a regular door. A reinforced door with a cheap lock is just as insecure as a cardboard door with a security lock and a second key under the doormat or hidden under a rock outside invalidates the usefulness of even a vault door...')
