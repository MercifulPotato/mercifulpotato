That said, aging affects 100% of population and is lethal. The amount of funding &amp; effort should be orders of magnitude larger than for any of diseases you mentioned.<p>I&#x27;m reading through Sinclair&#x27;s book &quot;Lifespan - Why We Age and Why We Donâ€™t Have To&quot; and I find it fascinating (especially the chapter on origins of life and proto-genes of aging).

Book&#x27;s predictions may feel too optimistic to me, but I don&#x27;t have any qualifications to make such claim against leading researcher in field.')
