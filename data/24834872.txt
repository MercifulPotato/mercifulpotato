I don&#x27;t really agree with you at all. The vast majority of british people I&#x27;ve interacted with, even the &quot;uneducated&quot;, all have reasonable, well thought out opinions even if they don&#x27;t always agree with my own. I think it&#x27;s much better than you seem to suggest.<p>The real issue is with the politicians, and the fact we don&#x27;t have proportional representation. There is a significant percentage of the population with no real representation. I do not relate with either Tories or Labor and I don&#x27;t think either has my best interests at heart.')
