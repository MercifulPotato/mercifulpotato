It is simple to imagine the train that is always on time to the second, the politician who is 100% ethical, a good judge of character, works hard, and has broad relevant knowledge. It is possible to imagine the construction company that always finishes the roads on time and with high quality.<p>But for humans to actually <i>do</i> all of these things is extremely hard. We only recently were very much like a primate we see in the wild. We have tons of ambition and imagination but all the flaws of a prototype intelligent creature.  We can&#x27;t always think clearly, emotions often get in the way when we can, we get tired, we have conflicting drives and feedback loops that mean we are never truly satisfied no matter how good we have it.<p>such is life.')
