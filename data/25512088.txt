The article argues this as well and explains that there&#x27;s more to it than societal&#x2F;vet pressure. Controlling the pet population via spaying or neutering seems humane to me, especially considering the alternative of putting pets down <i>en masse</i>.<p>Can you explain the other side of the argument? Why do you feel spaying or neutering pets is cruel?')
