But it&#x27;s not random flaws. Liberal people are flawed to believe rules are written as a liberal would interpret them. And conservatives just the opposite. Because the rules do not exist outside of subjective interpretation.<p>I may be the only person using the word objective in this conversation, but that doesn&#x27;t mean everyone else in the conversation is not building their arguments on the existence of objectivity in regards to a judges interpretations.<p>&gt;I often read opinions I don&#x27;t agree with, but I can see where the justice just had a different life than me and sees things differently.<p>That&#x27;s right. Their opinion is nothing more than their interpretation. A couple of people had the opinion that something was unconstitutional. That doesn&#x27;t mean it is, just that they believe it is.<p>Justice is supposed to be blind. And the Supreme Court opinion that CU was unconstitutional helps corporations just as it helps pro-choice non-profits just as it helps pro-life non-profits. But at the end of the day, it was 5 people who interpreted it as unconstitutional. They did not make the discovery that it is unconstitutional.')
