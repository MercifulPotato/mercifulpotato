Item(by='angott', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607565020, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25367741, text='&gt; Facebook has become a massive force for division and the propagation of hate rhetoric. A lot of that comes from their own algorithms which basically create a catered stream of content to reinforce user&#x27;s already held beliefs. This is not a FB specific issue, but they are probably the largest offender. I would argue they have been an absolutely massive negative for society.<p>I couldn&#x27;t agree more with this summary, you really hit the point here. And I would also add that it isn&#x27;t just about hate rhetoric. Algorithmic news feeds have led to an extreme polarization of <i>all</i> opinions, not only political opinions.<p>Social media platforms like Facebook have an interest in pushing content that generates the most reactions, because it increases the time spent on the platform, ultimately leading to higher advertising revenues. The sad truth is that thoughtful insights like the ones you would read in a newspaper or an academic paper are just boring for the majority of people out there, and lead to little debate. Therefore, news feed algorithms have a tendency to push their users towards extreme views, such as far-left&#x2F;right populist politics, or conspiracy theories.<p>This is just my opinion, but just look at all the COVID vaccine disinformation spreading online without control! The current level of vaccine skepticism would have been impossible to achieve without the help of modern social media mechanisms. The news feeds, with their tendency to reinforce extreme theories, have managed to turned a small minority of people with minor safety concerns into convinced no-vax activists.')
