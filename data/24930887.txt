This is important because if you have high friction to reporting issues, issues don&#x27;t get reported. [1]<p>What happens then? People who have legitimate grievances are the ones who stop coming around and you&#x27;re left surrounded by the assholes who chased them off<p>The code of conduct should be cheerfully received by everyone:<p>1. I know that my actions are above board, because I can read what is allowed<p>2. I know that any actions that aren&#x27;t will be reported and processed not in public (eg on Twitter) but in some sort of well-defined process<p>3. I know what the range of penalties can be<p>4.
