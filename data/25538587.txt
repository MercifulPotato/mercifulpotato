Apple was briefly in consideration for DAWs&#x2F;audio work in the late 80s&#x2F;early 90s, until Windows DAWs started hitting the market in force.<p>Today, most Hollywood composers use Cubase, which was definitely Windows-first. TV productions favor Studio One, which again, was Windows-first (and from the same developers as Cubase). Pro Tools is industry standard for Hollywood movies...but it didn&#x27;t become the standard until version 6, running on Windows. Ableton Live, which is the most popular tool for recording live music, was written first on Windows (but originally commercially released simultaneously for Windows and Apple).<p>And Logic on Mac was very much inferior to Logic on Windows, which is why Windows was the preferred platform for running Logic. The Mac version didn&#x27;t become better than the Windows version until version 6, for which there <i>was no Windows version.</i> While all accounts say that Logic is a great DAW these days, because it&#x27;s Mac-only, the only production companies that run Logic are ones that are exclusively Mac-based.')
