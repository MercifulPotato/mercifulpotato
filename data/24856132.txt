The US median adult wealth figure is now 85% higher than Germany&#x27;s figure, and the US figure is nothing spectacular.<p>If Germany&#x27;s labor position is so great, why are their workers so relatively poor? People constantly applaud Germany for their supposedly great labor protections and unions. So where&#x27;s the wealth?<p>Germany&#x27;s median wealth per adult is below that of Greece. Let that sink in for a moment. It&#x27;s 1&#x2F;2 that of South Korea. It&#x27;s nearly 1&#x2F;3 that of France.<p>For 2019 Germany&#x27;s GDP was $3.84 trillion. In 2008 it was $3.73 trillion. Inflation adjusted, Germany&#x27;s economy contracted by at least 1&#x2F;4 in a mere 11 years. That&#x27;s a vanishing economy, and that&#x27;s all pre-Covid.<p>A decade plus with zero net growth is one of the best economies in the world? No it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s a contracting economy with no wealth creation occurring and an impending assault by China on their high value manufacturing.<p>Germany is standing in a very bad spot. Whether they realize that yet or not is another matter.<p>Here&#x27;s the next 20 years for the German economy: China will take a giant chunk out of their high value manufacturing export machine. The average German will have to work a lot more hours just to stand still, while they attempt to retire with very little savings at the median ($35k isn&#x27;t going to cut it). The industrial hollowing out that Germany will suffer, is one that the US has already gone through, and it&#x27;s a brutal thing for a society to endure, especially starting from a position of a terrible median wealth figure and an economy that is contracting persistently.<p>Those super low hours per week that they&#x27;ve been enjoying? They&#x27;ve been trading on their future and haven&#x27;t been generating enough wealth to sustain against what&#x27;s coming for them.')
