I am confused though in how this project is intended to work at a higher level. The blogpost states:<p>&gt; The goal of the Scorecards project is to auto-generate a “security score” for open source projects to help users as they decide the trust, risk, and security posture for their use case.<p>Will there be a centralised site to gather and display scores for open source projects? Or will it be up to the open source projects themselves to integrate this into their pages and, if so, what does that look like? Some kind of badge or a listing of the results as above? Just trying to understand how end-users will be interpreting the results in a consistent and trusted manner.')
