Which has nothing to do with the devil, but it&#x27;s a test which can detect blood hidden in your poo. There are at home test kits. These are as simple to use as dabbing a stick in a turd a couple of times and waiting for the result. Similar to a home pregnancy test.<p>Our local bowel cancer charity recommends these. If positive, get a colo(no)scopy. If negative, retest in another year or two. \nThese are sent out to everyone over 50 IIRC. They&#x27;re also recommended to anyone who is younger and possibly at risk.')
