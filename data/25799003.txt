If it weren&#x27;t those particular things it would have been others. You might want to make things as easy for him as possible, but that&#x27;s not learning. If my memory is right, the Lua tutorial mentions early on that any variable that hasn&#x27;t been assigned a value is nil. The typo, the confusion, and then the realization was the act of learning something on a deeper level than you had understood it before. Going further, when accessing that variable, weren&#x27;t you indexing _G by accident? Indexing a table with a key that doesn&#x27;t have a value associated with it returns nil, which makes sense. That thing that makes sense has consequences that can catch you off guard. Looking for a frictionless way to learn something is folly, because the friction comes from the thing you&#x27;re trying to learn itself.')
