Surely if your hash function is A(C()) then if you find a collision in C() then that is also a collision in A(C())?<p>Also, just saying “we should use 100 year crypto” is about as useful as saying “we should hurry up and cure cancer”.<p>Nobody has a probably secure hashing function. It’s actually a huge problem in cryptography that a lot of the time hashing is modelled as a perfect random oracle and there are schemes which are secure <i>only</i> if modelled with a random oracle, but insecure when instantiated with any concrete hashing function.')
