The logistics behind delivering the jab are absolutely breathtaking.<p>Here in the UK we are rich and have the science etc.  We are a small, comparatively, densely populated place.  We have a country funded health service and a fairly well funded military with experience and gear and man power.  I think the UK represents one of the best possible case studies for mass vaccination.<p>60M people at 300K per week is 200 weeks or nearly four years - this is a very artificial example and only an illustration.  To get 60M people jabbed, twice, in a few months is going to need a few resources!')
