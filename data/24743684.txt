Item(by='nyanpasu64', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602389851, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24724632, text='&gt; These scenarios are so hypothetical that it’s pointless to give an answer.<p>Every audio library I&#x27;ve seen so far operates on (*i16&#x2F;f32, size_t) or &amp;[i16&#x2F;f32]. An audio library which supports dimensioned values is hypothetical. And most dimensioning libraries don&#x27;t have a unit of &quot;sample&quot; (in time) or &quot;audio amplitude&quot; or &quot;channel&quot;, so the audio library won&#x27;t even know what unit system to pick.<p>&gt; It’s also extremely possible to fork such a library, change a few lines to use the dimensionally correct type, and be done with the issue.<p>And suddenly the audio library is tied to your specific unit system, and you still need transmutes or whatnot when talking to the OS sound library.<p>&gt; If all of your heavy lifting is being done by this external library anyways, and that library just uses raw floats... why bother with the ceremony of using a dimensionally safe float in your own code if the performance cost of mapping between types is too high?<p>Most of the time I end up just using a named type alias, instead of a strong newtype.')
