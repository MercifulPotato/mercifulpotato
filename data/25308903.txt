Item(by='shawndrost', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607119946, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25302527, text='This essay shows a contradiction in PG&#x27;s own beliefs, which I also grapple with.<p>He doesn&#x27;t believe &quot;the only way to become a billionaire is by exploiting people&quot;, and his argument is persuasive. I tend to agree! All those characteristics he&#x27;s interviewing for are positive, and I think he&#x27;s a great billionaire scout. Most of the rich people I know got there in ways that don&#x27;t seem exploitative.<p>But, he does believe &quot;people who make a lot of money have a moral obligation to use it for the common good&quot;, and... isn&#x27;t that a contradiction? If someone makes their first ten million, and keeps earning more with no clear plans to allocate it to the public good -- are they ignoring their moral obligation? Maybe not yet. What about a multi-billionaire who, years down the road, still hasn&#x27;t signed on to something like the Giving Pledge? How can we defend the morality of that person?')
