That&#x27;s very neat! ...<p>n lines: The nth line has the correct 1&#x2F;n chance of being written, otherwise (with probability (n-1)&#x2F;n) one of the first n-1 lines remain, and they had an equal 1&#x2F;(n-1) chance of being stored just prior to the nth line appearing, now 1&#x2F;(n-1) x (n-1)&#x2F;n = 1&#x2F;n.')
