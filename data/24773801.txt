I spent a year working as an EMT picking up my fair share of patients on 5150 holds from PD off the street and bringing them to the ER or to the nearest mental health emergency receiving facility. I do agree, this kind of stuff is not pretty up-close. I&#x27;ve been the scared kid in the back of the box with the guy credibly threatening to murder me.<p>If we had a system where people could be placed on a medical hold, and taken somewhere to receive humane treatment with a safe environment to get better, my god, I wouldn&#x27;t have any problem with that at all. But, I have spent my fair share of time bringing patients into county mental health facilities, and oh man they can be kind of terrifying places. The system, as it exists now, is not even remotely capable of what you describe.<p>It would be great to see a system for humane, limited-term institutionalization with long-term follow-up like you&#x27;re talking about. If there&#x27;s a coherent policy platform somewhere that outlines what this would look like and how we get from A to B, I would love to see it.')
