That sucks and should be changed. Let me GitHub Sponsor or whatever FF development not throw money at a foundation that doesn&#x27;t put the money where I want it to go.<p>Why in God&#x27;s name did Mozilla even do this to themselves? Sitting up Mozilla into a Corp and a Foundation. The Corp which is supposed to be a money-printing machine has been shanghaied by a person who has gone on the record saying it would be unfair to reduce their salary because of dependants yet has consistently run this machine into red.<p>Why isn&#x27;t Mozilla taking any action? Why is Baker continuing to be allowed to destroy the dream of a multiplicity of browser engines? It kills me.')
