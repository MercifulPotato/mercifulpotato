Often, recruiters really are trying to do you both a favor. They will always ask what you&#x27;re looking for if you tell them that the range they&#x27;ve given is too low for you. Which is fine with me - as the pay I&#x27;m looking for is outlandish for many startups and non-FAANG companies. I rather not waste time with the companies unless I think they&#x27;ll be good for interview practice. :)')
