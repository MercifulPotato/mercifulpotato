The consumer doesn&#x27;t select from the entire possibility space, they buy from the available options.<p>Any &quot;correlation is causation&quot; statement about minor details when there are dozens of other larger distinguishing feature are the words of a lying huckster.  Giving them the benefit of the doubt isn&#x27;t that they&#x27;re not-lying, the benefit of the doubt is that they&#x27;re lying to themselves too. That&#x27;s how wrong it is to make those inferences.')
