Oil is a consumable but lithium is not.  A battery can be charged and discharged and then recycled.<p>My understanding is that the biggest limitations with lithium battery recycling are the economics.  Lead-acid batteries are already highly recyclable.  Seems like as lithium gets harder to extract the economic forces will prioritize recyclable batteries.')
