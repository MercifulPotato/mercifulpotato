So in my country, the majority of covid19 victims had access to a ventilator. I&#x27;d be surprised if it wasn&#x27;t the case elsewhere in Europe too.<p>On the 1.8 million dead from Covid19, 500k came from Europe, which means around 1 millions were saved by ventilators there. It is already not “tiny” and I&#x27;m counting Europe only.')
