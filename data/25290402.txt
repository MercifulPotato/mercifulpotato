I bet there is a significant overlap of those supporting her now with those rooting for Damore&#x27;s firing. And Damore didn&#x27;t make any demand, just a memo.<p>I see many support her (from a justified? knee jerk reaction?) that being fired from a corporation for questioning it&#x27;s bottom line is due to the power dynamics. The support to Timnit Gebru (provided her demands are provably good, but only hurts google&#x27;s bottom line) would be more powerful&#x2F;rational if the  same people will vocally support Damore.<p>Even if supporting a worker being fired without complete information is a justified position to take based on corporate dynamics, some have started making this into ugly race issue. Some are `supporting` her in the lines of &quot;She was black and hence was fired&quot;. If people are judging others as racist just based on tweets now, Jeff Dean seems the opposite of such smear. Even if Dean was a corporate zombie pulling the trigger to save the company bottomline, calling him racist for that without evidence for the latter is insane.<p>There seems to be a sick trend in progressive politics in US to move away from supporting workers and start making everything into a race issue with no justification.')
