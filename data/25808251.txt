They&#x27;re not looking at raw radar signals, like some WWII operator with an O-scope.  They&#x27;re looking at a computer-generated signal.  And lots can go wrong between the radar signal and the computer screen.<p>Likewise, &quot;the most advanced flight technology ever created&quot; has absolutely nothing to do with it.  They could have been in a hot air balloon and seen the same thing (which I suspect was an illusion).')
