Item(by='Animats', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603909990, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24916108, text='<i>&quot;And surprisingly there was never a single update that broke something for me&quot;</i><p>Blender&#x27;s usual problem is &quot;where did they hide that feature in this update?&quot; Questions on that come up in the forums often.
