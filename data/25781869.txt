Saying NPM has millions of packages is completely misleading. There will be 20, 30, 40 packages that all do the same thing.<p>And the one with the obvious name hasn&#x27;t been updated in 18 months.  Maybe it&#x27;s complete. Maybe the developer has moved on.  Then there are a couple half hearted forks.  All of these dependencies bring in 1 to 100 dependencies each and you have to spend a days on the treadmill every month or two to keep things updated.<p>I loved Node development despite the packaging mess but I really appreciate how the Elixir community tends to coalesce around key libraries&#x2F;frameworks&#x2F;methodologies and focus on making them the best possible.')
