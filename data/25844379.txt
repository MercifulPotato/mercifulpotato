Notice how the user responded to you, as an authority, I hope you&#x27;re aware of that power dynamic as well.<p>I&#x27;ve also thought I&#x27;d love to see a Netflix style documentary of &quot;a day in dang&#x27;s life&quot; to help us get to know you, to humanize you more + would be good marketing for HN and YCombinator.
