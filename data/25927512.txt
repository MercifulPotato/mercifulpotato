I think catching application errors is a necessity to ensure your application runs smoothly and doesn&#x27;t mess with customer&#x2F;user experience. We&#x27;re already tracking all the errors in the backend, and we should also be able to do the same with frontend. At the end of the day, we&#x27;re all humans, we will introduce bugs. Even if you can guarantee 100% no one will deliberately introduce bugs, there&#x27;s still the accidental introduction, or the third party library issues.<p>The issue comes with tracking users. The amount of code needed to track user interactions is insane, because of the number of possible interactions. Tracking application code generally does not need a lot of code.<p>Sadly, the user trackers have messed it up for application error trackers too. We&#x27;re blocking everything regardless of context, and this doesn&#x27;t allow websites to fix their application errors.')
