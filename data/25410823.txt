Or they misjudge you speed, they don&#x27;t expect you going 25-30kph. An accident that happened to me not long ago was a driver failing to yield and pulling in front me, causing me to slam the brakes and lose traction, skidding and scraping the asphalt. Luckily it was just road rash and bruises (and I wasn&#x27;t wearing my clip-less shoes - only flats from now on for me).')
