Item(by='cgriswald', descendants=None, kids=[25538121], score=None, time=1608920523, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25537188, text='&gt; I&#x27;m reading between your lines, but by &quot;totalitarian measures&quot; do you mean asking people to temporarily wear masks, wash their hands, stay home, and restricting the density of people at gathering spots?<p>Did your government really just ask?<p>My local government responded by drafting and frequently, but irregularly, updating an increasing complex document—by decree rather than through the legislature—the violation of which was a misdemeanor (or, for businesses, may result in being closed down). To this day, individual businesses are asking the government what steps they need to take in order to operate. The answers they receive are not in any legally drafted document. Effectively businesses are asking government what they need to do to avoid the scrutiny of government; not what they need to do to stay within the law.<p>This was a massive insertion of government control into the lives of individuals, which is the essence of totalitarianism. I agree that wearing masks, washing your hands, and avoiding unnecessary contact with others are all good things to do. I do those things voluntarily; and would have done so if asked, even if it wasn&#x27;t a misdemeanor not to do so. That doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m blind to the totalitarian measures some governments took to get there; or to the risks that imposes for the future.')
