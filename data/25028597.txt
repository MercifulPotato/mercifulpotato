They&#x27;re going to leapfrog our knowledge industries, leading to total economic stagnation of the West.<p>We shouldn&#x27;t do business with a country that steals, doesn&#x27;t play fair, is the embodiment of 1984, and above all, commits genocide.<p>Get the G7 countries, Korea, India, etc. on board with the plan. Start doing manufacturing in India, Vietnam, Africa, and Mexico. Copy their Belt initiative, but make the countries that do business with us allies rather than devastatingly indebted.<p>Agree in unison to cancel Chinese debts owed as repayment for technologies stolen.<p>Defend the South China Sea for energy exploration by other neighboring countries. Defend Vietnam&#x27;s water rights.<p>Strengthen alliance with Vietnam, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. In the extreme case, offer recognition of independence to Taiwan or even US statehood.<p>Brain drain China. Offer immigration packages and economic incentives to Chinese PhD students.<p>We have to be proactive about the situation. Xi has played the CCP&#x27;s hand early, and we have a chance to nip their ambitions in the bud.<p>Before anyone accuses me of racism, I care deeply about the Chinese people. I also acknowledge the problems of the West - racial injustice, inequality, ongoing wars. But compared to democracy, as flawed as it is, I think the future posed by Communist China is nightmare fuel and has the potential to eclipse the future we are trying to build.')
