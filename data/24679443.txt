My mom was a computer programmer in the 70s, and on days where my elementary school was out but she had to work, she&#x27;d bring me in to work with her, and plunk me down in front of a terminal to her work mini-computer.  I remember playing the original Adventure, as well as some other simple games that kept 7 year old me busy all day.<p>When I was in 5th grade, my teacher was taking classes for her masters at the local university, and was given an apple II to take to her classroom.  I stayed after school every day for the month she had the computer, and worked on projects in Logo.<p>In middle school, we had an Apple II clone (Franklin Ace 1000), and I would type in games from magazines.  That&#x27;s how I learned to program.  I was a terrible typist, and would always have bugs that I had to figure out.  I eventually started modifying the games on purpose, and doing that became more fun than actually playing the games.<p>When I was in college in the late 80s &#x2F; early 90s, I idolized our CS department sysadmin, who sat in a dark office, listening to cool music, and porting BSD to weird computers (DG Aviion).  I was hooked, and decided I wanted a job like that.  I bailed out of an MS degree program to take a sysadmin job.  A few years later, I moved to a job as research staff in the CS department, where I got to write device drivers for high speed network cards and eventually got paid to port FreeBSD to the DEC Alpha.')
