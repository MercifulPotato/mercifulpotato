It&#x27;s far more nuanced and alarming than just &quot;Parler tried but not hard enough&quot;. I&#x27;ll emphasize some points I think show that.<p>&quot;Recently, we’ve seen a steady increase in this violent content on your website, all of which violates our terms. It’s clear that Parler does not have an effective process to comply with the AWS terms of service. It also seems that Parler is still trying to determine its position on content moderation. <i>You remove some violent content when contacted by us or others, but not always with urgency</i>. Your CEO recently stated publicly that <i>he doesn’t “feel responsible for any of this, and neither should the platform.”</i> This morning, you shared that you have a plan to more proactively moderate violent content, but plan to do so manually with volunteers. It’s our view that <i>this nascent plan to use volunteers to promptly identify and remove dangerous content will not work in light of the rapidly growing number of violent posts.</i> This is further demonstrated by the fact that <i>you still have not taken down much of the content that we’ve sent you</i>. Given the unfortunate events that transpired this past week in Washington, D.C., <i>there is serious risk that this type of content will further incite violence</i>.&quot;')
