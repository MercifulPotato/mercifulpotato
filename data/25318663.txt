You tax carbon at the source, like power generation and oil drilling. The costs will naturally balance upwards.<p>The downtown parking lot, for example, probably doesn&#x27;t have recurring carbon costs. The gasoline people use to drive there will be more expensive from the carbon tax on oil and gasoline production, and the cement or asphalt that takes electricity to produce will be covered by the source-charge on power plants.')
