Item(by='echelon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606230493, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25198280, text='Reddit has been great for driving traffic to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vo.codes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vo.codes</a>.<p>It&#x27;s a meme site, so it&#x27;s tolerated. The best thing is that the users have started posting content generated by my site to various subreddits (&#x2F;r&#x2F;vocalsynthesis, &#x2F;r&#x2F;mediasynthesis, &#x2F;r&#x2F;artificial, etc.), which has compounded the traffic we get. It&#x27;s about 15k uniques a day and growing.<p>I don&#x27;t have monetization in place yet, but plan to add a Patreon and eventual subscriptions for streamers wanting to integrate TTS donations into their stream.<p>I&#x27;m going to use RPAN to demo streaming deep fakes and apply it to an improv session. It should be fun and will hopefully drive a lot more traffic.')
