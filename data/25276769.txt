Even Google isn&#x27;t the driving factor behind a likely military invasion.<p>TSMC only got so powerful because the competition, especially Intel, were <i>abysmal</i> failures in rolling out new tech. It&#x27;s not like their Dutch supplier ASML only sells their tech to TSMC, too. <i>Anyone</i> with the cash at hand could buy their stuff.<p>Also: the last US governments (both Obama and Trump) or the major EU governments could have stepped in any fucking time in the last 10-15 years and say &quot;hey it might be a good idea to have some backup for Intel instead of leaving everything to Taiwan&quot;... only in 2020 TSMC finally announced to build an US fab, and the EU is still sitting on their hands.')
