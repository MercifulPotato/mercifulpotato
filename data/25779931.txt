But they have overlapping skill sets - if you aren&#x27;t good at one, you&#x27;re probably not good at the other either. Somebody who shows up to a team with the goal of only modeling and pushing all the dirty engineering work to their teammates is basically a worst case scenario because<p>1) They probably aren&#x27;t going to produce good models since they&#x27;re not sensitive to data nuances, but now they&#x27;ve taken over ALL the modeling work.<p>2) They bring down the job satisfaction of everyone else on the team who would like to be doing at least some modeling.<p>3) They&#x27;re sucking up the prestige that should be distributed over the entire team and management thinks they should be paid more for work that it turns out everybody thinks is more fun anyway.<p>My number one advice to entry level data scientists is to not be this guy. Don&#x27;t give your interviewers the impression that you won&#x27;t do your own engineering work because they won&#x27;t want someone who brings negative value to the team.')
