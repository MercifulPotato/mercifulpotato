Whatever you are reading could be reporting itself incorrectly, if you were to read it through software (that is itself influenced by the microcode). One solution would be to have a hardware module, a verified function that dumps the microcode and cannot be significantly influenced by the microcode itself.<p>Another issue could be program obfuscation, where you hide behavior inside your program. Since microcode is quite small, I guess the risk is also small.<p>As a curiosity, as far as I know Cryptographic theory at this point hasn&#x27;t proved whether efficient white-box obfuscation is possible! (specially for the case of obfuscating cryptographic keys), but there are some proposed methods that generate very large obfuscated programs, and there are several manual techniques (by experienced programmers) that make it difficult to decode to figure out function (we don&#x27;t know if this could be generalized and automated).')
