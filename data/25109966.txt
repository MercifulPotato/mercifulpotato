Item(by='Lammy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605520518, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25108599, text='&gt; To further protect privacy, we have stopped logging IP addresses associated with Developer ID certificate checks, and we will ensure that any collected IP addresses are removed from logs.<p>Serious question as somebody who is not an Apple developer and has zero clue: does the wording &quot;Developer ID certificate checks&quot; here mean locally-built binaries only? Would a &#x27;Release&#x27; binary still be logged? Not trying to spread FUD, but I haven&#x27;t touched Xcode since it was called Project Builder and legitimately don&#x27;t quite understand.<p>I guess to phrase as a question: Does this stop the hypothetical logging of anyone who has downloaded and ran Tor Browser without compiling it themselves?')
