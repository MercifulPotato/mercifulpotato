Item(by='baobabKoodaa', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605635533, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25126257, text='&gt; In which scenario Amazon would deny sending an email and you would be protected by DKIM?<p>You want a specific scenario of a dispute between a vendor and a customer? Ok. Let&#x27;s say I email Amazon&#x27;s customer support to ask them if a specific order is going to incur customs fees, and the Amazon representative emails me back that the order is not going to incur customs fees. Then I make the order, and to my surprise, I do have to pay custom fees. I contact Amazon to ask them to compensate me for the fees, but Amazon now claims that they are not responsible for custom fees. At this point I would be protected by a copy of the email where they claimed that I would incur no customs fees. If I can demonstrate to Amazon that I have proof of their false claims, prior to the purchase, they will be inclined to compensate. If they refuse to compensate, I can (depending on jurisdiction) take my claim to small claims court and present my evidence there. In this case it&#x27;s unlikely for anyone to actually validate the DKIM signatures, but it does matter whether email is generally considered to be non-repudiable. If you run a campaign to make email repudiable, and make sure people should know email is repudiable, then this email will be less convincing as evidence.')
