Servers are one thing where i can rely on them to be always running, but clients go off grid occasionally.<p>As for restic, yes it&#x27;s available on Windows, but has a serious speed degradation when datasets increase above 2TB, mainly due to chunks being 2-5MB, where Borg uses 400MB chunks. And we&#x27;re not talking a 10% slowdown. It&#x27;s to the point where prune operations on repositories &gt;2TB can&#x2F;will take multiple days to complete.<p>For clients, I evaluated multiple solutions, one was Duplicati (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.duplicati.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.duplicati.com&#x2F;</a>), and while it appears to work well most of the time, it sometimes stops backing up for no apparent reason. Backuppc also looked promising, but doesn&#x27;t (didn&#x27;t ?) support source encrypted backups.<p>In the end i ended up with Arq (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arqbackup.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.arqbackup.com&#x2F;</a>) for Windows and Mac clients. It works reliably, and checks all the right boxes.<p>For servers i was initially really hooked on restic as it allows backups over HTTPS instead of SSH, but the performance issues were a showstopper.')
