An L2 charger will only add 20-25 miles of range per hour.  No-one is going to leave their car at a random place long enough to get any meaningful charge.<p>In fact, I think L2 chargers should be banned from retail businesses, as they&#x27;re just a gimmick and for vanity only.  The average customer stays what, 45 minutes to an hour, netting maybe 20 miles of range?<p>I don&#x27;t even bother with L2 charging except at the office.  At home I just use L1 as an evening&#x2F;overnight charge is enough for me.')
