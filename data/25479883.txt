Deus Ex, Vampire the Masquerade, (many) Fallout games and countless others have no or little driving and I don&#x27;t think it would really elevate those games.<p>Would Vampire the Masquerade be a better game if you could just drive between setpieces in a fully rendered city instead of having a loading screen? Probably, but it would also increase the development workload by an order of magnitude for what would effectively be a gimmick that wouldn&#x27;t really add a lot to the game.<p>And even outside of RPGs, there are countless adventure and FPS games without vehicles. Doom doesn&#x27;t have cars, neither does Tomb Raider, Devil May Cry or Resident Evil.<p>Of course if you&#x27;re thinking of something like &quot;GTA V, but you can&#x27;t drive cars&quot; then obviously that seems very tedious, but if you build the game with this constraint in mind it shouldn&#x27;t be much of an issue. Then you can focus on other aspects of the game.<p>Cyberpunk is clearly not at its best when you&#x27;re in a vehicle, and there&#x27;s no telling what else they could&#x27;ve implemented and finished if they had cut it entirely and focused on other aspects of the game instead.')
