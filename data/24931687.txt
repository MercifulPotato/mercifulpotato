What I have heard are arguments to the effect that we _must_ expand past the Earth because it will inevitably become uninhabitable, probably due to human intervention.<p>Even if we reversed climate change, that still would leave: bio&#x2F;nuclear terrorism, rogue states, threats from asteroids (let&#x27;s not forget the Dinosaurs), etc...<p>Most species on this planet last only a geological blink-of-an-eye before something wipes them out. Why should we think we are so special in that regard?<p>Space exploration is about survival and advancement, not utopia.')
