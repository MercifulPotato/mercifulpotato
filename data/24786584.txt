Item(by='vermaden', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602753863, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24783545, text='Depends.<p>I have tried some of newer games but often were very disappointed.<p>I have tried to play what Bethesda made as &#x27;Fallout 3&#x27; but I really do not like it. Its just not Fallout and they should have chosen different name. I really like Fallout 1 and 2. I always disliked Fallout Tactics for what they have done to battle mechanics in &#x27;turn based&#x27; mode (they broken it generally) but recently I even got to finish it and even started to like it a little, but not to the point to play it again.<p>I have similar thoughts with Heroes of Might and Magic III (especially with new Horn of the Abyss addon). I have tried Heroes IV and Heroes V but VERY disliked them. I still like Heroes IV music a lot but the mechanics of play are terrible.<p>From more modern games I really enjoyed playing Shadowrun Returns series.<p>I also plan to play these some day (in no particular order):\n- Art of Rally (as Colin McRae Rally 2.0 replacement)\n- Mewnbase\n- Wasteland 2\n- Wasteland 3\n- Dreamscaper\n- Pillars of Eternity (all of them I and II)\n- Expeditions: Viking\n- Pathfinder: Kingmaker\n- Disco Elysium\n- Into the Breach\n- Xenonauts\n- Opus Magnum\n- Metro Exodus\n- Invisible Inc.<p>Regards.')
