Item(by='franky47', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611776862, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25932876, text='My setup for adding OpenGraph images to my blog posts was to design them in Figma, export the image to JPG, store it as a static asset and link to it in the meta tags.<p>Figma allows linking to frames, but those links are suited for humans, for sharing and collaboration. I was looking for a way to link to an image generated from a frame, which is possible with the Figma REST API.<p>So I set out to build a little tool to take a link to a Figma Frame, and resolve it to the rendered image.<p>Since Figma handles versioning, it returns updated URLs when the design changes. As the frame URL is stable, there is no need to update the og:image tag when the design changes.<p>As a side note: this would work for any type of image, but og:images seemed a good fit.')
