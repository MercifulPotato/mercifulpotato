One would think there was a golden opportunity to disrupt this ridiculous market, but color ink is apparently the most expensive resource on planet earth. It hardly matters which piece of crap printer I buy. It&#x27;s going to cost $100 to refill, and it will break in less than 2 years. I mean, next, someone&#x27;s going to tell me there&#x27;s been collusion in this market for 30 years, and I&#x27;d be all like, pfft, come on. Really?')
