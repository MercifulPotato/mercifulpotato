An 100x optimization would mean that every single part in there can get 100 times faster, or there is a component that takes maybe 95% of the time and this can be optimized 200x, and the rest of the stack takes 5% of the time and can be optimized 10x.<p>I do believe that often it&#x27;s the other way around, instead of a very fast first iteration, people go and build the distributed version that can scale 100x but takes the performance hit that all distributed systems have for network, syncing, etc.<p>Most of us are using off-the-shelf components, so the space for optimization in our code isn&#x27;t that big â€”unless you are a novice developer but compilers go a long way in our time. Thus it may come to choosing the correct off-the-shelf components, like maybe SQLite instead a NoSQL external datastore.')
