This was before pkgin so you had to use the ports collection and compile or use the fairly simple pkg_add system.<p>For web browsing I did dillo and links -g ... it worked on a lot of the internet which at the time still did not heavily rely on stylesheets and javascript for baseline functionality. For email reading I used one of the many terminal readers, I believe pine.<p>For instant messaging I used naim. Social networking through websites wasn&#x27;t a thing yet nor was youtube.  I used mpg123 to do music and I believe I ran in screen without X up most of the time.<p>Before that I had an IBM 360c (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IBM_ThinkPad_360" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IBM_ThinkPad_360</a>) with 8MB of ram. I used I believe NetBSD 1.2 on that. I <i>could</i> even recompile the kernel without hitting swap with some very interesting gcc flags that I have long forgotten - but it still took I believe most of a day (maybe 7 hours?).<p>NetBSD 1.6 was really where the split began ... the priorities were different and things seemed slower. It is mostly meant for academics and research so this ultimately makes sense.<p>It&#x27;s like a lifetime ago.<p>So when I got this up and running, NetBSD was exactly what I turned to. It&#x27;s different of course now. But the P90 is surprisingly able to reasonably keep up as long as you have  patience and modest expectations.')
