That being said, much like your findings @sigzero, I&#x27;ve - so far - found zoho&#x27;s email to be fine (actually quite excellent when the low cost is factored in).  I was asking @agentdrtran if they had any more insight for zoho&#x27;s email service (other than their coment above), because i&#x27;m genuinely interested to learn more - if they had any stats or evidence (or even anecdote&#x2F;experience) to support their claim.')
