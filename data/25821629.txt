Item(by='rglullis', descendants=None, kids=[25822127], score=None, time=1610977110, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25821424, text='&gt; Most people can&#x27;t program and are comfortable with Mac&#x2F;Windows.<p>Yeah, being <i>comfortable</i> is not the point. The point is being <i>free</i>.<p>&gt; No one here is shackling you to Signal.<p>No one forced me to use WhatsApp. I still use it and still have on my phone. I did manage to introduce some people to Matrix, setup their accounts and install their clients when they wanted to talk to me, but there is a whole lot more that I am just not close enough and that I know won&#x27;t bother to switch just because I am asking them to.<p>If people ask me, I&#x27;d do the best case I can to get them to Matrix (or XMPP. I don&#x27;t care as long as it is open and <i>free</i>) and I will help them whenever possible to switch away from centralized systems.<p>&gt; I, too, would like to see a decentralized, federated protocol take off.<p>If you truly want to see a federated alternative grow, <i>you have to help it</i>. It&#x27;s not going to happen if we just stand passively waiting for some big benefactor to show up and decide they don&#x27;t want to control this space. Every big company will try to control this space and they will always have more resources and will use the advantages that centralized services (faster development, economies of scale) gives them.<p>Network effects matter. There is no better time to help people switch to a more free option than now with this massive WhatsApp diaspora. If people <i>settle</i> for Signal, it would be better than WhatsApp but it would still be a <i>massive</i> wasted opportunity. This is why I am arguing now so strongly.<p>(Lastly, do you know one software that I am somewhat forced to use? <i>Slack</i>. Do you know what can replace Slack with just a wee bit of training? <i>Matrix</i>. Two birds, one stone)<p>&gt; Signal is no progress at all.<p>In the terms of <i>freedom</i>: no, it is not. The server is supposedly open source, yet the last commit in their repository is from April. If someone decided to fork Signal to run their own server, would they get a current version? Would existing clients be able to use the different server?<p>The answer is <i>possibly, maybe it will require a lot of work on the people doing the fork</i>. Which is fine from the legal perspective, but really far from the mark from Open Source ethics.')
