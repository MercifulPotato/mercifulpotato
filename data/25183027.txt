If the service is bad, you don&#x27;t tip 20%. Usually, if you complain, they will give you some part of your meal free or otherwise provide an adequate remedy, in which case you still tip 20%. Otherwise, it&#x27;s okay to tip less. You can leave 10%. You can even leave 0%, but don&#x27;t expect to come back. A sincere apology and attempt to remedy at least deserves some tip.')
