Also you have to charge it daily (think better these days), while a watch would keep ticking, they even had a longer power reserve, the watch I am going to pick up soon has 31 day power reserve.<p>I just enjoy a nice watch, admire its engineering, the ticking sound, the smooth sweeping.<p>Loving it. I currently I have a small collection of watches of 18 watches. About to receive my two grail watches.')
