They never caught on for a very simple reason: CoL is literally the only advantage. $10K is nothing compared to the uphill climb of career progression that inevitably comes with remote work. Hell, $10K <i>literally less than my first relocation package</i> and I was moving a single bedroom. TL;DR: no one moves to SFBA because it&#x27;s the best CoL vs salary choice, and there are some great sweet spots for tech before places like Tulsa (eg Portland, KC, even Seattle)<p>CoL is the real attraction,  but if you don&#x27;t care about the dearth of cultural amenities, why choose a mid-sized city in a state that doesn&#x27;t have any non-Catholic private schools worth paying for and couldn&#x27;t even keep all of its public schools open 5 days a week in pre-pandemic times?<p>If you don&#x27;t need good schools or cultural institutions, why not instead choose New Hampshire? Or rural Oregon? Or, as you pointed out, the Ozarks? Heck, IMO, Branson and Springfield have better public schools than Tulsa suburbs, and Branson even has more theater than Tulsa if you&#x27;re ok with genuinely 100% world-class performers doing kitsch on faux river boats.')
