The issue is who this &quot;elite&quot; is. And that&#x27;s what no one wants to define.<p>I think you can do alright if you put some effort in. Maybe get a degree, maybe get a trade. Maybe start a business. It&#x27;s not perfect, you&#x27;ll (as you say) never actually break out of your class of birth. But the opportunity is there. In America, the UK, etc.<p>But people are lazy and short termism is built into humans. So a big chunk of people do nothing (don&#x27;t get a degree, don&#x27;t get a trade, don&#x27;t start a business, don&#x27;t take risks) and 20 years later they&#x27;re working the same job in the same (now dying) business in the same (also dying) Town. And they want to blame someone. So it&#x27;s all the Chinese&#x2F;Jews&#x2F;Immigrants&#x2F;Democrats fault.<p>Its grievance politics the same as Hitler.')
