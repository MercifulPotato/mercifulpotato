Item(by='vlovich123', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609879844, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25650206, text='That’s a logical albeit unhelpful argument. My observation of how engineering is done and the economic pressures involved make me think that such cost cutting is inevitable. So the short term “we’ll just make this single point of failure component more reliable” is not an effective strategy as “design in depth” that assumes any single component will fail. It can be more expensive but in some ways (maintenance, up-front cost) but can also be cheaper since the individual components don’t need as much testing&#x2F;validation&#x2F;reliability.<p>That being said, engineering is all about trade offs so the takeaway I have from something like this is blind faith&#x2F;hope that the domain experts make these decisions better than an outsider (me) and that when mistakes are made they’re corrected in the longer-term. I don’t know a better way than that.')
