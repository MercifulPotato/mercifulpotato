It&#x27;s quite simple. If you don&#x27;t want to get booted off the app store then follow the rules. The rules are very easy to follow.<p>If you offer a multi platform &quot;content&quot; app on iOS then users should always have the option to create a subscription account directly on their iOS device. It&#x27;s perfectly fine to create an account on a different platform and use it in the iOS app but this should neither be required, nor be directly advertised in the app.<p>Seriously, don&#x27;t make random stuff up. Amazon and Netflix don&#x27;t receive preferential treatment. If you want to make your own streaming app on iOS you can do that today as long as you follow the rules.')
