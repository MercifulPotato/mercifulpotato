Item(by='godelski', descendants=None, kids=[25107543], score=None, time=1605481970, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25105814, text='&gt; it effectively nullifies the argument for more nuanced voting mechanisms such as Score Voting.<p>I&#x27;m extremely confused by this statement. All the systems the parent is talking about still use plurality. Substituting in another voting method doesn&#x27;t change the fact that each state works slightly differently (and really every county).<p>I&#x27;d also say that if this was your goal then you&#x27;d want something besides plurality. RCV&#x2F;IRV would probably be good because it is highly inefficient because you have to do many different rounds whereas systems like plurality and condorcet (exception to STAR, which has 2 rounds) are single round methods.<p>I should mention Ireland and Australia does hand counting with IRV (Australia has had IRV for 100+ years). I don&#x27;t think the hand counting is really a major factor, though I will still contend that ordinal systems are needlessly complicated when we have cardinal systems available to us (which also give higher fidelity).')
