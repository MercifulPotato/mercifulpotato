I think about 50% of all traffic movements are by bike in this city. This includes walking, so IMO it&#x27;s pretty special.<p>The urban planning in this town has been the product of decades of bike and pedestrian friendly planning. Making the city really nice to live in.<p>It probably takes decades to convert a car centric city like Seattle into something like Groningen. That doesn&#x27;t mean that you shouldn&#x27;t strive for it. It makes a city much more friendly to live in, makes the population healthier and is more sustainable on the environment.')
