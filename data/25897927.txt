Unless you actually change your mind (what is causing these habits) in a pretty comprehensive, introspective way, habits won&#x27;t get you anywhere.<p>Although if you are super down with habits, you should keep going. Just saying it&#x27;s probably a dead-end, and if you <i>really</i> need to solve your problems (i.e. some habits are so crucial that you need to form them&#x2F;get rid of them to proceed in life), then habit-hacking (or just any sort of self-help in general) won&#x27;t help. Start looking in the direction of meditation, or just whatever you feel like. Relax a whole lot. The self-help industry is fueled by anxiety.<p>Belief makes most self-help work, which is also why it is hard to un-believe it in case it&#x27;s wrong. Very weird corner of the world, that is, the self-help space.<p>*: Habits that work aren&#x27;t habits that were constructed.')
