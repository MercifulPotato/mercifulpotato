But that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it&#x27;s still just blatant political censorship on a massive level. Every evil regime in history has done evil things under the guise of convincing the citizens that it&#x27;s OK because it&#x27;s &quot;for a good reason&quot; or directed against &quot;bad people&quot;, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it&#x27;s still evil. No matter how much political propaganda they push about why the censorship is good, it&#x27;s still massively partisan censorship and suppression.')
