That&#x27;s a good question.<p>The performance was great, I can&#x27;t complain about it, but the unpredictable (and high) price was the issue.<p>In terms of aurora I think it probably can scale better to much larger workloads. If we put the time in and dug in and optimised any queries that could touch a large number of blocks (we do well, but I&#x27;m sure there are queries that have some seq scans somewhere in our codebase) then the price wouldn&#x27;t have been an issue, and we&#x27;d happily have stayed with it.<p>In addition, we have a single large master and one replica. with my understanding of aurora&#x27;s architecture, and how the storage is separated from the &quot;postgres&quot; instance, it could possibly do a lot better with drastically different architectures with a lot of different smaller &quot;postgres&quot; instances. We didn&#x27;t have time to investigate many other architectures and in the end moving to RDS felt safest (didn&#x27;t want to spend too much time when we could be building core features)<p>Hope that answers your question! Some of the above is more an educated guess with a smattering of experience so please treat it as such.')
