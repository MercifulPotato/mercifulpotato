Actually, I am baffled how a lot of the common frameworks (React, Angular) omit some kind of documentation on how to integrate with third-party libraries that operate on the DOM directly (charting being a very good example) or how do something imperatively with the DOM (e.g. scroll to element after the user did something). In React I actually know how to do it properly, in Angular, however, I am completely lost how to do it.')
