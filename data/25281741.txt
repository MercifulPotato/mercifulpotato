There is nothing hiding in Urbit other than a deliberately obfuscated computing model, of the same stripe as brainfuck, but with (again IMHO) very different motives.  Brainfuck is obscure purely for the sake of being obscure, in the spirit of a puzzle or other intellectual challenge.  Urbit has more sinister motives, not least of which is to separate fools from their money by selling them &quot;real estate&quot; in the Urbit cyberworld.  The obscurity is there to conceal the fact that there is no there there, to entice people into investing time and effort into it, and then keep them sucked in by leveraging the sunk cost fallacy.  It is a tactic taken directly from the playbook of con men and cult leaders through the ages.<p>What <i>is</i> worthwhile (IMHO) is to read some of Curtis Yarvin&#x27;s (the founder and designer of Urbit) writings and compare them to the writings of L. Ron Hubbard, particularly bootlegged copies of the &quot;secret&quot; teachings of the &quot;church&quot; of Scientology, not for content, but for <i>structure</i>.  To my eye, there are deeply disturbing similarities.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unqualified-reservations.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.unqualified-reservations.org&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xenu.net&#x2F;archive&#x2F;ot&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xenu.net&#x2F;archive&#x2F;ot&#x2F;</a>')
