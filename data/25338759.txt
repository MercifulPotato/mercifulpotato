That&#x27;s not what &quot;libertarian&quot; means.<p>That is exactly what libertarian means in practice. The ideology, when implemented in a democratic society has no mechanism to combat this kind of regulatory capture. It becomes just a shorthand for &quot;People with money get to keep it, people without get to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.&quot;<p>Autonomy from government is only welcome by actual libertarians when it comes to autonomy from obligations towards government - but reliance on government is sought out when it comes to protection of their wealth by government.<p>Stop looking at symbolic virtue-signaling gestures, and start looking at what policies actually affect real people&#x27;s lives, and why those policies are in place. The SFBA is a <i>great</i> place to live if you are self-reliant (wealthy), and can afford its smorgasbord of world-class private services, for anything from education to transportation to healthcare, to legal work, to housing. It very quickly becomes a far-from-great place to live if you have to result to public options for any of those things - because they range from either &#x27;on life support&#x27; to &#x27;non-existent&#x27;.')
