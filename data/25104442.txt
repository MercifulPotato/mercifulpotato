Pose as a foreigner or journalist and they&#x27;ll tell you how much they have to endure. Pose as a neighbour minding your own business and you&#x27;ll see what happens :)) I guess this will be an amazing article.<p>The gypsies are the master of social engineering and fake propaganda. Rroma is the new branding put forward after everyone agreese the word gypsy carries too much of a bad meaning. It&#x27;s curious people don&#x27;t ask themselves why the word American is a good word and the word gypsy is a bad word.<p>It&#x27;s so easy to judge from the outside the Bulgarians as racists because of the self preservation mechanisms they set in place to live together with gypsies. Surely if one does the math to gauge the money that were spent by a tiny country to integrate the gypsy communities for more than 5 decades will exceed by multiple orders of magnitude the investment the western or US governments in social integration and justice. The same experiment can be easily replicated in any Eastern European country that still has large communities of gypsies.')
