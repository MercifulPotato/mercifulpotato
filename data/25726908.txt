That&#x27;s when I started getting full page ads and browser redirects. I don&#x27;t know who hijacked this app...<p>&gt; Avoid!! Used to be great. Now opens adware, and pops it over the lockscreen. Goes to great lengths to cover its tracks, calling the process &quot;partners&quot; and removing itself from recent applications. I had to use &quot;popup ad detector&quot; to find it. Appalling behaviour. Very underhanded.<p>The zxing library is open source and different from the app. So looks like something fishy happened to the app recently. From the description of problems, this might even be the app referred to in the article.')
