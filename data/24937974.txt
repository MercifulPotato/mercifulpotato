If I want to read about law I can read Eugene Volokh. If I want to read about about security I can read Bruce Schneier. In every category I care about, there are writers who are experts who make their expert opinions known without me having to subscribe to the Economist, FT, or the WSJ, all of which are great, all of which I grew up reading.<p>But I think I&#x27;m done with their gatekeeping now, I don&#x27;t need it.<p>WaPo and NYT are trash and that was made nakedly obvious in 2016. It&#x27;s more blatant now than it was then, but I guess if you didn&#x27;t notice it then, you won&#x27;t notice it now.')
