You&#x27;ve taken the time to fix a problem <i>you</i> are having in code that <i>you</i> are using. You&#x27;ve made that patch available to the upstream maintainer, but if they don&#x27;t accept it that doesn&#x27;t stop you (or anyone else) from doing what you want to do with the code. I don&#x27;t see how you&#x27;re any worse off.')
