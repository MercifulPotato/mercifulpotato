Do we really want to go down that path, and the inevitable removal of many open discussion forums that will be unable to effectively moderate content?<p>This is a very difficult problem but I don&#x27;t think the solution is to hold hosting organisations either legally or morally responsible for the content they carry.<p>Where does this leave the voice of minority groups that for some reason are seen as &quot;unacceptable&quot; to the majority of the population?<p>Should a non-religious voice in a religious society be banned from talking just because they express it would be nice if women could drive cars?<p>Should we ban the gay person who talks about the shitty treatment they get when trying to get medical treatment just because they live in a primarily heterosexual society.<p>Should we stop a group organising protests against deaths at official hands just because they are really pissed off and there is some potential that official organisation may react badly to the protest.<p>Personally I find the language and behaviour of your president and his cronies to be completely unacceptable and frankly unhinged.  However would you prefer them standing in public sprouting their rubbish where we can all hear them and point out the ridiculousness of their words, or would you prefer to have them hide away in private, able to say whatever they want with no chance of opposing voice?<p>I don&#x27;t really know what the answer to this movement is.  I know one of the answers is better education, teaching people critical thinking, but I don&#x27;t know that this is going to be something that happens quickly.  What I do know is that you can never win somebody to your point of view unless you actually engage with them, rather than just tell them they are wrong and cut them off.<p>To quote a song that escapes me at the moment, we need to &quot;Keep on Talking&quot;!')
