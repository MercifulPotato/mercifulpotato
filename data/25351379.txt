In class, We were warned again that half of us were doomed to fail, and that ECE 352 was the weed-out class that would be responsible for much of the damage.<p>What an absolutely shitty attitude towards teaching. &quot;We&#x27;re going to let half of you fail&quot;. But that&#x27;s not the failure of the students: you&#x27;re their bloody teacher! You&#x27;re the one who&#x27;s failing to teach them!<p>Gah.<p>(I&#x27;ve read to the end of the article, I know he&#x27;s complaining about the same thing, I just had to get that off my chest thanks).')
