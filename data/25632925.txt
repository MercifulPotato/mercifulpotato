If that would apply, companies giving their employees more say and shares would be more successful, and drive away the others, all without the need to form unions.<p>I mean it is possible that shareholders will work harder. But that is not an argument for unions.<p>Also, some employees are people like cooks or janitors. Will they really work harder, and what would that even mean? What if they just do their jobs? Does a janitor at Google really deserve more money than a janitor somewhere else? What makes them the &quot;chosen ones&quot;? Just lucky to work for a successful company?')
