In grade school I could (and would) recite the Star Wars movies on the playground. I was a freak.<p>At 35 I haven&#x27;t lost it yet but for at least 50% of my life have been a HEAVY marijuana user because it helps dull this problem.<p>School was easy but dreaming is a nightmare. Again, drugs are the  the only thing that helps. I hate having such vivid dreams and remembering all the awful details. I remember dreams from decades ago like I had them last night. It&#x27;s horrible mostly, again, marijuana was a God send.<p>Killing my memory with drugs and alcohol isn&#x27;t great but I&#x27;ve found it better than the alternative and often discuss with my therapist how jealous I am of people that waltz through life confidently forgetting all their screw up and mistakes.')
