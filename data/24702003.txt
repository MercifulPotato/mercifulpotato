So you&#x27;re left with choosing one of two compromise options:<p>1) Ignore the nice app-native keyboard shortcuts and just use vimium everywhere (Frustrating when single-key shortcuts in the app are multiple drop-down menu clicks with vimium)<p>2) Disable Vimium on shortcut-rich apps, but deal with the inconsistencies. (Eg clicking on the link in the body of an e-mail in gmail now needs a mouse again)<p>I really wish vimium had some kind of modifier for &quot;send next key to website&quot;, so I could have my cake and eat it too.')
