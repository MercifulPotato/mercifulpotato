My handwriting improved tremendously.  They spent several weeks on just how to hold the pencil correctly and how to have the right touch on the paper for even lines.  They also spent a lot of time on how to be deliberate about what was written.  Because back then getting an error into a blueprint was extremely time consuming and a pain to repair just in the paperwork world never mind the physical.  Never did that job.  But it sure cleaned up my handwriting.<p>Just for fun a few months ago I thought back on how my signature has changed over the years.  I drew them all down on a piece of paper.  My wife thought I was nuts for having no less than 7 different signatures.  My current one sort of resembles letters and scribbles.')
