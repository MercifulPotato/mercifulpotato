I&#x27;m 32 now. Almost more of my life has been spent on it than off it.<p>I&#x27;ve been productive in a variety of ways. Some examples are listed on my patreon: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.patreon.com&#x2F;shawwn" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.patreon.com&#x2F;shawwn</a> but I feel silly bragging about comparatively minor accomplishments in ML.<p>But I know for a fact that without adderall, I wouldn&#x27;t have done a damn thing. I&#x27;ve tried for a few months. Shrugged and went back.<p>Her flying to Nevada is completely understandable. CA pharmacies are some of the worst in terms of this medicine. I&#x27;ve experienced it firsthand.<p>Is it so hard to believe that I&#x27;d probably be a potsmoker working at a grocery store if I hadn&#x27;t had adderall? Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with potsmoking nor working at a grocery store, but it&#x27;s not ML.<p>I advise empathy. Try. And I wish I could put it more eloquently why it&#x27;s worthwhile. Her missing work for a few ays is equal to a coworker getting sick for a few days. Your reaction is why so many keep their lives private.<p>I myself have gone from Missouri to IL to fill a script. A few hours&#x27; drive is nothing. Fun road trip.<p>Most recently, a person (who wasn&#x27;t me) found themselves in CA unable to fill their script because their doctor wasn&#x27;t licensed in CA. They literally just tell you &quot;Sorry, can&#x27;t do it.&quot; What are you supposed to do?<p>It&#x27;s easy to say &quot;Well, just deal with it.&quot; And we do. Let me cast a sleeping spell on you and see how well you do. You&#x27;re getting verryyy sleeeppyy... you&#x27;ll have a rough week.')
