There&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s still called &quot;solid wood&quot;.<p>If you look, most plywoods are &quot;whitewood&quot; or whatever is cheapest (most softwoods are incredibly strong as the term is just a synonym for coniferous). If you compare apples-to-apples -- Baltic Birch (or similar products with only birch layers) to solid birch...<p>The plywood doesn&#x27;t have any noticeable wood movement;<p>The plywood can have fasteners and glue in any face (unlike solid where endgrain must be joined);<p>The solid wood usually has much better stiffness;<p>The solid wood is limited to shape and size by nature of trees; plywood can be found in larger sizes.<p>Good wooden chairs are impossible to find commercially now. The wood from the seat needs to be very wet and a wood that doesn&#x27;t split easily, and the wood for the legs needs to be riven and dryer than what its final environment will be (so as close to 0% moisture as possible, at least &lt;10%).<p>This is so that the legs expand a bit into the seat, which will continue to shrink, and make an incredibly tight fit. But it&#x27;s not conducive at all to mass-production, which is why you often see them nailed, bracketed, bolted, etc, all sorts of dirty tricks.<p>Woodworking is a rabbit-hole you might find compelling or infuriating. You can&#x27;t unlearn the knowledge when you do.')
