I worked for a doubleclick &#x2F; ads 360 competitor and it was so plain that Google used its dominant position not only to  squash competitors like us but also to further obscure the auction mechanisms. Today it&#x27;s a challenge to specify exactly what you want to bid for a given keyword, in part for the better since it dramatically reduces complexity for advertisers but it does remove a lot of the control and hands it back to... Google. Ultimately the auction is completely irrelevant since Google decides which ads will show and by extension whose ad money they&#x27;ll pocket. In addition to that, Google charges premium for ad space even in non-competitive markets; I&#x27;m talking about what you end up paying for a top spot although there are no other actors in the auction for a particular keyword (even in broader matches). While one could argue that it&#x27;s up to them as a publisher to decide what a spot is worth, this mechanism is completely obscure and you will only ever find out in hindsight through what you pay for the traffic.')
