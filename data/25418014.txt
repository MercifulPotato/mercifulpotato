Item(by='KaiserPro', descendants=None, kids=[25418455], score=None, time=1607956680, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25417058, text='&gt; Absolutely there is room for development of more traditional farming<p>I&#x27;m not talking about traditional farming. I&#x27;m talking about using &quot;low tech&quot; solutions but monitoring them scientifically.<p>For example, flooding in the UK is becoming a bigger problem, partly because of more rain, partly because people are allowed to live on flood plains. However a significant change is the way farming has modified land drainage. The soil contains less humus (spongey black&#x2F;brown stuff, not hummus :)) which means it&#x27;s much more like sand and doesn&#x27;t absorb water.<p>This water runs off, taking the fertiliser, and soil with it. This clogs up and kills rivers, and because there is no capacity to hold water in the land, it all disgorges into streams and rivers at once, causing floods.<p>Improving soil health costs money, more money than fertiliser in the short term. There are no real incentives to change this. Everyone knows that soil health is degrading, but there isn&#x27;t agreement on how to proceed.<p>&gt; Record droughts already cause huge economic damage nearly every year<p>Farming has a massive impact on droughts. it also has a massive impact on heat absorption. hence my statement on mixed tree&#x2F;arable.<p>Its less productive, but moderates water loss and heat gain. It also is a boon to wildlife. it can be made almost as productive if there is some form of intense labour. Assuming that we can mechanise it effectively we can remove the barriers to adoption.')
