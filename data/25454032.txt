Hence it&#x27;s a good idea to teach everyone reading and writing at school.<p>I think the programming equivalent of a shopping list would be something like a simple 1, 2, 3 cron script, or if-this-then-that event handlers. That only needs a very basic understanding of computing (and how to find information effectively online), but opens up lots of really useful automation, e.g. backing up files, sending an email (e.g. a notification&#x2F;reminder to ourselves), etc. Even without some automated API to use, a sequence of &#x27;print&#x27; and &#x27;sleep&#x27; commands can be useful to help ourselves&#x2F;others perform some common task, e.g. a receipe which tells us when to turn down the oven, when to put on the pasta, etc. Hence I think it&#x27;s a good idea to have simple &#x27;learn to code&#x27; classes in schools; whilst more advanced classes would be optional for those wanting to specialise down that path.')
