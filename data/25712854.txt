Let me explain.<p>I&#x27;m not up to date, but a few years ago the issue with H1-B was that the big Indian consulting firms (Wipro, Tata (TCS), HCL, Infosys, Tech Mahindra) [0] were used to submit a VERY large amount of H1-B applications, knowing that about 1&#x2F;3rd to 1&#x2F;4th of these would &quot;win&quot; the lottery and be accepted. As a result, most of the H1-B granted are theirs (top 3 in this list [1]).<p>At least, if it&#x27;s wage-based instead of random, they would be forced to review the wages offered to Indians moving to the US to work for them.<p>I am not sure if there are other implications (did I miss something important in my little analysis?), but I think it would be something worth exploring more.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.deccanherald.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;economy-business&#x2F;indias-top-5-it-firms-stare-at-historic-revenue-mark-766973.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.deccanherald.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;economy-business&#x2F;india...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.myvisajobs.com&#x2F;Reports&#x2F;2020-H1B-Visa-Sponsor.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.myvisajobs.com&#x2F;Reports&#x2F;2020-H1B-Visa-Sponsor.asp...</a>')
