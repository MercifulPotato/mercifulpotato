There are many ways to prep children for this kind of test, and the wealthy in America have access to an early education system that trains children for standardized tests.<p>I have anecdotal evidence because I have two children who were raised in different countries. My older child did daycare and preschool in Finland, before we moved to USA. My younger child is now three and in private daycare in Manhattan.<p>In Finnish daycare, three-year-olds spent their days playing. In affluent New York, they are clearly being trained to perform on tests. I’m not exactly happy about that because I believe the Finnish system creates more balanced individuals on average. But I guess I’ll see the results of this experiment firsthand in 5-10 years.')
