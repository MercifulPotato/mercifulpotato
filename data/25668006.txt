I build solutions I&#x27;m asked to build and then an abusive architect coopts that work and rewrites it in a shitty, unusable way. Users cry at me, but when I tell them what happened, they are silent. No one cares enough to cry to leadership. And the leadership have clearly said they have no intention of overruling what said architect talks about.')
