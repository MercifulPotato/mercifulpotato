I don&#x27;t want to do anything where drivers or hardware keeps sucking the life out of me. I also don&#x27;t want to do anything where I need to read a dozen spells into some cloud shell in order to get a hello world from an app running on sixteen different machines.<p>I just want to code algorithms and data structures and solve hard domain problems. Not solve difficult programming and operations problems in order to deliver on what is often  (at least superficially!) simple domain problems. I think that sweet spot is in  games and desktop development.')
