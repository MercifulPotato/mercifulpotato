If I just did a full day of shooting photos, and I am in the hotel room looking at the photos, I don&#x27;t want to dig through my bag and pull out the card reader, or to have a dongle hanging off of my laptop when I&#x27;m doing it.  If I can just get the card out of the camera and throw it in the laptop it&#x27;s so much nicer')
