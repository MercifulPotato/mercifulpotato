I complained -- at the time -- that the monoculture was harmful, and I used Firefox as my primary browser for that reason (but there were lots of sites that would only work on IE). I loved Chrome when it first showed up: a new entrant increasing the diversity and bring lots of new technical and UI innovations. But once Chrome reached the point where it dominated the browser ecosystem I returned to Firefox because I really DO think that diversity is important.<p>Specifically, I believe that when the largest player in the market has no more than ~40-50% market share AND there are at least 4-5 different widely-used tools, that producers of content (as well as the tool providers) will feel compelled to focus on delivering a compatible experience. But when the largest player in the market has 75% of all users, it&#x27;s advantageous for content producers to focus on delivering for that platform AND it starts to be advantageous for the producer of that tool to become <i>incompatible</i> with other tools.<p>To keep the ecosystem healthy, I want to see more diversity than we have today.')
