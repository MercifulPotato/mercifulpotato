Was that not news worthy? Was anything about Joe Biden news worthy prior to the election? It&#x27;s an embarrassment.<p>I hope everyone realizes the powers that took on Trump, Big Tech, Deep State, China&#x2F;Russia&#x2F;EU, Democrats, etc.  Quite the feat that it took that much power to barely beat Trump (which is debatable until we get a handle on what happened for voting.  I don&#x27;t know if the election was rigged, but I wouldn&#x27;t put it past them and there are some weird anomalies in the voting data).')
