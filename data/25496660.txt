I have a startup idea that I want to implement. I&#x27;ve done it on windows, and it&#x27;s flawless. Should work on macOS too. But these mobile OS&#x27;s don&#x27;t provide the right API&#x27;s to do it. Android offers access to do it in a half assed way, and the way to do it right is to do it the correct way, flawlessly. So I&#x27;m stuck in a limbo, I want to be the first and last to market, prepared for when these companies break up, the OS offers access to some API&#x27;s I want, and capture the market. There may be little network effects to the idea. But it&#x27;s going to be a big market for everyone, with plenty of competition if idiots offer the right API&#x27;s. [edited it gave away a bit too revealing info]. Enough that I don&#x27;t ever connect my development machine to the internet to make sure no source code ever leaves.<p>My test users have asked me when will I offer a mobile app? The app needs mobile integration to make it work the way the idea was supposed to be. All OS&#x27;s that the user uses, together.<p>And, I have no response to their questions and the mails end up collecting dust.<p>These fuckers ruin innovation for everyone and it makes me mad.<p>If these companies don&#x27;t get broken up with a competitive mobile OS landscape again, don&#x27;t get mad when I jump ship and go with some OS Huawei makes if it offers the right way and gains adoption.<p>If America wants competitiveness, innovation and a technological lead, it has work to do at home: Trust busting needs to happen fast.')
