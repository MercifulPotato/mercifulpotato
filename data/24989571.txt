It&#x27;s not like any country is just going to give you a spare island or two, especially if the island has enough viable resources to be worth occupying. You&#x27;re going to have to take it from people who already live there, or persuade them that it&#x27;s worth staying in your ideal society. Ask the Maoris or Palestians how that worked out. You might buy some land, but I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re not Bezos, and you&#x27;re not Musk either, so colonizing Mars is a no-go.<p>Or...it looks like you want to change US law on the protection of religion. That&#x27;s a specific change, that actually has a lot of support. The younger generation tends to be less religious than their parents, so there might be a long term trend behind you. Perhaps it might be worth getting on board with whatever groups are lobbying for that change. That&#x27;s something actionable, rather than dreaming about starting a whole new country.')
