Item(by='chii', descendants=None, kids=[24738069], score=None, time=1602322462, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24737692, text='&gt; you can&#x27;t just be allowed to post bomb making plans on the internet or yelling fire in a crowded theatre<p>one is very different from the other. I agree yelling fire in a crowded place can&#x27;t be allowed - causes people to panic, because it&#x27;s not possible to &#x27;unhear&#x27; a sound.<p>But posting bomb-making information (or really, any information) should be allowed. This information is voluntarily consumed, so it has no danger of causing harm without a person acting on said information (in which case, it&#x27;s not the information but the person acting on it that is the problem). This applies to _any_ information, not just bomb making information.')
