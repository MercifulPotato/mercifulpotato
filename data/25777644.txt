Look at the time it takes to design chips. Look at where the market and tech is going (M1 and AMD especially). Compare with RIM and Nokia. There is a &quot;roadrunner&quot; effect where a colossal company will continue for a few years on pure momentum. There are so many things speaking against Intel.

I would guess at the following conversation in 5-10 years:<p>- &quot;How did Intel die?&quot;<p>- &quot;Well, first slowly. Then quickly.&quot;')
