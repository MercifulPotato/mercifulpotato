AMD can&#x27;t manufacture half the volume they should to satisfy demand, while Apple is a poster child of $900 laptops costing â‚¬1000 when they finally cross the Atlantic long after release.<p>&quot;Available at an Apple store&quot; might be the biggest joke one could possibly say. There&#x27;s only a handful of store worldwide.')
