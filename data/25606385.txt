Yes, some places are experiencing a lack of water but those are the exception to the norm.<p>With yet another year of drought in SoCal and heavy fires as a result of dryer weather in Norcal seem to suggest otherwise: I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a lack of demand at all.<p>Carlsbad actually built their desalination (Poseidon) plant when I still lived in CA permanently and the cost was the biggest hurdle, as was waste management, as they sold the water to neighboring areas at a premium in order to recover the costs in a public-private undertaking. Carlsbad is one of the more affluent cities in San Diego County so they had the money during the bubble economy boom before the crash.<p>Another one is&#x2F;has been scheduled to be rolled out in Huntington Beach apparently [0].<p>I definitely think desalination should be explored, tested, and refined especially as the CO river source is&#x2F;has been closed and CA needs to take advantage of the massive resource it has in addition to reducing consumption while figuring out the waste issue with desalination. And nothing could accelerate it faster than CA&#x27;s massive need for fresh water. A Day Zero situation is something that should be avoided at all costs and in incredibly myopic in what is essentially the 5th largest economy in the World.<p>Personally speaking, I always figured it would be perto-states trying to diversify that would be the biggest financial backers of these facilities, as well as massive solar farms, as the automotive World moved further way from fossil fuel and OPEC goes to ever greater money losing schemes to prop up the price of oil. Especially in a World with evermore cheap and hot fiat being thrown at stupid things like Airbnb and Doordash IPOs.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angeles.sierraclub.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;stop_the_poseidon_desalination_plant_in_huntington_beach" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;angeles.sierraclub.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;stop_the_po...</a>')
