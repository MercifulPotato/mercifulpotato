The tracking and logging is excellent, the community aspects are fun, and overall I find the product very easy to use.<p>Do I think it&#x27;s worth a 100M investment?  I&#x27;m not sure.  I wouldn&#x27;t have expected Peloton or Mirror to exist.  But there&#x27;s clearly a demand for social fitness products and who am I to argue against the market?')
