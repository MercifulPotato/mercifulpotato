I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not the only one who immediately realized that kindness is <i>very</i> easily exploited by the wrong people.<p>I find it grating because my disposition of being kind gets me in situations where people try to exploit their perception of my kindness. There is this implication of &quot;so you want me to think you&#x27;re nice? well do <i>this</i> for me and I will.&quot; When it turns transactional like that - where their assumption is that I&#x27;m being kind to get something (because maybe that&#x27;s how they interact - by being kind to get things), I feel like I have no choice but to switch to a very serious tone. Then comes the &quot;you&#x27;re not being very nice&quot; which is the intent: I don&#x27;t want them to think I&#x27;m being nice for personal gain. This is all very cynical and I really need to work on it, but it&#x27;s a knee jerk response to what seems like slimy behavior.<p>&gt;1. Help yourself<p>&gt;2. Climb a mountain, tell nobody<p>&gt;3. More suffering is needed<p>&gt;4. The enemy is a wonderful teacher<p>I love wisdom like this - is there anything that talks about this in depth or is it more of a proverb only?')
