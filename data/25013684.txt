I caused a scene.  I still think about it because of the way they embraced an exaggerated stereotype that didn&#x27;t actually in any way reflect the people they actually knew with that identity for years.  The stereotype was so different from the reality that I think at some point they stopped making the connection between the two.<p>I never heard anybody in my group of friends make a 4chan reference again, I can&#x27;t help but think that incident served as an alarm bell that people were getting out of touch with reality, and people seemed to either stop using the site or started visiting it less.  Human&#x27;s historically have not existed in social environments like 4chan and I think the site, especially when indulged in frequently, can lead to a sort of psychosis.')
