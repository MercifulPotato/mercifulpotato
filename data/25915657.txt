Item(by='RoyTyrell', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611668558, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25912853, text='For TV&#x2F;film, it&#x27;s probably one of the most accurate that I&#x27;ve seen. There are some things that are obviously for drama and visual effect though.<p>Some examples (very low spoilers but you&#x27;ve been warned):<p>------------------------------<p>------------------------------<p>1. In one of the first episodes, a couple characters design up a circuit to step through the values of an EEPROM to read off the value of each address. They use a series of 8 LEDs and convert the binary value to decimal in their head and then write it down on paper. Even if you were going to do something very manual like that you would want to use a 7-segment LED and driver so you could at least just write down the hex value.<p>2. One of the characters writes some firmware in assembler, and other characters keep saying that their code is &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;art&quot;.<p>3. Later on in the series, some of the characters run an online game company and run a distributed game server on networked IBM XTs. They don&#x27;t actually say if they&#x27;re using some custom OS or how the accomplished that, but that also isn&#x27;t the point of those episodes either.<p>4. There are brief flashes of assembler, basic, and C on a computer screen and most of it seems to be at least slightly incorrect.<p>All of that being said, I would give it a B+ for technical accuracy - and an A for being an awesome show.')
