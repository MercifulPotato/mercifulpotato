That seems a bit like stereotyping to me. It also seems to contradict actual data.[1] While most black Americans agree that racial issues are still serious problems, they tend not to endorse the extreme progressive interpretations and policy recommendations.<p>If I were to guess, tech workers are much more likely to be progressive activists than workers in most other industries. This includes the (shamefully small) number of black tech workers as well. But at the same time, almost all of the activists are white.<p>[1] see appendix 1.1.1 <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hiddentribes.us&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;hidden_tribes_report.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hiddentribes.us&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;hidden_tribes_report.pdf</a>')
