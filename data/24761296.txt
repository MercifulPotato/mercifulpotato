Assuming it&#x27;s based on nothing more than a software emulator core (just like their previous C64 project), you&#x27;re better off getting a MiSTer [1] or just using WinUAE.<p>For extra points, it&#x27;s not hard at all to setup the MiSTer board in a used Amiga 500 case with the original keyboard.<p>And of course, one can always buy a classic Amiga 500 system from AmiBay, there are lot of them out there and prices are still reasonable. Moreover, there&#x27;s a galaxy of modern expansion boards and hardware accessories that can be used to bring them into the 21st century.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MiSTer-devel&#x2F;Main_MiSTer&#x2F;wiki" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MiSTer-devel&#x2F;Main_MiSTer&#x2F;wiki</a>')
