But already a few years ago, 1893, the Edison Kinetoscope was used to produce the first short films, viewable only through a peephole. Several other such apparatus existed in Europe before the Lumiere&#x27;s. The Kinetoscope was a huge success, Lumiere&#x27;s projectors also.<p>The train arriving in La Ciotat was a bigger production, because they had to travel some hours to the south, and was something they wanted to present in Paris. But I would count the Blacksmiths or Fred Ott&#x27;s Sneeze more of a movie than the first Lumiere docs. And they are much earlier.<p>Eg <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kinetoscope" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kinetoscope</a>')
