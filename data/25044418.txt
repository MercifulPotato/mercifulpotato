And this is \na major plus.\nThat means you get quickly to see what you have configured,\nyou can put it into version control and check it out\non a different machine, and so on. This is a big ergonomical\ndifference to IDEs.<p>As the technical foundation, it is rock-solid. Emacs is\nbased on lisp which has basic text manipulation\ninstructions implemented in native code. This makes it\nboth extremely easy to configure and extend it. It is\nalso from a time when Linux was not yet existant, Unix\nwas not yet universal, and Lisp machines were a thing,\nso it has a certain platform feeling - while also\nhaving good access to the OS.  It is certainly possible\nto use Emacs in text mode as a login shell or as a\nterminal manager.<p>To that adds another quality of Emacs and vi,\none which these IDE enthusiasts can not even\nunderstand, which is that the user interface\nis incredibly stable. And this means that\nsomething you have become used to will\nnot change and drift under your feet\nlike quicksand. And in the long run, this\nreally saves a ton of time. That does not\nmean you can&#x27;t change things, rather you can\nchange stuff under your control, like using\nthe better-defaults setup.')
