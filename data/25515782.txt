If you merge B into master, find a problem, revert the merge and push a fix to B and try merging B again most devs would expect the result in master to be equal to having just merged the fixed version of B to begin with. But it ain&#x27;t so.<p>I agree of course that SVN is much worse than git for most purposes, although it&#x27;s still used frequently in preference to git in design artifact heavy settings because it won&#x27;t choke as quickly as git on binary assets from artists or designers. The question of what tool handles merge commits better is a bit academic to me, so I do not know the answer. The two reasons for this are: 1. there is currently no practical benefit in learning a better VCS given the dominance of git 2. I gave up on using merge with git.')
