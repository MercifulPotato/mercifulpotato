Item(by='tialaramex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612104860, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25978930, text='There are (roughly) two separate ways RFCs can be created, and there are also both &quot;standards track&quot; and otherwise RFCs. Both these are emergent properties rather than having been consciously decided upon at the outset.<p>This was an Independent Submission and it was also not Standards Track.<p>Here&#x27;s an RFC about the Independent Submission process.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc4846" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc4846</a><p>The IETF takes the pragmatic view that whether something is in fact &quot;a standard&quot; is an observable fact, rather than something they, lacking any enforcement powers, have control over. As a result for most RFCs in Standards Track the end state is &quot;Proposed Standard&quot; although some may eventually get labelled &quot;Internet Standard&quot; when it turns out that&#x27;s what they are.<p>To the extent you can really &quot;follow discussions&quot; for an independent submission they&#x27;ll have taken place in the mailing list for the ART (Applications and Real Time) area <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ietf.org&#x2F;mailman&#x2F;listinfo&#x2F;art" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ietf.org&#x2F;mailman&#x2F;listinfo&#x2F;art</a><p>If you were developing something a bit more substantial, and wanted a community of people to work on that, you&#x27;d form an IETF Working Group to do so. The products from such Working Groups are the other major source of RFCs, and some (but far from all) will be Proposed Standards.<p>The decision about what to do, especially if you aren&#x27;t an experienced participant, is a problem for the IETF group named DISPATCH (or, if it&#x27;s a security problem, SECDISPATCH). DISPATCH can figure out whether it&#x27;s a good fit for the IETF (&quot;What is a sandwich?&quot; is not), whether it&#x27;s something where useful consensus can be achieved (&quot;Should web pages use Javascript?&quot; is not) and what best to do with what you&#x27;ve got.<p>For example: Maybe you want to propose a new protocol for Internet-connected cat flaps. DISPATCH might suggest there&#x27;s a Working Group already doing related stuff for home pet networking, they could &quot;adopt&quot; your idea, you should write up a draft, submit that, and then get their chairs to have you present your idea to the group. You should probably also join in their discussions meanwhile, you might realise their existing &quot;Pet toy related protocols&quot; are almost what you need anyway and abandon your idea. Or they might say you seem to have a complete working proposal, we can&#x27;t find anybody else who is interested in this at all, so just submit it as it is.<p>Independent submission is also good where you are in fact documenting a real product that exists regardless. If Apple decided to allow every platform to use iMessage, they could write up an Independent Submission explaining the protocol. Microsoft did this for various protocols years ago. Clearly if it wasn&#x27;t already a &quot;standard&quot; when Windows did it, it won&#x27;t be a &quot;standard&quot; just because you wrote an RFC, but at least now we can all agree how it&#x27;s supposed to work.')
