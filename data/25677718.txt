He strings together contradictions in every sentence he can, and when he can&#x27;t, he makes sure to contradict or make a random topic change within the next sentence.<p>Why does he do this? It&#x27;s a rhetorical trick. That means every time he speaks, most people find something in it that they want to hear. He makes sure not to say anything specific unless it&#x27;s obvious that he&#x27;s embellishing it; then if you don&#x27;t like what he says, it sounds like it was a joke or off the cuff. This has been his whole platform. Say so many things, with so many interpretations, with so little factual basis, that most people can find something they like, and almost no one can pin him down for saying something awful. You just expect him to be grandiose and full of shit, and he is, so it&#x27;s hard to be upset, as long as you find him charismatic.')
