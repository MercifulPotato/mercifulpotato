The weather has been amazing the last few months. A lot of neighborhoods have closed off main streets to vehicle traffic. Outdoor dining has been on in full swing. Parks, beaches and outdoor areas have been generally full (a bit too much for comfort, in fact). IMO the city has been amazing to live in the last few months.<p>Of course now with the rains and rising cases nationwide it&#x27;s probably time to hibernate again.')
