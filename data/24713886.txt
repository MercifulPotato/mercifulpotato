Yeah, I&#x27;ve never had a use for that.<p>One of the major goals for Haskell programmers (and users of fancy-type-systems in general) is to make it easy to transform runtime errors to compile-time errors. Further, an additional goal (albeit one which Haskell doesn&#x27;t prioritize as much as some of its relatives) is to make the compiler better at telling the programmer what is wrong and how to fix it. If you have no interest in these projects and don&#x27;t see why they could lead to code which is more reliable and easier to maintain, then your confusion about why people care about this stuff in the first place is perfectly reasonable IMO.')
