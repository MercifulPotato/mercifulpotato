I always like to say, the best way to make code extensible in future is to make it do its current job as simply and clearly as possible.<p>If you leave a hook in for some feature you &quot;know&quot; is coming you&#x27;ll only screw it up - either that feature won&#x27;t be needed or it&#x27;ll look different than you expect. Your field validator is a great specific example, I think I&#x27;ll use that one in future.<p>(A corollary of this though is that you have to be happy to ruthlessly refactor existing code when a new requirement actually does enter the scene, because of course that requirement was deliberately not prepared for in the existing code.)')
