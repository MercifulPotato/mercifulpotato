Covid got me cooking much more, and I actually started liking it, so I thought I’d invest in some decent pans as my non stick ones were wearing down. I am not a natural in the kitchen, and the learning curve for stainless has been huge for me. The heat is different and the pans get much much hotter at a lower heat. When you throw things in the pan, it sticks for a moment. This can make things yummy but is unsettling after a life of non stick. You can season stainless like a cast iron pan to get it non stick.<p>I was really frustrated after making the switch. Non stick pans are so forgiving. However, now that I’m over the hump, I really love these pans. They are so sturdy and will last my whole life. I’ve learned how to control heat much better, and they’re quite satisfying to cook with. There’s something so quality feeling about them.')
