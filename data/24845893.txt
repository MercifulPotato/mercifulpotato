The relational model is built out of the box to keep a consistent state of the data and this is one of its main value propositions.<p>Another danger that I didn&#x27;t mention is that junior developers will be tempted to prefer &quot;Turing like code&quot; inside stored procedures (for loops,cursors, conditionals) instead of relational constructs (joins, subqueries,grouping,table variables). I have seen that several times and this is really a killer for database performances.')
