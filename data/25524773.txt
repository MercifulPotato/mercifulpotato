For example, regarding obese people on planes having to pay for extra seats, a good faith argument would involve genuine discussion about the impact on these people, whether it&#x27;s prejudiced to do so, whether it&#x27;s within the rights of the airlines to charge them extra, and so on.<p>A bad faith argument is where this topic is brought up as a strawman when the real topic of conversation is censorship or some such.<p>I&#x27;m fully aware that this entire comment thread, including my replies, constitutes a bad faith argument, BTW. We are not genuinely discussing the plight of obese people, we&#x27;re just using their plight to further our own discussions.')
