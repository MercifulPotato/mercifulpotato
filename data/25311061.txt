Seeing &amp; having that stuff around you doesn’t mean you grow poor.<p>I did the 6 year community college plan; I failed out of college and by every metric on my academic record, I should be a complete failure, but hey, I’m not!<p>All the issues you of poverty and how crippling it is, I completely agree with, but what you don’t understand is that it’s all a decision. It’s a decision to live how you are or seek a return that will be realized down the road at some unknown point. I understand what I just said would be extremely difficult for someone who would be in that current situation, but it doesn’t deny them the ability to seek that reward at some point down the road.<p>As I’ve said, it’s all a choice on what to do with your time. The fight within is the most difficult thing anyone could ever face, but face it one must to change.<p>One of my favorite sayings is “you’re not going to change until the pain of change is less than the pain of staying the same.” Basically... one must hate oneself so much that it would be easier to change than to live another day as one currently does.<p>Wanna guess how I changed? I hated myself that much.')
