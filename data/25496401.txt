Instead of focusing on how people use roads to get around, this game focuses on where people live vs where they shop. When zoning keeps these separate, you -- er, Santa -- might have a harder time.<p>This is a light-hearted response to the idea of 15-minute cities, where people can reach most amenities by foot. We&#x27;re also building a more serious tool (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dabreegster.github.io&#x2F;abstreet&#x2F;side_projects&#x2F;fifteen_min.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dabreegster.github.io&#x2F;abstreet&#x2F;side_projects&#x2F;fifteen...</a>) to understand how cities could evolve. If you have thoughts about how software can get people usefully involved in that conversation, please let us know!<p>Everything we&#x27;re building uses OpenStreetMap, so if you want to see this game or walkshed tool work in your city, open a Github issue. Ideally include public data for land use, like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com&#x2F;datasets&#x2F;current-land-use-zoning-detail" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com&#x2F;datasets&#x2F;cur...</a>, so we know how many housing units each building has.<p>Happy solstice,\n-Dustin<p>Previous HN about A&#x2F;B Street: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23605048" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23605048</a>')
