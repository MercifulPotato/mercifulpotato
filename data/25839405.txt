Glorious battles between the Federation and Klingons. I only wish I had video of some of these games. The game was written in MACRO-10 and featured 3D game play using ASCII renditions of stars, planets, and ships. The Enter key on the numeric keypad certainly took a beating as that was your propulsion key (if I recall correctly).

I asked dumb questions and he sent me in the right direction.')
