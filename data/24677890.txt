To be honest with you I don&#x27;t like them, but I understand the need of having one in a bigger company.<p>I understand your point, however this resume isn&#x27;t intended to be the first contact with a future employer. It will be contained in my pdf resume once I update it, but I hope the employer will notice it. I&#x27;ll probably mention it in a cover letter or similar.<p>But as quadrifoliate already stated, this resume is a reverse filtering against standard hiring processes.\nI&#x27;m actually looking for a smaller sized team which I hope will be full of hackers that like to fiddle on the low level side of technology etc.')
