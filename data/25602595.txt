Every keyboarder at that time had to have one. They were pretty expensive, so Yamaha came out with some cheaper models with 4 oscillators instead of 6. The sound was also very good and the E-Rhodes is still a classic. But soon after that Roland came out with the D50 and that changed everything again, because now you could mix samples and digital oscillators. Yamahas answer to that was the SY77. A monster synth that nobody could program any more.')
