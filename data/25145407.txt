In my day job, I work on some world-changing technology that will massively improve the state of security; I see applications for it everywhere. I have nearly complete control over the technical aspects of the project, from language (Rust) to framework to code style, etc. I enjoy working with my colleagues, and we all feel strong loyalty to each other. It&#x27;s the best work situation I could hope for, and I plan to stay there for the foreseeable future.<p>And yet, I somehow find continuing to work on it to be a bit of a slog. At the end of the day, I breathe a sigh of relief and crack open my personal project, which is a point of sale system written in COBOL on an AS&#x2F;400. This, somehow, sparks joy.<p>Yes, there are aspects that can make a day job more or less pleasant. Keeping up with the churn in faddish sectors is exhausting, and I&#x27;m glad that I&#x27;ve been able to avoid touching the web in my career. Unrealistic deadlines are a sure-fire trip to burnout for me. Constantly putting out fires gets demoralizing.<p>So, you can control how much your day job bothers you, and even like it, but it&#x27;s never going to have the same joy that you feel when you&#x27;re working for yourself, with nobody to answer to. I still think it&#x27;s a better career track for me than any of the alternatives though.')
