You can motivate people by paying them competitive salaries, providing them job security, or providing them access to do work they wouldn&#x27;t otherwise be able to.<p>Compensation is out (see above), and job security in government is always subject to weasel-capture (just as it was&#x2F;is in academia) without a perfect, future predicting oracle.<p>This seems to (rightly, IMHO) be focused on that last incentive.')
