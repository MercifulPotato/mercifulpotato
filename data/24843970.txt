Item(by='toast0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603242885, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24843779, text='&gt; Don&#x27;t ask me how grounding works for 240v appliances. I have no idea.<p>Ground is &#x27;the same&#x27; for 240v and 120v on split phase. A usually bare copper wire is run from the ground pin to the service panel, in the main service panel ground and neutral are connected together and to the utility neutral and the grounding rod.<p>Most 240v outlets are hot-hot-ground, or hot-hot-neutral-ground; some older outlets were hot-hot-neutral and the appliance was supposed to be wired separately to ground (and we can all suppose how often that was done properly, resulting in that outlet type becoming disfavored).<p>I&#x27;m currently rejiggering a 240v wired box for 120v outlets, after finding the wires in the panel and confirming they don&#x27;t power any other 240v outlets, I&#x27;m connecting the white wire to the neutral bus bar, and the black wire to a spare 120v breaker, and then it&#x27;s normal wiring of the outlet.')
