The cats definitely appear to enjoy it.  My cat has learned to recognize the sound of me opening the tub of catnip and will come running across the house to get some.<p>Good for them?  Maybe.  It&#x27;s certainly not <i>bad</i> for them.  This has been very much studied.  Cats can&#x27;t overdose on catnip.  At worst, after 5-15 minutes of sniffing and rolling around in it, they stop responding to it.<p>&gt; when we view other drugs with such different eyes.<p>Because most drugs humans take are harmful.  The hard stuff like meth, cocaine, heroin, etc., is easy to overdose on.  Alcohol can make some people belligerent and can easily be deadly.  Tobacco causes cancer, among other things depending on how you consume it.  Marijuana is the least harmful, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned, the jury is still out on whether or not it&#x27;s as harmless as people think it is, especially if smoked.<p>But catnip?  It&#x27;s completely harmless.  The cat will sniff or eat it, roll around in it, and appears to experience euphoria, but there are no health dangers in it.')
