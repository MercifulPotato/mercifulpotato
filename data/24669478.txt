In all honesty, I wouldn&#x27;t trust anyone that disagrees with this even if they told me the sky was blue. Man capitalism has made people so heartless.<p>Edit: This is getting downvoted by people that are mad their version of agar.io hasn&#x27;t made them rich yet. Oh please. I&#x27;ve made a couple games myself that didn&#x27;t do good. You can&#x27;t wish someone in prison for not buying your game...I&#x27;m sure if they had the money they would pay. It&#x27;s not like you lose money. You simply didn&#x27;t earn any off that one person.')
