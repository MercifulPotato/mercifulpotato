IME the best programmers by far are those who solve difficult technical problems quickly, whether or not they&#x27;re abrasive. I don&#x27;t like when they&#x27;re assholes, but it doesn&#x27;t matter. They still have more impact.<p>I used to buy into the whole &quot;communication is king&quot; idea but the more I program the more I just don&#x27;t think it works that way. Most good coders I know communicate clearly as a side effect of being good, even if they&#x27;re otherwise completely socially crippled, and they&#x27;re way more productive.')
