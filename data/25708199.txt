I find running to be extremely tedious, but if I&#x27;m stoned, it&#x27;s fine.  Kinda helped that my running partner had a low alcohol tolerance and would slug a beer before our runs.<p>A couple of points to consider.  First, CBD and alcohol are painkillers -- I don&#x27;t like using anti-inflammatories during exercise for fear of overdoing it -- that&#x27;s an issue here.  Second, drugs make you stupid -- don&#x27;t be a stupid in traffic, y&#x27;all.')
