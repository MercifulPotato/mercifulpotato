I pity them for having to deal with a new (perhaps persistent) education dynamic and not be able to enjoy their college party years. On the other hand, we both feel that remote learning is the new normal and we as humans should find new ways to adapt to this bourgeoning learning method.<p>&gt;“I did not focus much on my school work; it was more motivating to just get things done rather than actually obtain any information.”<p>Welcome to crushing your objectives ;)')
