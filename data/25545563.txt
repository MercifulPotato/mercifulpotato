It&#x27;s about as &quot;middle-of-the-country&quot; as it gets. Lines at charger stations are really a California problem as of now. I have never encountered it driving throughout the midwest and I have gone on some long road-trips.<p>As for taking 30 minutes to charge, what people usually do is to make sure their charging stops line up with food&#x2F;bathroom breaks. Realistically, if I drive 10-12 hours in a day, I would stop about 3-4 times for food&#x2F;bathroom breaks, if not more. This lines up perfectly with the range in my Model 3 AWD. In many cases, I have ended up having to get up and go get my car to avoid idle-rates because it finished charging while we were still eating.<p>On these trips, I usually pick a hotel&#x2F;B&amp;B with destination charging so that I can get going in the morning the next day with a full battery.')
