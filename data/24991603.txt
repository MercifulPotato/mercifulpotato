In fact, ridiculously way better.<p>Munchies ritual became part of my trips when I used to smoke, since such an experience in regard of taste can&#x27;t be provided by any michelin star restaurant, no matter how hard they try (although they do provide great experience in other forms). Its unhealthy, its practically impossible to just nibble, rather devour a metric ton and some more.<p>Let&#x27;s stop pretending people do drugs for anything but drug&#x27;s effect on them. Wine is no different, plenty of folks who are alcoholics run purely on wine, albeit on different quantities than small glass of red. Try drinking half a liter of red wine every days for few years though, where it will lead you.')
