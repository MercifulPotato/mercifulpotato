There should be at least one on every floor.<p>But besides that, sometimes the fire just starts in an area that doesn&#x27;t immediately set off the alarm due to whatever quirk of the floor plan and the passageways. If you&#x27;re a heavy sleeper, and alone, in the time the alarm takes to wake you, the fire might have grown from that spot enough to block an exit.')
