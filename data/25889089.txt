Once upon a time, I built many sites with it, and I recommended it to many folks. Despite its flaws (and it always had flaws), it was a great piece of software in its heyday, and it had (and still has?) an amazing community.<p>I&#x27;d still choose it over WordPress any day. But the days when I&#x27;d recommend either of them (or indeed anything in PHP) are long gone. Your best bet now is probably a static site generator such as Hugo. If you insist on staying in database-driven CMS land, at least go with Django or Rails.')
