Are you saying that worker protections are all unnecessary because people freely enter their employment?<p>IMO, just because someone <i>will</i> work for $4 per hour, doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s ethical for the company to pay them that rate, or that it&#x27;s desirable to have a society in a race to the bottom. ideally, the wage would be more in line with the actual value that the worker brings in')
