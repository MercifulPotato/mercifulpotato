Redhat has. In some people&#x27;s minds, that changed the risk assessment significantly; not &quot;well it worked on this RHEL-family OS, so it should work on this other RHEL-family OS&quot;, but &quot;I need to replace my OS - should I use one from the same vendor that just screwed me over, or should I switch to <i>literally anything else</i>?&quot; Honestly, you&#x27;ve got people seriously suggesting <i>Oracle</i> Linux over anything from Redhat; do you have any idea how much trust you have to burn to get people to treat Oracle as a good option!?')
