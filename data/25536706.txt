Blame the phone vendors that don&#x27;t have an adequate support plan for their devices. Or the carriers that sell unsustainable phones with their plans.<p>But Let&#x27;s Encrypt is really not the one to blame here. They aren&#x27;t responsible for outdated phones, they aren&#x27;t responsible for expiring roots and they actually found a solution for these phones (as described in the article).')
