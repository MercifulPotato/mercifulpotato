Everything can be solved with ints too&quot;, which is true, but also a lot of work and a poor trade-off. Similar arguments exist for many language features.<p>So it&#x27;s a question of trade-offs: how much time will this save people? Will it reduce faults? And what are the costs of adding this? And how do they balance?')
