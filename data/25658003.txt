Unmetered bandwidth is cheap if you look beyond the cloud providers and the majority of calls can be established directly (in fact WhatsApp does use UPnP to map ports presumably for direct connections) so you&#x27;d only ever use that bandwidth for texts&#x2F;transient media uploads and the small percentage of calls that can&#x27;t be established directly and need to be proxied through. WhatsApp doesn&#x27;t store media long-term so storage requirements are also small.')
