I still voted for him because I felt he aligned with the policies I wanted to move towards.<p>You mean like actively refusing and convincing ~half the country NOT to wear masks? Even though the <i>worst case scenario</i> is.. you are wearing the mask and it doesn&#x27;t help?<p>Trump <i>himself</i> said he thinks wearing a mask looks weak.  And that&#x27;s why he didn&#x27;t want to do it.<p>So, instead of being a LEADER and leading by example- wearing a mask.  He made it into a political issue because he thinks people looks weak doing it.  And has no doubt cost peoples lives by CONVINCING others not to wear masks.  To this day (in his recent rallies) it&#x27;s the same damn thing.<p>I mean, I can go on and on about the CHARACTER of Trump, but let&#x27;s leave it at one.<p>You sound like someone who is like &quot;eh I like his policies so he can act however the hell he wants and that&#x27;s OK&quot;.<p>THAT is what you and I can never agree on.')
