So did juvenile violence rates, drug taking and alcoholism. And teenage pregnancies went down too. All the while divorces went up. Stop demonizing kids of single parents and for that matter Americans.<p>Also,  American domestic violence rates went down. While the reporting of it went up as women can get actual help nowdays, so there is a point in doing it. These would not even count as crimes in many of &quot;harmonious&quot; families with taboo around divorce.<p>Also, in Americans crime statistics,  murders are higher relative to other crimes, because of prevalence of guns. America is not perfect,  but it&#x27;s youth is way better then you make them be due to your strong bias against kids who had divorced parents.')
