It was cold weather with some snow on the shoulders, but the actual road surfaces had no snow.  I was mainly using just the cruise control, and no auto-steer.  Even with just cruise, the car gets &quot;spooked&quot; from time to time and will suddenly jerk to a slower speed for absolutely no reason, even during the day and with no precipitation.  At one point it did this several times within the span of 10 minutes, which was such an unpleasant experience that it made me want to stop using cruise entirely.  Besides being jarring for the people in the car, it makes me worry that anyone tailgating will rear end me.<p>Besides that, the rain&#x2F;sleet that was falling from time to time apparently blocked the camera, so at one point the car wouldn&#x27;t even let me use cruise any more.<p>The car is tons of fun to drive and I don&#x27;t regret the purchase at all.  But I really don&#x27;t like the overpromising on full self-driving.<p>EDIT: bmcahren pointed out to me that the new FSD beta software merges images from multiple angles, which my software does not do.  I don&#x27;t know much about that, but it sounds like the kind of change that could lead to a noticeably better result than what I experienced.')
