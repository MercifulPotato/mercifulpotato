The tech details in <i>Fire</i> are more fantastical since they involve superluminal communications&#x2F;travel and the book centers around the mechanism that makes that possible. I like <i>Fire</i> more because I like the pacing and the xenos better (space operas are fun) but the tech and its implications are far better in <i>Deepness</i>. I like the depiction of computing&#x2F;programming in both and both have the history of technology as a major theme, which is one of my favorite topics.')
