At least then we&#x27;d be able to ask for a 4-day week and promise the same productivity.<p>I know I&#x27;ve spent half a day messing around before and then smashed out a piece of work in a few hours and still had the impression of being productive. Simply because the majority of employees aren&#x27;t as productive as me. Being a very productive and capable developer will open lots of opportunities but some of us don&#x27;t want to climb the ladder. I just want a comfortable job and be good at it.<p>I&#x27;d never take a pay cut though. If you kept the same productivity at a lower pay then you&#x27;re effectively saying they overpaid you before. 20% less pay is 20% less work in my eyes.')
