There will be a driver inside anyway. And there is a huge difference between &quot;no L5, you have to keep an eye of the road every 10 seconds all the time&quot;, and &quot;drives itself, but once every 2 hours, or in extreme weather conditions safely warns you and makes you take over and force you to drive yourself&quot;. This could very well be a great usecase, even if it won&#x27;t drive itself for those 1% of cases.')
