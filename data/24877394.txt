What kind of socialism is this, anyway? How is this structure even valid, if not for historical precedent?<p>Nothing against socialism or even my point, really. Just very odd to see how blatantly discriminatory and contradictory this seems to have a private university performing a necessary public service, with free land from the state. Not that the work isn’t well done, or anything. Just bears strict scrutiny.')
