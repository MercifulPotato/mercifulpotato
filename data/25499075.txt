Sometimes, these stretches can be very short (like 1m), e.g. at intersections. I typically only mark those as lit if there&#x27;s a streetlamp directly on it - so if there&#x27;s not, I&#x27;ll mark it as unlit even though nearby streetlamps do shine on it.<p>Is that the right thing to do?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;westnordost&#x2F;StreetComplete" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;westnordost&#x2F;StreetComplete</a>')
