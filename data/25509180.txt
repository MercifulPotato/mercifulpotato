It was just the cost of scaling being expensive; comparatively speaking when people say Rails not able to scale. And for most if not <i>all</i> <i>SaaS</i> that should never be much of a problem. Because you are getting revenue per user, and generally speaking the cost percentage of user &#x2F; app &#x2F; server resources is so small, that is a rounding error in grand scheme of things.<p>What doesn&#x27;t work quite as well is when the app is operating a freemium &#x2F; ad based model. Where a large volume of traffic are required <i>before</i> you start generating revenue.')
