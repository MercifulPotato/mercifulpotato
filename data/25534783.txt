More competitive foundries are always better.<p>GloFo isn&#x27;t really interested in building anything super competitive moving forward either - they announced they weren&#x27;t going to pursue 7nm.<p>I think Intel&#x27;s still pretty dead set of getting back into the foundry game, doing so is kind of necessary for defense contracts right?<p>Maybe we&#x27;ll see On Semi get in the game.
