Not that such investment shouldn&#x27;t take place, but it has nothing to do with free trade, and I would much prefer a large carbon tax with minimal bureaucratic overhead than the centralized EU as-is allocating capital to ventures that the bureaucrats have decided are worthwhile. It&#x27;s  the globalist, big government and centrally planned solution to climate change.<p>Also two percent is a stupefyingly large amount if it were simply about effectively administering a FTA (and it isn&#x27;t as per the above). NAFTA on the other hand requires roughly 0 percent, which is markedly better. Given the precedent of low overhead FTAs, I don&#x27;t accept the premise of the EU.')
