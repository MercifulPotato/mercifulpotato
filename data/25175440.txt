That <i>some</i> people have debt may be, but the question there is, who these people are and whether their educations are performing for them, not simply that the debt exists.<p>Focusing on the debt is a red herring that conveniently rewards elites and others who are doing just fine. Focusing on whether universities are actually doing what they claim on the box is the real issue -- again conveniently elided by a blanket debt forgiveness program.')
