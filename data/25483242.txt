That is money they didn&#x27;t have before that they now have, that they can then spend on goods and services correct?<p>Because if sold quickly, it will crash the price of shares. So instead of a share being worth $3000 like it is now, it could cause a short term event where the people that need cash the most would only be able to get $100 for a share, which will get swooped by people who have disposable income to blow on investments.<p>It would just re-consolidate the wealth in the hands of wealthy people.<p>Sure, that&#x27;s probably somewhat better than having it in the hands of 1 person, e.g Bezos, but is it better than other alternatives? Like just giving people stimulus checks in cash?')
