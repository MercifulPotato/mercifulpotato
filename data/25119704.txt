Why are you lying. They made it sound like a potential end of the world&#x2F;civilization. It&#x27;s why everyone remembers Y2K. If they reported it benignly like you claimed, we wouldn&#x27;t remember Y2K. We wouldn&#x27;t be talking about it 20 years later. The only reason anyone remembers Y2K was because the media hyped it.')
