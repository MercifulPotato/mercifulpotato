I believe they were phased out due to the desire to enforce age limits for smoking more strictly, not because of theft.<p>My general impression is that the U.S. used to have more vending machines in general ~30-40 years ago. I remember soda machines being outside of every grocery store, but I don&#x27;t see that anymore. Newspaper vending machines also used to be common. But I don&#x27;t have any data to back that up.')
