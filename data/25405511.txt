It involves exactly the same materials (the fiber) and labor (one bucket-truck visit to each pole) save for a $5 bracket.<p>The only thing you save is an extra pole attachment fee.  But that&#x27;s a monthly running cost, not an upfront construction cost.  Attachments are ~$1&#x2F;pole&#x2F;month in the 30 states with regulated pole attachment rates and in the same ballpark for most (though not all) jurisdictions in the other 20.  Dunno how you got from that to $10k construction cost savings.<p>Sounds like you got quoted some fiber contractor&#x27;s &quot;I get to buy a new car&quot; price.  ISPs buy their own bucket trucks and hire linemen.<p>Even so, $250&#x2F;home setup cost for fiber is a bargain.  CenturyLink charges $200 setup for crappy 10mbit copper DSL and people still buy it.')
