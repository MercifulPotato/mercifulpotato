You cannot assert copyright over a human brain because you cannot copy a human brain; and insamuch that brain is capable of copying other works, that&#x27;s already covered by standard copyright law. It would be a good plot for a 2000s-retro-futuristic cyberpunk book (P2Ppunk?) but I suspect the Supreme Court would rule that the 14th Amendment overrides copyright interest in human brains were that to become a problem.<p>(If you wanted a 2010s-retro-futuristic cyberpunk sequel book you&#x27;d have some far-right militia group arguing for bringing back slavery to protect author&#x27;s rights or something. Call it Twitterpunk.)')
