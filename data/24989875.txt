I think one reason this comes across as an &quot;issue&quot; is that a majority of the public believes that &quot;election day&quot;, the event, or holiday, or whatever you want to call it, is the day on which a new president is elected.<p>This narrative is pushed by tradition, news media, and the politicians themselves (if it&#x27;s in their interest). I think we need to separate this narrative in two separate days; one day is Voting Day, the day on which everyone who wants to participate in voting must have their ballot mailed or submitted, and Election Day, which should be a month later, after all votes are counted, where the official results are published, and we accept a new president.<p>This is good for the American people, in that it&#x27;s reliable and clearly defined, good for the media, because now they can have a month long headline where they hem and haw and speculate about who will win, and good for the politicians, in that there&#x27;s time for a smooth transition.')
