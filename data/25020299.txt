Item(by='alkonaut', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604788619, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25019957, text='&gt; All voting in multi-cultural states is ultimately demographic<p>I think this is a gross oversimplification (and demonstrably false if you look at some other countries), but OK, for the sake of argument let&#x27;s say that one party represents one core demographic. Then one of these is true: 1) their core demographic is a majority or 2) they can attract enough share from other demographics without alienating their core demographic. or 3) they are, and should be a minority party.<p>I think a big part of the problem is that the US is a big and diverse place politically, so having parties with a huge national identity like the donkey and elephant is always problematic at the edges. R&#x27;s simply have to attract more minority voters, more women voters, more young voters etc.<p>&gt;  I expect them to fade away over time in a similar manner. The US can no longer support an effectively White-only national party.<p>Well they will adapt <i>or</i> fade away. That of course goes for any political party, anywhere. A party can&#x27;t please everyone. But it also can&#x27;t perfectly please only a tiny core base. They need to broaden their support. But are they capable of that? It&#x27;s like they think that &quot;Attract voters from demographic X&quot; means &quot;Tell people in demographic X how good Republican policy is&quot;. \nWhat it should mean is actually change policy to attract that demographic.<p>Now: this state discussion misses a big point with the US political climate and it&#x27;s that the divide isn&#x27;t really between states, nor mostly between demographics like age or ethnicity, but between city and rural. I honestly don&#x27;t quite understand why that divide is so pronounced.')
