Its a great performer for sure, but its locked to a proprietary and closed ecosystem controlled by a single entity.<p>Its a new direction for Apple in their laptop architecture, and a solid first step, but the raw performance is not up to the fastest from AMD and Intel, and it lacks the ability to upgrade any of its components.  I get it, its a laptop, but if you want to talk about performance lets put it out there: its a fast laptop.<p>People already in the Apple ecosystem will love M1, but it lacks a compelling reason to switch to Apple.  Apple already made the best laptops, the M1 keeps that crown.  People that were satisfied buying Windows laptops and Chromebooks will continue to do so because the criteria they used when making a buying decision involved other factors than &quot;I want the best&quot;.<p>I expect SoC designs to fracture the CPU market in the coming years and kill AMD and Intel, but unless M1 opens up to other designers and companies its a tangent in the great CPU race.')
