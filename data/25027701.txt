I didn&#x27;t want to do anything particularly complex: expose services on 4 different ports, automatic Let&#x27;s Encrypt certificates, strip a prefix for one of the services, enable the Traefik dashboard, and a few other bits and bobs.<p>For context, I&#x27;ve configured nginx (and Apache before it) a few times over the years, and have an in-depth understanding of networking and HTTP. Still, I struggled to get things working - it was like whack-a-mole; I&#x27;d get something working, but something else would stop working! As someone else has noted, it&#x27;s difficult to Google docs&#x2F;samples, because Traefik 1.x is a thing, and is configured differently.<p>I was configuring it in my Docker Compose file, and it&#x27;s quite confusing - some stuff is added in the command line for the entrypoint, while other stuff is as labels. At some point I also realised that you can&#x27;t <i>quite</i> configure quite everything in this way - some stuff, like TLS config, can only be done in files.<p>The syntax for config in Compose files is pretty ugly too, and it&#x27;s not always obvious - middleware config for example.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if I might have made things easier for myself if I&#x27;d put all the config in YAML&#x2F;TOML files instead, but I think the config for every other container was in the compose file, so it seemed more natural to do the same for Traefik. Anyway, next time I think I&#x27;ll try config files, or maybe try Haproxy instead.')
