Try evaluating (+ 1 &quot;1&quot;) in Clojure as well as Clojurescript.<p>One is weak...it doesn&#x27;t throw an error, might throw a warning because the compiler can plainly see that it is wrong, but you&#x27;ll get no warnings when it is out of scope or evaluated at runtime.<p>The other is strongly typed, because it will actually throw an error, knowing that adding a string and a number is nonsense. While it would be better if this was caught at compile time, catching it at runtime is waaaaay better than not catching it at all.<p>The languages are actually different languages, because their type semantics are different. And you might want to figure such things out, as well as the far reaching implications, before you go around telling people they&#x27;re wrong on the internet about a language that is laying in the mud like a crocodile, waiting for the perfect time to bite you in the ass.')
