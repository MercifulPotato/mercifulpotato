The OCSP endpoint is part of the certificate. If I had to guess, I would say that they just relied on certificate validation features of the library they are using, not necessarily aware of all of the consequences.<p>Checking OCSP is a standard feature of many SSL libraries.<p>Doing what you suggest is an implementation outside of what standard libraries would provide and was probably completely out of scope until now when stuff started burning.<p>Don&#x27;t call relying on standard features of an underlying library &quot;batshit implementation&quot;.
