Item(by='coldtea', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609976168, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25663077, text='&gt;<i>But free will doesn&#x27;t fall in the realm of &quot;things to research&quot;. It&#x27;s an escape mechanism devised by religious people wanting a perfect mechanistic universe designed by God with an escape hatch from it in the form of &quot;free will&quot; that somehow enables us to sin. Nothing more, nothing less.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think so. If anything it&#x27;s the opposite: free will is a direct experience we all have (whether true or illusionary).<p>The idea of no free will, on the other hand, is pure rationality. It&#x27;s us ignoring what we empirically experience, in favor of the theories we have devised to explain the world.<p>So, it&#x27;s the latter (no-free-will) that is more religious in nature, to the extend that is ideological and not empirical in origin. At best it&#x27;s based on a distillation of isolated empirical observations into general laws.<p>But while any empirical observation is enough in itself to support its own existence (if I feel X, I feel X - there&#x27;s no two ways about it. X might or might not exist, and I might have felt it because I took drugs or whatever, but there&#x27;s no denying that I felt X), any general law cannot be proved logically by any number of empirical observations (see e.g. Russel, re: the problem of induction). Heck, it can&#x27;t even be supported, except in an uncertain degree (what if you see 1 million white swans and the 1.000.001 is a black one?).<p>&gt;<i>If you are willing to claim &quot;but the universe isn&#x27;t even causal&quot; then you don&#x27;t even need free will anymore since the sole intent for it was to claim independence from causality.</i><p>Well, I&#x27;m not bound by some rational neat ordering of things , where the universe follows our rational bias, things go by the simplest explanation, and so on (Occam&#x27;s razor is just a heuristic, not a law of nature).<p>I&#x27;m not saying free will necessarily exists. But if it existed, it could exist whether we &quot;only need it to claim independence from causality&quot; or not. Casuality for example could not exist AND free will could be a thing. The same way two physical objects can XOR exist, not the same way two inter-connected exclusive theories do. Or there could be zero, or 10 different mechanisms alonside free will that are all independent from casuality in different ways.<p>&gt;<i>- Nor can anyone claim that they &quot;feel&quot; free will - that is such a blatant non-truth.</i><p>Well, we do. Whether correct with the &quot;world as such&quot; or not, it&#x27;s only an ideological rational bias that says otherwise, not felt experience.<p>&gt;<i>- Nor you can &quot;prove&quot; free will by raising your hand. You can at most just point to the fact that you raised your hand. Through your existence, reasoning, internal and environmental pressures.</i><p>Well, the same is true for causuality. It&#x27;s not something provable.<p>Which is why Wittgenstein once quoted &quot;causality is a superstition&quot;.')
