How should I go about it?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='tl;dr - s&#x2F;w product dev shop, few months in business, looking for benchmarks&#x2F;advice.<p>I&#x27;m an experienced engineer and product&#x2F;eng leader. Earlier this year I started a software dev shop, after having been in engineering and product IC and leadership roles for over a decade. I mostly worked at early stage startups, so my consultancy focuses on helping non-tech founders build MVPs. I work with talented freelancers to do a lot of the dev heavy lifting and focus more on product&#x2F;technical review&#x2F;problem solving and play the role of the lead who gets it done well. I also focus a lot on finding new business.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with 4 clients so far but given that I work with founders&#x2F;early stage cos, they haven&#x27;t been particularly cash rich projects. Biggest one was 15K spread over 2 months. My margin has roughly been 40-50% on each project so far.<p>Those of you who&#x27;ve been in this business for 2+ years now, I&#x27;m curious how it&#x27;s worked for you and what advice you would have for yourself starting out or for me. My goal is to build a healthy income (200k+) for myself. I&#x27;m not looking to build a $multi-million consulting practice but it&#x27;d be great to get to a million or high six-figures in billings.<p>How did you grow from a few one-off clients to a healthy pipeline of new business? How does one outgrow this phase where business only comes from your network?<p>How long did it take you to cross $1M in billings&#x2F;yr?<p>What&#x27;s the typical client you work with? early stage? mid-sized&#x2F;large companies? founders? are you focused on a niche?<p>I understand what I&#x27;m offering is a commodity service but I try to focus on my USP of <i>bay-area based strong technical leader&#x2F;fmr founder who you can trust with owning product development</i>. This doesn&#x27;t scale though - I can&#x27;t be doing 8 projects. The easier path to the money I want to make would be to just freelance at a high rate but I am looking to grow this as a business, not as a solo practice.<p>Can you share your learnings?')
