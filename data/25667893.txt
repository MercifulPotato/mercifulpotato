They made my number searchable and notified people who have me in their Google contact list even though I didn&#x27;t grant Telegram access to my contact list (before the time when Android would enforce this with permissions) and didn&#x27;t allow them to use my number for anything.<p>Then it turned out that they have a setting where one can opt out, but what good is that if you already were opted in automatically.<p>In &quot;Last Seen &amp; Online&quot; I had a deleted account in the exceptions of those who can always see my status, even though I never added one.<p>Telegram may be better than WhatsApp, but it is far from fantastic.')
