All there is, is our satellite and terrestrial broadcasts. These are not intended to reach far beyond the earth and are encoded in a quite arbitrary way that is designed for easy implementation, not reverse-engineering. Interference and interstellar distances will likely distort them beyond recognition, unless you already know what you are looking for. There were some attempts at intentional broadcasting, but it&#x27;s really not the main avenue of research (look for Active SETI). We are mostly <i>listening</i> at this point.<p>We are like an Uncontacted Tribe with technology. Even if we managed to decode a signal (not really feasible as many encoding schemes utilize quite arbitrary formulas and mapping tables), we would still not understand the language. Humans are pretty bad at figuring out languages without some sort of rosetta stone. Even if we understood their language, we might not be able to comprehend it, or comprehend it in fallacious ways, because of missing context. To compare, do our dramas, thrillers, TV shows, horror movies, porn (unfortunately often including children), and Youtube videos really portray an accurate picture of Human life and culture? We are ourselves quite bad at understanding other human cultures, past and present, and often rely on stereotypes...')
