One thing I&#x27;ve noticed about IntelliJ though (and any other IDE), is that eventually I manage to get the thing configured into some inconsistent state that I can&#x27;t figure out how to get out of and I have to restart everything from scratch before I can get things working again - up to and including deleting the entire IDE and reinstalling it.
