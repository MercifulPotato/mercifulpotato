The practical solution is tiered backup of the stuff you really care about + some local fault tolerance for stuff you don&#x27;t care about as much.<p>What I wanted to point out is that of course backing up everything is the solution per the parent comment, but the reality is that costs for punting and mindlessly backing up say 10 TB of data properly are still fairly high. So you pick and choose the important stuff and do the best you can for the rest.')
