Most of my expertise is in processing large datasets: extracting features, ingesting data, engineering pipelines, scraping sources, training and debugging machine learning models and deploying various results via api endpoints. I often join startups at an early stage when they have a bunch of csv&#x27;s lying around, develop and deploy their first model and then automate all the steps so that iterating on future models becomes very simple. I am a very diligent coder, a big fan of QA&#x27;ing, CI&#x2F;CD and unit testing - I am often the first engineer to bring such practices to the team.<p>I currently work as a backend developer at a blockchain company where I deploy gRPC endpoints using Kubernetes. A small example of the kind of work that I do at the moment is here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;afiodorov&#x2F;bitcoin_ancestries" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;afiodorov&#x2F;bitcoin_ancestries</a>.<p>You can follow my (nerdy) blog to get a sense of my personality: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;afiodorov.github.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;afiodorov.github.io&#x2F;</a>')
