This would reduce function of those organs, and that reduction may not impact people until they are older. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s too soon to declare it for covid in any individual case. Vaccines work differently, if they caused such scarring for example, it would be accompanied by a bunch of other symptoms which would have been spotted and tested. As a result you can&#x27;t point to something like I have for covid and make the same argument. Yet, we do understand the vaccine protects us from covid, so we can make an argument about it being a net positive overall.')
