It is one of the greatest misconceptions about GC languages that you shouldn&#x27;t worry about allocations at all. For me, GC mostly means the correctness guarantees which come with it and the convenience, that I don&#x27;t have to track every single allocation and mange it manually. However, it still means that I should be aware of all the larger allocations and avoid them as in any other language, if I am looking for performance. Not reusing allocated memory where reasonable is detrimental to the performance in any language. \nAnd of course, the choice of the right GC approach can also help with applications like games. Lispworks even provided a Lisp environment for a Nasa probe, the GC had real-time capabilities.')
