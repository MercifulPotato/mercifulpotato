You&#x27;re, quite literally, one command away from being on the inside: &quot;M-x ielm&quot;<p>&gt; I have no idea what point you&#x27;re trying to make here. By opening with what I&#x27;m sure is an oh-so-witty commit like this you signal that you aren&#x27;t going to engage honestly in this debate.<p>I don&#x27;t think that he was trying to make a &#x27;witty&#x27; or snarky comment, just pointing out that anyone who wants to can be &#x27;inside&#x27; Emacs development simply by firing up Emacs and running ielm (the interactive Emacs Lisp mode).  It&#x27;s an Emacs REPL: one has exactly as much power in it as anyone on the dev team.  If you want to, you can even recompile the C bits â€¦<p>&gt; I categorically reject the idea that polished software is mutually exclusive of free software.<p>FWIW, I agree. I think that the default Emacs <i>look</i> could be a lot better.')
