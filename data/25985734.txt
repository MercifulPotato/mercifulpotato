If you&#x27;re running a fund like this, purposely making materially false statements like this would be akin to jumping out of a plane without a parachute and somehow hoping for the best, while 5M angry redditors are purposely trying to make sure you crash into the hardest thing possible. This position of &quot;well maybe he&#x27;s lying, you can&#x27;t definitively prove he&#x27;s not!&quot; position is so bonkers that it&#x27;s closer to a conspiracy theory than an actual opinion.<p>&gt; One might also assume that Melvin would not be dumb enough to short over 100% of GME stock.<p>This has been discussed in depth elsewhere. You&#x27;re understanding of this concept is fundamentally flawed. Frankly, even if it wasn&#x27;t, you&#x27;re suggesting that a <i>single firm</i> shorted more than 100%? Or that both Melvin Capital and Citron <i>both</i> shorted more than 100%, and that somehow added up (with your misunderstanding) to 140%?')
