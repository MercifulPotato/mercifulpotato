I know, Snapshot is a massive Google customer, but that means that they need to be rather careful.<p>Facebook and Twitter couldn&#x27;t exist on AWS, unless Amazon chooses to enforce their rules very selectively. There is a ton of hate speech on Facebook, which is not censored, moderated and which clearly violate all sort of rule. Much of it is due to the language of the users not necessarily being English, or another major language. However, regardless of the language, the content can still easily be in violation of an AWS terms of service (and often Facebooks own).<p>If Facebook had been an AWS, Azure or GCP customer, they would have been shutdown long ago... Well they wouldn&#x27;t, because the rules wouldn&#x27;t really apply to them. I honestly don&#x27;t care about Parler, Amazon has every right to shut of their service, they decide what customers they want on their platform.
