Item(by='kergonath', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610851359, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25803878, text='This bit:<p>&gt;&gt; f(x) is O(g(x)) iff there exists a positive number M and an x_0 such that for all x &gt; x_0, |f(x)| &lt;= Mg(x).<p>is fairly similar to the so-called epsilon-delta definition of limits of functions. This way of reasoning is quite common. I know I bumped into it quite a lot: I learnt it in high school, even though I really understood it a couple of years later (I did a MSc in Physics). So the explanation above makes sense even if I never saw this exact formulation. Now I appreciate that not everyone is a Physics graduate, but Iâ€™d expect this to be understandable for people with degrees in applied Maths, Physics, or some related engineering discipline.')
