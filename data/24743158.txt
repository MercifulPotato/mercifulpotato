And far less epicycle-ly than orbitals.  And easier to avoid error and artifact (&quot;layer after layer&quot;, &quot;electron pairs&quot;, etc).  Chemistry education content is notable for leaving both students and teachers steeped in misconceptions.<p>Though how&#x2F;whether it could be used to teach orgo is an open question.  I&#x27;ve only seen a couple of isolated attempts.  Needing new content, and non-trivial software, with isolated professors, has made progress unlikely, even if possible.<p>I&#x27;ve an barely-started lockdown project, using ASE&#x2F;GPAW[1] to precompute trajectories and densities, for an AR browser interactive - playfully tugging on atoms blobbing as small molecules, <i>realistically</i>.<p>Imagine we taught elephants the way we teach atoms.  Here&#x27;s an early medieval drawing that looks... yikes (they&#x27;re actually not that bad, so the analogy isn&#x27;t great).  Here&#x27;s a table model. And a hose model.  And an orbiting cell model that has everyone imagining breakdancing jellyfish.  But nothing with the slightest resemblance to an elephant photo or toy.  Let alone a realistic interactive.<p>If anyone knows of efforts to do better, I&#x27;d appreciate hearing of them - thanks!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.fysik.dtu.dk&#x2F;ase&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.fysik.dtu.dk&#x2F;ase&#x2F;</a> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.fysik.dtu.dk&#x2F;gpaw&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.fysik.dtu.dk&#x2F;gpaw&#x2F;</a>')
