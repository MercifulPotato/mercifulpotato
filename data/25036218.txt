The maintainer doesn&#x27;t need to document the package in order to solve their own problem (at least, not to the same level.) Should that be chargeable too? In which case the project will likely never get off the ground, and there&#x27;ll be no money coming in for other change requests either.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I agree in principle. There are just too many grey areas to make a blanket rule.<p>But what this is leading me to, is that if we go down this path, it just becomes another business model - where you build some things, and give them away, because you need to do so to have a product. And then charge for others. Nothing wrong with that at all, but it isn&#x27;t as simple as the article makes out.')
