It was generated by a fairly involved handwritten Python pipeline that I hacked together while learning Pandas. The dataset became far more popular than I expected, and now I&#x27;m anxious about possible bugs.<p>I&#x27;d like to solicit your advice on building out a decent test suite. How would you go about validating data? Are there any books on best practices that you&#x27;d recommend?')
