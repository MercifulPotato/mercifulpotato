Linkedin is free to stop providing that data or move it behind a login wall, they just don&#x27;t want to because it helps them with SEO. Contrast that with these plugins that are absolutely accessing data behind the user&#x27;s login.<p>Also with regards to the antitrust assertions you make, Facebook is absolutely not required to share their data with anyone. People give their data to FB, FB can do what they want with it (as long as it&#x27;s within the ToS). Facebook can&#x27;t stop me from also giving my data to someone else outside the platform, but they do not have to facilitate that process in any way.')
