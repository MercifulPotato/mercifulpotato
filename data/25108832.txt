Effective advertising targets people who are likely to want the product or service already. The idea that ads can change people&#x27;s minds to get them to buy something they don&#x27;t want is so wrong. You would waste so much money trying to change peoples&#x27; minds. This isn&#x27;t like Inception. In all my (and people I&#x27;ve read and worked with) experience, you have a chance at profitable ROI when you run ads targeting people likely to want what you&#x27;re already selling, and just try to make them consider your product or service. You&#x27;d be guaranteeing negative ROI trying to change minds.')
