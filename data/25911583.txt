Either the notes(frequencies) are not being filtered, causing all sorts of harmonic noise, especially when added together (most likely), or (probably and) the individual tones are not being normalized before being added together, and its clipping.  edit:  it&#x27;s also possible the tones are looped over a short period and there are discontinuities between the loops (filtering will also fix if this is the case)<p>Awesome concept though, I really love to see stuff like this, and it&#x27;s great to experiment with and find new (to me) &quot;synergies&quot; between notes&#x2F;chords.')
