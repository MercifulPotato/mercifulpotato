The non-expert (as targeted by this article) is much more likely to read positive articles about Telegram than negative ones. They are also more likely to hear about Telegram over Signal so it will be unsurprising if Telegram grows faster than Signal imo. I believe that Signal is advertised primarily by word of mouth.')
