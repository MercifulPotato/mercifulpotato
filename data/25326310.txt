As far as I understand, there are plenty of suckers in the game, but they are mostly backing and not laying.<p>No one is laying at odds which would leave them out of pocket in the long run. I could lay a specific outcome at favorable odds for that outcome alone, but laying makes sense only if you can lay the right amount of money for _all_ outcomes.<p>This is the job of a traditional bookmaker. He sets and updates his odds such that he can match exactly the right amount of money for each outcome such that he makes a profit no matter the outcome.<p>Given that I have the exact odds for the game, I would like to understand how this balancing is done on a Betfair exchange game in an efficient way.')
