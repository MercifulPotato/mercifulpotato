The only players with similar [amount delivered] * [hype] values are peyton manning and tim duncan, but lebron&#x27;s is way bigger.<p>Also worth mentioning in his accolades: brought a championship to his hometown, has never had any PR disasters (except for &quot;the decision&quot;), has many charities (scholarships, gives out bikes, etc), and elevated his friends and family to make them successful as well.  He&#x27;s basically done everything right.<p>And I say this as a long time celtics fan and lebron hater.')
