I am not sure what you mean by &quot;legal&quot; cap, if you want to work more or less hours you can. Other similar countries do not employ slave labour. And education is very cheap in the US (cheaper than most countries in Europe) if you go to a state college...at private universities, the fees in Germany are still very expensive (the US has better colleges, so private colleges in the US are always going to be higher than everywhere else)...you aren&#x27;t comparing like to like.<p>And presumably, you don&#x27;t come from Germany because all the reasons why it is bad are reasons that wouldn&#x27;t occur to most people who don&#x27;t live in that system: unions that are essentially non-functional&#x2F;run by companies, staggeringly low levels of consumption relative to income (Germany runs a trade surplus worth 10% of GDP, which is all funded by savings...this is as high as China when China was at peak inequality), the average wealth of German citizens is equal to Greece...an economy that isn&#x27;t functioning and doesn&#x27;t have the large number of billionaires that Germany has (who largely got rich in the 30s), non-existent levels of competition, non-existent levels of innovation, closed banking system that pays nothing to savers and funnels free money to bankers&#x2F;large corporations who have (historically) lost it all in short order, sometimes shockingly low wages (I believe this has changed but German apprentince wages were sometimes 2 or 3 euros&#x2F;hour). Again though, read about German history (or even Northern European countries, generally bar the UK)...the economic system was designed by large corporations, that is who it is for. It isn&#x27;t for consumers (or google &quot;IMF Germany report&quot;...if you don&#x27;t believe me).')
