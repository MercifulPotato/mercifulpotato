I do the same (at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;notes.stavros.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;notes.stavros.io&#x2F;</a>, though I have much fewer notes).<p>Nowadays, with all the SEO going on, Google is useless for showing you things like the author&#x27;s site. To combat that, I was thinking of making an open community of notes, sort of a Wikipedia&#x2F;WikiHow where every user gets their personal site and publishes notes, but with search being global. You could go on the site, search for, say, &quot;fpv airplanes&quot; and find people&#x27;s notes on the topic.<p>It probably wouldn&#x27;t have the high-level overview of Wikipedia, but it would instead be a sort of &quot;StackOverflow for knowledge&quot;, where you could find solutions to minor annoyances like this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;notes.stavros.io&#x2F;software&#x2F;monero-gui-syncing-stuck-with-ledger&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;notes.stavros.io&#x2F;software&#x2F;monero-gui-syncing-stuck-w...</a><p>Instead of going through the effort of writing a whole new UI, I was thinking of making the server be a synchronization backend for Joplin [0] instead, and publishing the notes every time there&#x27;s a change.<p>What does everyone think? Would you be interested in participating in an early alpha? Any other feedback?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joplinapp.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joplinapp.org&#x2F;</a>')
