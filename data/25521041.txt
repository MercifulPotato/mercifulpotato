They&#x27;re not even that expensive - built in systems can be had for a few tens of thousands of dollars, or non-certified iPad based systems for a few hundred.<p>That crash was likely due to disorientation in dense fog with an experienced, IFR rated pilot but who didn&#x27;t experience much fog in LA. A radar altimeter would have been unlikely to help.')
