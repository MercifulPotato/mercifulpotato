German might be different, but in Finnish words might sometimes have a slightly different meaning if the words are written separately (with a space) or as a compound. (Often that other meaning is rarely used, and there would almost never be any actual potential for confusion, but technically there may still be a difference.)<p>Some of the compounds may be written as compounds because that&#x27;s just how you&#x27;re supposed to write them, but sometimes there might be some kind of actual semantics behind it.<p>Could there be something similar going on in German, or is it really that German-speakers just concatenate things that English-speakers would write separately?')
