Walmart&#x27;s &quot;own brand&quot; stainless steel pans that start at under $10 work fine. The pans it doesn&#x27;t work with are actually rare&#x2F;expensive (pure aluminum&#x2F;pure copper, and certain high-end stainless steel that are now largely discontinued).<p>People repeat this special pan thing often (multiple times in this thread) but I don&#x27;t know where this idea came from. The most common&#x2F;popular pans for the last fifty years work with induction, and cheap ones are MORE likely to work.')
