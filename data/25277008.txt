Item(by='jerf', descendants=None, kids=[25277805, 25277683], score=None, time=1606921920, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25253498, text='I think the triangle notation is actually terrible; it breaks the = symbol. A fully-filled-in triangle with all three components is essentially an equation, or a set of equations, and I can&#x27;t think of any other (common) situation in which we hide the equality symbol like that. Having only two of them filled out makes me feel like it&#x27;s a math problem where we&#x27;re being asked to fill out the rest of the equation, not an operator.<p>I also don&#x27;t like that this is far from the only set of operations that might fit into a triangle of some sort. In fact I&#x27;ve seen math problems from school using it for + and - already. I haven&#x27;t seen it for * and &#x2F; but it&#x27;s easy to imagine. It&#x27;s possible this notation is already ruined for teaching students by the common core stuff already in use. And the mere fact that the operators can be arranged in a triangle is not sufficiently unique to give the triangle to this particular set of them.<p>One could argue that the &quot;=&quot; symbol could use a rethink, but I would consider this not a terribly good place to begin that argument just because one set of operators happens to have this particular relationship.<p>Putting up and down arrows under exponents&#x2F;roots is also not that great; it looks fine when you have one letter above the arrow but it&#x27;s not going to scale well. I&#x27;d happily argue that standard exponentiation doesn&#x27;t scale particularly well either once the exponents start getting complicated, but putting another symbol below it doesn&#x27;t help. Putting them as inline operators flows better, but may hide the lede too much, so to speak; while the exponentiation operator we use today may have some issues, at least it&#x27;s clearly visible.<p>Really, the problem isn&#x27;t the three of exponents, roots, and log, the problem is just log. The whole &quot;three letter operator&quot; thing seems to have a lot of problems; see also the trig functions and their bizarre standards for sticking powers on them (where -1 is supermagical). That said, there probably isn&#x27;t a problem large enough to be solvable here because the solution isn&#x27;t going to be better enough to overcome inertia.')
