It does. But it is literally no difference in terms of what happened during the CA scandal, so all the same rules apply here. If you are ok with this group of researches and think they did nothing wrong, and that FB should have let them have the data, then the CA situation was a perfect happy road scenario for you. Because in that case, CA just got that data, and FB didn&#x27;t stop them. Win-win, right?<p>Also, regardless of how valid this take is, FB was ordered by FTC to prevent third party sharing of friend data like that from happening. So FB&#x27;s hands are kinda tied on this one.')
