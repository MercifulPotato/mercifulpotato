This means community must write the type definitions twice, once for specification in Web IDL and second time in TypeScript to get proper IDE support. (There is a converter, not sure how well it works)<p>Naturally the Web IDL is not as nearly as sophisticated as TypeScript so it would be nice if they could improve the TS to work as a replacement for Web IDL.')
