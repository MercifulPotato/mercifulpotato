Current IFR estimates are on par with the flu:<p>For some reason, I assumed that once we got to hundreds of thousands of dead in the US, that people would move on from this.<p>Even the CDC puts the IFR around 0.65%. And, for example, you&#x27;ve got multiple boroughs in NYC with hundreds of deaths each that have exceeded a population fatality rate of 0.5%. You&#x27;ve got entire countries that have passed 0.1% population fatality rates. And, of course, none of these places have actually hit 100% of their population being infected.<p>&gt; Moreover, Michael Ryan of the WHO estimates 750M infected globally, which would put the IFR at around 0.1%<p>This is only useful if you also estimate deaths, otherwise you are comparing confirmed deaths against estimated cases. Given the level of missed covid deaths, this only works to downplay the fatality rate.')
