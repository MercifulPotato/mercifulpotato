DeJoy&#x27;s staff eliminated overtime and made other changes which, along with the ongoing COVID crisis, led to sharp increases in delays in specific regions.<p>The situation in December was exacerbated by UPS and Fedex limiting parcels from commercial shippers, which added even more volume to the shipper of last resort ... the post office.<p>At one point the Post Office stopped scanning parcels (for us, in mid-December) and huge backlogs built up across the system. We heard from our USPS business rep in Boston that 200 workers were out sick at the processing facility in Nashua NH, leading to trucks arriving at the parking lot that couldn&#x27;t be unloaded. They switched to processing Priority Mail at the facility in South Boston and everything else in Stamford CT, but they weren&#x27;t able to work through the Nashua backlog until January. one Priority Mail parcel we shipped on Nov 30 that was supposed to be &quot;3-day delivery&quot; arrived at its destination in Kentucky 45 days later, on Jan. 13.')
