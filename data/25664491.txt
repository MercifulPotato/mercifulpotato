Coupled payment and access. If desired, the person who publishes to lbry:&#x2F;&#x2F;rhapsody-film#e1029aaa08bef8e9225efcbfb94a895e9bbdc8ea can charge a fee to users that view the content.\n\n  2. Decentralized and distributed. Content published to LBRY is not specific to one computer or network, making LBRY robust to failure and disruption.\n\n  3. Community controlled. No party other than the publisher (including us) can unilaterally remove or block content on the LBRY network.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nI wonder if this scales well to micro-publishing, say as a protocol for an unmoderate-able twitter.')
