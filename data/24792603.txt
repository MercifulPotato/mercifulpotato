I don&#x27;t even mean in the legal sense.  What happens in the immediate wake of an accident?  Is there a note on the car about what the other driver should do?  Is there a way for someone back in the office to communicate to the other driver on the scene?  Does the other driver need to wait around until some human shows up?')
