Asking myself why I didn&#x27;t do this sooner to be honest.<p>I had one big complaint which is that copying files from Windows to WSL2 would create &quot;.ZoneInfo&quot; file copies of every file, that was downloaded from the web, but they patched this recently too.<p>With the support for Linux GUI apps that launched with Windows Insider Preview recently, I have a hard time making arguments against it now. The taste of crow is a little bitter, eh.<p>Linux + WINE&#x2F;Proton basically felt like shittier, more bug-ridden Windows + WSL2. With the one notable exception that as an OS&#x2F;host, Windows 10 &quot;feels&quot; a bit slower in general.')
