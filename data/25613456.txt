Maybe it&#x27;s time to revisit the idea.<p>&gt;  The bigger problem is the surrounding stuff that relies more on Liquid, like email signup forms, the list of posts, the list of tags, etc. All the little things that would need a small bit of work to reformat to work with another tool, it all adds up.<p>Yeah, but then it&#x27;s not really content (posts) so I think it&#x27;s okay.
