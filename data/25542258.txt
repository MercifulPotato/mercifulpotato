I mean, mainly vegetarian but some fish every so often.<p>I gave up meat at 17 on the basis of no reason whatsoever, I was just a contrary teen who liked giving things up.<p>Down the line a few years I find so many compelling reasons to not eat meat. Each individually may be argued out of the room but collectively it&#x27;s pretty compelling.<p>Ethically: there&#x27;s no arguing meat eating is better. None. However well you treat animals you&#x27;re still ultimately going to kill them.<p>Environmentally: a hundred reasons to choose a plant based diet, all of which have been cycled here a million times so won&#x27;t go back through it but we all know it&#x27;s true.<p>Health: again, see pretty much all the research ever. Eating a plant based diet is so much better for weight, health, BMI, etc etc etc<p>Taste: this is the kicker imo. If you&#x27;d asked me 15 years ago when the vegetarian alternative was a crappy pasta with tomato sauce, I&#x27;d have been more tempted to chomp my way into a steak. Nowadays? There is SO much good vegetarian food. Loads of choice, huge range of flavours and in many places it&#x27;s the vegetarian food that gets the chef&#x27;s attention, rather than falling back on the Default Meat.<p>I totally support anyone making whatever decision they like about eating meat, but I&#x27;m completely unable to agree that it&#x27;s a good idea.<p>Cultured meat in this context is a difficult one to parse. For people like me there&#x27;s literally no point. I&#x27;m just not interested in eating steak, whether it&#x27;s killed or grown. For your hardcore fleshy, a bloody slab of meat is all that&#x27;s going to satiate them, so it misses that market too. I guess there&#x27;s maybe a middle ground of people who could be convinced to stop eating killed meat if they see an alternative?<p>It&#x27;ll be interesting to see where this one goes and how it is marketed...')
