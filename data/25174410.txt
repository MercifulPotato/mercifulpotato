The usual meaning of a bit of information is with regard to a probability distribution over messages which the user wants to send to a server.  I don&#x27;t think most people are used to thinking about bits in other contexts, so that&#x27;s where the miscommunication is happening.<p>Your interpretation, which I think is correct in this context, seems to be with regard to the entropy of a probability distribution over internet users, and the mutual information between that and the distribution over messages.  The actual length of the message is irrelevant to the math <i>once you fix the joint probability distribution</i>.<p>The argument others seem to be making is that the joint probability distribution is in fact not fixed, and that you can smear out the conditional probability over users given a message by shrinking the space of possible messages.  In theory that seems possible, but I don&#x27;t know enough to have any idea how well that would work in practice.  If you shrank the message space to be small enough to be useful for this purpose, wouldn&#x27;t that get in the way of usability?')
