I removed that part of my statement.<p>Still, the declarativeWebRequest API does not allow to filter out tracking-related headers from incoming responses or sent requests.<p>I mean, you cannot declare the rules via the RequestMatcher and know what headers are going to be sent or received in advance, as the API expects full declaration of all protocol schemes and host suffixes; which is very bad if a website can pretty much do whatever it wants when it executes js code.<p>&gt; In fact, the very blog post you cite states that &quot;There is not an exact date for removing support for Manifest V2 extensions&quot; and has a quote from the Adblock Plus team, praising the collaboration with Chromium.<p>You know that eyeo GmbH were the ones with the &quot;Acceptable Ads&quot; initiative that are literally forcing websites to pay them money so that their ads continue to work, right? Personally, I would take their comment with a grain of salt.<p>For their whitelisting-ads use case the API works; for the use case of uBlock Origin et al - it doesn&#x27;t.')
