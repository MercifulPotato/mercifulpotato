It usually isn&#x27;t helpful in any political dispute.<p>But <i>we all have skin in the game</i>. Look at satellite images. Compare how much space the US takes up for houses and lawns to the pattern in Japan or Germany. Everyone laments living surrounded by concrete. But it&#x27;s our own determination to each get our personal patch of grass that leads to the unending expanse of roads and driveways and parking lots.<p>Kant said that an action is immoral if it when realized contradicts the rational ideal (&quot;an action is derived from a rule...&quot;) that motivates it in the first place. If our desire for minimum lot sizes and detached single-family houses is a result of our revulsion at the jungle of artificial infrastructure we find ourselves lost in, and our desire to reduce its impact on our health and comfort, shouldn&#x27;t that qualify?')
