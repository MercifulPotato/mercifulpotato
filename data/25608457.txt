I think if you got delivered a hamburger in a restaurant that had just been sitting for 15 minutes, not under heat lamps, you&#x27;d be complaining to the waiter. I think we sort of internalize that our food is going to be getting colder etc. as the process of eating it goes on and we don&#x27;t really think about it. And, as I noted elsewhere, something like soup dumplings or dumplings generally (unless you pan-fry them at home) are going to be pretty meh too in general.')
