If there&#x27;s a house on the property and it&#x27;s halfway close to a town, you might make more leasing the house than the property.<p>At least when people get into buying apartment buildings they&#x27;re not competing with someone who will pay a premium so they have room for a horse and can watch the sunset over their field.')
