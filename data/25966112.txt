The FDA insisted on a course of action that makes it unlikely the AZ vaccine will receive an EUA before April. They did this despite the fact that pretty much no one with vaccine expertise doubts that it will meet the safety standards or the (relatively low) efficacy standards required to grant that EUA.<p>No one disputes that AZ screwed up their trial, but it doesn’t make sense to prevent people from accessing a safe and reasonably effective vaccine just to make a point about that. That’s why the UK and EU have approved it and are moving forward with distribution, while the US waits months for absolutely perfect data before doing anything.')
