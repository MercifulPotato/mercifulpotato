When it receives packets out of order it responds by sending duplicate ACKs. This causes the sender to retransmit the packets after the ACK’s sequence number. If there’s no loss, just reordering, then this retransmission is a waste.<p>There is a SACK (selective acknowledgement) TCP extension which allows a receiver to say in more detail which packets have been received, to handle reordering more efficiently. But even so, network engineers try hard to avoid anything that can cause reordering: for instance, ECMP (equal cost multipath) balances traffic load across multiple links using a hash of the TCP quadruple to ensure that each flow follows a consistent path.')
