Make an appointment, transit to the doctor&#x27;s office, pay a bunch of money, wait for labs, wait for your doctor to explain and prescribe stuff to you. It&#x27;s cumbersome enough to the point where the vast majority of humans aren&#x27;t testing anywhere near the frequency they should, including myself.<p>I don&#x27;t think running diagnostics on a human should be this hard, we run diagnostics on our apps, computers, cars more often than ourselves. I wonder if people are working on making this process a lot easier (or if it&#x27;s even possible, I have zero knowledge of the space).')
