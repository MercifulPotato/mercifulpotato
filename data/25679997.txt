I think about the vast number of layers that have been combined to create such a marvel of technology, simply to store data in an efficient way.  Sure, you might be able to figure out the physics of magnetic storage, or even the basic electronics, but what about the motor controller?  The architecture and firmware on the storage controller?  The electrical interfaces to the storage controller?<p>Let&#x27;s assume you even get that far.<p>What about the physical layout of data on the drive?  The filesystem?  The file <i>formats</i>?<p>That&#x27;s not even all of it, and there is just <i>so, so much</i> that would be incomprehensible to a single individual, however intelligent.<p>It&#x27;s truly incredible how we&#x27;ve been able to combine years and years of knowledge into something most humans would just take for granted.<p>“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” -Arthur C.
