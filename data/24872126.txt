For a while I&#x27;ve been adding links to this repo in my spare time. Machine learning is a fast moving field, and new techniques are constantly emerging in research. While the formulation of an ML concept as it&#x27;s used today may have diverged or evolved from its original presentation, I&#x27;ve found it helpful to track down the papers which introduced common ML concepts, from things as general as Lasso regression to as specific as the papers which accompanied GPT1, 2, and 3.<p>Feel free to contribute. I&#x27;m open to suggestions on what to include as well as how to organize and present it. I hope it&#x27;s a useful tool for people hoping to read up on the research behind various ML ideas.')
