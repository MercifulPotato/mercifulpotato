They are ASICs, they do 1 thing and 1 thing only, and it&#x27;s not crack passwords hashed with SHA256 sadly.<p>This fundamental problem with their argument either shows a serious lack of understanding regarding the subject of password hashing&#x2F;cracking or it&#x27;s simply being done because they don&#x27;t expect their readers to understand it. Given the product they are pushing, I&#x27;m uncomfortable with both scenarios.<p>Passwords should be hashed with Bcrypt or Argon2, maybe Scrypt or PBKDF2 in some special cases. \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cheatsheetseries.owasp.org&#x2F;cheatsheets&#x2F;Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cheatsheetseries.owasp.org&#x2F;cheatsheets&#x2F;Password_Stor...</a>')
