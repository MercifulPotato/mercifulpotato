Not in a &quot;I need food and shelter and this is a good way to get it&quot; kind of way, but in the &quot;I can do whatever I want and I choose this&quot; kind of way.<p>Abolishing work means abolishing the false choice between a job and homelessness. People can still be paid to do things. Unpleasant work might need to pay better rather than depend on a desperate underclass. People will probably still clean toilets if you pay them enough, or maybe they will simply out of a sense of responsibility. What if we had the resources to provide for everyone&#x27;s basic needs while paying people enough to keep things running, even when they have an actual <i>choice</i>? What if we have the resources, already?<p>You ask about artistic megaprojects. Well, what about them? Maybe billion-dollar movies don&#x27;t get made. I think we&#x27;ll do fine without them. Maybe AAA games aren&#x27;t ground out by a machine of worker exploitation. They aren&#x27;t worth it, anyway. No game could be. But I think it&#x27;s crazy to think that you won&#x27;t have people who want to organize into groups and create things. If everyone in the tech industry is given their basic needs for free, do you think everybody will go home? Or will some of them still do it for some extra money and because they find it rewarding? People who like their jobs like them for reasons beyond The need for money.<p>Today, the way we get farming, cooking, cleaning, manufacturing, etc., is primarily by exploitation. I think that our society should refuse to accept that that is inevitable. The idea that things only get done if you <i>force</i> people to do them lies at the corrupted heart of our economic system. We should reject it and build a just world, or we should die trying.')
