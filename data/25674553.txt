Gumroad raises $8m from VCs, isn&#x27;t able to grow fast enough, so the VCs agree to give up any claim on the company. Sahil fires all of the employees, hires a cheap contracting firm and some of the employees back as part-time contractors. The company now does $11m in revenue, most of which is profit and Sahil keeps.<p>That&#x27;s amazing. For Sahil. Not so great if you were one of his investors or former employees who had options.')
