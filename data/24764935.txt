Not everything needs to be assessed by cost. I live near downtown because I can just walk to the bar.

Having a backyard cookout and swimming pool in a popular neighborhood makes it really easy for me to throw parties.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t want to rent a van for the same reason I never invited friends over when I couch surfed the first few months I moved to a new city<p>I guess it just depends what matters in your life.
