VoIP.ms costs me roughly $2&#x2F;month. With the pandemic, I cancelled my cellphone plan and make all phone calls on WiFi.<p>However, SMS are still a pain to deal with. About 2-3 people in my life still send them, and many apps still use them for authentication&#x2F;verification.<p>Adding SMS support would make Beeper a lot more appealing, and might encourage people to move to VoIP (a service you might charge for when you inevitably work on audio&#x2F;video bridges).')
