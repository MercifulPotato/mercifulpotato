That&#x27;s legit.<p>Just like if people are attacking Capitol Hill, or even plotting to - you arrest them.<p>Why? Because it&#x27;s lawless. Not because &#x27;We don&#x27;t agree with them&#x27;.<p>Thankfully, there will be laws that have to be adhered to. Courts. Constitutions.<p>With Jack Dorsey, there&#x27;s none of that, it&#x27;s whatever he feels on that day.<p>It&#x27;s a little absurd to suggest that totally arbitrary individuals should have the right to arbitrarily control discourse - over the regulations (hopefully few and far between) applied by elected governments, overseen by courts, the constitution etc..')
