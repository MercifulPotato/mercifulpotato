For lack of better solutions they can get put on daily prednisone for months (or years!) which causes a wholly different set of health challenges to manage the first. It can be very hard for folks walking homeless through a desert of autoimmune knowledge. Often my advice is, “what would you do if you had that last marker? Adopt a lifestyle as if you did: watch your food intake, do gentle but <i>regular</i> exercise, get plenty of sleep, reduce mental and physical stress, avoid excess (sun, drink, food, etc).” I’ve yet to meet anyone with a neat diagnosis that <i>wants</i> to be on immunosuppressive drugs, so even these folks must strive to manage their disease through disciplined lifestyle changes.<p>I also understand the need for doctors to be measured in their diagnosis, so I don’t begrudge them for following protocols established for disease qualification. I don’t think of it as invalidating experiences of patients (though it can feel that way to patients) but everyone is aware of those that <i>want</i> a diagnosed health problem, and to a more frequent extent, those that want a tidy answer to their experiences even if there isn’t one. Denying a diagnosis of a known disease is not denying a diagnosis at all.')
