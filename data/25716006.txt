This basic premise would allow the government to reach in and force companies to associate against their will. This power <i>will</i> be abused.<p>&gt; Speech without a platform isn&#x27;t speech at all<p>This is utter nonsense. By this logic, speech without access to a bullhorn or an editorial board isn’t speech at all.<p>You have a right to speak without being prosecuted by the government. Pretending that you have a right to a Twitter account or an equivalent thereof is both silly, it’s incredibly entitled.')
