No developer wants their brand spanking new condo to be occupied by paupers. It gives the place a bad image and brings the value down. Plus because you cannot simply kick out tenants in most places, you are stuck getting a low income for a very long time. So they prefer to market them as studios for expats and young professionals and keep half of them empty accumulating dust. There&#x27;s certainly something to fix there although I cannot tell you how.')
