Did people in every country have the same opportunities in terms of education? Remember that when people say education standards are improving, they are not talking about a particular country, but rather about an overall global measurement. I’m sure countries in the global south (where the majority of the world’s population lives) were not having those same education opportunities back in the 60s. But now they have widespread access to education.<p>Also, how useful it is&#x2F;was  reading in Anglo Saxon? And please, could you point out all those examples and arguments with verifiable  evidence, rather than anecdotal ones?')
