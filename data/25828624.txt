Can you point me to it?<p>$100k sounds like a lot but....I live in San Diego. All in, it costs about $4,200&#x2F;month <i>post-tax</i> to live here. Sure, it can be done on much less. That means $50,400&#x2F;year post-tax. So your $100k whether liquid or not only lasts two years max.<p>Let&#x27;s say a real recession occurs and you lose your job. If your $100k is in the asset that crashed -- say real estate (which I like real estate) or speculative tech stocks -- oh boy. You&#x27;re now probably at $70k hopefully. If it takes you 12 months from losing your job to finding a job. Now you&#x27;re looking at only $20k left in your account....that is scary.<p>I know I am being paranoid because you&#x27;d get unemployment + could probably find a lower level job quick in the meantime + you would cut your $4200&#x2F;month to bare minimum. But that&#x27;s my point, I live in this fear and the $100k provides some peace of mind.')
