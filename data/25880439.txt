On the other hand, Qt will forever be stuck with legacy C++ language, which appears designed to be nigh impossible to interop with.<p>And if you have a requirement to use C++, there is the gtkmm binding too, which doesn&#x27;t require a separate language extension such as Qt&#x27;s MOC to use.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gtk.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;language-bindings&#x2F;cpp&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gtk.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;language-bindings&#x2F;cpp&#x2F;</a>')
