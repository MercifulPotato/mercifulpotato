Some RC car batteries are &quot;60C&quot; indicating they can do a full discharge in 1 minute.<p>To achieve that, substantial capacity and lifespan tradeoffs are made, and you&#x27;re right that cooling becomes necessary.<p>7500 amps isn&#x27;t &#x27;bigger than car&#x27; territory either.  If you&#x27;re happy to have copper the thickness of your forearm it wouldn&#x27;t melt at 7500 amps, even with simple air cooling.   &quot;Not melting&quot; isn&#x27;t quite the standard we&#x27;re after, but shows that it isn&#x27;t unachievable.')
