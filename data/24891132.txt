Consoles, tablets, smartphones (all iPhones and many Androids don&#x27;t allow rooting), smart TVs... even some laptops. Surface RT laptops had locked secure boot, and Chromebooks made it very difficult to install alternative OSes, as far as I know.<p>As for the incentives of the &quot;open market&quot;, there&#x27;s profit in locking down devices, and selling you back fragments of that locked functionality. For example, nvidia pushed an EULA that forbade using their consumer GPUs in datacenters, making them buy the far more expensive enterprise versions.<p>With how markets tend towards oligopolies and monopolies, there&#x27;s no guarantee the handful of manufacturers left won&#x27;t conspire to put restrictions on all computers. Especially if 95% of consumers don&#x27;t care about being able to run gcc.')
