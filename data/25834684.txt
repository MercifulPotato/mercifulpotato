But for heaven&#x27;s sake, call a tax a tax.<p>The BBC is license-fee funded rather than tax funded so that (in theory at least) they don&#x27;t have to rely directly on the government for funding - private citizens directly fund the corporation.<p>This goes some way to ensuring more independence, and fairer news output.<p>In reality, the government holds the BBC to ransom every eight years when the royal charter they operate under is re-written. There will always be claims of political bias on both sides.')
