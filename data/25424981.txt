It can be grown under perfect conditions, then transported and used the same day it&#x27;s harvested.<p>So, pretty cool from a technical and culinary perspective, but it&#x27;s never going to produce staple crops economically. It seems kind of silly to portray it as being particularly eco-friendly or as addressing concerns like food security.')
