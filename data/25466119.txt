That&#x27;s basically what they did.<p>&gt; The rest is BS and media circus.</i><p>Eh, I don&#x27;t object to Apple slowing down the phone in the name of stability when the battery is worn.<p>It&#x27;s more that they did it without telling the user it <i>was</i> happening or documenting that it <i>could</i> happen.<p>And given that it was by the same company that pioneered the glued-in battery, and is famously unhelpful to third-party repair shops, it&#x27;s reasonable to see that as part of a pattern.<p><i>&gt; For one, the drop in battery (and thus perf tradeoff) happens after 3 or more years of use, not after the first year.</i><p>People&#x27;s experiences vary a lot depending on their phone use. I have a computer at home, a computer at work, and a commute where I can&#x27;t use a phone. Use 20% charge per day and slow-charge every night? Battery will last for years!<p>On the other hand, someone who spends two hours a day streaming netflix while they commute then use their phone a bit a home as well? The sort of person who charges twice a day? They&#x27;re going to see the symptoms of battery wear a lot earlier.')
