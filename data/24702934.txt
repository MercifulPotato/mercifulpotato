This will help retain the best overseas workers in the US.<p>Even better would be a <i>salary auction</i> where US companies get to auction (higher and higher salaries for the best overseas workers.) The highest auction rates would fill the quota first. Overseas workers win bigtime. Companies seeking talent also win. Local workers win as well. Companies trying to underpay lose.')
