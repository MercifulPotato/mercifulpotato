Do you think a bulletproof vest manufacturer hiring the best gunmakers in the world would dramatically improve their bulletproof vests? It could help, and it is certainly essential to have good bullet&#x2F;gun engineers on staff, but you would probably be better off hiring people who know materials science and the actual job of making bulletproof vests.<p>It would be far more beneficial for them to just use the tried-and-true techniques that have already been deployed for decades in high-reliability&#x2F;high-security systems. In the event that such things are too onerous, they could run development methodology tests to remove the elements that provide the least security ROI to produce lesser, but still good, systems at a reduced cost. This would be far more likely to produce a good outcome than taking the standard high development velocity commercial methodology that has failed to produce meaningful security despite decades of attempts and enhancing it to be a high security process. At least in the former you can be reasonably confident you get good security, though possibly at a higher cost than desired. In the latter, although the cost may be less, the security is a complete unknown since you are using a new process invented by people who have never used, let alone made, a high security process before and it is a class of strategy that has literally never succeeded over multiple decades of attempts. Not to say it could not happen, it took hundreds or possibly even thousands of years of failed attempts before heaver-than-air flight was cracked, but they would probably be better served just using the existing techniques that are known to solve the problem.')
