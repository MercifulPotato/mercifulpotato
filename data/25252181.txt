In the current milieu everyone seems to be aware of this and any person who uses the term “alpha” is automatically considered anti-science alt-right misogynist.<p>Though, of course “alpha” animals exist in different species and in artificial wolf packs as the article admits, which makes this weird obsession with wolfs as a way to take down the concept of alpha-male quite bizarre.
