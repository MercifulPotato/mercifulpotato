Item(by='corty', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607548212, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25363512, text='Germany is roughly 1&#x2F;3 catholic (south and west predominantly), 1&#x2F;3 protestant (north) and 1&#x2F;3 atheist (east). Regional specifications are very rough, often there is actually a village-by-village variation between catholic and protestant due to cuius regio eius religio in the middle ages. Atheism&#x2F;agnosticism&#x2F;dontcare is on the rise roughly everywhere, but has a head start in the east&#x2F;GDR due to GDR politics.<p>And I guess you mean to say germany has gone farthest in christianisation, with the least of old german or old norse cultural remains? I guess that might be true.')
