Then what&#x27;s the power of having a compiler in a PDF? you can output the executable, but can you run it?<p>Depends what you mean by &quot;run&quot;, really.  You can write a full-on X86 emulator, and execute a compiled binary there.  But given that it&#x27;s an emulator running in a nested series of sandboxes, it won&#x27;t be terribly useful -- for example, it still won&#x27;t have I&#x2F;O capabilities.')
