The issue is those technique that are memorized, that become useful in solving these problems, aren&#x27;t intuitive, despite their deceptive simplicity. In reality there&#x27;s little memorization of solutions, and much memorization of useful techniques (data structures, algorithmic techniques) that are useful for these problems. And the more you do, the more you&#x27;ll have at your disposal for &quot;novel&quot; problems. Further, many of these memorized techniques are not as intuitive as they seem. Quite a few resulted in publications when they were discovered.')
