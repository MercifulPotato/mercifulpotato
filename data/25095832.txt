I don&#x27;t eat veal or fish for the same reasons[1]. Veal is cruel. And fishing is horribly destructive. Where someone draws a line isn&#x27;t as important as they do.<p>[1] Don&#x27;t get me started though with Hippie Brahmans that won&#x27;t eat chicken or beef but eat fish for &#x27;heath reasons&#x27;')
