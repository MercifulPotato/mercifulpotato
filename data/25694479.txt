And, yes, this applies to high-profile corruption cases, and, yes, the politicians (and similar stars) proceed to play the ultralegalist card (&quot;everything&#x27;s OK and we&#x27;re blameless because we&#x27;re not in prison&quot;) and ignore the fact that the guilt has already been established.<p>It sometimes even happens that a journalist records a call with some scum like that, gets a boast&#x2F;confession out of them, and <i>almost nobody cares</i> because the call recording is not admissible as evidence without the consent of the guilty party.<p>I mean, sure, part of the blame lies with the possibly incompetent and&#x2F;or malicious law enforcement, prosecutors and the judiciary; but the justification for the rules of excluding otherwise valid evidence obtained illegaly just don&#x27;t make a lot of sense to me, especially as they tip the scales against a fair society and towards corruption.')
