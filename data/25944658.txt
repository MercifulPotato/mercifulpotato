Leveraged short-selling is a tactic of activist investors to take control of a company, and there was an article about what they wanted to do with it. No doubt the past actions of activist investors in the gaming industry was fuel for this fire. I’m not a gamer and I don’t know what is going on, but I think it has something to do with getting rid of the ownership model of games to make way for cloud gaming and advertising, served with a political agenda. GameStop made the ownership model work. Every major cloud service provider, social media company, and their investors all want it gone.
