When writing data into your data warehouse we provide 2 options: 1. write each record as a json blob. 2. infer the schema of the data and write each value in a record to its own column with an appropriate type.<p>We are betting on EL(T), meaning we think that Transform should be considered separately from EL. To give a more a concrete example, if you are already using DBT in your data warehouse to normalize your data, you likely prefer operating on the &quot;raw&quot; (json blob) data than an arbitrarily normalized form of your data that your EL pipeline has decided on for you. I am seeing this trend pretty pervasively where a lot of, nominally, ELT pipelines are outsourcing the Transform to best in breed tools like DBT.<p>Thanks for asking this question btw, we&#x27;ll do our best to clarify in our docs!')
