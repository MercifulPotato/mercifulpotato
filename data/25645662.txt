Childcare&#x2F;nursery isn’t going to become cheaper just because you’ve more experience with the job.<p>College textbooks really stand out though. These should not have to become more expensive. They are written once and printed cheaply thereafter. I wonder what the curve for other types of books looks like but my guess is that other books have not seen these increases and this is purely money-making.')
