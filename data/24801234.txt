Also on the day of the data collection, they performed the techniques right before being exposed to E coli, so they had &quot;advance warning&quot; as it were.<p>Still very cool to see the immune system changes observed, since that&#x27;s rare, but definitely requires a commitment to produce it in its current format.')
