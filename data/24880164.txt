Item(by='ogre_codes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603556855, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24876506, text='&gt; There is nothing about Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness that fits the definition of great.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how you&#x27;d consider Apple Music a money grab but are ok with iTunes music purchases? Basically they were expanding their business to follow the industry trend of streaming music instead of buying it. iTunes has been a revenue stream at Apple since the iPod was born.<p>Also, Apple selling supplemental services and software that are... not amazing is not new either.<p>The big one? iTunes. For a few years it was great, but for a long long time it was just a giant mess. iHome, iMovie (Garage Band is pretty rad), iPhoto (Photos is way better), Mobile Me, Ping didn&#x27;t even last 2 years I don&#x27;t think. Most of those products were <i>meh</i> at best, they did the basic thing they needed to do and that&#x27;s about it.<p>The big difference between Apple then and Apple now is they have the money to contract out for their own content.<p>&gt;  Apple TV+, Apple Fitness that fits the definition of great.<p>Apple TV+ has a paltry selection because they didn&#x27;t go out and buy a huge external library of content to bootstrap themselves. The content they have isâ€”Decent and getting better. They know this and there is a reason they aren&#x27;t really charging for it yet.<p>Apple Fitness doesn&#x27;t even exist so not sure how you can criticize it.<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s all a &quot;Money Grab&quot;, they are growing the business, that&#x27;s what companies do. Fortunately all of this stuff is optional. You can enjoy your computer&#x2F; phone&#x2F; tablet without any of it. IMO the only egregious &quot;money grab&quot; is their paltry 5GB free iCloud storage. Considering that&#x27;s the best and for many only way of backing up their $1000 phone with their life stored on it, that&#x27;s messed up.')
