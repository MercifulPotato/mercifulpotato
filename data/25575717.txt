In India, <i>250 million</i> farmers and associated union members went on strike. Somehow this event went completely unreported by USA journalists. In nations where the USA &quot;defense&quot; department could conceivably waste more money, the threshold is considerably lower than 250M... more like, say, ten? Twenty? Possibly a hundred protesters in Syria or Hong Kong would be worth a report.')
