A drop in one does not equate automatically to an increase in the other.<p>There&#x27;s a process involved in converting carbon to CO2. To make CO2 levels rise by 6x, the process of converting would need to be running at 6x too. The entire of human industry over ~100 years has contributed to increasing CO2 levels by 1x (so doubling them). So we&#x27;re not in any imminent danger of 6x.')
