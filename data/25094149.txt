Whatever they do with it afterwards is up to them.</i><p>This sets the tone for any further conversation we might have. You are simply a fundamentalist, a dogmatist. People earn money because they work hard, then they buy stuff with that money, then they do things with that stuff. And that&#x27;s how our economy works! I don&#x27;t even know how to reply to such an absurd statement. It&#x27;s like someone saying the sky is pink. What are you even supposed to argue other than... just look out your window?<p><i>&gt; points two and three</i><p>Glad you decided to split my sentence in two in order to argue against something that I didn&#x27;t say. A significant portion of food goes to waste <i>while there are shortages in other places</i>, this is what I said. You can argue all you wan&#x27;t but you cannot change the basic reality that your system for allocating resources isn&#x27;t doing a good job at allocating resources.<p><i>&gt; We have given trillions to help pay for the losses of the bankers</i><p>Bankers (class I people) are given free money that they then lend out, with interest, to the rest of us (class II people) who pay tithe to them for the economy to work at all. Not content with this, if they ever make a serious fuck-up and tank the whole economy, we will be there to compensate them for their losses and make sure that they still get their due profit. This is not right, full stop.')
