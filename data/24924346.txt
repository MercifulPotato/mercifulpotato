Most of the code suggested in this thread is that.<p>Modern C++ looks very, very different from C, and even more different from Java. So, if you see code that looks like one of those, you know it is not a thing to emulate.<p>Certain companies, notably Mozilla and Google, have extremely peculiar coding standards that badly warp how code has to be written for them. You do not want to emulate that code. If you see classes with &quot;Init&quot; and &quot;Deinit&quot; members, and constructors that don&#x27;t do anything, you know you are in a dark back alley headed for a world of suffering.<p>If you see code that looks like it might as well be C, it&#x27;s probably bad code. Modern C++ is a very, very different language from C. Most of your C habits, if you have any, are bad C++ habits that you will need to work hard to unlearn. In particular, if you handle naked pointers much, you are Doing It Wrong.<p>If you see code organized like Java, full of shared_ptr and virtual functions, it&#x27;s certainly bad code. (I think Dropbox just published a big library that was virtual functions from top to bottom. Shiver.) We call that Java Disease. Inheritance and virtual functions are occasionally useful, as pure mechanism, but not as an organizing principle.<p>Modern C++ code works with values more than pointers or references, and prefers to pass objects by move over by reference. If you actually see allocations, and particularly deallocations, in top-level code, it is very likely to be bad code.')
