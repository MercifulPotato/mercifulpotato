The fact that AP failed to QA input validation on iOS is an affront to the basic responsibilities of product quality. Submitting an HEIC file would cause the page to time-out with no recourse.<p>Compounding this is Apple’s decision to abstract file formats to whatever degree possible in iOS. Unless you are an avid tech blog reader or had run into some compatibility issue beforehand, iOS would have never shown you the text “HEIC” anywhere in it’s UI.')
