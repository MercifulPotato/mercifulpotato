It&#x27;s laughably far from representative.<p>But the actual rubber stamper voting group is about 3000 people.<p>However, since there was never any real independent and strong opposition (the Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan) the only power struggles were very much about succession, and again that&#x27;s like a minor clash in a royal family, whoever wins, it&#x27;s still feudalism.<p>... yes, you said that Jack Ma is a CCP member, but he was nowhere near close enough to Xi in any aspect to challenge him.
