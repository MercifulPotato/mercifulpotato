I&#x27;d also like to point out that your argument for &#x27;personal responsibility&#x27; has a lot of similarities with the &#x27;abortions would stop if people just exercised abstinence&#x27; argument. The flaw is the same: people <i>don&#x27;t</i> act responsibly[0] and others suffer for it[1].<p>&gt;They can achieve this responsibility through, for instance, basic income, unemployment benefits or a social safety net.<p>Those would be reasonable approaches but instead CA seems more interested in hacking a massively useful service into unprofitably. It&#x27;s akin to pushing mass transit by bulldozing highways instead of building subways.<p>[0] A lot can be written about why people don&#x27;t, but its demonstrable that lowering the barrier to alternatives decreases irresponsible behavior.<p>[1] If you consider abortion and&#x2F;or drunk driving to be social ills.')
