[0]<p>I love the little guy. Lighter than any paperback I&#x27;ve ever owned. Fits in a large pocket. Displays in color! Which lets me highlight in color! And runs Android 9.0 with Google Play Services (though activating this is a bit hacky). Can install whatever Android browser you want. It&#x27;s the &quot;Gameboy Color&quot; stage of color vibrancy, but it&#x27;s color.<p>Problem is, to my knowledge, this was a limited run. I got mine from Good eReader, but they sold out of this model, and I don&#x27;t know when or if there will be more.<p>I haven&#x27;t tested, but I think the Onyx Boox Poke 3 (not color) might be able to install GPS too.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goodereader.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;hands-on-review-of-the-onyx-boox-poke-2-color" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goodereader.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;reviews&#x2F;hands-on-review-of-the-...</a><p>ETA: Note about quality of colors.')
