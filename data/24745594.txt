You can buy insurance in case of a burst pipe but not a flood.  You can’t buy insurance that will pay out if there’s a nuclear war.  You can’t buy insurance that will pay out in case of climate change.  The damage is too big, and affects too many people at the same time.  Some tail risks are fatal, existential, and the only recourse is not to take the risk at all.')
