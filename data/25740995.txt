Item(by='mikedilger', descendants=None, kids=[25741539], score=None, time=1610414266, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25740502, text='Well there are a lot of possibilites:<p>1) The story is true but not meant for our eyes,\n2) The story is true and meant for our eyes, but they can&#x27;t officially say so or haven&#x27;t yet prepared their statement,\n3) The story is false and meant for our eyes as a form of propaganda,\n4) ... other options<p>I think the best course of action is to treat the story as if it never happened. I&#x27;m utterly exhausted by what appears to be repeated propaganda via the US news media, covering their asses with this very tired &quot;anonymous source&quot; trick. If the source is anonymous it garners zero trust, and you just fool yourself if you think otherwise and choose to believe it because it is exciting&#x2F;scary&#x2F;wishful&#x2F;etc... unless you trust these particular media sources (I don&#x27;t). I&#x27;m fairly sure that most of the anonymous leaks during the Russia Collusion investigation turned out to be false propaganda.<p>If the government wants to warn us of something, they have to actually do that -- they can&#x27;t play these games and presume we are going to react (if option 2) because we are exhausted by manipulation.  I will take it seriously as soon as (and only if) the FBI takes communicating it seriously.')
