Item(by='WorldMaker', descendants=None, kids=[25877512], score=None, time=1611352417, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25876303, text='I&#x27;m not saying being regional is the problem, but that we have an opportunity to question the definitions&#x2F;assumptions behind &quot;regional&quot;. A lot of our country&#x27;s ideals of a representative district stem from concepts&#x2F;assumptions that a representative&#x27;s office should be no more than a brief horse ride away. Gerrymandering has insured that isn&#x27;t the case in a lot of places today hence the assertion that the original ideals are unmet (&quot;broken&quot;).<p>But what happens if we question the assumption directly? Is it okay to take public transportation into account? What about car travel? To get into useful extremes for illustrative purposes, what about air travel? How far in travel time is feasible&#x2F;allowable, an hour&#x27;s distance? Four or more, like some of the classic representative horse &quot;ridings&quot;?<p>It doesn&#x27;t entirely matter where you stand with specifics to those travel methods&#x2F;distance qualifiers: the point is that those are variables&#x2F;knobs in the equation. If the outcome is better representation overall, knowing that your representative is less than four hours by car away, for instance, may still be sufficient to meet the useful parts of the &quot;regional&quot; ideal while providing more options to explore in optimizing representation (such as random sampling or some k-means clustering gradient) than the traditional &quot;geographies need to be contiguous and no more than a simple horse ride big&quot;.<p>Technology also presents other opportunities to explore: Would you be happy if your Representative&#x27;s &quot;Office&quot; was a Discord server of &quot;the right size&quot; (say, small enough that it isn&#x27;t a cacophony, big enough that it isn&#x27;t just in jokes and memes of two to three shitposters every day) and your Representative had mandated &quot;Office hours&quot; to &quot;hang out&#x2F;townhall&quot; in a voice or video chat channel? I know that a lot of people might find the idea ugly or terrifying, but I find it an interesting ideal of a different more modern sort. You might feel more likely that your voice is directly heard, and a good Discord server can feel very &quot;regional&quot; even when the actual participants are scattered to the winds geographically. I&#x27;m not saying &quot;Discord but for Politics&quot; is necessarily the best idea either, just that it is a useful thought experiment in questioning what it means to be &quot;regional&quot; in 2021.')
