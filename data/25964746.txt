People look at the covid-19 death numbers, and have <i>no idea</i> how many people actually die in a normal year.<p>And this causes people to focus on ensuring nobody dies of covid-19 to the exclusion of everything else. Yes, it absolutely sucks that a lot of vulnerable people in elder care facilities have died of it, but it&#x27;s <i>equally</i> tragic that a lot of them have died of cognitive decline due to not being allowed to see their family and friends, or not being allowed to see each other.<p>Or that people are dying or going to die because hospitals and patients alike are postponing care and checkups and routine surgeries, because they&#x27;re afraid of hospitals being overrun with covid-19 patients, or because they&#x27;re afraid hospitals will increase spread.<p>I belong to the privileged class of people who can work from home, I&#x27;ve done it for years, and I live far away from friends and family, so I&#x27;ve been doing weekly video calls for years. The effect for me, personally, is pretty much zero. A lot of people who drive policy are like me, and therefore think lockdowns are no big deal.<p>But lockdowns are absolutely <i>miserable</i> for a large amount of people. There&#x27;s a very good reason that we&#x27;re seeing violent anti-lockdown protests in several countries, because a lot of people are completely fed up with the restrictions.<p>So, in terms of specific policy, I want governments to encourage and enable people to isolate and distance and keep themselves safe, but I don&#x27;t want them to <i>enforce</i> it. People have to be allowed to make their own choices, their own risk analysis, and live with the consequences. As we already do for a lot of things.<p>One example of encouragement is to have good sickpay policies in place, so that no-one feels they &quot;have to&quot; get to work even though they&#x27;re sick or possibly infected, either out of social obligation or financial necessity.<p>&gt; and I&#x27;m not sure discriminating by age and health is going to be some magical solution.<p>It&#x27;s too hard to lock down and isolate a fraction of the population, therefore the solution is to lock down the entire population, except &quot;essential&quot; workers? This argument doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.')
