Total cost of the core components: $0.03.

Why get rid of one unnecessary sensor without getting rid of another?<p>I wonder if perhaps it was done to force the vision teams to become less science&#x2F;research oriented and more &#x27;we need this result now, we have angry customers waiting&#x27; based.')
