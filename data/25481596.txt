The objects that you see &quot;through the roof&quot; may be <i>in front</i> of the building, not inside.  Radar imaging is based on the return time of a chirp to the antenna.  If two objects appear on the same pixel in the image it means that they are at the same distance to the antenna.  For example, if the sensor is at a (common) elevation of 45 degrees, a 10m vertical wall will seem to cover the 10m of ground next to it, and any object there will be superimposed with the roof of the building.<p>EDIT: I have some professional experience with the interpretation of satellite SAR imagery.')
