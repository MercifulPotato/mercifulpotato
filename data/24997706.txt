(Example - enums are implemented with a metaclass and dataclasses with a class decorator - arguably the latter is the wrong choice, because it is already evident it limits what kind of features can be added to dataclasses).<p>Another example just because it makes me irate - `typing.NamedTuple` has been added as an &quot;alternative&quot; to `collections.namedtuple`. Same name, new capitalization, slightly different features. Add to that, a collection type that&#x27;s inside the module `typing` which is supposed to be for.. type annotations, not actual implementations.')
