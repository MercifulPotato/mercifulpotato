Nowadays it simply means you have to type the URL of a site into your browser yourself.<p>The internet is not becoming closed off so much as users are using centralized, proprietary aggregation sites for everything. To the average internet peruser, there are maybe 5 websites. Google is a far the biggest of those aggregators (IMO it no longer functions well as a search engine) and if your idea of &quot;the deep web&quot; is that it doesn&#x27;t rank in google, sure. But the internet is far bigger than that, still to this day, and for those of us that eschew those big aggregators, the internet you speak of is a daily reality.')
