Just because subpoenas are likely to be dismissed does not make them unworthy of reporting, and arguably quite the opposite - particularly when it is a major federal agency doing the subpoenaing rather than some small town sheriff.<p>A subpoena is expensive and onerous to fight. Yes, Buzzfeed has the resources to do so. Does your local paper? To dismiss the power and newsworthiness of a subpoena from a major federal agency with all of the financial and human resources (funded by you the taxpayer!) that such position implies is cynical beyond belief. To then further dismiss the criticism of that view as “spam” is revealing.')
