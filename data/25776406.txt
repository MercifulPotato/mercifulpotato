What I just noticed was that when I looked deeper on MUI components, their internals are bulky and almost always used a mixed of JS &amp; CSS instead of just CSS. They even import an external library for their styling.<p>On low-end devices it&#x27;s a bit too much (I&#x27;m talking about edge-case users with phones as cheap as $50). It was also quite a chore keeping up with their API changes every couple months.<p>I forced myself to cut down on components and just style my UI with CSS. It&#x27;s more consistent, more predictable, and less strain on the end-user&#x27;s device. It&#x27;s a trade-off across looking good, better end-user performance, good user experience, good developer experience, and having more time for the product and users instead of maintaining and updating dependencies.')
