Usage over a long time span is usually not a &quot;decline&quot; but a &quot;wave-like&quot; pattern. aka rebound, or substitution. You remove one distracting app, stay productive for a week or a month, then rebound to same or <i>another</i> app. Repeat process.<p>2. Substitution through other media. As this one said, &quot;use laptop&#x2F;PC for mindfully using Social Media&quot;, this sounds really good, but in practise usually given time, returns to mindless browsing. That&#x27;s how we work, our brain constantly tries to push things we have to do mindfully to an automated &quot;mindless&quot; process. The tricky thing with this is that, we usually don&#x27;t consider the process &quot;mindless&quot; until long after it have become an mindless process.<p>It would be interesting, if you can observe your usage pattern over longer time-span. Not just Smartphone but also your PC&#x2F;Laptop and observe if you <i>truly</i> have reduced your &quot;distraction&quot; time.')
