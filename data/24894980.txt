I&#x27;m using Thinkpads&#x2F;Lenovos for 15 years as my main development computers:<p>1. Not thaaat big, but I prefer sub-4k anyway: WQXGA support, with docking station more than one - check<p>2. External keyboard - check<p>3. Check<p>4. Two M2 1TB Samsung + one 500GB SATA + optional external drives of similar sizes. More than enough<p>5. Admitted, docking station for some cases and connections.<p>6. Not anymore, USB bootable devices for the rare occasion. Other former reasons are more or less obsolete for my causes.<p>7. Docking station again<p>8. Lenovos are not so bad in this respect too<p>9. This one was &gt; 2000EU - but will last several years as its ancestors did too\n...<p>12. A piece of duct tape solves all camera problems<p>I am a consultant, the necessity for traveling around was partly responsible for the original choice, but even today I&#x27;m not missing much.
