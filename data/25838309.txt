The functionality of LOADALL now largely happens in the RSM instruction which returns back to normal execution context from an SMI. In modern firmware, before the SMI handler is invoked by the SMM dispatcher the firmware will switch the mode away from real mode and have its own GDT&#x2F;descriptors. All this needs to be restored on SMI return thus RSM will parse a specially formatted block of processor context to dump everything back.')
