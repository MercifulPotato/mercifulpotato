In many parts of the civilized world (where, by miraculous chance, they&#x27;ve also handled Covid reasonably responsibly) people who were sick in public (or even just wanted to avoid putting on makeup) habitually wore masks pre-covid to avoid infecting others. I&#x27;d be willing to assert that it&#x27;s exactly that habit (and a related set of hygiene conditions, in addition to an already-present infrastructure for home PPE) that helped them return to living much more normal lives through this pandemic.')
