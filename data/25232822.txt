And they got it by cramming for the exam like any other test. So my thoughts on Developer Associate are not very high.<p>Obviously, that is more of a reflection on that person&#x27;s personality and less on them having a cert. Not everyone with a cert is like that.<p>&gt; Other developers have told me that one of the easiest ways to get a cert is to just pay someone in India to take the test for you in case you need it for a contract (for those developers in the consulting world)<p>That&#x27;s a culture problem, not a cert problem. Some people get certs to honestly learn and signal that knowledge to others, not just to tick a check box or add a resume bullet point.<p>Yeesh. SMH.')
