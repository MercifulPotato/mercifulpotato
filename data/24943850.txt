And nobody is happy with the situation we&#x27;re in now. Not the farmers, not the public, not the sheep and not even the environmentalists. Public support for wolves is growing, but only among people who don&#x27;t know about the problems they cause.<p>One of the main reason farmers hate wolves is because it&#x27;s madness. A wolf kills 14 sheep in one night and only eats one, partly. That doesn&#x27;t make it a very sympathetic animal.<p>The Netherlands is very densely populated. Everyone was doing fine without the wolf. Now a couple of environmentalists use public money to try to reintroduce wolves in habitat that isn&#x27;t able to support them. They got subsidies based on reports that promised no livestock would be harmed. Wolves would just limit themselves automagically to wildlife when there is enough wildlife to support them. This claim is demonstrably false. It&#x27;s fraud.<p>On top of that, the environmentalist arrogantly call everyone who doesn&#x27;t love the wolf stupid, uninformed bigots.<p>Like that helps.')
