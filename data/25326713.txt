I guess that after decomposition of the wood, all its carbon goes back to the atmosphere.  It is just slower than if you burned it.<p>The biosphere is a closed cycle, we cannot probably use it to store carbon away by means of its own mechanism.  Main problem is that we are adding new fossil carbon into it every day.')
