The Tesla Model 3 costs twice as much as low-end new cars: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motortrend.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;top-10-cheapest-new-cars&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motortrend.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;top-10-cheapest-new-cars&#x2F;</a><p>It&#x27;s also important to note that a lot of car purchasers buy used cars, because the low end of the new market is too expensive for them.<p>And really the appropriate comparison versus food is the <i>transport</i> sector, not cars alone. Cars are, as I said, the rich end of the market. In many places, cars are less popular than motorcycles, scooters, and bikes. I don&#x27;t see any reason to think Tesla has an advantage going downmarket there. Indeed, as a luxury brand, there are significant brand barriers to them going lower in the car market, let alone down to scooters.')
