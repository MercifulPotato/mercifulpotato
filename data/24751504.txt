It&#x27;s main purpose is to stand up for the poor which makes it appear humanitarian and ethical. But it only feels good on the surface because the left is generally also opposed to market freedom and property rights that benefit everybody, including the poor, in the long term. The right wing&#x27;s humanitarianism comes as a long term consequence of wealth creation rather than something they want directly.')
