Instead there&#x27;s hardly any variance in long-term social mobility between human societies. Certainly modern democratic socialist Scandinavia must impose less overt class privilege than 16th century aristocratic Scandinavia. Yet the two have nearly identically low mobility.<p>(Note that social mobility and inequality are two different things. A country like the Soviet Union, may have the rich be only slightly richer than the poor, but still makes it hard to move from the latter into the former.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;commentisfree&#x2F;2015&#x2F;feb&#x2F;04&#x2F;social-mobility-equality-class-society" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;commentisfree&#x2F;2015&#x2F;feb&#x2F;04&#x2F;social...</a>')
