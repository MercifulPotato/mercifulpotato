For anyone unfamiliar it had a basic library type structure where only one person could get out (lock) a file at a time.<p>Now the obvious downside is that when someone goes on holiday or simply forgets those locked files can become blockers. The solution to that is to have an admin unlock the files, which was pretty easy, then a merge, which is basically what happens by default with git.<p>The upsides of the library approach were a) that I could scan the top directory, and quickly drill down to see who was working on what. b) I feel that walking over to someone&#x27;s desk and asking if they were still working on a file produced some great back and forth, that was where the magic of collaboration actually happened.')
