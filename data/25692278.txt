At the same time, they do not moderate threats of violence or plans to commit those acts of violence (which we&#x27;ve witnessed come to fruition this week). At what point do we stop calling Parler a platform for free speech and admit that it is actively breeding violence?<p>If I release a messaging app on the app store and call it a tool for free speech, but block any content that doesn&#x27;t have to do with committing acts of violence against members of congress, what argument is there for not blocking my app?<p>Any discussions about the merits of free speech around Apple and Parler here are largely moot: none of the parties involved here truly value &quot;free as in freedom&quot; speech and never have. The pot and the kettle are arguing about which one is blacker.')
