A static website (relying on a headless CMS or a build&#x2F;deploy process for content) is much more shelf stable than WordPress if the project isn&#x27;t updated on a monthly basis. A lot of people have built successful businesses and sites with WordPress and continue to do so (this is what I got my start in consulting ten years ago). That said, WordPress provides a bigger surface area for vulnerabilities with the 3rd party plugin ecosystem and database connection compared to static sites. If you&#x27;re familiar with it, and prepared to keep it up to date, it may be a good option for you. Otherwise, I&#x27;d go with the Jamstack (assuming it can handle whatever your use case is).')
