People like ethnographers and other people who spend their continuous feeling time understanding this are owed a lot of gratitude (like us, who benefit from unicode). Tone is just another way to encode a basic unit within a language (how a basic unitary &#x27;meme&#x27; is converted to a &#x27;lexeme&#x27;, &#x27;morpheme&#x27;, etc is very interesting, but has been part of an ancient ontology&#x2F;metaontology war for all communications systems), and language is just a tool for two human beings to communicate and share ideas. just look at the variance of toneless between English, the gamut of into-european Langs, and tonal languages like Chinese. Heck, in the Universe in a Single Atom, the Dali Llama talks about how Buddhism and other Indic culture spread across the himilayas (it took a lot of sheer luck and kinematics). Sanskrit unlike Tibetan had a lot of prosody (aka distributed word-meaning state), but the English equivalent to things like &quot;affect&quot; and &quot;effect&quot; were culture shocks. Tibetan had little words to encode affect-like words outside of mental states. So little &quot;counting&quot; was ever done.')
