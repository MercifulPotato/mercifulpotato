Here&#x27;s a well known review from back in the day: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;hep-ph&#x2F;0203079" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;hep-ph&#x2F;0203079</a><p>I&#x27;m not sure we&#x27;re done with composite models. There are more exotic alternatives and then the fact remains that neutrino masses aren&#x27;t in the SM.<p>I consider pretty hopeless to keep thinking that you can modify GR like plasticine in all the instances in which putting amounts of matter that doesn&#x27;t radiate works (maybe it works because it&#x27;s there and its effects on other stuff is how you &quot;see&quot; it). It has the appeal of making some people feel like they can call a whole profession or several a bunch of crooks, and that&#x27;s pretty much what it has going for it outside of the scientists working in earnest on it.')
