It&#x27;s a way of trying to portray a certain set of values as intrinsic to a particular national identity. In the context of free speech, it makes sense to frame something which some might consider to be a restriction on free speech to be un-American, given that the American constitution explicitly protects free speech. Calling it anti-American would be a different sentiment.')
