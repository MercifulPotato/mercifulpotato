Over the season, LH comfortably out-qualified everyone [1], and of course comfortably out-raced them as well [2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.racefans.net&#x2F;2019-f1-season&#x2F;2019-f1-statistics&#x2F;2019-f1-qualifying-data&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.racefans.net&#x2F;2019-f1-season&#x2F;2019-f1-statistics&#x2F;2...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.racefans.net&#x2F;2019-f1-season&#x2F;2019-f1-statistics&#x2F;2019-f1-championship-points&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.racefans.net&#x2F;2019-f1-season&#x2F;2019-f1-statistics&#x2F;2...</a><p>.<p>&gt; That genuinely makes me question if Hamilton&#x27;s success isn&#x27;t largely a consequence of Merc&#x27;s well known superiority. On that topic, I think even Bottas has all the qualities and skills to beat Hamilton but he is mentally losing the battle. Imagine if Hamilton had to face someone like Leclerc, Vettel, Sainz, Russel, or even Raikkonen despite his age or even Riccardo or Hulkenberg. If you look at the biography of each one of those, they had it considerably more difficult than Hamilton.<p>We&#x27;re so far apart on this, it&#x27;s probably not worth continuing much further.   But I strongly agree with the other person who replied to you: Hamilton hasn&#x27;t &quot;had it easy&quot; - <i>he&#x27;s put himself in strong positions</i> (McLaren, then Mercedes) and has been supported by strong people (Dennis, Lauda, Wolff, etc.) <i>because</i> he&#x27;s seen as the best overall driver on the grid (qualifying, racing, speed, tyre management, racing temperament, developing and setting up a car, adaptability to different cars &amp; driving styles, etc.). During Hamilton&#x27;s time, probably only Alonso (IMO) comes as close as such a complete package.<p>Ultimately, F1 is a dog-eat-dog world.  If Hamilton didn&#x27;t make himself valuable to his team bosses through his performances --didn&#x27;t make it totally in <i>their</i> interest to continue to employ him-- they&#x27;d drop him and move on to someone else.  So ultimately, either you&#x27;re saying that multiple smart successful team bosses are wrong... or maybe Hamilton really is that good.')
