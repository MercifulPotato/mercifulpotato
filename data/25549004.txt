You want to relight them only once, to ensure that the header tanks and the &quot;downcomer&quot; remain full. Additionally you want to burn off as much speed as possible with the bellyflop, so flipping vertical as late as possible. All combined this means combining the landing burn with the flip is best, as close to landing as possible.')
