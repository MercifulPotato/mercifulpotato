For example, the following parenthetical questions from a small chunk of the &#x27;Translation&#x27; video:<p>&quot;The addition of each amino acid is a three-step cycle; (Why three step?)<p>First the tRNA enters the ribosome at the A-Site (Why does it only enter at the A-Site?  How are other options prevented and&#x2F;or made inconsequential?  Was it always this way?  How did the features of the A-Site evolve for this to happen.  What happened before this? ), and is tested for a codon &#x2F; anti-codon match with the mRNA.  (How is the tRNA tested?  What happens when it fails the test or is missing the amino acid?  What is the energy budget of this test and what are the specific features of the ribosome, RNA, tRNA and amino acid that make it possible?   What happened before this testing was done?  How did we get from the lack of ability to test and the ability to test?)<p>Next, provided there is a correct match, the tRNA is shifted to the P-Site (What is the mechanism of this shifting?  Why does it only go one direction?  What is the energy budget of this process and how is it powered?  How do we prevent multiple tRNA from shifting or keep it from shifting more than one spot?  What occurred before the ribosome&#x2F;RNA&#x2F;tRNA&#x2F;amino-acid had the features to allow this to occur?)&quot;<p>You get the idea.')
