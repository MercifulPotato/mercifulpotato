I&#x27;ve read a similarly impressive account, where a GNU&#x2F;Linux system was revived in comparably wizard-like manner, with Kernel hacker Al Viro involved: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yarchive.net&#x2F;comp&#x2F;linux&#x2F;extreme_system_recovery.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yarchive.net&#x2F;comp&#x2F;linux&#x2F;extreme_system_recovery.html</a><p>It was linked to in an LWN article&#x27;s comment section, titled &quot;If you think you&#x27;re really good, read this.&quot;, or something. The story proved very effective at humbling its reader for me.<p>That doesn&#x27;t change the fact that I, too, once felt like the uncrowned teenage king of emergency system rescue operations back in 2002 or so, right in my parents&#x27; basement. I had started recursively deleting &#x2F; by accident, and ended up with most directories, &#x2F;bin and &#x2F;sbin included, already turned to dust, and most of my as of then proudest achievement - a Gentoo Linux stage 1 installation - gone.<p>I dug myself (and the standing remains of my &#x2F;home) out of that particular hole by virtue of still having an instance of a browser (I think firefox) running. Mildly panicking, I still left everything untouched ... and after a few hours of thinking hard about what to do, I arrived at the following: I set up a webserver on my mom&#x27;s windows PC with am embedded PHP interpreter, and hacked up a script that enabled file uploads via HTTP over the LAN. After using that from within my still-running browser (fortunately, it could still list the contents of my home directory) to evac the most precious artifacts my ~ had in store, I rebooted my machine into the lightless nothingness of not having a kernel image in &#x2F;boot any more. Another few hours later, I had Gentoo reinstalled, and copied the rescued files over to my own machine again - and felt like I had levelled up a little bit.')
