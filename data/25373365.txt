My posts pretty consistently reach #1 on &#x2F;r&#x2F;django because (I suspect) I put substantially more time and effort into them than the average Django guide. I also try quite hard to be a good citizen and give back in a non-promotional way.<p>Edit: I didn&#x27;t know about those numbers&#x2F;terms you added. Will take a look and update my behavior accordingly if necessary.')
