You either do it or you don’t. It doesn’t help to ask yourself how badly you want it or whether it’s worth it or what purpose it serves or to say affirming things to yourself in the mirror. That’s all bullshit easily said by people who just keep going anyway for whatever reason or who can’t make peace with having given up. The marginal utility of tips and tricks and strategies and tactics is inversely proportional to their seductiveness. Don’t waste energy looking for answers. If you make a dollar or a million dollars or don’t build what you wanted or don’t build anything at all, it won’t be because you did or didn’t know why.')
