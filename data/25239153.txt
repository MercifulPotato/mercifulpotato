I did what I&#x27;m currently doing (Ruby on Rails dev) on a 4 GB MacBook Pro until last year and it was fine.<p>At the moment I have around 2 GB free on my 8 GB Linux machine with a webserver, MariaDB, a JetBrains IDE, Slack and Firefox running. It would be easy and dirt cheap to increase the RAM to 16 or 32 GB but I&#x27;m too lazy to even order it and open the machine up since I have never felt the need to have more.<p>I&#x27;m just saying this so that people like me remember that they&#x27;re still professionals and their work is valuable even if they don&#x27;t need 64 GB of RAM.')
