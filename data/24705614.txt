I would argue that perceiving some of the grandeur of the universe may make it difficult for the most common teachings to really resonate without significant modification.<p>Also, for folks who are drawn to religion primarily due to &quot;spiritual&quot; experiences they&#x27;ve had with the religion -- where they experience a loss of self, a one-ness and connected-ness with others, and a distinct sense of clarity -- it may be that having a very similar experience in a non-religious context may lead to new beliefs about what that experience is or means.')
