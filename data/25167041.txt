I should make the time to learn more stuff and never make excuses for why I don&#x27;t.<p>On the other hand, I don&#x27;t think you fully understand where I&#x27;m coming from. &quot;Optimizing for stagnation&quot;, &quot;stuck on the same plateau&quot;. Idk, I just want to run a container. I&#x27;m totally fine being on the same Docker plateau if something like Podman makes me re-learn what I already know how to do.<p>Unlike Git, which, from the start, was different and BETTER than SVN, can you really make the case that Podman would be BETTER if it didn&#x27;t try to follow Docker conventions? If not, what are we talking about here?')
