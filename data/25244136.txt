I’ve watched Youtube videos I&#x27;m subscribing. And whenever I think the background music sounds good, I check if there is a Creative Commons music information on the description section.<p>2. And If there is a YouTube link for the music, I get mp3 by copying the link and pasting it on Youtube Converter like ytmp3.cc<p>3. And I use that music in the Youtube video and give a credit in the description.<p>But I think the process can be improved.<p>1. I think if I can collect almost all of the Creative Commons music shared on Youtube and Soundcloud and rank them properly, It would be very convenient to find good CC music for the video.\nSo I did it. I’ve collected almost 200K musics and I’m ranking them by [Videos using that music] * [View count of each video] * [Freshness of that video].<p>2. I put the function to show original Youtube video for the CC Music and convert it to mp3<p>3. I put the function to copy the credit information for that CC music.\nBonus) I put the function to show the Youtube Videos that contain the background music to feel the mood in the real use cases.<p>Currently, It is not search engine but just a kind of archive of 1,000 CC musics ranked by usage in Youtube Video during November 2020.<p>But If many of the video creators enjoy this demo version, I would add Search functions to search music by Youtube channel, category, mood, BPM and so on.\nThanks.')
