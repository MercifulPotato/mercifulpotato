In case it&#x27;s not obvious, the key feature of this project is that it creates sound effects dynamically at runtime, without any samples or static audio files.<p>So if you twiddle the GUI and find a sound you like, you can then copy the code at the bottom to play that sound in whatever other web project. And since it&#x27;s just code you can add whatever amount of variation to the sound effects without any extra file size.<p>Thanks for having a look!')
