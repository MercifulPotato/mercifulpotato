I&#x27;m surrounded by conservatives; that&#x27;s my world, and guess what? There&#x27;s a lot of discontent with the way election fraud claims are being handled, and despite almost every single one of them having enough firearms to supply a small militia, nobody is even remotely close to even thinking about some sort of armed resistance.<p>You say it&#x27;s dangerous? You need to stop letting mainstream media form your perception of the world. What&#x27;s dangerous is constantly race-baiting people of color like myself and white people against each other.<p>To people who truly love and believe in freedom, your comment is disgusting.<p>Wrong information must be countered and corrected by right information -- not censorship, buddy!')
