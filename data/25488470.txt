Item(by='adwn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608489682, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25487234, text='&gt; <i>I am asexual by choice due to several instances of violent sexual assault.</i><p>I am sorry for what you had to endure. However, I think you&#x27;re using the term &quot;asexual&quot; in a non-standard way, and I believe that has led me and others to misinterpret your original post. One cannot &quot;choose&quot; to be asexual, the same way as one cannot choose to be homosexual or heterosexual. One can, however, choose to be sexually abstinent or inactive. Would you agree that this is a better description of your lifestyle?')
