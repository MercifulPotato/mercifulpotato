See below for the 538 polling average vs. the current NYT tally (% for Biden):<p>PA: 50.2% vs 49.7%<p>FL: 49.1% vs 47.8%<p>TX: 47.4% vs 46.3%<p>OH: 46.8% vs 45.2%<p>IA: 46.3% vs 44.9%<p>NC: 48.9% vs 48.6%<p>WI: 52.1% vs 49.5%<p>MI: 51.2% vs 50.5%<p>GA: 48.5% vs 49.3%<p>AZ: 48.7% vs 48.9%<p>NV: 49.7% vs 49.9%<p>Most are within ~1% or so (some for Biden, some for Trump) with some outliers being Wisconsin (-2.6%), Ohio (-1.6%) and Iowa (-1.4%) in Trump&#x27;s favor still not being so far off (relative to margins of error).<p>I&#x27;m not sure what that &quot;missing&quot; bit in the polls really means (undecided?) but it seems the issue was that that bit of the electorate ended up going entirely for Trump in many places.<p>(edit: had the PA 538 # wrong)')
