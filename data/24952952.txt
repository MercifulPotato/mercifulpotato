People can, and do, accidentally and intentionally, step in front of vehicles. They also intentionally crash vehicles. They won&#x27;t stop because of AVs.<p>Even the fact of suicide by vehicle is complex: AVs can prevent some suicide by driver but possibly raise the risk of pedestrians committing suicide by vehicle. One reason suicide by vehicle happens is because it can conceal the intent to commit suicide. This is compounded by suicide being a taboo subject. This alone will complicate and possibly delay adoption of AVs.<p>Millions of innocent people are injured every year and about a million die every year in road accidents. Cutting that number significantly would have roughly the same impact on global well-being as curing a dread disease.<p>There are potentially hundreds of millions of new customers for vehicles as developing nations grow their middle class. If humans drive those vehicles, hundreds of thousands more will die every year.')
