This is interesting to me as well, but my understanding of the English language is not as good.<p>Some key takeaways:<p>-They use delivery data from different categories of births, including &#x27;complications occurring during the course of labor and delivery&#x27;. Do they account for the conditions in which the babies were born, and then attribute that to the types of doctors handling those deliveries? In other words, do they make a distinction saying emergency white doctors perform worse than emergency black doctors? Because I cannot find that information in the research.<p>-Since doctor race data isn&#x27;t codified in Florida&#x27;s database (where they use the data from), they used web pictures and determine if the doctor is white or black. They narrowed this task down to 4 people who were good at it.<p>-Black female doctors performed the best, they mention some control of the gender but I do not fully understand how they did it.<p>-They used a Latino doctor group as well to account for differences, but found that while there is a distinction, it is much smaller than Black-White.<p>I also don&#x27;t understand if&#x2F;how they control for the quality of the hospital. Is there one bad low income hospital with white doctors in a predominantly black area?')
