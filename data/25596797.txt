Am I being judged&quot;, not the fear of someone shaming you verbally. That actually rarely happens, as that risks real physical escalation.<p>Online, verbally shaming people happens a lot more often as it&#x27;s safer for the shamer, but you need to have essentially the same amount of shamelessness as in the &quot;real world&quot; to not care.<p>In fact, shaming online can be more powerful because those people KNOW who you are. Do you think Jeffrey Toobin would feel more shame if he was caught rubbing one out with his windows open as just some guy in his apartment and his neighbors seeing him, or on Zoom with his colleagues?')
