Because they want to offset the &quot;value&quot; of the feed, against the implied cost of their news aggregation under the coming Australian mandated payment for news content.<p>I don&#x27;t have much skin in this game despite being an Australian, I think the main thing for me is the complete mis-characterisation of the A&#x2F;B test, and what it means.<p>We do A&#x2F;B testing all the time. There might be an ethics issue in this, much as Facebook experimenting on sad&#x2F;happy news raised issues, but I think this is on the evidence something google HAS to do, to balance out the economics of the cost&#x2F;benefit across this area. I think its heading to some kind of least-cost reconciliation, not unlike peer settlement.<p>Disclaimer: this is my theory. I don&#x27;t work for google. I know google staffers of some years, and ex-staffers. This wasn&#x27;t informed by talking to them.<p>I said as much in the Graun comment-is-free space too.')
