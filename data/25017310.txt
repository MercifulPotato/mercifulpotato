Just this week, I had to open the Cherry switch on a Race keyboard [1] to modify the spring a bit. On a normal cherry, four small flathead screwdrivers can be used to pry the top off to access the switch internals after just popping off the keycap. With backlighting, though, the keyboard case needs to be opened and the LED needs to be desoldered before the top of the key comes off. The actually soldering it back in place is a pain as the leads just barely make it out of the hole, and that hole had better be clear of solder. Most modern boards are also ROHS compliant, so they&#x27;re using high-temp leadless solder, which is more of a pain to solder, requires a high-temp soldering iron, and has a higher chance of causing thermal damage if you don&#x27;t get the parts together quickly.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mechanicalkeyboards.com&#x2F;shop&#x2F;index.php?l=product_detail&amp;p=759" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mechanicalkeyboards.com&#x2F;shop&#x2F;index.php?l=product_det...</a>')
