If Republican voters who preferred the Democrat to the Progressive candidate had falsely specified the Democrat as their first choice, they could have changed the election outcome in favor of a candidate they would have preferred over the winner that IRV elected.<p><i>I don&#x27;t think anyone would argue that first-past-the-post would have produced a better candidate in this election than RCV did.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think so either, but I also think that&#x27;s a straw man argument. The Condorcet winner would&#x27;ve been the Democrat. IRV elected the Progressive, but according to that same Wiki page FPTP would have likely elected the Republican, whereas the Democrat would have likely won under systems like approval or score.')
