We bought a baby monitor in 2012 that was probably $80 (Philips brand I think). It was based off the DECT standard that was developed for wireless landline phones, so range was around 1200ft line-of-sight, in practice you could go two stories down in our apartment building to visit friends and it would stay connected just fine.<p>The baby unit was quite bulky and ran off wall power, but the parent unit was significantly smaller than a modern phone and had a loud speaker plus a really strong vibration mode. And if it lost the signal from the baby unit, it made a hell of a racket to let you know you were out of range. It also transmitted temperature. Can&#x27;t say we ever had trouble with it running out of battery either.<p>I mean, I get the appeal of hacking just as much as the next guy. But IMO it makes no sense to hack on something like a baby monitor, where there is very little to be gained over off-the-shelf products, and where the consequences of a hardware or software failure can be that your baby is left crying unattended for a long time.<p>Go grab an ESP32 and some WS2813s to pimp your stroller instead, much more fun.')
