I expect that he is another faker, like John McCain, whose father was a full admiral.  Were either of these characters even PoWs?  I doubt it.<p>These people are not to be respected.  They are our governors.  They tell stories and lies.  To manipulate us into thinking we deserve to be governed by them.  And they like to portray themselves as heroes to be worshipped.  All lies.<p>If we use some skepticism - which, I know we all profess to do - we don&#x27;t know that any of this is true!  Its not true because it says so in some online source.<p>All I can see is another soft-sell, soft-spin of some character, that in a more moral dimension, would likely have been sent to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity.')
