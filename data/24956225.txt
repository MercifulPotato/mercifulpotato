Item(by='Kwpolska', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604188233, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24955779, text='&gt; In iOS Safari, using the font for entering HN comments, ℂℍℙℚ renders a bit taller and bolder for me. ℝ and ℤ render taller, but not bolder. Why beats me.<p>Font fallback. HN specifies Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif. Geneva has the six characters mentioned. The rest will be rendered using a different font that covers more parts of Unicode, or that covers Unicode math specifically. With the built-in system fonts, that would be Cambria Math on Windows and one of the STIX fonts on macOS.<p>(Source: Firefox → Inspect Element → Fonts tab of the right Inspector pane. Chrome can do that too in a slightly different place, macOS Safari is too user-hostile to have this feature.)')
