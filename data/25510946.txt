It stopped showing a picture but I get a white flicker at the base of the screen every few seconds.<p>I could (and probably should) investigate fixing it but it was easier to buy a 2160p Philips for $240.   Only issue with the Philips is it doesn&#x27;t have a VESA mount and it would be difficult to make some sort of jury-rigging work.<p>I run them attached to a Mac Mini and use the DisplayPort on the monitor.  At one point I believe HDMI (or maybe just the Mac) wouldn&#x27;t do 1440p.  I&#x27;m copying stuff from an Intel Mac mini to an M1 and I&#x27;m able to toggle back and forth using HDMI for the Intel just fine.')
