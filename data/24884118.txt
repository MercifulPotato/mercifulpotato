As someone who happens to live at a location where normal time aligns pretty well with solar time, that makes dst feel extra bit silly. For reference, today solar noon happens at 12:04 local time. During spring the difference is greater, e.g. in late March (before switch to dst) solar noon will be at 12:25 local time. But the final irony is that dst shifts the time in wrong direction, pushing the solar noon to 13:xx during summer!')
