Skyward Sword has more compact dungeons, sure, but I actually found them to be easier than Twilight Princess&#x27;s. Sure, Twilight Princess is pretty big and a bit empty at times, but I feel this is just a setting thing. (Skyward Sword&#x27;s overworld is kind of a weaker, larger dungeon to be honest.)')
