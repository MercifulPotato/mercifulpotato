It&#x27;s partly platform lock in, because it&#x27;s probably a pain to switch, but I like to think it&#x27;s also we solve a majority of their needs at a decent price and provide good support. So why would they switch? I think it also helps that we are generally targeting that small to medium size company. Or even smaller departments&#x2F;teams within larger companies. So we&#x27;re not subject to the whims of a C-suite that is looking to cut 5% off their budget every quarter.')
