The authority simply considered it undesirable that slaves fled.<p>Many behaviors that correlate very negatively with success are not considered mental disorders, for they the authority considers them desirable.<p>And of course, it&#x27;s an entirely circular argument. There are also some disorders that correlate very negatively with success and thus called disorders, but the disorder is more or less “not caring about success”. — there are disorders characterized by the subject&#x27;s indifference how he is socially perceived.')
