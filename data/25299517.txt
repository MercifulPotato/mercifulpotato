Item(by='cambalache', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607062012, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25296469, text='&gt; When I refereed the Science paper, I asked why the authors directly verified the results of their experiment only for up to 26-30 photons, relying on plausible extrapolations beyond that. While directly verifying the results of n-photon BosonSampling takes ~2n time for any known classical algorithm, I said, surely it should be possible with existing computers to go up to n=40 or n=50? A couple weeks later, the authors responded, saying that theyâ€™d now verified their results up to n=40, but it burned $400,000 worth of supercomputer time so they decided to stop there. This was by far the most expensive referee report I ever wrote!<p>They should have requested  AWS free credits :)')
