Just chip away at stuff until you feel like the risk level is acceptable to you.<p>For me, that started with email. Email is a root for a lot of your digital identity.<p>I can&#x27;t guarantee access to @gmail addresses going forward, but I can at least _start_ fixing that problem. I picked up a new domain, hosted the email with someone else, and set all my other accounts to forward to it. I updated a few really critical things right away, but for the most part it&#x27;s just as I go log into various accounts with the old email address, I update it.<p>I didn&#x27;t really bother trying to migrate the email out of my gmail account. Instead I did a bulk download from Google Takeout so I know I _can_ access that old email if I really need to find something.<p>Six months or so in, the bulk of my identity is now tied to a domain that _I_ own, and email hosted with someone I can trust more than Google.<p>It&#x27;s not perfect, but already the impact if Google were to suspend my account has dropped immensely.<p>Cutting Google completely is something you do on principle. Instead, just look at what the impact of losing access to various services would be and address those specifically. (E.g., losing drive? Switch to NextCloud if availability is a concern; or set up a regular Takeout download if data loss only is a concern but an interruption in availability is okay, etc)')
