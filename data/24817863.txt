Very nice platform and lots of bang for the buck, paying ~$40&#x2F;month for Intel Core i7-980, 2x HDD SATA 2,0 TB, 1x SSD SATA 250 GB, 3x RAM 8192 MB DDR3 and unlimited traffic. Hard to beat really.<p>Only gripe is that they only have servers in Europe, wish they had at least North&#x2F;South American + Asian centers too.')
