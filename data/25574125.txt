I&#x27;m not even seeing any obvious indications it&#x27;s been denoised.<p>As someone who works in the VFX industry, faking reflections on wobbling&#x2F;flexing glass screens (static ones are easy) is actually pretty difficult to do right, and I doubt they would have added the camera operators if they were faking it.<p>Some of the aspects making people think this is CG are the diffuse lighting (no obvious hard shadows or occlusion), very clean robots, &quot;weird&quot; (i.e. not normal, but I believe it&#x27;s honest for the robots) motion, and lack of sound.')
