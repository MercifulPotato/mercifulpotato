When people aren&#x27;t spending, more is created. When people spend a lot, it gets removed from circulation.<p>&gt; We have a tiny number of massive pockets. The entire financial order ends up depending on the reliability of a handful of high net worth individuals to play along with the current scheme.<p>High net worth individuals by the way? They&#x27;re absolutely not sitting on dollars, they own assets. Real estate, stocks, bonds, and some nutters, crypto. That means inflation is irrelevant to them, and all that matters is the performance of their investments relative to the benchmark rates.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s no surprise then that governments ends up wanting to control and limit how these high net worth individuals spend or invest their money.<p>Not really, no. Fiscal and social policy control the distribution of wealth. Progressive taxation and redistribution reduces inequality. This applies equally no matter what we&#x27;re using as currency. If we switched to BTC, to sea shells, to zombie killing ammunition, fiscal and social policy would apply just as it does now.<p>Monetary policy operates on a lower level, it controls only the supply.')
