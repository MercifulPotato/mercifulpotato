Item(by='shawabawa3', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610710108, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25788409, text='Article seems mostly accurate but there&#x27;s a mistake in understanding about the Whale Alert tweets<p>&gt; What’s more, the supposed USD inputs (e.g., 401,431,056 USD in the top left transaction) are giving perfectly round Tether outputs (e.g., 400,000,000 USDT in the same transaction) in every block — regardless of the prevailing exchange rate or anything else.<p>Whale Alert uses exchange rates to convert currencies in the post. The &quot;USD inputs&quot; are simply the USDT that was minted converted using a USD&#x2F;USDT exchange price (I&#x27;m not sure which one)<p>Whale Alert has also hard-coded USD&#x2F;USDC to 1:1, which is why the coinbase pro minting Tweets match exactly')
