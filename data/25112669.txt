The US is going to struggle to actually distribute the Pfizer vaccine. It&#x27;s not like your local CVS has a freezer that goes down to -70C. Dry ice is possible but there&#x27;s a shortage of that, too. Nobody has ever distributed a vaccine that needs to be stored at -70C.<p>The Moderna one is much easier, you just need a normal freezer. Which is fine for developed countries, will still be a challenge elsewhere (but one they&#x27;re used to, it&#x27;s not the first vaccine that needs to be kept cold)')
