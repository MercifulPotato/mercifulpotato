It&#x27;s far lighter and easier to work with than EKS. I haven&#x27;t tried GKE so I can&#x27;t speak to that comparison.<p>All I&#x27;ve ever really wanted is: &quot;take this container with this config and auto-scale it for me&quot;.<p>Of course it should also be run in a private network, have blue-green deploys, auto-restart containers on failure, have geographic redundancy, etc. etc. but I don&#x27;t want to have to think about any of that.<p>Fargate gets reasonably close to this ideal.')
