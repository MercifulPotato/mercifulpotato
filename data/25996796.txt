The default setting will have issues to convert TV range properly to PC range so the video is &quot;washed out&quot;. I see no such issue with any other players like MPC-BE, MPC-CE, or MPV. If I remembered correctly I have to manually change the renderer mode or whatever it&#x27;s called to make it work. To be fair, I didn&#x27;t experiment much since I&#x27;m content with MPV.')
