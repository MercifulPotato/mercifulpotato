Maybe you&#x27;d have CNN if you had cable, which a lot of people didn&#x27;t have. I could guarantee you right here that <i>none</i> of them would platform extreme viewpoints, and the country was much better off for it. I guess if you lived in NYC you&#x27;d have a few more options, but they were still pretty limited. And none of these were interactive in any way we&#x27;d recognize: maybe, at the most, you&#x27;d get a letter to the editor published if you got lucky.<p>The idea where anyone could say anything and be given a massive platform on an international social network that most of the population uses is a very, very new development.<p>Algorithm-driven social media where anyone can post whatever is actively harmful to our country. Right now, if you view any YouTube videos about WW2, you&#x27;ll start getting videos &quot;explaining&quot; that the Holocaust was a hoax in your recommendations. If you&#x27;re thinking about getting into hunting, and you look up gun reviews on YouTube, your recommendations are going to fill up with &quot;Stop the Steal&quot; and QAnon and other boogaloo propaganda. This is the kind of behavior that, if allowed to continue, will absolutely and utterly burn down society.')
