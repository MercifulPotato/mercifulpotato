Item(by='madhadron', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607274755, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25324140, text='&gt; I sometimes have this thought at the back of my mind about using the same reading time for books instead.<p>This implies that books are inherently superior. But sometimes the author&#x27;s content isn&#x27;t a book length. (I see this a lot in books from Harvard Business Review where what is really called for is a dense article, but that doesn&#x27;t put a book on the author&#x27;s resume.)<p>Some arguments are intrinsically long. Building up an understanding of thermodynamics (not just a summary of its formulation) is certainly book length. Scheidel&#x27;s &#x27;Escape from Rome&#x27; is not going to fit into an article.<p>So I don&#x27;t really balance. Sometimes I have a big book in flight and that&#x27;s going to take a lot of my attention. Sometimes I don&#x27;t, but I have a number of interesting articles. I aim to optimize the enrichment I get instead.')
