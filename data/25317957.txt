The main page isn&#x27;t organized chronologically. And while the archive lists seasons, Seasons 3-8 all have the same modification date in 2019, whereas Seasons 9-11 all have the same modification date in 2018. Consequently, I have no idea when these audio shows were recorded. Moreover, there are no descriptions of the contents to tell the listener which topics are discussed, so that they can choose to listen to one that piques their interest.')
