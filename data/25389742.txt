Maybe the existing curve will continue for another 30 years. Maybe it will continue for another 30 days.<p>If it continues for 30 years, we&#x27;re fine. If it peters out before solar+batteries are cheap enough, we still need nuclear and we&#x27;re that far behind where we would be if we started building it now.<p>Worst case if we build it now is that we have some nuclear plants that cost somewhat more to generate power than future technologies will (but still in line with existing prices). Worst case if we don&#x27;t is we get more climate change. Which one is more expensive?')
