As another commenter points out, we need to zoom out quite a bit more.<p>SF, for example, was a popular place to live before it was a tech hub.  Even if all the companies go away (they won&#x27;t), there will still be plenty of demand.  Maybe it will be a healthier sort of demand that doesn&#x27;t push lower-income residents out of their homes.  But there will still be demand, and it will grow as COVID becomes further behind us.<p>For a lot of the people who moved back in with their parents, I think social circles will be an important factor.  I know if I&#x27;d moved away, I&#x27;d be anxious to see my friends again, and live close to them.  That doesn&#x27;t mean everyone will end up back where they started, but some will.  Others might band together and pick a new, smaller city or town to live in.  Some social circles won&#x27;t get back together, and some will split into new combinations.  Some might see it as an opportunity to move to a new city where some old friends have lived for years.  Still others might decide to stay with their parents, especially if they&#x27;re older and may not be around much longer.<p>Also consider that only something like 30% or 40% of the workforce has been working from home during COVID.  Everyone else works in restaurants, bars, state and local government agencies, retail and grocery stores, hospitals, universities, and a host of other things that require a physical presence everywhere.  There&#x27;s no &quot;grocery hub&quot; like there&#x27;s a &quot;tech hub&quot; or &quot;entertainment hub&quot;.  Every city and town needs a hospital or clinic and people to staff it, telemedicine notwithstanding.  Those professions will continue to grow with the US&#x27;s population, which will drive more demand everywhere, including cities.')
