Germany surrendered in May of 1945, before the Trinity test (first test of a nuclear device) in July!<p>&gt; I&#x27;d like to point out the two bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki as retaliation for Pearl Habour.<p>This is far too simple - it&#x27;s widely accepted that there were multiple reasons for using the bombs that do not include simple revenge. Most notable were the estimates of allied casualties to invade mainland Japan after the experience of clearing islands during the Pacific campaign.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that consent to use the bombs was required and given by the British per the Quebec Agreement of 1943.')
