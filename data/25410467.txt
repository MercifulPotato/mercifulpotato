It was, as others are saying, 120% time, at least if you care about actually moving upward on the career ladder.<p>Paradoxically, this makes it a good policy _for Google_: if you&#x27;re an idiot, you&#x27;ll put in 120% effort and Google gets more work per dollar from you (and gets to deny promo because you &quot;spent too much time on your 20% project&quot;, as well), if you&#x27;re not an idiot, you will work 8 hours a day, but then spending 20% of time on things unrelated to your next promo completely dooms your chances of getting it. Some people used to take advantage of this, truth be told you&#x27;re paid pretty well even at the senior level, and Google expects most people stay at that level indefinitely. Although then there&#x27;s the question of why one wouldn&#x27;t just take it easy at work and spend their spare time on hobbies instead that Google won&#x27;t own the output of.<p>OTOH some people are taken in by the Google mythos, and they think spending 20% of their time on semi-random shit is _conducive_ to their career advancement. You get disabused of that notion after applying for a promo even once, which is when any experiments with 20% usually cease.<p>Exceptions are few and far between.

They don&#x27;t.')
