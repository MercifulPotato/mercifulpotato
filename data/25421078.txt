And that’s before it went off and printed another 17.5 billion tethers. So what’s backing all those?<p>So 7&#x2F;8 of tethers have been printed in the last ~20 months? Is there any reason to think they&#x27;ve increased their cash holdings by anything like $17.5b in that time? They claim to have increased it from $1.85b to something close to $20b since April 2019?')
