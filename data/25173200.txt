The causation in two arguments is reversed, however (poor -&gt; mental disorder, mental disorder -&gt; poor), and this is where the OP&#x27;s argument fits, I think... you become more likely to develop mental disorders because of certain aspects of poverty (malnutrition? bad habits&#x2F;lifestyle? etc.), however for someone who believes in personal responsibility, that may be to a significant degree because you &quot;didn&#x27;t do better&quot;.')
