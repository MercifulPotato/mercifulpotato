(feed the card reader, file printouts). We disabled overprint on student jobs because it caused a lot of headaches from bugs. Form feed in an infinite loop was enough hassle.<p>The original IBM printer did not document + for overprint, it was the result of a logic optimization in the controller and someone discovered it. So IBM installed a field change order that disabled that function, but included a switch that for an additional monthly fee would upgrade your printer to a model that supported it.<p>The automatic openning of the lid at the end of a box of paper destroyed coffee cups on a regular basis.')
