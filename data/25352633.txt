Every single one of these articles always mentions &quot;nation-state actors&quot; to imply that only a nation-state with billions of dollars and thousands of people can pull off such a &quot;sophisticated&quot; &quot;novel&quot; attack. That is unequivocal garbage. I have never had a CISO (or any other high-level security executive) of a multi-billion dollar company ever answer the question: &quot;How much would it cost to critically compromise your systems and do an unrecoverable amount of damage?&quot; with a number higher than $1,000,000. $1,000,000 is a rounding error to these companies. $1,000,000 is a rounding error in a rounding error to a sizable nation-state. These systems are not just insecure against nation-state attackers, they are insecure against organizations with the staggering weight of 3-10 people. Or, to use a quote from the recent Project Zero blogpost on the iOS exploit said: &quot;one person, working alone in their bedroom, was able to build a capability which would allow them to seriously compromise iPhone users they&#x27;d come into close contact with.&quot; That is a far cry from being secure against credible threats to a multi-billion dollar business by any stretch of the imagination.<p>Are systems more secure now than they were in the past? Maybe. A targeted attack against an arbitrary target would generally take a few 10 to 100s of thousands of dollars. This is probably orders of magnitude more than the past of teenagers hacking for giggles. But, there are like 6-8 orders of magnitude between teenagers hacking for giggles and a &quot;nation-state actor&quot; and about 3 orders of magnitude between a random company&#x2F;organization and a nation-state. The best systems deployed systems are about as close to adequate as a house is to a skyscraper.')
