Usually it&#x27;s calculated so that any excess deaths is pretty rare which is what makes it a good metric.<p>With year on year increase in deaths I&#x27;m not sure I could convince myself it was significant unless I had a chart and a calculator in front of me. A year over year death increase, even a large one, seems like it would occur pretty often. Even a large increase in the increase doesn&#x27;t sound like it would be significant -- wouldn&#x27;t that be pretty sensitive to the shape of the population relative to age? And I&#x27;m not sure what that looks like off the top of my head. There&#x27;s a lot to adjust for, and you need to be sure you&#x27;re not just rolling dice at the end with the numbers.<p>My point is it&#x27;s not really a good metric. There&#x27;s plenty of reasons why it would jump around, and I&#x27;m not smart enough to adjust for all the necessary variables in my head. It&#x27;s not obvious how much we should expect it to jump around. But maybe others here just know their US demographic data better than me.')
