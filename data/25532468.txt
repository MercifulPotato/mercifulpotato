Item(by='diarrhea', descendants=None, kids=[25532816], score=None, time=1608851828, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25532140, text='A popular path is to ditch Lightroom for the trio of Rapid Photo Downloader, digikam and finally RawTherapee.<p>This was entirely unusable for me. RawTherepee is only for RAW treatment&#x2F;export. Digikam can only do photo organization. Now here&#x27;s the kicker: the two won&#x27;t talk. Metadata known and written by one is invisible to the other. Using Manjaro, Rapid Photo Downloader eventually started segfaulting on me.<p>I also tried Darktable which looked <i>much</i> better and much more like a Lightroom replacement, but didn&#x27;t like it.<p>So back to Lightroom, and even Windows as a whole, it is for me.')
