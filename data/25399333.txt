In a city if you dig a trench that&#x27;s a huge pain, because the city is paved or built on everywhere, but in rural areas it&#x27;s no hassle. With modern agricultural practices a <i>relatively</i> shallow trench is enough that the fibre won&#x27;t be disturbed by subsequent farming activity, these days nobody churns up half the planet to grow stuff because we know that destroying soil structure reduces long term productivity.<p>And as to those &quot;network elements&quot; it&#x27;s GPON, the elements are passive splitters, basically a fancy prism, completely passive. There&#x27;s only bit of actual electronics in each region but it&#x27;s quite a bit fancier than a &quot;gigabit switch&quot; because it&#x27;s multiplexing the light for all the nodes behind the GPON splitters.')
