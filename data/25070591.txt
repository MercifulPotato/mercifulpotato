Must disagree...the reason for DI is to support the Dependency Inversion Principle : &quot;High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g. interfaces).&quot; Won&#x27;t even go into the host of side-benefits that are gained from adhering to the DIP.<p>In C# the idiomatic way to achieve this is via constructor injection, which is made much easier to manage in ASP.Net with a DI library that works with the framework for you (either the built in one or AutoFac &#x2F; SimpleInjector, etc.). But you don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to use a library; many times I&#x27;m writing a simple-ish console app and just use good old &quot;Poor Man&#x27;s DI&quot; where I manually construct my object graphs at startup.')
