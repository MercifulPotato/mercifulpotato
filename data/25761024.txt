He also shouldn&#x27;t be publicly posting in an excited way about banning them. Finally, only right-wingers and generally people who don&#x27;t like antifa  capitalize every letter of ANTIFA, so that just further makes this post horrible PR, and seems like he&#x27;s gleefully banning political views he doesn&#x27;t agree with.')
