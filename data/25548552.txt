But newer processor features (like AVX) don’t “renew” the patents on the older features. So when AVX-512 was patented, it didn’t change the expiration dates for AVX2 and prior.<p>The base requirements for x86-64 mandate SSE2 IIRC. Those patents expired this year, so Apple was now able to release an x86-64 “emulator” without negotiating patents.')
