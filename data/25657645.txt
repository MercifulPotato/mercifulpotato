GA collects more personal data, you get better insight of your audience. This is important if you do online marketing and like to see how well your campaigns perform. GA does track visitors across days and you can therefore see if someone came back after a week and made a purchase.<p>In case you don&#x27;t do that or are simply not interested in specifics, all the alternatives are good enough right now, I think. You can still tell how visitors navigate your page, what content they visit most and all that stuff. We are currently thinking about what we can add to gain more insight for businesses, without invading privacy as Google does.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pirsch.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pirsch.io&#x2F;</a>')
