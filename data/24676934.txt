[1] Are all 12 million Uyghurs in camps? Or is it also a disproportionate amount like in the US? Estimates say about 3 million are in camps, so about 25%. So, statistically anyway, the US seems a bit worse so far.<p>&gt; Concentration camp in America = break the law by entering the country illegally and need to be processed before you&#x27;re deported.<p>A concentration camp is a concentration camp regardless of the justification.<p>[1].  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;06&#x2F;share-of-black-white-hispanic-americans-in-prison-2018-vs-2006&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;06&#x2F;share-of-bl...</a>')
