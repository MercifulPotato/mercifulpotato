Established banks are very good at handling reversed charges in the case of mistakes, fraud, and ESPECIALLY glitches.  In the case of a glitch, banks _do_ have authorities that can mutate the system to fix things.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t have experience with very large sums of cash, but I own a house and I have opened and closed a few investment accounts.  I never felt the need to sent test payments through the system first.  If the bank had screwed up, I&#x27;m sure it would have been a lot of trouble to fix, but it would have been fixable, no doubt.')
