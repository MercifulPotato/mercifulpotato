Tax <i>everything</i> based on the unimproved value of the land.  Unoccupied homes and apartments become money-losers, and owners are forced to sell them to people who <i>would</i> rent them out or occupy them, or else it becomes a money-losing enterprise.  No need to figure out what&#x27;s occupied or unoccupied, and no loopholes.  Just tax the externality and let the market figure out the rest.')
