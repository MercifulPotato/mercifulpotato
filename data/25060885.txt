Something like:<p>Configly.init(API_KEY, { values: [keyOne, keyTwo]})\n&#x2F;&#x2F; (other code runs)\nprint(configly.shared().get(&#x27;keyOne&#x27;)) &#x2F;&#x2F; would be cached by the background thread<p>but was slightly concerned about unwanted bandwidth&#x2F;battery usage for mobile users but perhaps that mode would be useful exactly for the situation you describe.')
