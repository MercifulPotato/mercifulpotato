If somebody is knocking on my door, in the middle of the night, claiming to be a police officer, then making phone calls to verify that is 100% reasonable.  If I had just been fired for politically motivated reasons, then making phone calls to alert the media when your home is being raided is 100% reasonable.<p>&gt; Theyâ€™ll most likely even find it boring and start skipping ahead to more knocking without a response.<p>Police are allowed to be bored.  Police are allowed to sit outside a house and wait.  It does them no harm, and does not justify them using additional force when serving the warrant.')
