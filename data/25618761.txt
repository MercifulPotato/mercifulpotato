Especially since plenty of Russian vessels utilize vertical launch systems. I believe the necessity of the angled launch systems like what you&#x27;d find on the Kirov, Slava, and Kara  classes were more due to the immense size of those missiles. Look at the U.S. Talos and UK &quot;Sea Slug&quot; missiles for western examples.  As missile technology became better and more miniaturized, you start seeing more vertical launch systems where it makes sense.<p>The one area I&#x27;ve seen consistent arguments for horizontal launch are in places where a missile failure (see above) would be much more dangerous, such as on a carrier deck. This is why I believe you still see Sea Sparrow and SeaRAM systems placed on the wings and below the deckline, so that a failed launch won&#x27;t land back on a deck full of fuel and ordinance. The ranges that point defense systems are working at can&#x27;t allow for a missile body to &quot;tip over&quot; and still hit the target at range.')
