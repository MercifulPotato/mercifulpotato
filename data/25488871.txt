(Lobster mitigates this with other aspects of their memory model, I&#x27;m not sure if vlang does)<p>* Vulnerable to cycle leaks. IIUC vlang has no weak refs to break these cycles yet.<p>* Space overhead per object to store the RC.<p>Still, its nice to see more languages not using GC. Hopefully as Lobster innovates, vlang can adopt more of their techniques.')
