They are however the most convenient platforms to use because of various reasons, however we&#x27;re not talking about having a right to convenience - we&#x27;re talking about having the right to free speech, which everyone still does in America and on the internet.<p>Some advice: if you&#x27;re going to have a mob boss and wannabe tyrant like Trump and rally your followers on a platform, I&#x27;d recommend using, depending on, technology layers of owners who are aligned with you and okay with inciting of violence; Trump goes on Fox News to say whatever the fuck he wants to millions of people while saying he&#x27;s being prevented from free speech - come on now people, let&#x27;s come back to reality and stop getting sucked into the gaslighting.')
