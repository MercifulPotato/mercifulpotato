If we measure something that looks like 0, we can&#x27;t be sure if it&#x27;s just below the sensitivity of our instruments.<p>For neutrinos, even if we accelerated an rocket and somehow checked if a neutrino was at rest relative to it, we might find that it&#x27;s not. That means we won&#x27;t know if we need more speed or if it&#x27;s impossible. I suppose it&#x27;s a bit easier than that because we only have to accelerate the rocket fast enough that the neutrino&#x27;s speed becomes measurably less than c, rather than 0. But still, what if we can&#x27;t even get it to go fast enough for that? No way to prove that it&#x27;s travelling at c, it seems.<p>I&#x27;d like to add that even photons have a nonzero upper bound to their possible rest mass. At least they used to. Is there any way, in principle, to show that it&#x27;s exactly zero, and thus falls into this distinct category?')
