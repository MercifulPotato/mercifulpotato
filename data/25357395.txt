Higher education facilities will raise prices because people that work at those facilities like more money than less money. The customers have infinite amounts of money due to being able to borrow as much as they want, and donâ€™t have fully formed brains nor the requisite education or guidance to be able to calculate return on investment to make an informed decision.')
