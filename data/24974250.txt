In particular, you seem to think a service is something that operates on resources called &#x27;instances&#x27;. Here&#x27;s the Wikipedia definition of a web service:<p>&gt; a server running on a computer device, listening for requests at a particular port over a network, serving web documents (HTML, JSON, XML, images), which serve in solving specific domain problems over the Web (WWW, Internet, HTTP)<p>Clearly IAM is a service.<p>Further, the service needn&#x27;t operate on resources called &quot;instances&quot; in order to provide value--few AWS services offer &quot;instance&quot; resources and yet they deliver value to customers and are consequently priced. IAM isn&#x27;t priced directly, but rather the operating cost for the service is built into other AWS services, presumably to encourage people towards security best-practices (charging for IAM might dissuade users from building securely).')
