Item(by='jscholes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609992430, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25667114, text='&gt; Do you also take exception to braile translations replacing &quot;red button&quot; with &quot;third button down&quot;?<p>This is a different case for two significant reasons:<p>1. Utilising purely sensory references in web materials is a violation of WCAG success criterion 1.3.3, Sensory Characteristics (level A)[1].  Naturally, if you&#x27;re physically brailling something, it&#x27;s probably not web content but the point still stands: if your web page tells people to press the red button on the left it&#x27;s not accessible to some.<p>2. By including alternative instructions in some form&#x2F;format (or just making them inclusive from the start), you&#x27;re not asking anybody to out themselves as having a permanent or circumstantial disability.  You&#x27;re just preparing for the case that they do.  This is assuming the alternative option is available to everyone (e.g. on a web page or as a physical braille sign), rather than as something that is locked away and must be explicitly requested.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;WAI&#x2F;WCAG21&#x2F;Understanding&#x2F;sensory-characteristics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;WAI&#x2F;WCAG21&#x2F;Understanding&#x2F;sensory-characte...</a>')
