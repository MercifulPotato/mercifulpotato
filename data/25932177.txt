Item(by='zelphirkalt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611773404, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25929191, text='Actually I would not create any Clothing class or abstract thing, but instead probably create a structure, which is named something like &quot;product&quot; and then let it have a flexible attributes container. For example it could have: id, categories, price, product-attributes. Where product-attributes is a key-value thing. categories would be either a hierarchy or tags, but probably tags, as they avoid issues with inventing artificial hierarchies later.<p>This way I would never need to make a class &quot;shirt&quot; or &quot;pant&quot; or whatever. I would simply add categories for them. Way simpler than encoding this stuff in some class hierarchy. There is that word again, hierarchy. The problem with those is always, that sometimes you will have an item, which fits into 2 sibling categoies or into 2 parts of the tree, which are not on the same path. With classes you will need multi inheritance or you will need to come up with a new parent of both of the classes.')
