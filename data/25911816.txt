Search around online forums for involuntary commitment and you&#x27;ll see lots of horror stories. There are even news articles about it.[0]<p>If a homeless person can get back on their feet, then they are a full member of society with all the same rights as everyone else. If they get institutionalized, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, then that&#x27;ll be a mark that follows them around. They will be denied some rights.[1] A patient at such a facility often has fewer rights than even people in prison. At least in prison if your time is up then you&#x27;ll be released.<p>The problems don&#x27;t stop there either. Misdiagnoses are common. Even when they aren&#x27;t, it&#x27;s likely that the treatment they offer has no or minimal effect. It&#x27;s also possible that the trauma of being in such a facility causes issues of its own.<p>I can completely understand why people would prefer to struggle with their problems as homeless, but <i>free</i>, rather than go to such a facility.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seattletimes.com&#x2F;seattle-news&#x2F;times-watchdog&#x2F;public-crisis-private-toll-free-to-check-in-but-not-to-leave-washington-mental-health-care&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seattletimes.com&#x2F;seattle-news&#x2F;times-watchdog&#x2F;pub...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reason.com&#x2F;volokh&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;10&#x2F;the-second-amendment-and-people-who-had-been-involuntarily-committed-20-years-ago&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reason.com&#x2F;volokh&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;10&#x2F;the-second-amendment-an...</a>')
