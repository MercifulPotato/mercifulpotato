Only one nail is necessary to hold it in place. If that isn&#x27;t the case, you can offset the nail positions by 2 cm. If the nail is broken, they can cheaply be replaced. Nailed MDF backboards are completely standard even for very expensive furniture. Removing the nails is trivial given the right tool, but can also very easily be done with a kitchen knife.')
