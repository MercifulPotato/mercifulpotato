That’s crazy simple – it allows you to import xlsx spreadsheet file with data into your system with defined TypeScript types. Basically you need xlsx file which has data in it, and it can have any form you want, use this library and all the data is on its place in your system. Well, best way to understand it is to see samples here:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Siemienik&#x2F;xlsx-import&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;samples<p>Additionally I’ll give you some example here:\nLet’s imagine that you have sales department in your company, and all of your sales teams are working on xlsx files. They even have xlsx file with all their inventory that they are selling. But you have a system which has same inventory in it packed with all the data and lot of formulas. Sales team has to use your system, but they also want to use their xlsx file which has very specific form. All they want to do is to edit their file and import it to your system to create specific entry with this data – e.g. sales campaign with prices and inventory, which can be used by the rest of the company. You can do that very easily with this library. You just need to have to have this xlsx spreadsheet with defined TypeScript types and you are good to go! Sales will be working with their favourite tool and you will have it all in your system :)<p>What do you think about that? Would you use this library? If you have any ideas how it can be used or you think you have idea how to use it but don’t know it will fit, let’s discuss about it! :) We’ll try to describe how it can be used in your project.<p>Besides that we will be very thankful for leaving stars here -  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Siemienik&#x2F;xlsx-import<p>It will make this library a lot more visible for other devs and push its development forward :)')
