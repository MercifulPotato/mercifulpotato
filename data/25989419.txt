From a risk&#x2F;error prevention point of view, it&#x27;s not that different from writing software for a single local machine: not every programmer needs to know how to manually do memory management, it makes a lot more sense to rely on your OS and malloc (and friends) for this, but the caveat is that you do need to account for the fact that malloc may fail. In the cloud case, one can&#x27;t just assume that you&#x27;ll always be able to provision a new instance, scale up a service, etc. The cloud is like a utility company: normally very reliable, but they do fail too.')
