People’s mouths and noses are disgusting, and a common source of non-lethal aerosolized diseases. Prior to COVID people used to sneeze and cough all over everything in public without even thinking about it, and I used to get colds all the time. Haven’t even got the sniffles since masks became mandated. Sure, sample size of one, and all. I’ll probably continue to wear a mask in public after this all goes away.  When I see an unmasked face now, I mentally think “disease carrier” and avoid. We really could use this small norm-change society-wide.')
