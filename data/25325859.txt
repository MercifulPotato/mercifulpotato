However, I feel that this might be a false sense of security.<p>The other day I was installing some plugins for my VsCode and IntelliJ setups and realized I had no idea how much access these random plugins have on my laptop. I understand plugins have access to my source code, but I doubt that access is limited to my project folder.<p>I understand I could be totally safe by using some VM virtualization, but I feel that is overkill. Is there simpler alternatives? How about just a different user in your machine? With a Mac though, that becomes unnecessarily complicated with having to establish an iCloud login for each account. What do folks do? Just trust everything and try to be careful?<p>I tried keeping a personal device for trading&#x2F;bank use, but that is just not convenient. There must be a better way.')
