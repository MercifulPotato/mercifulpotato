It&#x27;s a bit random but in another part of this thread your name appeared out of pure coincidence from another poster:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25557413" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25557413</a><p>In the github thread (started in 2013) mentioned by pcen, you were part of the big debate on bringing more formalization to javascript promises. You were on the winning side (at the time) of NOT doing this. Your comment here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;promises-aplus&#x2F;promises-spec&#x2F;issues&#x2F;94#issuecomment-16188234" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;promises-aplus&#x2F;promises-spec&#x2F;issues&#x2F;94#is...</a><p>Likely you muted the thread since then but the conversation continued.<p>Now in 2020, times have changed and Typed javascript is not the dominant paradigm. However, the decisions made by you and your brethren back in 2013 continue to echo through eternity. The final comments in that thread (dated 2019) sums it up perfectly:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;promises-aplus&#x2F;promises-spec&#x2F;issues&#x2F;94#issuecomment-549868812" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;promises-aplus&#x2F;promises-spec&#x2F;issues&#x2F;94#is...</a><p>and also:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;promises-aplus&#x2F;promises-spec&#x2F;issues&#x2F;94#issuecomment-553767177" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;promises-aplus&#x2F;promises-spec&#x2F;issues&#x2F;94#is...</a><p>This github thread was brought up to me as an example about how my Current thread is representative of history repeating the same mistakes. A decision to ignore formal theory in the past now results in a fundamental mistake that all JavaScript developers must live with.<p>The irony is that you, Jonathan, are part of both histories, you made a mistake then, the question is are you repeating a similar mistake now?<p>Regardless of whether you&#x27;re right or wrong now, and disregarding the previous (minor) verbal scuffle we had...  I thought you&#x27;d be interested in this tidbit of serendipity.')
