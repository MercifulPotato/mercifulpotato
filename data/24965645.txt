Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=[24965685], score=None, time=1604304332, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24965540, text='&gt; &quot;newtypes can provide a sort of safety, just a weaker one. The primary safety benefit of newtypes is derived from abstraction boundaries. If a newtype’s constructor is not exported, it becomes opaque to other modules. The module that defines the newtype—its “home module”—can take advantage of this to create a trust boundary where internal invariants are enforced by restricting clients to a safe API.&quot;<p>The author appears to be claiming that this is somehow distinct from (and qualitatively weaker than) &quot;type safety&quot;, without any justification for that claim.')
