We once had a microwave link setup that would fail during the rain. Admittedly this was maybe 20 years ago so maybe the tech is different, but this would manifest as latency spikes presumably as there was a failure to extract signal and TCP backoff kicked in. i.e. it wasn&#x27;t physical layer latency but transport layer latency.<p>But my knowledge of networks is fairly rudimentary and old now and now that I think about it, pings would get sudden spikes in the rain too and that&#x27;s just a lower layer than I&#x27;m talking about. hmm. I was also a child then so I might be misremembering.')
