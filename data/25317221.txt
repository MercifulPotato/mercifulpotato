The reason Apple&#x27;s commission for apps is a problem is that they have a monopoly on iOS app sales. But publishers can sell books that can be read on iOS without going through Apple. If they don&#x27;t like the cut, they should just sell their product elsewhere. (Now if Apple were to do something like ban ePub reader apps that worked on outside purchased books, I&#x27;d change my tune.)')
