Seriously?<p>Yes, seriously. No need to get defensive.<p>&gt; I didn&#x27;t say this is slavery, did I?<p>No, you&#x27;re just pointing out that <i>some</i> slaves across history have been paid better than <i>some</i> modern workers. This is of course factually true, but also factually irrelevant.<p>On an emotional level however, it sounds like &quot;Apple pays its workers less than slaves&quot;. Saying it plainly like that would be too obviously disingenuous, so you&#x27;re going for the &quot;I&#x27;ll just leave these numbers here!&quot; kind of middleground. Again, that&#x27;s not <i>wrong</i>, that&#x27;s just in poor taste (for me).<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t know what your standard for &quot;a bad paycheck&quot; is, but I suppose, given how you were fine with this being equal to actual slaves&#x27; wages, I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that less than half the average salary for a person who build products for the world&#x27;s richest company isn&#x27;t bad enough for you.<p>I don&#x27;t actually know what these engineers were expected to earn in their respective market, but considering that they voluntarily entered into these contracts assuming to actually get paid that much, it must&#x27;ve been the best offer they have received. Consider that gatekeeping can keep earned wages high while simultaneously leaving a lot of otherwise qualified workers out of a job entirely.<p>If that salary is lower than whatever certain slaves may have earned at some point in history, that may be unfortunate, but again, factually irrelevant.')
