They complain that 60 Minutes made a bunch of mistakes due to their poor journalistic integrity then make a load of unsubstantiated opinions. The fact that facebook and youtube will usually do the right thing out of their own good will isn&#x27;t really a defense of 230. Nor is 60 Minutes making a pat statement that &quot;230 is bad&quot; as much as saying that disinformation is proliferating and there&#x27;s very limited legal recourse under 230. There&#x27;s no advocacy for a simple repeal. The presentation is factual.')
