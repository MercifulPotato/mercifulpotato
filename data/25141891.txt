Instead, have a deep understanding of what your goals and values are. And, act accordingly. How others react or judge your actions are only important insofar as they help you achieve your goals or align your actions with your values.<p>I think the &quot;feedback is a gift&quot; perspective works regardless of &quot;manager genuinely trying to help you improve&quot; or &quot;manager who will just want to get rid of you in a HR-approved way if they don&#x27;t like what you&#x27;re doing.&quot; And similarly, regardless if your goals are &quot;genuine self-improvement&quot; or even just &quot;don&#x27;t get fired.&quot;<p>If you get negative feedback from someone who is viewing you negatively you&#x27;re in a better position than <i>not</i> getting negative feedback from someone who views you negatively.<p>It might only be valuable as a warning, if you are working in a fairly inhumane bureaucracy, but it&#x27;s still better than not knowing where you stand.<p>(It&#x27;s important here to be able to tell &quot;feedback&quot; from &quot;frustration,&quot; though. For instance, if you&#x27;ve got a manager who&#x27;s grumpy towards everyone or about everything, you need to calibrate for that...)')
