The on demand music available for YouTube Music was not previously available and all of it appears to be &quot;auto-generated by YouTube&quot; according to the description (eg: the audio for Thriller was only recently uploaded&#x2F;auto-generated in 2017 <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Z85lxckrtzg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Z85lxckrtzg</a>). All of that music was likely licensed in the same way it was GPM and for any other DSP.')
