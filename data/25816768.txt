It seems far more likely that this guy is a plant, who is there for the specific purpose of generating those news articles about &quot;evil&quot; Trump supporters.<p>I don&#x27;t believe we can really discuss things if you believe that people are false flagging in the midst of &quot;normal&quot; Trump supporters that invaded the US Capitol to somehow make them look worse. Additionally, Trump and his supporters have continually failed to eject the worst elements of the group so I fail to see why you believe that these supporters would suddenly draw a line here.')
