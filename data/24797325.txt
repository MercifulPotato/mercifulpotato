Beautiful, big, red, unmarred strawberry.  I take a bite out of it, and as I pull it away from my mouth I see that the entire inside is filled with the remaining half of a living worm, along with a great deal of what I assume were its excretions. I see this just as the taste hits me.<p>My wife heard the noise I made from across the house and assumed I was being histrionic, but she changed her mind once she saw the remains of the strawberry! In fact I think she came closer to vomiting than I didâ€”fortunately I was right in front of the sink, so was able to spit it out and wash out my mouth immediately...  It was years before I ate another strawberry without first cutting it in half.')
