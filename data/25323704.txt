I think one of the problems is that &quot;invisible&quot; handicaps do not invoke an emotional response.<p>In fact it is even worse because e.g. irrational behaviour of a mentally ill person often invokes a negative response. This results in stigmatisation, which is inherently counter productive.<p>A general mindset change is needed to address this on a larger scale. Specifically, in education there should be much more of a focus on ethics than there is now. This is hard because it can be in contrast to &quot;profit-focused&quot; education where e.g. the main goal of studying a field is to get a well paying job at a big company. But of course there are many factors there such as how a university is funded and can keep running.<p>Sadly, it doesn&#x27;t look like the general population is ready for these discussions because as a human race, we cannot even get over more known&#x2F;discussed problems such as racism.')
