Maybe it really is that simple.<p>For me, cheaper premiums are not even the selling points of universal healthcare. It&#x27;s selfish hedonism:<p>It&#x27;s emergencies - No tax will exceed 100% of my annual salary, so why should a surprise medical bill I couldn&#x27;t possibly avoid (T-boned when I had the right-of-way and thought I looked for cross traffic?) bankrupt me?<p>It&#x27;s uncertainty - Sure I&#x27;m middle-class now, but what if software really is in a bubble, and I&#x27;m broke in 15 years? Voting for my own interests has to include voting for things that _could_ plausibly happen in my future, not just what&#x27;s happening to me this week.<p>And it&#x27;s the social graph of private charity. If my friend is a little worse-off than me, should I be guilted into donating money to their medical costs? I&#x27;m nowhere near the philanthropist class. Why should it fall on me? Not having a safety net punishes middle-class people who care about their not-middle-class friends and family.<p>Paying with taxes is much fairer - No surprises, no desperate clinging to my job, and no guilt.')
