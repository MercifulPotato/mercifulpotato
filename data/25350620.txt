Both in and out of Apple ecosystem.<p>I think it&#x27;s primarily my laptop to be honest (2018 Macbook Pro), because they do better when connected to my phone; but the ~4 other bluetooth devices including one in-ear bluetooth pair i have <i>never</i> have connectivity issues. Yet i can&#x27;t count the number of times these AirPods have disconnected, or connected one ear but not the other, etc.<p>I still love my AirPods, but connectivity has been the worst out of all my bluetooth devices. It&#x27;s been frustrating.')
