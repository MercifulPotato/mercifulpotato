He wasn&#x27;t my DPhil supervisor (a DPhil is the Oxford equivalent of a PhD) but he urged me to start writing up and spent an hour with me each week during that period encouraging me to get my DPhil finished and submit. He would also listen to me practice my talks for the kinderseminar - all far beyond the call of duty. He was a bit like a kindly grandfather to all us algebraists and had a wonderful way of talking about and explaining group theory.')
