Felt like rebirth. My spinal pain was significantly decreased for the next few weeks, and my mood was ecstatic. Like the mushrooms though, it is short-lived. The doctor liked prescribing it because it is an NMDA agonist and decreased my opioid tolerance quite a bit, also helps with withdrawal symptoms. It is not covered by insurance -- $450 out of pocket.
