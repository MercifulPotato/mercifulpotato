Item(by='captain_price7', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606505953, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25231399, text='&gt; I&#x27;m also assuming that the US, IL, and SA are pretty interested in regional stability if only because stability favors their own interests.<p>A completely stable and peaceful region is very much NOT in the interest of Israeli right-wing politicians (currently in power) hell-bent on expanding illegal settlements. Israel is the only modern nation in the world without a fixed border. This can only be maintained by denying Palestine statehood, and the only moral way to do that is by selling this image of &quot;our savage, uncivilized neighbors will destroy us if we grant them statehood. We&#x27;re in an extraordinary circumstance, so that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re taking the extraordinary measure of denying millions of people their human rights for 70 years.&quot;<p>Btw, 2014 Gaza war killed 5 Israeli civilians vs around 1500 Palestinian civilians (UN). It amazes me how Israel still manages to play the victim card in the western world.')
