I&#x27;m back for Show &amp; Tell.<p>Tell first: I&#x27;ve been reading Excession by Iain M Banks again. Not because Elon Musk pays superficial lip service to Iain Banks. Not because of peer pressure among posers to read Excession. Because I genuinely identify with some of the characters.<p>A theme in Excession is: nerds collect things. Gestra collects scale models of sailing ships. Pittance collects warships in stasis. Sleeper Service collects people in stasis. Grey Area collects torture devices.<p>Another theme in Excession is: nerds are not welcome in the Culture. I mentioned four nerd characters. Three of them leave the galaxy by the end of the story. Grey Area goes a step further and leaves the universe.<p>Yeah that&#x27;s right. Too much literary analysis for Hacker News.<p>Show second: I&#x27;ve been collecting song metadata from Jango Radio. By which I mean I wrote code to collect metadata. It took a few months but I collected metadata for every song and made it searchable. I did it because I was looking for a few specific songs which had become unsearchable on Jango Radio. Without knowing the song IDs I was looking for so I had to grab every song ID and once I started I might as well finish the collection.<p>Bash and JSON and PHP and SQLite are tech nerd tools. Too technical for Hacker News. We all know Hacker News is named ironically because it&#x27;s really a marketing site.<p>Finally: Coding is a worthless activity for nerds like Gestra and Grey Area and just as unprofitable as collecting scale model sailing ships. There&#x27;s nothing to monetize about some nerd&#x27;s collection of song metadata. There&#x27;s nothing about coding to monetize. Marketing is what matters always.<p>Yeah that&#x27;s right. Hacker News is not a tech site. Hacker News is a marketing site.<p>I don&#x27;t do marketing.')
