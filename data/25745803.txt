To whom is money being redistributed? It&#x27;s punishment for holding dollars instead of investing them.<p>If you want to print money you have to inject it somewhere, and that place where you inject new money benefits from it - they decide how to spend this new money and this stream of wealth skews economy.<p>This is high level understanding ofc, I am sure there are a lot of technicalities on how this can be done.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t think you should not keep currency but instead you should &quot;invest&quot; at least you could do this when you had gold.')
