I just checked, if I wanted to go hiking tomorrow, the nearest suitable car that&#x27;s available all day is 200m from my place. Booking it for 8 hours and driving 100km would cost me 33â‚¬ ($41), all costs included. The key is in a lockbox that opens with a card, so it&#x27;s available 24&#x2F;7&#x2F;365 without another human in the loop. Booking is easy and convenient. If the weather were any good tomorrow, I might have done that and gone winter hiking. Not having a car doesn&#x27;t have to be as limiting as you may think :)')
