Item(by='jiggawatts', descendants=None, kids=[24775294, 24775055, 24775148], score=None, time=1602663944, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24759037, text='I&#x27;m a consultant across a bunch of orgs, and some of the fun stuff I&#x27;ve seen recently:<p>Client A requires VPN Client &quot;X&quot; that is exactly version 1.2.3.4.<p>Client B requires the same VPN Client &quot;X&quot;, but force-upgrades it to &quot;1.2.3.5&quot; or whatever.<p>I now cannot connect to Client A without uninstalling the VPN client installed by Client B and reinstalling from scratch.<p>A gentle suggestion to the VPN vendors that write not-backwards-and-forward compatible clients like this: Go die in a fire. Or quit IT and go lay bricks or something. Actually don&#x27;t do that, I wouldn&#x27;t want to live in a building you build. It&#x27;ll probably collapse if the wind isn&#x27;t blowing at the exact right speed.<p>Similarly, Client C has a VPN client that is also the kitchen sink, and has a &quot;profile&quot; that overwrites half my system with its junk. It refuses to connect if I edit the profile. I have several coworkers who VPN in via Virtual Machines to work around this.<p>Many VPN vendors believe that VPN client downloads should require a support login. My feedback: Stop that. Just stop. Publish a straight up download link to every version. Please. Just do it. I promise you won&#x27;t lose any sales because of this. Really. I promise.<p>More fun: A large gov org client of ours had spent nearly a decade hard-coding their &quot;LAN subnet range&quot; in a bazillion firewall and IP whitelisting rules in dozens of products. The VPN is in the Cloud and uses a different range (10.x.x.x&#x2F;8), so now every firewall rule is broken for users connecting from home. 9 months into the pandemic, they&#x27;re still working on it.<p>I have Gigabit fibre and a high performance computer. Downloads really do go at 800+ Mbps. I&#x27;m yet to see a VPN product that can crack 200 Mbps even during periods of low load and with a matching gigabit link at the other end. Most do 3-20 Mbps, and I&#x27;ve seen as low as 1 Mbps. This is entirely a software problem!<p>Microsoft deserves the IT equivalent of the Razzie awards for their implementation of IP-HTTPS in DirectAccess which is a) Slow as molasses, b) Limited to 8 cores on the server for no reason, c) Not fixed in 12 years, d) Still theoretically supported, e) Will never be fixed.<p>Vendors: Benchmark your products please. Once a decade maybe. Or two. No rush. It&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s a pandemic on or anything. Take your time.<p>I have to stop ranting now, I think my blood pressure is rising to dangerous levels...')
