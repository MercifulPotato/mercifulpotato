We use VMs or VPS to solve. Clunky, but it gets the job done.<p>Hurdle 2: Python Devs are not used to a real IDE. There&#x27;s a learning curve with Visual Studio or Rider. Just requires exposure and time.<p>Hurdle 3: Async in C#&#x2F;.NET is confusing. The internet is full of contradicting advice. Experienced Devs have a hard time explaining all the nuances. The solution again is exposure and practice.<p>Hurdle 4: Entity Framework or &quot;Why can&#x27;t I just use SQL?&quot;. More practice&#x2F;exposure.<p>IMHO most take a liking to the pampering provided by the ecosystem once they clear those hurdles and latch on.')
