Actually, Ruby is my primary language, but I have chosen Python for this project for a complicated set of reasons I tried to explain[0] in the first article.<p>&gt; If I recall native hunspell suggestions are quite slow - the same algo must be even slower on python.<p>Pretty slow, yes. But the current project&#x27;s goal is to &quot;uncover&quot; how the Hunspell worksâ€”so, I implement it the Hunspell&#x27;s way. The next (several) parts of the series would explain a lot on suggest, including &quot;why is it hard&quot;, and &quot;why SymSpell might not be enough&quot; ;)<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zverok.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2021-01-05-spellchecker-1.html#why-python" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zverok.github.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2021-01-05-spellchecker-1.html...</a>')
