While racism is a problem in Poland, it&#x27;s not a systematic racism like in the US, and treating it as if it was does more harm than good - we have to do better, but suddenly Polish people watching American news and for instance adopting &quot;all cops are bastards&quot; attitude is just dumb in so many ways I could probably write a whole article about it.<p>In general I lament the americanization of worldwide media, as if America is some kind of paragon of behaviour that everyone should emulate, and whatever social phenomenon is happening there it must be valid elsewhere. That&#x27;s simply not true.')
