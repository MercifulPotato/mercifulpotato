And gradient based methods need to have this one scalar value to derive gradients from.<p>Since you mentioned higher dimensional representations for rewards, I want to remind that the sub-fields of Inverse RL and Model-based RL are concerned with reward representation and prediction by neural nets.<p>Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem like a good idea to try to disprove an entire field with a purely theoretical (a-priori) argument. There should be at least some consideration given to the state of the art in the field.')
