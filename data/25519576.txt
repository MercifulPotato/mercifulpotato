In itself, it was not particularly horrific -- just a successful retreat of the communists to preserve their forces for future fighting. 25 years later the disasters of Great Leap Forward and the cultural revolution hit China.<p>Is this connection strong enough to make &quot;Long March&quot; a horrible name? Perhaps, but I want to point out that there is a greater depth to this question that might seem at first glance.<p>Let&#x27;s say, hypothetically speaking, that Kennedy and Khruschev  were unlucky playing their Cuban missiles game of chicken: they destroyed each other and plunged the world into the dark ages. Which names would be badly tainted with this event? Obviously, Kennedy and Khrushchev, and anyone connected to the Manhattan project would be hated beyond measure by the few survivors. What about Truman? FDR? Or maybe even Lincoln, or Washington, or the American Revolutionary War? What about the scientists who figured out the fundamental laws behind atomic weapons -- Einstein, Rutherford, Bohr? Or even scientists in general?<p>(I guess it&#x27;s easier to answer for Russia: presumably the Soviet Union period will take all the hatred. Even then, arguably the mere existence of the USSR was partly due to the ineptness of several generations of Russian tzars, as well as Germany&#x27;s assistance to communists, so they could share some of the blame?)')
