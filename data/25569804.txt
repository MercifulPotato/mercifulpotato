Just think of Bill Gates that went to probably the only school that had a computer in the world.<p>In ancient China they even went so far to castrate bureaucrats to prevent cross-generational cronyism.<p>&gt; Why limit Elon Musk<p>Because he is using cool goals like travelling to mars to motivate his workers to work themselves to exhaustion while ignoring safety measures? He acts exactly like capitalists of the industrial age. The difference is that his workers do not lack money for sustenance, but a purpose in life.')
