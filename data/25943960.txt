Item(by='alexggordon', descendants=None, kids=[25945149], score=None, time=1611849826, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25941727, text='&quot;Intentional financial harm&quot; is not illegal, otherwise shorting stocks would be illegal. There is also no court precedence for normal market maneuvers that happen to have a significantly negative outlook on a company. Imagine if Gamestop sued TD Ameritrade for facilitating short market orders for Goldman Sachs? It would be a joke. Same thing for if Melvin sues--they over exposed themselves and paid for it.<p>There&#x27;s nothing here that&#x27;s illegal. Insider Trading, Pump and dump schemes, etc all require coordinated distribution or communication of false and&#x2F;or non-public information. What&#x27;s happening with GME is happening in the public, in full view of everyone, with a goal of exploiting a hedge fund that overexposed itself through a short squeeze. Short squeezes are legal, and have a large storied history over the last couple decades.')
