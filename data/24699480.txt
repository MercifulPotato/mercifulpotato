If you can&#x27;t communicate well enough why your product is competing in the price point that it is, that&#x27;s a classic marketing failure.<p>&quot;Looks&quot; and &quot;feels&quot; can be addressed by marketing narratives. (And some of the differences between &quot;economy&quot; and &quot;luxury&quot; in cars are marketing more than cost basis. If the American version of the Leaf wasn&#x27;t tweaked for some of those &quot;luxuries&quot;, that can also be a failure of marketing imagination.)<p>As for performance, I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;ve either never driven a Leaf nor owned a sub-$15,000 ICE car? No EV &quot;performs like a sub $15,000 car&quot;, in terms of torque&#x2F;pickup&#x2F;handling. That that isn&#x27;t more well known is itself a particularly larger American industry marketing failure that&#x27;s left the average American consumer behind the world market.')
