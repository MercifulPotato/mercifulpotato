It&#x27;s the result of a lot of testing, and discussions with my doctors.<p>Most people that are around me enough get a sense of this.  Most don&#x27;t know the depth of it.<p>What gets old is when I deviate from the diet, by say having a glass of beer at a social function, it&#x27;s a big deal.  Everyone&#x27;s concerned about me, which I appreciate, but I have to justify the beer by pointing out how it fits into my diet, and how I&#x27;ve planned for this beer.  I have had to pull up my diet plan on more than one occasion to make someone happy.<p>If I was known to have problems adhering to my diet, and asked for this sort of help, then fine.  I don&#x27;t have that, and I&#x27;ve tried to tell people that I know what my diet is.  I try to be nice about it, and ask people to just let me be.<p>Instead I get to defend every beer I have.  So, now I&#x27;m the teetotaler in the office.  It&#x27;s just easier than the alternative.  But it&#x27;s damned annoying.')
