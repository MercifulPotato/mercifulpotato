Examples of these algorithms include BCrypt, SCrypt, PBKDF2, and others. These algorithms are specifically designed to cause the CPU&#x2F;GPU of the computer to take an excessive amount of time generating a single hash.</i><p>This is true of bcrypt and PBKDF2, but not of scrypt.  The design behind scrypt is to take an excessive amount of <i>time multiplied by memory</i>.<p>This does not inspire confidence in their product.')
