Item(by='sebmellen', descendants=None, kids=[24654600], score=None, time=1601571732, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24653213, text='I never said it was universal to feel more sympathy for criminals, nor am I trying to apologize and&#x2F;or gain sympathy for racists. How did what I wrote imply that?<p>The TED talk, now 5 years old, encapsulated what has now grown into &quot;cancel culture&quot; in a poignant anecdote. There&#x27;s nothing generative or useful about this concept of prosecution (or persecution?) for making a misstep online.<p>I am fully in favor of implementing the Portugal drug model, implementing prison reform, and offering prisoners chances at rehabilitation. But to equivocate a racist tweet with a crime is ridiculous and, in my opinion, dangerous. This line of reasoning is barely different from the concept that speech can be violence, which is absurd. The foundation of every liberal democracy is the separation of free speech from criminality.<p>That principle assumes that a person&#x27;s ideas can be reformed, which is what we should all hope is possible. Half of the time, alienating people for their views will only further radicalize and polarize them.<p>Now, to argue that a rehabilitated ex-convict is a better hire than someone actively tweeting racist things is a fine argument, but in an entirely different scope than the aforementioned comment, unless I misinterpreted it.')
