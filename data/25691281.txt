So you don&#x27;t have any argument against what I said and now you change the subject?<p>The same senators and congressmen that objected were interrupted from doing so because of the mob. None of the elected officials did anything illegal by objecting. Did they have anything to back their claims? No, but that&#x27;s another discussion.<p>I don&#x27;t see neither how harassing a senator today has anything to do with the other day events. I don&#x27;t support that just as I don&#x27;t support the ones who almost beat Sen. Rand Paul.<p>Any of this makes me become an apologist. I only stated that a coup wasn&#x27;t the idea behind the Capitol assault.')
