And either way, even if someone was bribed to introduce the attack there&#x27;s zero reason to allow the hacked software to be downloaded now.<p>I work at a large and highly regulated (HIPAA) company and we have the equivalent of Electric Dylan&#x2F;Pete Seeger with the axe: if someone at the VP+ level declares a major incident, our infosec team has a script that will lock down all inbound&#x2F;outbound traffic, snapshot all our running machines for later forensics, lock our AWS IAM access down to a single incident response account, and move DNS for our web properties to a &quot;we&#x27;ve been hacked&quot; page.  (OK, it obviously doesn&#x27;t say <i>that</i>, but something similar that has been heavily vetted by legal and marketing ;-)). We&#x27;ve drilled and timed it out and can stop the ship in ~5 minutes.<p>Either SolarWinds doesn&#x27;t have a major security incident response plan, or they don&#x27;t have the stomach to pull the trigger.
