Some pump faster and some pump slower. 10 gal&#x2F;min sounds about average.<p>I like pumping at truck stops (Flying J, Loves, etc) because they tend to have faster pumps.<p>I drive a pickup truck with a 38 gallon (145 liter) tank. So I definitely notice slow pumps and seek out gas stations with faster ones. I have been to many gas stations where they pump way too slow and I will just get a few gallons and leave because I don&#x27;t want to sit around all day while it fills up and I don&#x27;t trust the auto-shutoffs enough to leave it unattended. I have had one fail once and luckily was there to stop it before too big of a mess was made.<p>I am lucky enough to live right next to a Gasoline Distribution company and they have a really nice public gas pump that you can use with super fast pumps and all of their gas is ethanol free (most gas in the US has ~10% ethanol). So that is where I usually fill up.')
