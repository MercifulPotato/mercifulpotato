So this isn&#x27;t really helping with spying.<p>And even if the change did help with spying, <i>adblockers</i> help with spying. Firefox will solve this problem better than Chrome or Safari by hopefully balancing the relative privacy risks from extensions and from ads and not by making clumsy fixes that introduce additional problems.<p>We all recognize that extension security is an issue. The question is how to make things more secure without introducing additional privacy risks by weakening adblockers. If adblockers legitimately need full access to the page in order to work effectively, we can&#x27;t just stick our fingers in our ears and pretend that they don&#x27;t need that access. We can&#x27;t just pretend that declarative blocking is good enough just because it would be more convenient for us if it was good enough.<p>I would welcome a security model that made adblockers safer without making them less effective. Does anyone have one to propose? Because I don&#x27;t want a half-baked solution implemented in my browser just because &quot;we have to do something&quot; -- and that&#x27;s what I think Manifest V3 is.')
