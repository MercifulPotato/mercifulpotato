Item(by='luckylion', descendants=None, kids=[24961598], score=None, time=1604230603, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24958668, text='&gt; Yes, lockdown most likely has some death toll. But the specific points you&#x27;re making are very dubious and also very recognisable as the effect of consuming specific kinds of media.<p>I find that an unnecessary slight. Since that topic is very taboo, you won&#x27;t be able to read about it in mainstream media sources, but only in opposition sources and professional journals. Attacking it on those grounds is weak.<p>It would be extremely surprising if a multi-month lockdown didn&#x27;t have a death toll, &quot;most likely&quot; makes it sound like that&#x27;s probable but remains to be seen. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a reasonable position given all we know about the cost of policies, mental health and economic depression.<p>The argument shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;lockdown is painless&quot; (because it obviously isn&#x27;t), it has to be &quot;no lockdown is more painful&quot;. We won&#x27;t be able to tell whether it&#x27;s true for quite some time, but there&#x27;s a good argument for erring on the side of caution.')
