One side of this discourse is based on projection and conjecture, the other on observable behaviour. I think that&#x27;s one reason why I&#x27;m not seeing a huge appetite for finding the middle ground in some parts of the left: they need to see that the reasonable folks on the right will repudiate and, where necessary, punish the extremists they see as having been encouraged and given a free rein, rather than continue to give them a political home.  I think the core of it is that with the extremists on the right wing (whether that&#x27;s swastika-flashing Actual Nazis or the radical theocrats) they&#x27;ve actually had power, whether in the form of boots-on-the-ground &quot;very fine people&quot; that the police turn a blind eye to or actual elected&#x2F;appointed office, whereas &quot;card-carrying communist&quot; describes an uninfluential fringe of Democrats who won&#x27;t now be able to achieve very much.  Because that repudiation hasn&#x27;t happened yet, some would view anyone who unflinchingly supported the Republicans over the last four years as complicit in the actual, demonstrated, real actions that the extremists performed as at least an enabler, and possibly worse.  Until that gets fixed, and mainstream Republicans own that, I don&#x27;t see them moving.<p>Unfortunately, if McConnell is still in the driving seat in the Senate, form says we should expect political logjams, which won&#x27;t help win anyone over either, and contrition isn&#x27;t a trait I&#x27;d expect to magic itself into being purely on the basis of the presidential result.')
