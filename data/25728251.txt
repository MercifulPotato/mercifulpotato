You&#x27;re not citing any evidence whatsoever here so I really shouldn&#x27;t be bothering, but just think this through. When you witness for example Kuerig pull their advertising from Fox News, that is not evidence of some leftist agenda in their management. It is some combination of (a) a response to customer complaints&#x2F;bad press, (b) an absolute storm of free publicity resulting from the controversy and (c) customer goodwill from the majority of the population. It&#x27;s exactly the kind of action of the free market conservatives are supposed to be so enamored of. If you honestly think that companies are running socially progressive ads etc. because they are run by social activists, you are (a) just as gullible as all the liberals who eat up that style of marketing and (b) not living anywhere in the vicinity of reality.<p>You&#x27;ve also cited the example of a union, an organization explicitly in conflict with management, to bolster your argument about the management of organizations being captured by social activists. Absurd.<p>&gt; if you talk to many conservatives you will find there is a large contingent of people that believe that since Roger Ailes passed Fox News has also taken a left turn...<p>Someone who would complain about some &quot;left turn&quot; by Fox News is not someone with whom it&#x27;s worth discussing politics.<p>&gt; Further Print News media is clearly Left bias as well probably 70% &#x2F; 30% left to right positioning<p>Nope. Almost all media is either liberal (read: neoliberal) or conservative. Left wing print media is negligible.<p>&gt; I think alot of your position is based on the fact that many of these places are &quot;not as far left&quot; as you<p>My position is not based on the fact that these places are &quot;not as far left&quot; as me. I am not further along on some sliding scale. Yeah, I probably agree with liberals on most social issues. However, I have a qualitatively different outlook to liberals, one rooted in a fundamentally incompatible worldview.<p>At the end of the day, you&#x27;ve made it clear that the left-right divide is about culture-war issues for you. Some of the repressive apparatus of the state is going to start being directed against the fraction of reactionaries who can no longer be assimilated by the system, but it&#x27;s not going to approach the level of brutality reserved for e.g. BLM in the foreseeable future. You can continue to enjoy media catering to people totally fixated on the lost cause of relegitimating retrograde social attitudes, because it doesn&#x27;t pose a threat to people in power.')
