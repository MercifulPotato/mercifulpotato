I&#x27;m nervous yet <i>very</i> excited to share an early preview of a novel programming language I&#x27;ve been developing for the past year or so. Passerine is an <i>functional scripting language</i>, blending the rapid iteration of languages like Python with the concise correctness of languages like Ocaml, Rust, and Scheme. If you&#x27;d like to learn more, read the Overview section of the README.<p>It&#x27;s still a ways away from being fully complete, but this release marks the introduction of Passerine&#x27;s macro system. Like the order of songbirds it was named after, Passerine sings to more than just one tune – this new hygenic macro system makes it easy to extend the language itself – allowing you to bend the langauge to your needs, rather than bending your needs to the language!<p>This submission links to the GitHub Repo, but there&#x27;s also a website (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.passerine.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.passerine.io</a>) if you&#x27;d like to look at that.<p>Have a nice day!')
