The advertiser pays the platform who pays the content producer, and the amount they get is based on the number of views (there are other factors, but I think views is the main one).  Let&#x27;s say they&#x27;re getting X views per day.  Then the theif takes the content and uploads it to their own account with ads enabled, and gets Y views per day, and gets paid for that.  No one is going to watch the content on the producer&#x27;s channel a 2nd time just to make up their view stats, so now the producer is only getting X-Y views per day and hence is paid less.<p>This is the reason Youtube&#x27;s Content-ID exists.')
