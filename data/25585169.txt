Item(by='janders', descendants=None, kids=[25588305], score=None, time=1609357294, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25582962, text='I want to be a fan of Apache Avro (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;avro.apache.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;avro.apache.org&#x2F;</a>) so much for situations such as this. And while I like Avro as a standard, most of the implementations I have found (specifically in C&#x2F;C++) are... lacking. I feel Avro would be a great fit for something like this close to zero overhead (assuming a pre-shared schema) but there is little to no support for pre-shared schema and the RPC part of the standard is not a great fit for telemetry. Maybe one day I&#x27;ll make an Avro library I like, or contribute to an extant one.')
