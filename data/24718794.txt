What does this have to do with probabilities?<p>&gt; <i>And if they switch both have probability 2&#x2F;3 of getting the car?</i><p>Yes. Remember, because both can pick the same door, this is effectively two independent games running simultaneously.<p>They each have a 2&#x2F;3 probability of getting the car because, when they first chose, they had each 1&#x2F;3 of getting it right. Each contestant&#x27;s choice and corresponding probability of winning is independent of the other&#x27;s.<p>&gt; <i>Is this some form of car sharing?</i><p>That&#x27;s what I asked :) Car sharing makes little sense, prize-wise, which is why this makes no sense as a contest. But in regards to probabilities, it makes no difference: yes, both contestants should switch.<p>&gt; <i>Maybe you should try to play with three cards and one ace.</i><p>There are only 3 doors, so you should only use 3 cards.<p>&gt; <i>Now, do you prefer card #2 to card #1 and simultaneously prefer card #1 to card #2?</i><p>I don&#x27;t understand your question. Probabilities are computed independently for each contestant. There&#x27;s no &quot;simultaneous preference&quot;.')
