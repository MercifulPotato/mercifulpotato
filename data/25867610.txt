The principled arguments about how the NYT was in the wrong revolve around an NYT story simply being more visible than the other public places you could read his name; of course, that&#x27;s true for practically anybody and any source, the NYT being one of the most visible sources in the world.<p>He gives good reasons for not wanting his name more public than it already is; they&#x27;re hard to argue with. But some genies are hard to put back in the bottle, and reasonable people can disagree about the extent to which the NYT is obligated to help with the attempt.')
