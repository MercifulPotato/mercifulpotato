Anything that is between the too is in a gray area.  And anything past the second I don&#x27;t need to feel too concerned about, or I&#x27;d describe it as ethical husbandry.<p>It&#x27;s clear that there are plenty of chickens whose lives are soo terrible that don&#x27;t meet the first benchmark and their extinction would be preferable to their current experience')
