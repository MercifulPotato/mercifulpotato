So if you&#x27;re making a situation comedy, you might have a character announce this is why they&#x27;re late, and then maybe another character observes that it&#x27;s currently May (The UK is in the Northern Hemisphere and so leaf fall is associated with autumn and early winter in maybe October through December)<p>In practice this is not actually a very common cause of unanticipated delay, although it can happen. Where deciduous trees (the kind with annual leaf fall) grow over or very near to railway lines, leaves may accumulate on the rail and will be crushed by the tremendous weight of the train, this creates a potentially very low friction layer on the rail, which makes braking difficult, leading to problems with the train service. Of course both the most trivial (don&#x27;t have so many deciduous trees in places where that&#x27;s a problem; re-schedule trains during leaf fall to allow for worse braking) and sophisticated (fit special equipment to trains to destroy the leaves) solutions are in use to reduce the likelihood of this happening.<p>Because leaves don&#x27;t <i>seem</i> like a big threat to a bipedal human the juxtaposition (seemingly unthreatening leaves actually causes big problems) is good comedy.<p>The actual most common reason announced is &quot;Signal failure&quot;. This too is misleading and an opportunity for comedy, since it might seem as though it refers to e.g. an incandescent bulb burned out in a signal lamp - why not just fit two or use LEDs (they do). But in reality &quot;signal failure&quot; means any part of the entire signal system, including every sensor and component, might have failed and as a result the system has degraded working. For example perhaps in one of the sixteen motorised points (&quot;switches&quot; in US terminology) at a busy junction a sensor that confirms the metal &quot;lock&quot; to prevent undesired movement is in place has broken and its output is floating instead of tied. A human needs to go there, stop any trains nearby, take the machine to pieces, replace the sensor, put it all back, confirm it works, and then re-open, until then that part of the junction mustn&#x27;t be used because the computer isn&#x27;t sure it&#x27;s safe, and all resulting delays will be reported as &quot;Signal failure&quot;.')
