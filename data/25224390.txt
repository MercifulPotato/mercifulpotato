Item(by='tzs', descendants=None, kids=[25224932], score=None, time=1606434695, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25223715, text='&gt; Blacks usually don&#x27;t have Neanderthal genes<p>That brings to mind a naming question.<p>Most researchers seem to put the identical ancestors point (also known as the all common ancestors point or the genetic isopoint) for humans at somewhere in the last 20k years.<p>That&#x27;s the point where every single human alive either had no descendants who are alive today or everyone alive today is their descendant.<p>Since the Neanderthals were extinct long before the identical ancestor point, it follows that if anyone alive today is descended from Neanderthals, then <i>everyone</i> alive today is descended from Neanderthals.<p>The naming question: is there a word or term for when person A is a descendant of person B but does not have any genes from B?<p>I&#x27;ve heard of someone using the term &quot;homeopathic descendant&quot; for this, but I think that was offered as a joke.')
