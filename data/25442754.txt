I mean, sure, you are strictly improving the &quot;sortedness&quot; by a discrete amount in each pass and crucually, you don&#x27;t destroy any progress you made before (not totally trivial), and there&#x27;s only a finite amount of &quot;sortedness&quot; to attain, so it will converge to the sorted state. But how exactly and, as you say, after how many iterations, is not so clear.<p>But contrast that with insertion sort. I have a sorted pile that grows after each insertion. I find it trivially clear that it works and when I will be done.<p>It&#x27;s also something that people will intuitively do in the physical world to sort paper documents I think: just grow a pile of sorted documents by adding the next one in the right place.')
