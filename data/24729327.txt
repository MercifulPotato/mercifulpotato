If 9 people on a team are in an office and 1 is remote, perhaps a few time zones away, that tends to be a problem. &quot;Oops, we forgot to set up a dial-in AGAIN.&quot;<p>But, in general, not really. I work for a company that normally has offices but also has quite a few remote people. And we&#x27;re a global company anyway so people are going to be in different offices in any case. Even our management is pretty distributed.<p>&gt;Not to mention, you can&#x27;t really move far away from the office either since you could at any time be expected to show up in the office for $IMPORTANT_MEETING.<p>Again, in normal times, there are planes etc. I work in a broader group that&#x27;s scattered across the world and we would normally get together for team meetings a couple times a year.')
