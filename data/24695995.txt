Worse, by all accounts from a <i>normal</i> person - they are private. I mean, we certainly act like the messages we send family iMessage or whatever are private, and we assume the same level of privacy we&#x27;d be afforded for a phone call, except that&#x27;s not present; and, with laws like this, it will be <i>even less present</i>.<p>And not only is the former bad, but the latter is much, much worse.')
