It&#x27;s insurance-based, and it pays for treatment in hospitals both inside and outside of the NHS. It&#x27;s even offered as a perk by some employers. Specifically relevant to this HN story, there&#x27;s access to cancer treatments before they&#x27;re approved by the NHS and NICE (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bupa.co.uk&#x2F;health&#x2F;health-insurance&#x2F;bupa-cancer-promise" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bupa.co.uk&#x2F;health&#x2F;health-insurance&#x2F;bupa-cancer-p...</a>).<p>I realise that some people are politically averse to single payer healthcare, but <i>please</i> read up a bit about how the UK&#x27;s healthcare system works before posting about it. You&#x27;re only spreading misinformation if you don&#x27;t.<p>For clarity - the UK&#x27;s NHS is a single payer taxation funded, free-at-the-point-of-use healthcare system, but we <i>also</i> have companies that offer parallel private health insurance funded healthcare for anyone who chooses to pay (and yes, that does mean they&#x27;re paying for the government service and their own private service, but that&#x27;s just how taxation works).')
