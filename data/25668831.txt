If a given website isn&#x27;t screen-reader accessible, the screen reader usage statistics are going to be very low. This shouldn&#x27;t be surprising to anyone, after all, why would blind people go to a website they can&#x27;t comfortably use? Some developers would probably still use that data to explain why accessibility isn&#x27;t important, though.<p>Regardless of that, as a blind person, I&#x27;m all for a flag that lets you detect screen reader usage. I believe a good compromise here is disabling this flag in private&#x2F;incognito mode.')
