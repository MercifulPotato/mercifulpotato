Or does the driver have a right to kick you out of his cab when the ride becomes unprofitable?<p>The only question about payment is &quot;Who?&quot;<p>As much as you can fight it, at the end of the day the answer will <i>always</i> be &quot;the end consumer.&quot;  The only question is whether you pay it on every ride as an up front increase or whether you pay it on the unfortunate ride as an addition.  Both are perfectly acceptable solutions and can even coexist in the market in different companies.<p>People have gotten spoiled by the fact that ridesharing was burning VC cash to subsidize exceptional cases.  Once those costs all quit being subsidized, they&#x27;re all going to materialize back to the end consumer.')
