Kubernetes if anything is too complete in how it manages it&#x27;s deployments, and all this does is add another level of abstraction on top of that, while encouraging people not to think about the operational part of the loop. For example, no health or readiness checks are defined as part of the deployment examples in this link. If you are still running multi-deployment with Ansible&#x2F; Puppet &#x2F; Cloud formation, etc I see value, but i think most are probably better off focusing on going K8s.')
