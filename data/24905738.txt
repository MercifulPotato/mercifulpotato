This one is more of a question, rather than just a report: why not to use the img tag (which, I think, is handled generally better) instead? Or even to leave them as texts.<p>- &quot;Made with  by TEC&quot; uses a relatively uncommon glyph (the font I use doesn&#x27;t have that; apparently it was assigned just last year).')
