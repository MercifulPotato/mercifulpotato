Not everything follows that convention admittedly, but not everything understands the &#x27;=&#x27; either. Or it could just treat everything as text until a user tells it otherwise.<p>But none of that is really the point. Because <i>CSV files aren&#x27;t just for importing into Excel</i>. One of their main benefits is their portability. In other situations column types might be specified out of band, but even if not, putting equals signs before values is unconventional, so more likely to hurt than help. And in the cases it might help, i.e. when you only care about loading into Excel, then you have options other than CSV, rather than contorting CSV files for Excel&#x27;s sake.<p>&gt; What ever happened to process and a sense of responsibility and craft in your work?<p>I actually have no idea what you are on about. I&#x27;m talking about the &quot;responsibility and craft&quot; of not producing screwed up CSV files. Why do some people find that so offensive? Yes, it is not inconceivable that there could be some situation working with legacy systems where putting `=&quot;...&quot;` in CSVs is, unfortunately, your best option. Sometimes you do have to put in a hack to get something done. But don&#x27;t go around telling people (or yourself) that it is &quot;the correct way&quot;.')
