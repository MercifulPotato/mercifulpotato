It might explain why I still kept seeing lots of interrupts raised even though I had enabled the I&#x2F;O completion polling instead, with io_uring&#x27;s --hipri option.<p>I think that should be independent.<p>&gt; edit: I ran a quick test with various IO batch sizes and it didn&#x27;t make a difference - I guess because thanks to using io_uring, my bottleneck is not in IO submission, but deeper in the block IO stack...<p>It probably won&#x27;t get you drastically higher speeds in an isolated test - but it should help reduce CPU overhead. E.g. on one of my SSDs\nfio --ioengine io_uring --rw randread --filesize 50GB --invalidate=0 --name=test --direct=1 --bs=4k --numjobs=1  --registerfiles --fixedbufs --gtod_reduce=1 --iodepth 48\nuses about 25% more CPU than when I add --iodepth_batch_submit=0 --iodepth_batch_complete_max=0. But the resulting iops are nearly the same as long as there are enough cycles available.<p>This is via filesystem, so ymmv, but the mechanism should be mostly independent.')
