Item(by='edoceo', descendants=None, kids=[25512505], score=None, time=1608675475, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25511269, text='C128(ABC) and 39 got the most testing (other players in my space like C128). I&#x27;d also like to add that the fail rate on C128 increased as the encoded values got complex.  That is to say 15 numeric chars was &quot;very reliable&quot; but 17 alpha-numeric+1 symbol had was &quot;very unreliable&quot;<p>And if you&#x27;re in the &lt;12 digits only space C128 is still a safe choice')
