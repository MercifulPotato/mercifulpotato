This is not as bad as it sounds; it uses extra power and generates extra heat but it is not doing any extra real work. InnoDB cores run at either 25% or 90% but the 90% indicates that you need an I&#x2F;O upgrade not more CPU cycles.<p>Optimizing for CPU efficiency in a system that is I&#x2F;O bound will not save significant money. Memory and NVMe are the critical factors and with the master&#x2F;slave replication used, network I&#x2F;O significantly undercuts the peak performance this single server is capable of.')
