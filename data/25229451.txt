If the chip is available to the general public, it&#x27;s not an ASIC but an ASSP. So a Wi-Fi chipset [0], an Ethernet controller or an LCD driver on the public market are all ASSPs, never ASICs. But colloquially speaking, for many people, &quot;ASIC&quot; is a synonym for all custom chips, so almost everything is ASIC, even if the chip is a general-purpose CPU, many will call it &quot;ASIC&quot; if it&#x27;s someone&#x27;s original design. Loose term, but it&#x27;s not really bothering anyone, so this usage remains. Oh, and the word &quot;chipset&quot; has a similar problem. It originally refers to the ASIC&#x2F;ASSP on the computer motherboard (originally IBM PC&#x27;s I&#x2F;O controller, but also graphics and sound), but nowadays it&#x27;s often used as a synonym of &quot;ASSP&quot;, in other words, &quot;highly integrated chip designed for a specific application in mind&quot;, hence Wi-Fi chipset, 5G chipset...')
