One org mandated that you were not allowed to have the 2FA token and your laptop in the same bag. But almost everyone, including me, at some point had their token on the keyring - if you’d throw that in your backpack, put the laptop in you had a security breach. In another, you were not allowed to leave the laptop in a car unattended - leave it in at the gas station while going to pay: security breach. And so on.<p>Security breaches are convenient as cause: If rules are sufficiently byzantine, everyone breaches them at some point or another. “Security breach” also sounds bad enough that few will question the decision to fire. “But everyone does it.” is no defense against an alleged security breach. Whether the rules actually increase security doesn’t matter.')
