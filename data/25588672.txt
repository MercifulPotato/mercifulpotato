If the virus was in Milan’s sewers in December, it feels that it might as swell have started spreading there first.<p>Likewise, Italy contained the virus from May to September, then it exploded again. Nothing particularly happened in September, yet <i>by chance</i> it spiked.<p>Just speculating though, I’d like to hear others’ opinion on this thought.')
