Because of some biochem, these micelles can then enter a healthy cell and disgorge the mRNA. This is <i>kinda</i> how a virus works as well. However, these micelles seem to be very fragile, hence the very cold temperatures needed for transport.<p>Once in the cell the mRNA then diffuses and is translated by ribosomes into protiens')
