Item(by='saurik', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608484113, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25487646, text='&gt; Among the regulations the new bill seeks to enact are: ... Prohibiting video downloads from these platforms, to be in place within three months of enactment of the legislation<p>I feel like this part (which is what a lot of sex workers are balking at, as that&#x27;s their bread and butter) is a fundamental misunderstanding of how the Internet works--where I would claim accessing anything is &quot;downloading&quot; it--which, to actually implement, puts even more companies in a position of being pro- DRM and locked-down computing efforts :(. The wording from the bill: &quot;a covered platform may not permit the download to a retrievable data file of any pornographic image from the platform&quot;.<p>Like, going down this path puts us in the position of &quot;well, browsers can&#x27;t just have a feature that lets you download anything you see, as they have to play along with mechanisms in place to help prevent people downloading files from porn websites!&quot; being a reasonable position (in addition to the existing pressure from copyright groups and the such, which at least tech companies often have less sympathy for; and really, with the exception of Section 1201, often has &quot;less teeth&quot; and doesn&#x27;t force the hand much of platforms and devices... this is more direct).')
