But I moved to Android after iPhone 2, because I was fed up with the funny limitations Apple imposed on me, for &quot;consistency&quot; and &quot;security&quot;, like:<p>- forcing me to sync music in iTunes, with my 500GB personal music library crashing iTunes<p>- no mms support, back when this was still a thing<p>- no video recording<p>- no file access<p>- no copy&#x2F;paste functionality<p>later, owning a MacBook Pro in 2016, reminded me of those funny decisions Apple made for me, like no CMD+X for cutting files, no real full-screen button and regular kernel panics when connecting&#x2F;disconnecting my multiple screens and MIDI devices for music production.<p>I since completely turned away from Apple and I am happy. Not because of my wallet, but because of the freedom of choice I gained. As a plus, yes my wallet has more left for other stuff now.')
