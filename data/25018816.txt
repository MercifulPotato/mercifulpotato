Leaving the Middle East would end any dream of bringing those regions under the western umbrella (as has been successfully done in S. Korea and Japan). Ending globalization would end the thing that has made US corporations uniquely successful, and which makes US economic sanctions so strong.<p>And focusing on China as the new red scare would (is already?) simply result in a new Cold War, to nobody&#x27;s benefit.<p>I personally don&#x27;t think the US has any business <i>being</i> hegemon (feel free to check my post history), but if your primary interest is maintaining the position of the US from ~1992-2016, then your best bet is to maintain the foreign and economic policy of those times, which is basically what Biden is promising to do.')
