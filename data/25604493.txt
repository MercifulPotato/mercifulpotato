It asserts that the brain works as a sort of recursive two-sided process, with theory creation on one side and evidence collecting on the other. Recursive in that the visual processing system might get a &quot;is that a door?&quot; theory from a higher level system, which it&#x27;ll then answer by collecting and trying to match evidence from multiple lower level systems (&quot;is that an edge?&quot; &quot;is that a shadow?&quot; etc.) until it eventually reaches the level of processing stimuli directly, with each system on the way acting as both questioner and answerer.<p>In this framework dreaming is when the evidence collecting side becomes a lot less rigorous than it usually is, so it says &quot;sure, why not&quot; without reference to a stimulus (i.e. a way to be falsified). In other words it&#x27;s the brain&#x27;s predictions continuously coming true.')
