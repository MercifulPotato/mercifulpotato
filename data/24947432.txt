The candidate nominated by that party in the primary election is nearly certain to win the general election. If the candidate is <i>highly</i> extremist &#x2F; flawed, they might lose, but party affiliation is sufficiently strong nowadays (aka the electorate is sufficiently polarized) that a candidate can be pretty far to one extreme -- farther out than the bulk of the electorate -- and still win.<p>Meanwhile, there is a tendency for the more centrist voters in both parties to skip the primary. Thus, the candidate who survives the primary is often relatively extreme.<p>The result is that the victor of the general election is often to the extreme side of not only the electorate as a whole, but the membership of their party.<p>To oversimplify, imagine that political views fall on a one-dimensional spectrum ranging from 0 to 1, and the electorate consists of:<p><pre><code>  - 40% at 0.4 (center-left)\n  - 30% at 0.6 (center-right)\n  - 30% at 0.8 (heavy right)\n</code></pre>\nIn the primary, center-right voters are under-represented, and a candidate at or beyond 0.8 has an excellent chance of being nominated. Then in the general election, at least 2&#x2F;3 of the center-right voters are likely to swing toward that candidate (because of polarization &#x2F; strong party affiliation).')
