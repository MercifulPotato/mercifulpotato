The first run is _always_ slow, but I&#x27;ve never measured it or bothered to find out why. This is a real &quot;lightbulb moment&quot; for me.<p>I just built a Go executable and timed it: 0.194 for the first, and ~0.018 for subsequent. I haven&#x27;t signed code on Mac platforms before, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a go using the Apple code signing guide [0]. So, I created a self-signed certificate using Keychain, changed and built a Go project, signed the executable [1], and ran it: ~0.400 for the first run, and ~0.018 for subsequent. It... doubled? Will this happen on every first run still? Is there a way to exclude executables?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;archive&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;Security&#x2F;Conceptual&#x2F;CodeSigningGuide&#x2F;Procedures&#x2F;Procedures.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.apple.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;archive&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;Se...</a><p>[1] codesign -s &lt;cert_id&gt; &lt;path&gt;')
