It was a revolutionary product. Some people stood in line for hours to be the first to own it. Well that reminds me, i do own one!<p>Get it out of the closet and ah, the battery is depleted. Who expects it to hold charge after... 8 years? I don&#x27;t have a cable either. I have lightning though, even usb-c. But nope, it&#x27;s the old 30 pin charger. Order it online.<p>Still works! Except, I haven&#x27;t successfully managed to download a single app. It hangs forever. Same thing for itunes.')
