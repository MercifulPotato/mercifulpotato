The problem is not all the inexpert persons styling themselves as &quot;independent journalists&quot;, the problem is all the inexpert persons who think they understand enough about the world&#x27;s problems to cast a vote on who should legislate solutions for them. The electorate <i>must</i> be restricted to those who prove they can use the franchise wisely. &#x2F;s<p>Okay, you probably are not opposed to democracy. But if not, why not? If the people are too stupid to choose to consume good journalism and ignore bad journalism, how can they be considered wise enough to elect good legislators instead of bad ones?<p>The US system of government is predicated on having a populace that is sufficiently intelligent, prudent, and moral that it will not give in to mob excess. If we the people no longer possess that sort of character, restricting the speech of said people will not be sufficient to solve the problem. A full dictatorship will be the only solution.<p>Your point about the character of the people is a good one. But if you jettison free speech, you have jettisoned the entirety of democratic government with it.')
