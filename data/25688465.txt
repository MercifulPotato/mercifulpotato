To justify the current trading levels, the expectations must be that it will capture significantly bigger part of its market than any of its competitor, <i>and</i> it will have better profit margins than them. I simply can&#x27;t see that happening over long-terem horizon. I can definitely believe that Tesla will capture large part of the market, and in fact that it becomes number one automaker. I can also believe they will significantly enjoy higher profit margin than their competition. I just can&#x27;t see any path to both at the same time: this would imply having some enormous advantage that none of its competitors can get even close to. Since the competitors are not bumbling morons, I think it&#x27;s unlikely.')
