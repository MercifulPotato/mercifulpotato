In addition to the many IoT device control capabilities, HA has a rich integration&#x2F;add-on ecosystem, and can pull in all sorts of additional data about daily life (financial feeds, weather, etc).<p>The missing piece for me right now is a device that acts as a control hub.<p>I hadn&#x27;t considered using a Kindle, but now I&#x27;m excited about the possibilities. If I can use Life Dashboard to receive status information from HA (and possibly even send commands to devices), this might be the solution to that final missing piece.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.home-assistant.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.home-assistant.io</a>')
