Even then they were left with a lot of potential options they still had to whittle down. Finally even with all that work they’re left with a vaccine with complex storage requirements.<p>So it’s entirely possible that we just didn’t have the surrounding technical ability even if theoretically it was possible. The gene sequencing to sequence it quickly and share that across the entire world, the compute needed to do try different experiments at scale, the manufacturing capabilities, Moderna having invested in the space for the preceding 10 years, existing experience with developing a SARS vaccine, etc.')
