CentOS grew out of RedHat Linux going away and Fedora being the feeder for RHEL. At the time there were a bunch of competitors that were building the RHEL source. CentOS ended up &quot;winning&quot;.<p>I fully expect this to happen again. CentOS will wither and die because no one actually needs the cutting edge repo -- Ubuntu has a way better process for this. RHEL is build on open source. They publish their SPRM packages. A bunch of people will grab these and start bootstrapping DentOS and everyone will move to this. IBM will be sliced up by PE and RedHat will be owned by someone else. 10 years will go by and RHEL will acquire the leading &quot;DentOS&quot; and today&#x27;s DevOps will be tomorrow&#x27;s greybeards and will patiently wait for EentOS to emerge.')
