Nothing too exting.<p>If you really want to tackle Lattice QCD with ASICS you could go much further than this chip. Since Lattice QCD is nothing more than Monte Carlo integration over a specific Hamiltonian you could start with implementing a good deterministic random number generator in hardware. Then you can make some major optimizations calculating the Hamiltonian by cleverly seperating addition and multiplication and trasformation to a logarithmic number system, so that you only have additions in the end. All of this has already been implemented on a FPGA years ago.')
