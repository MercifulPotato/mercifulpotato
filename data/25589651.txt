Cask-strength whiskey, before watering down to (usually) 80 proof, is often in the 120 to 130 range anyway. (Elijah Craig has a cask-strength that clocks in around 133, but it of course depends on the batch) But I&#x27;ve also toured some micro-distilleries and by asking questions, it seems that distilling up around 180 proof is a pretty trivial tweaking of the equipment (combined with carful fire-safety protocols).')
