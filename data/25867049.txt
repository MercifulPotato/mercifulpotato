For example, AWS has tutorials that provide instructions on how to setup TLS in a LAMP stack running on Linux 2 EC2s. As part of the Let&#x27;s Encrypt setup, they provide a crontab entry that runs twice a day with a copy option to paste. How many EC2s all hit the Let&#x27;s Encrypt server at that exact time? Since EC2s default to UTC time, that means that servers are not offsetting those requests by timezones, so that means an even bigger spike.')
