But then I&#x27;d argue: Beware of optimism bias when predicting the future. You don&#x27;t know whether economic, social and political circumstances will converge over the next decades towards such trajectory that extracting uranium from seawater and using it in nuclear reactors becomes a commercial viable enterprise.<p>You yourself may be confident they will, but that doesn&#x27;t make it so.')
