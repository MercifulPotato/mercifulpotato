I don&#x27;t use Google search. I haven&#x27;t missed it.<p>Well, I think there&#x27;s a lot of disagreement about whether DDG or Bing are adequate. I use DDG most of the time, only rarely searching standard Google (tho often searching Google Scholar). If Google disappeared, I&#x27;d be fine; I&#x27;d simply get more precise with my searches.<p>The reason I claim it will harm Australian web users is because I have argued that it will motivate web search providers to make their product no more competitive than the market average. If their product is more attractive than anyone else&#x27;s, then they risk becoming dominant and subject to the restriction. Consequently, the search engine space in Australia will always lag significantly compared to the space in other countries.<p>It&#x27;s not the absence of Google Search that will harm Australia, it is the presence of a rule that makes exceptionalism costly.')
