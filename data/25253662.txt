For this purpose I developed the Python package `simago`.<p>While data at the individual level is often subject to a lot of restrictions, aggregated data can be found online. With `simago` this aggregated data is transformed to probability distributions that are used to randomly generate datasets of the population. This data can then for example be used for developing or benchmarking a machine learning model, simulation or database setup. Because the generated data does not contain privacy sensitive information, it can be supplied with your model&#x2F;simulation&#x2F;setup so the users can recreate the benchmarks or follow along with a tutorial.<p>The package is available from PyPI through `pip`. The workings of the package are discussed in the form of an example on the ReadTheDocs page (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simago.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;simago.readthedocs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;</a>).<p>Any feedback on the project, the code or the documentation is very welcome!')
