Unclear if the arrest was for something totally different than the fabricated report states, or something very similar. And who knows why the report was fabricated, though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right to fabricate a report, perhaps there&#x27;s a &quot;more honest&quot; explanation than someone making this all up wholesale (like fabricating some minor details to maintain anonymity type of reasoning, I don&#x27;t know). The relevant quote:<p>Pishevar confirmed his arrest in a statement to Fast Company.')
