Item(by='titzer', descendants=None, kids=[24695729], score=None, time=1601970520, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24695369, text='Your intuition on this is wrong, and there&#x27;s no need to fly off the handle.<p>Ancestry is infectious. Take two populations, A and B, completely isolated from each other. (nevermind that they <i>all</i> have a common ancestor long before the populations diverged). Now one day in 1000 B.C. a <i>single</i> individual from population A migrates over to population B, mates, and has offspring (more than 1) with an individual from population B. Just keeping things simple with 2 children per generation. The next generation, those 2 individuals go off and have offspring with other members of population B. That&#x27;s 4 descendants. Next generation 8. And so on. Of course the characteristics of population A (it&#x27;s phenotype) may become less, because proportionally, that individual&#x27;s genes make up less and less with each generation. So it might not even be detectable by looking at someone that they have a tiny bit of A&#x27;s genes.<p>The key is that the propagation of ancestry never stops, because ancestry doesn&#x27;t round down to zero. It&#x27;s a mathematical relation. Now, genetically, those genes keep spreading (thinly) over the entire population, generation after generation, so it is actually possible that those genes get rounded down to 0, and you actually have no DNA in common with that ancestor (except that which they had in common with your other ancestors). But mathematically, in terms of ancestry, there is a point many generations later that it becomes almost impossible to <i>not</i> interbreed with someone who is descended from A.<p>This is exactly the intuition behind this genetic isopoint--when you run the exponentials <i>either</i> direction in time, they overflow the population. So you either have your genes completely selected out, or they &quot;infect&quot; the entire population, assuming that you and your offspring consistently have more than 1 child on average.')
