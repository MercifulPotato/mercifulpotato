They have project managers that steer the ship and more than enough smart people to write code. What do they need you for?<p>I think that’s often the (subconscious?) attitude Google has towards its open source projects at least. Which would be fine if they didn’t try to make it seem like their OS projects are a welcome place where anyone can contribute ideas and code and move the project forward.<p>As an example: Angular is open source but it’s very much a Google project. Rails is also open source but it’s a broad collaboration, certainly not a “37signals project”. Most people would rather spend their time contributing to the second kind of project.')
