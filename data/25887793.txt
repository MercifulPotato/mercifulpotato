Obviously, a pilot who ejects on a training flight over Tonopah isn&#x27;t going to get captured, and thus my statement about a pilot being captured would not apply to such a training flight where there is zero risk of capture.  The numbers you&#x27;ve made up mean nothing, even if they were correct, which they aren&#x27;t.  Nearly no aircraft have a 50 year lifespan, and any aircraft shot down over enemy territory is going to end up with the pilot almost certainly either killed or captured, just as I said.<p>You&#x27;re adding in all kinds of things that have no bearing on the discussion and don&#x27;t mean anything in the context of the discussion.   And the numbers you made up are silly.')
