They can make it themselves, such as a favorite recipe, which will make it special to them. Or they can buy something that they like and think that you might like, which conveys a connection between you.<p>If it&#x27;s good, you get a great memory. Even if it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s soon gone, and not weighing down your life.<p>There are some who have rigorous diets or otherwise don&#x27;t want their routine disrupted.
