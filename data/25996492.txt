Sempo facilitates over a million aid payments a year, and is used by organisations such as the Red Cross, Oxfam and the UN in regions such as Kenya, Iraqi Kurdistan and Venezuela. In 2020, for my work on Sempo, I was named on Forbes Asia’s 30 Under 30 list for Finance.<p>I&#x27;m looking for the opportunity to hone my skills as a software engineer and be exposed to different ways of writing code.')
