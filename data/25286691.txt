Yes, it was expensive, and probably it was more expensive than it needed to because execution wasn&#x27;t perfect, but this year up today, Germany has produced 51% of the electricity via renewable sources. And of course Germany gets the same cost savings as anyone else when moving further forward with renewables. Also the guaranteed high prices for solar and wind from the early years are currently slowly running out, so currently those costs are falling quickly and the true cost saving of more renewables will be effective in the electricity prices in Germany.')
