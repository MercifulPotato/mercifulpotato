The world you propose does not have functional real-time public communication, because nobody could risk the liability of allowing the posting of content they haven&#x27;t checked yet. The world you propose is one in which nobody could take the risk of running a community online. The world you propose is one in which the site you&#x27;re making this comment on cannot exist in a functional way. The world you propose has <i>more</i> governmental restraint on speech, not less; that restraint comes in the form of &quot;we&#x27;re not actually telling you that you can&#x27;t administrate your site, but if do something we don&#x27;t like, we&#x27;ll just stand back and let you get prosecuted out of existence for the actions of your users&quot;. That&#x27;s just regulation of speech by an indirect means.<p>&gt; The ask of companies under section 230 is that they be allowed to publish<p>No. &quot;publish&quot; is a distortion promoted by people trying to use the repeal of Section 230 as a weapon. To the extent liability should exist for speech at all, companies should absolutely be liable for what <i>they</i> publish. They should not be liable for what <i>their users</i> publish. Without that distinction, the Internet cannot exist as a medium for any kind of user-generated content. Centralized services providing curated content would fare just fine, but anything that allows users to interact or contribute would die.<p>&gt; The question is, what do we get back for allowing them that privilege?<p>A functional Internet. Websites that contains content supplied by others, that aren&#x27;t &quot;anything goes&quot; cesspools. An Internet that helps people interact in a read-write manner, not just consume content in a read-only manner.')
