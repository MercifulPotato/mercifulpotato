Rust&#x27;s type system is basically a more sophisticated version of Java&#x27;s, JS is in the opposite direction - a much simpler dynamic type system. Rust&#x27;s lifetimes and borrow checker is additional complexity that JS doesn&#x27;t have. Rust has longer compilation times than JS, longer than Java. Etc.')
