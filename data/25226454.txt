Item(by='mewse', descendants=None, kids=[25226609, 25226483], score=None, time=1606464168, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25226272, text='I can&#x27;t speak to the services side of your comment, but my professional experience is in games.<p>I worked as part of a team that once backported a game from the Xbox 360 to the PlayStation 2 (512 to 24 megabytes of RAM, much slower CPU, much more limited &#x27;shaders&#x27; if you can call VU code &#x27;shaders&#x27;, etc).  The PS2 had 32 megabytes of RAM, but by Sony submission requirements you weren&#x27;t allowed to touch the bottom 8mb of that.  And a lot of the remaining 24mb would be taken up by your program itself, leaving little space in memory for model data, sound, etc. But we did it.<p>From that perspective, it seems to me like there&#x27;s really very little in Breath of the Wild that couldn&#x27;t have been done back on the GameCube, if somebody had really wanted to.  You just use lower detail models and textures, and maybe adjust the way you stream the world into memory from disk.<p>Similarly, Death Stranding could probably have been made on the original PlayStation (if you didn&#x27;t care about network features;  you&#x27;d have to wait for the later PS2 models if you wanted those).  And similar for Kingdom Hearts 3.<p>Sure you would have had lower numbers of triangles and less fancy shaders and lower-resolution textures.  But the games themselves?  The stories and logic and mechanics and experiences?  I feel like they&#x27;d all be pretty doable on lower-spec hardware, if an experienced team had a mind to try.<p>I guess my point is just that if computers stopped getting faster, you&#x27;d still have newer and better and more intricate games being released.  Faster computers are absolutely not required for that.  They&#x27;re really only required if you want ray tracing and higher polygon counts and physically based lighting and similar.')
