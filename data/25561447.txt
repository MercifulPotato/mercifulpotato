Item(by='sedachv', descendants=None, kids=[25562256], score=None, time=1609178905, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25558665, text='&gt; Most people avoid washing waterproof gear often (and particularly not at high temps), since it’s believed to damage the waterproofing.<p>Which is completely wrong. The PTFE pores will get clogged with skin oil, leading to more internal condensation, and the wax (the part referred to as &quot;Durably Water Repellent,&quot; which is a hugely fraudulent marketing claim, as there is nothing durable about it) impregnated into the outer woven textile layer is less effective if there is moisture-wicking dirt on the outer layer, or the wax has rubbed off. In fact the wax is melted into the yarns of the outer woven fabric at about 40°C. To &quot;re-activate&quot; the DWR, most manufacturers recommend putting the garment in the dryer at 40°C for about half an hour. This re-melts the wax and wicks it into the parts of the yarn where it has rubbed off. Incidentally, Arc&#x27;Teryx recommends washing PTFE garments at 40°C as well.<p>The biggest scam in the waterproof-breathable garment industry (and that is saying a lot) are the so-called &quot;2.5 layer&quot; garments. Instead of being sandwiched between two woven textile layers, the PTFE film is coated directly on the inside of the outer layer, then some kind of ink or paint (yes, really) is printed over the PTFE layer for &quot;durability.&quot; In 2.5 layer garments, the PTFE will start to flake off in a couple of years at most from abrasion with the clothes you wear underneath and bending and flexing of the outer textile layer (this has nothing to do with the acidity of skin oil - another completely fraudulent marketing claim I have seen as an attempt by retailers&#x2F;manufacturers to deny warranty claims for &quot;improper care&quot;). These flakes (which is where all the PTFE is) will end up going down the drain, and you will have a ruined garment that is impossible to repair. 2.5 layer garments continue to be sold, because the manufacturing process is so cheap. I do not understand how there has not been a class-action lawsuit about this yet.')
