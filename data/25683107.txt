Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610098840, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25675050, text='&gt; There are formal codified processes and there are informal tribal ones<p>True but misleading. A lot of the time the difference is simply doing a bunch of process activities versus not doing them. E.g. imagine team A develops software in a more-or-less sensible way, and team B spends 80% of their time doing the same things that team A does and 20% of their time estimating how long those things are going to take. It seems fair to say that team B has not just different processes from team A or less formal processes than team A, but actually has more process than team A.<p>&gt; Processes mitigate risk. Just because that risk isn’t important to you doesn’t mean that risk isn’t important to someone.<p>Processes <i>can</i> be a mechanism for mitigating risk. They can also be entirely devoid of value.<p>I&#x27;m not saying all process is worthless, but someone who wants you to follow a process should be able to tell you who that process benefits and how. If the only reason you&#x27;re following the process is because it&#x27;s the process, it&#x27;s probably a waste of time.')
