But even if they all turn out to be completely doctored, there&#x27;s a much more responsible way of handling the information. Of course it&#x27;d be absurd to assume the emails are real, but it&#x27;s almost as absurd to assume they can&#x27;t be real and that to even attempt to objectively assess the claim is falling for propaganda.<p>This is a true Shiri&#x27;s scissor, here.
