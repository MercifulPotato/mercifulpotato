There are options. If I had to choose, I would rather invest this time and money to collaborate on the existing protocols that <i>do</i> have the goal of being fully open. Matrix and XMPP <i>can</i> do the things that I want and there are plenty of people working on them to overcome the present issues and challenges for mass adoption.<p>Why should I swim upstream by myself if there is no special reward for this kind of effort?')
