Item(by='bonoboTP', descendants=None, kids=[25434528], score=None, time=1608058649, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25432521, text='I can attest that I am wittier and verbally &quot;quicker&quot; when in a relationship or have more friends. In those cases even when I happen to be alone, I notice things to comment on, and can always find something to say. It&#x27;s like... how will I remember all these interesting things I&#x27;ve seen or have happened to me and will want to tell my friends or girlfriend.<p>When I&#x27;m single and without many friends around, I rather just slide past life. I don&#x27;t latch onto interesting stuff as much. I have my thought processes and goals and since nobody asks how my day was, there&#x27;s no point in remembering minor inconsequential stuff. But as you don&#x27;t need to remember them, you don&#x27;t even notice them. Like even a mundane task of taking a package to the post will be more of an emotional adventurous roller coaster when I have people in my life and rather a goal-directed straightforward thing when not.')
