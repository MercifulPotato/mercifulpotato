They give a wider berth to comments than they need to, including some I have made (apologies and thank you hn). But I can&#x27;t imagine I would want to be here if Trump&#x27;s post were an unfiltered part of the experience.<p>edit: and to be clear the thing I am most disappointed in my comments is the brevity.
