There&#x27;s a fundamental unfairness in putting in work to make your local community great, making it so good that rich people want to live there, and then being told that the community no longer has room for you because the rent is too high. If the city won&#x27;t allow enough housing to keep your area affordable, you have a right to feel aggrieved, and it&#x27;s understandable that you might misdirect the grievance if you have no lived experience of a city successfully expanding the housing supply.')
