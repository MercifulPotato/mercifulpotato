We live in a society ruled by the mob, a mob that will mobilize and torch institutions that yield a result deemed to be inequitable (as long as it&#x27;s not against whiteness or maleness)--nevermind how it came to be. It&#x27;s all too common to hear otherwise smart people talk stupidly about issues like employment earnings or congressional representation when broken down via a single variable: sex.<p>What&#x27;s good for the goose is good for the gander.')
