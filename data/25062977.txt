Those responsible for the vaccine should definitely be rewarded.  However, it&#x27;s dangerous to make celebrities out of scientists.<p>Besides, this vaccine wasn&#x27;t the work of two individuals.  BioNTech alone is a publicly traded company with almost two thousand employees, and there were likely many more from Pfizer and elsewhere assisting them with this project.')
