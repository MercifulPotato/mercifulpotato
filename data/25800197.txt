Everybody I know who hates reddit hates it <i>for</i> the reputation system - reddit karma is what makes it so full of shitty memes that get regurgitated again and again. Tying that sort of system into <i>work</i> (especially ones that docks points for things like introducing bugs! Try having a blameless postmortem after that!) is a god damned nightmare.<p>Not too long ago people in this community were pissed at workplace monitoring tolls that were introduced as wfh started due to COVID and Microsoft for adding individualised metrics in teams. I&#x27;m sure you have positive intentions with this, especially with incentivising micro-interactions like cheering teammates for good work. But whether or not you intend it to be a workplace monitoring system is irrelevant, with easy to see metrics it <i>will</i> become one. I dread the day I&#x27;ll have to ask my coworkers to &quot;cheer&quot; me on PRs because I introduced a bug and my karma has gone down.')
