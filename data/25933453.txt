The other famous Chamath video was also great, but this one was just fantastic. Spot on with what&#x27;s going on.<p>I also took notes on how effective it can be to remain cool\nas a cucumber and calmly explain a fundamentally sound\nmathematical position against an emotional attack.<p>Note: I also wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if some smart folks on Wall Street are now doing a clever counterattack where they are going long momentum and the short is a decoy, and then will pull the long profits and then also profit on the short. So I think smart Wall Street money will profit off this more than average retail, but no one will make out better than that reddit user who started the whole thing (forget their name)')
