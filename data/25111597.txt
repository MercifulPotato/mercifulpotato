A lot of countries with lockdowns had more trouble than countries without lockdowns. e.g. Argentinia with masks and lockdowns has one of the worst curves of the planet... while Sweden is doing fine.<p>And COVID-19 is strictly following Gompertz-Mathematics - just like a seasonal corona-virus.

There are no visible trend-changes around most policy-changes.<p>And there&#x27;s no statistical epidemiological evidence that masks did anything good. In some countries with masks things got a lot worse. (more efficient catch+inhale? Or catch+transmit without being infected?)<p>Most of the hype around COVID-19 is just cheating by using &quot;reporting date&quot; instead of &quot;date of death&quot; to make Gompertz-Functions look like seriously dangerous exponentials...<p>If you have some datasets that allow to compare &quot;reporting date&quot; with &quot;date of death&quot; it is astonishing to see how many reporting-anomalies appear around policy-changes...')
