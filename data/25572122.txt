Between the weird elitism, the arbitrary and time consuming hurdles for membership and the feeling that everybody there felt 20+ years older than me (even when they probably weren&#x27;t) didn&#x27;t make it seem like a good time.<p>I like the concept though, I just wish there was one that felt more up to date and actually felt like a sort of thing I&#x27;d want to join.')
