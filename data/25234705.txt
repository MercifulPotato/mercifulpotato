It&#x27;s &quot;just&quot; a combination of two neat techniques.  Get books on each of those and understand them each, and you have the combination.<p>GA has been well discussed here, so, the other half:<p>Projectivization is a fairly standard trick even for normal geometry.  It&#x27;s adding an additional dimension, which is in most contexts just set to 1.  (Projective actually just means treating all points on a ray as equivalent; this loses the dimension you just gained<p>It lets rotations and translations be treated in a nearly uniform manner, and lets you do rotations around points that aren&#x27;t the origin.  It&#x27;s used all over the place in much graphics code (usually under the name homogeneous co√∂rdinates).  The last section of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Homogeneous_coordinates" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Homogeneous_coordinates</a> discusses this briefly.<p>For online resources for the combination: another commenter has recommended  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bivector.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bivector.net&#x2F;</a> , and it looks okay, with sections specifically on 2 and 3 dimensional projective geometric algebra.<p>There is also the nice C++ header library klein: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jeremyong.com&#x2F;klein&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jeremyong.com&#x2F;klein&#x2F;</a>')
