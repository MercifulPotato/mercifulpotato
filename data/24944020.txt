Some people run yellows, some people don&#x27;t. The only reasonable thing to assume the other car to do is follow the law, but be prepared for the unexpected.<p>Unless Waymo cars are doing something unnatural like braking significantly harder or faster than a human would, the Waymo car is not at fault for being rear-ended.<p>Once we pass ethical muster (meaning don&#x27;t ship knowingly buggy code, don&#x27;t sell cars you expect to crash a lot, etc), I have a hard time seeing what the moral issues are here.')
