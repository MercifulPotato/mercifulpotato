This is the central dogma of Piketty&#x27;s Capital.<p>The problem with this is taking it as a law of nature rather than an observed behavior over a specific period of history. And notably one with a stark lack of antitrust enforcement.<p>Suppose you bust up monopolies and require companies to compete with each other. Then prices go down, which increases growth (lower price, higher demand), but decreases return on capital (lower margins). Is r &gt; g still true then? Maybe not. I say we try it and find out.')
