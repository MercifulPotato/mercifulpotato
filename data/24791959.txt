But it&#x27;s important to note that there <i>is</i> a real problem that Filecoin is trying to solve.<p>Censorship absolutely exists in file storage. Just blocking access to a website could be considered an example of this. Torrents are one solution, but normal people don&#x27;t want to set up servers to stay on for people to be able to get their files. And there&#x27;s no standardized way to have someone else seed a torrent for you in exchange for money.<p>IPFS is basically a giant, distributed file server. Also, it uses libp2p under the hood, similar to torrents. However, it has an incentives problem. Why would other people offer you storage on their devices?<p>So that&#x27;s the problem, and Filecoin claims to have a solution. I personally think there&#x27;s too much complexity in the interface right now for people to prefer it over S3.')
