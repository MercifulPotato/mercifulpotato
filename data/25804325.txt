I came to pay it on Friday, and they tell me the notice will appear in their systems only on Monday and then it takes 2 days for the system to automatically reactivate my access. No, they can&#x27;t make a simple phone call to someone in the company, yes I will be charged full monthly price for the next month even though I didn&#x27;t have access for a few days, nothing we can do - ciao')
