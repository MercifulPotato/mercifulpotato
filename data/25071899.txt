Item(by='john_moscow', descendants=None, kids=[25072168, 25073796, 25075616], score=None, time=1605200853, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25068820, text='A bigger, much bigger problem, is that having a family and raising kids is effectively being outsourced to cheaper countries.<p>Come to think of it, about 50 years ago you could afford a mortgage on a detached house from a single salary, where the other parent would dedicate their time to raising&#x2F;teaching the kids. That would also make people need each other more, and care more about alignment of values, since that&#x27;s something you want to pass to the next generation.<p>Currently, 2 median salaries will barely pay for your apartment rent. Worse, in many lower-level jobs you are expected to be an &quot;independent contractor&quot; and stitch your living from several part-time sources, multiplying commute time and draining your time and energy. And I can&#x27;t even think of what all those people will have to do when the old age catches up to them to the point where the previous generation would simply retire.<p>Most disturbingly, many people don&#x27;t seem to see a problem with it. There is a lot of activism targeting many flaws of our society, but the fact that having a family and passing your knowledge and beliefs to the next generation has become a luxury, somehow receives very little light.')
