To the effect that &quot;to Uber&quot; is even kind of a verb&#x2F;noun.<p>Also people either need a hired transportation or not. If they don&#x27;t have a car or don&#x27;t want to mess with the traffic and need to go somewhere, it&#x27;s either Uber or Taxi usually.<p>It&#x27;s not like Coca Cola, which is well known, but people could do without it (unless addicted), so needs to constantly nag people.<p>And it&#x27;s not like some new product, which without advertising nobody would even know it existed.<p>In fact most of Uber&#x27;s existance its operation has been 100% advertising (spending VS money to offer cheap rides and expand and gather &quot;eyeballs&quot; and &quot;customers&quot; without a profit). In my book, customer acquisition without profit is another name for advertising.<p>So it doesn&#x27;t sound strange that it could do without advertising today.<p>But what if there were 3-4 strong players in the same, each eating in Uber&#x27;s market share? You&#x27;ll see how fast they&#x27;d found advertising indispensable again...')
