When I learned Russian I installed the Russian keyboard layout on my computer. Because my keys (obviously) didn&#x27;t match, I had to type by feel using a small diagram I printed as a reference, carefully placing index on f and j like you&#x27;re supposed to. I just touch type in Russian now, but if I dare do that while typing English I stumble and lose track; I&#x27;m stuck doing it my normal messy (still faster than average) way.')
