The example I gave was actually for the &quot;cloud automation&quot; team, they handled such things as AIM roles&#x2F;policies, cross-account AWS permissions and various other AWS&#x2F;cloud services that other teams used. Other teams had similar &quot;go through tickets&quot; ways to interface with them, for example the team that handled the servers that CI got provisioned on. Developer-services teams that provide services to development teams internally, basically.<p>So making quality software would not eliminate the need for them or the need for them to manage incoming requests.')
