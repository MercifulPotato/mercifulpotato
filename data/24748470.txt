HFT is simply one way that role is fulfilled, in some markets (equities, futures, ...) but perhaps not others (corporate bonds, MBS, ...).  No market <i>needs</i> HFTs to provide the service, but they exist because in those markets they provide a monumentally better (cheaper) service than their predecessors.')
