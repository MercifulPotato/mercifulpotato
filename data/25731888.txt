High price does not automatically signal longevity.<p>The other thing is that nothing lasts forever, so eventually you&#x27;d need to repair. Most things you can&#x27;t repair by yourself, so if the repair costs more than new, and the suggested increase for disposal, I&#x27;d still end up buying new to save the hassle.<p>My wishlist is:<p>- For consumers, incentivize repair over disposal and buying.<p>- For companies, incentivize manufacturing quality and design for repairability.<p>But the question still stands how to do either?')
