I had to think a bit about that at first.  I don&#x27;t use it any hard core fashion as an organizer or for task management or anything.  But it has supplanted Markdown and RST as my go-to for lightweight markup.  Whenever I would have previously started a .txt, .rst, or .md buffer to jot some quick notes down, I now find myself creating a new .org buffer instead.  So on reflection I would have to say that I use it nearly daily, even if in a basic and ad-hoc way.')
