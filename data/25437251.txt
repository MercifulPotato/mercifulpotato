I&#x27;m sure every GTA is a mountain of work to create, but its a considerably smaller mountain than starting from scratch.<p>But putting GTA aside, I don&#x27;t think CDPR ever promised to create a Cyberpunk-GTA clone.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of small bugs. It doesn&#x27;t run particularly well, but I&#x27;ll say it again - the core game is fun and story well written. I&#x27;m taking a break, but I look forward to revisiting after the first few big patches.<p>Edit: One thing that&#x27;s always worked for me is to amortize the cost of purchase by time played. If I get only six hours of Cyberpunk 2077 played at $60. That&#x27;s 10&#x2F;hr for entertainment... which is better than a lot of stuff.<p>I&#x27;ll probably sink 50 or 60 hours into the game completing the main story. That&#x27;s $1&#x2F;hr of entertainment... ridiculously good value.<p>Gamers are so cranky.')
