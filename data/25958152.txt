Sure they&#x27;re not going to prosecute 2 million degenerates, but it&#x27;s not like they can&#x27;t round up 50 of the big names to make a statement.<p>It&#x27;s that there&#x27;s really no appetite in the federal government for going after retail traders. Retail trading as an industry took a very long time to build and ham-fisted enforcement could tank it harder than a few lawsuits ever could.<p>Make no mistake, this was going to happen eventually. There&#x27;s infinite ability to gather information, infinite ability to share it. Retail collusion was inevitable. The people who built the industry knew it was going to happen. They prepared for it. Everyone, including the SEC, knew it was only a matter of time before something like this happens.<p>Denmark did that because there&#x27;s much greater financial regulatory capture than there is here.')
