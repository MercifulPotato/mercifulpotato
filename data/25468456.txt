Covid-19 is lethal, I&#x27;m not discounting that, but in terms of real lethality, this was a good test run to show that this approach works. (At least in my lay person&#x27;s knowledge.)  What really scares me are the highly lethal flu strains (I think H5N5?)  The fact that we can produce a vaccine this quickly now gives me hope when we encounter a scenario like out of the movie Contagion.')
