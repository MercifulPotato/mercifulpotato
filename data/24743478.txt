Also the spoils of war.<p>Only difference is... in the end it wasn’t worth continuing to fight for. What resources?<p>Canadians like to act like morally superior peaceful “nice guys” but we will see what happens when Toronto gets invaded.<p>Meanwhile, much like Switzerland, they enjoy a certain degree of immunity from world affairs and, much like England, like to talk a lot. But at least the UK has earned its stripes and protects it’s island and sticks its nose into things here and there. After all, they do have two aircraft carrier groups and those aren’t for self-defense but forward assault.<p>Canada meanwhile makes syrup. It’s delicious and it’s a nice place to live. But it would be so much nicer if it weren’t full of self-righteous Canadians. Imagine a Canada that wasn’t a neighbor to the USA but instead was still a territory of European countries and a neighbor to Mexico. Things would be very different indeed.<p>P.S. Don’t give me standard rhetoric about Canada being an ally and helping a bit in the Gulf Wars. Every contribution is important. Too bad that Canadians don’t thank the Patriots who fought in the French &amp; Indian War and who later rebuked the greatest military force in the world back to London - twice. Else there would be no Canada as it presently exists. And no luxury to spin yarns about spending less on the military. Easy for you to say when you have the USA as your neighbor. Or as Han said to Leia, “Perhaps you’d like it back in your cell, your highness?”')
