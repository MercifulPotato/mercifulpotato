If there were exactly one FHE ciphertext for any plaintext (which can&#x27;t work, otherwise you could distinguish FHE values and break it), then you could simply implement this by supplying &lt;target FHE ciphertext&gt; XOR &lt;obfuscated secret&gt;.<p>Is there a scheme where iO could do this, or is it impossible because any obfuscation would necessarily require both the FHE decryption key and the obfuscated secret?')
