E.g., at a 4-way stop the &quot;extra polite&quot; person who gets there first, instead of going through the intersection first, waits and waves the person who does not have the right of way to go through first, which makes that person (and everyone else) confused, and then causes a lot of slowdown, frustration, etc. Of course only happens in certain locales, where it&#x27;s part of the local driving culture.')
