Without any change the US will hit 55% by 2035.<p>Also, I think advocacy groups tend to underestimate the obvious and not so obvious impacts an increasingly larger share of so-called clean power. I suggest we do not yet know the true cost of grid-scale battery, e-mobility battery, solar pv and wind because we have not yet reached the end-of-life for a statistically significant percentage of installed projects.<p>“Solar photovoltaic (PV) deployment has grown at unprecedented rates since the early 2000s. As the global PV market increases, so will the volume of decommissioned PV panels, and large amounts of annual waste are anticipated by the early 2030s. Growing PV panel waste presents a new environmental challenge, but also unprecedented opportunities to create value and pursue new economic avenues.”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irena.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;2016&#x2F;Jun&#x2F;End-of-life-management-Solar-Photovoltaic-Panels" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irena.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;2016&#x2F;Jun&#x2F;End-of-life-mana...</a><p>“This report, prepared jointly by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and the International Energy Agency Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme (IEA-PVPS), is the first-ever projection of PV panel waste volumes to 2050. It highlights that recycling or repurposing solar PV panels at the end of their roughly 30-year lifetime can unlock an estimated stock of 78 million tonnes of raw materials and other valuable components globally by 2050. If fully injected back into the economy, the value of the recovered material could exceed USD 15 billion by 2050.”<p>edit: here&#x27;s a 2017 in depth EU sponsored study<p>EU Commission: JRC Science for Policy Report – Materials Impact on the EU’s Competitiveness of the Renewable Energy, Storage and E-mobility Sectors – wind power, solar photovoltaic and battery technologies<p>See section 6.1 &quot;Recycling of materials from wind turbines, solar panels and batteries&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu&#x2F;repository&#x2F;bitstream&#x2F;JRC108356&#x2F;jrc108356_report_competitiveness_online.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu&#x2F;repository&#x2F;bitstream&#x2F;J...</a>')
