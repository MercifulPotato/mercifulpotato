One cost is that you need a separate transaction layer &quot;on top of&quot; the shards if you want to offer transactions. If you want to offer strong isolation (such as snapshot or serializability), good performance, and fault tolerance, that transaction layer can be quite complex. Scaling a single RSM is much cleaner conceptually, and (depending on the model) can offer very strong semantics (strict serializability would be typical). Having a single system image (rather than trying to simulate one through distributed transaction protocols) also removes complexity in other areas, such as making it easier to do large read queries MVCC-style.<p>I don&#x27;t think that being able to scale an RSM up makes anything possible that wasn&#x27;t possible before, but it is convenient in all kinds of ways.')
