This isn&#x27;t over. People tried to overthrow the government last week. They&#x27;re going to try again soon. There is a credible threat of imminent violence across the country.<p>After September 11th, we shut down air travel across the country for a week because we just didn&#x27;t know if there were additional threats out there. Would anyone have complained if tech companies shut down a website known to host and inspire radical Islamic terrorism?<p>Today we face a far more dangerous threat. Imagine if the mob had succeeded in capturing most of Congress -- we could be fighting a civil war right now.<p>We don&#x27;t know what else the &quot;patriots&quot; have planned, nor what the FBI, Facebook, or Twitter have seen in private messages and groups. Maybe let&#x27;s prioritize everyone&#x27;s physical safety for a few weeks.')
