Google&#x27;s search and search advertising products remain the strongest in the world, and we believe that this renewal puts us in a solid position for the years ahead.&quot;<p>Does google have data scientists looking at ad revenue? For sure. How that revenue is generated is a core business, and there is no question they had metrics on quality of that traffic which would be the first hop before landing on the ad. The idea they thought this was all quality organic traffic - no chance.<p>I get regulators are cracking down, but the fake reviews, fake shopping sites and now these fake ad revenue generators don&#x27;t deserve regulatory protection.<p>Fair point on the extensions side though.')
