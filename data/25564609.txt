I was using stow before I switched to nix (on mac) and nix-darwin + home-manager. I use home-manager for everything except my vim config (I don&#x27;t want to bury it in nix config and loose portability). home-manager is very nice when you want to create configuration that depends on other programs, e.g complex gitconfigs or crazy mutt setups.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s all worth it. I recently got a new machine, and it sure reduced the pain of setting it up. But I get a new laptop every four years or so. Bike shedding is fun.')
