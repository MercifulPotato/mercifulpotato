The one I used was a US import to the UK, so it had a special transformer and monitor to run on foreign screen refresh rates and voltage.<p>That machine with Lattice C was my introduction to modern programming techniques, having been a 6502 and Z80 programmer before.<p>I ended up with an A500, and upgraded it with a 16Mhz processor by putting some TTL logic together to build a suitable clock from the mainbaords 8Mhz. This is obviously in pre-internet days, I have absolutely no memory of how I learnt about that hack, or even where I sourced a suitable processor. Happy days.')
