One of the most important aspects of everything is that our immune system has to make two distinct determinations about any object it encounters: is this object _foreign_ (thus not made by our own body), and is this object _malicious_? The interesting aspect is how long we too as a community to realize the second requirement exists and is extremely important. The first suggestion that we might have a system to independently determine whether an object is pathogenic was only made in 1989, which is very late for such a fundamental discovery indeed. Whether it&#x27;s a virus or bacteria, our immune system has to primarily ascertain that it&#x27;s pathogenic before it can do anything about it.<p>Importantly, when the immune system goes haywire like it does in Covid, it&#x27;s because of some fuckery with this system that is at the root cause more often than not.')
