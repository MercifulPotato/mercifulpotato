People shouldn&#x27;t hire blacks or women or whatever just for diversity sake, it just cause problems because those people are bitter and can&#x27;t compete.<p>If someone come to me and force me to do some political act I am going to fire them immediately, who are they to tell me what to do with my political view? even if they force other people in the company I will fire them without apologies. Google did it for this Damore guy for just stating his opinion about diversity, not even forcing anyone to accept his views. Imagine he go to Pichai and force him to chant &quot;diversity is bullshit&quot;, which it is, but does it matter? you can&#x27;t do such stuff even if you think your cause is right')
