Mostly because there have been quite many news articles referencing similar events earlier, so if there was no year&#x2F;month listed, I would have thought it is just another discussion on a tariff passed earlier this year.<p>I don&#x27;t have a strong feeling on it either way, but the default rule of &quot;no year in the title if the article is from this year&quot; actually makes sense and feels appropriate, as it definitely helps with keeping things a bit more standardized and easier to parse.')
