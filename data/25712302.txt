Item(by='smsm42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610267160, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25710908, text='You didn&#x27;t talk about moderators - you talked about users.<p>&gt; Participating without challenging that is giving it a veneer of legitimacy<p>That&#x27;s bullshit, and moreover, this is asinine and dangerous bullshit. Any idiot can write anything on a public site, and there&#x27;s no moderation team in the world that can police everything with 100% accuracy. Facebook and Twitter, despite millions spent on moderation, are full of hateful content and host hundreds of violent groups. Twitter used to host Hamas and Hezbollah until 2019. Does it mean every single Twitter user until 2019 were sheltering terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah? This is just idiotic. Of course no user can know who else writes what on a large public service, and no user owes to anyone to police the content of large public service. It makes as much sense as demanding me to police the speech of everyone in my city or move out. Only my city has a million people and twitter has hundreds of millions - so it&#x27;s more like either you police the speech of everyone in your country or you must emigrate. Or you are responsible for everything anybody ever said within your country. As I said, utterly asinine, idiotic and dangerous. \nI am not talking about specialized forums that are explicitly declared as belonging to particular movement - like Stormfront - I am talking about generic platform that is open to anybody and hosts millions.<p>&gt; and lending plausible deniability to a platform clearly designed for them.<p>This is example of circular logic. You declare that Parler is platform for specific kind of bad people, and when you&#x27;re pointed out that vast majority of the users aren&#x27;t those people you claim the platform is &quot;clearly designed&quot; for a tiny minority and all the vast majority is just &quot;gives plausible deniability&quot; to them. It&#x27;s like claiming the whole USA is built to enable the Zodiac Killer, and everything all the people do is just giving him veneer of legitimacy and that&#x27;s the point of whole USA existing. That&#x27;s how you are sounding.<p>&gt; theyâ€™re tolerated and implicitly welcome<p>It is telling that you said &quot;implicitly&quot;. That means you have no proof they are, but pretend to read minds of Parler users and administrators. Too bad it is explicitly knows internet telepathy does not work. \nOn Parler, all the speech that does not violate the law is tolerated (even though it is not endorsed, or agreed with, of course). As it should be on every free platform. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. It&#x27;s called &quot;free speech&quot;, and once it was a value of America. Not anymore, of course.')
