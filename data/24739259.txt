While the training itself cost 4.6$M (unsure if this include hyper parameter search done on smaller models beforehand), even if an open source organization had that money available, I don&#x27;t believe they would be able to access the kind of infra needed to train GPT-3. The closest thing would probably be some TPU pods on GCP, but even then, I think the biggest pod you can publicly access is too small (unless you are ok training for 3 years).')
