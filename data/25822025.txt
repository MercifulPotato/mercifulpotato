In manufacturing and operations, the thinking has already been &quot;baked&quot; into the activity and you make it faster by adding more people, materials and equipment. (More cashiers, more assembly lines, more factories, more CI compute&#x2F;memory&#x2F;storage&#x2F;bandwidth)  With problem solving&#x2F;analysis context switching would exhaust concentration from the thrashing of unrelated patterns&#x2F;predictions.  If you add more people to a problem solving&#x2F;analysis context you increase the amount of coordination work for everyone to achieve &quot;shared understanding&quot;.<p>If you add a _lot_ of people to a problem solving&#x2F;analysis context (e.g. open source&#x2F;crowd sourcing) you throw out the constraint of &quot;shared understanding&quot; and win by probability with many different minds partially thinking about the problem.  This takes longer of course-- because the project maintainers then have to sift through the crowd&#x27;s input.<p>The goal has to be understand the form of work, and adjust the levers accordingly.')
