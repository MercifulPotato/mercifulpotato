An audience member who was an avid Go user asked a simple, innocent question about some shortcoming of the language. He copped a sarcastic and dismissive response from Pike, which of course then acted as the signal for everyone else to treat him the same way during the casual drinks and pizza after the session. I’ve seen this sort of thing time and time again both professionally and in the meetup &#x2F; conference space.<p>On the contrary, the Ruby development community across three different Australian cities is dominated by people who have a solid baseline of emotional intelligence and worldly perspective. This filters through the community and creates an environment that I personally find to be far more welcoming and intellectually stimulating.')
