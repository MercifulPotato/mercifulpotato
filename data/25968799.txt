Loved the language.<p>Then along came JPI TopSpeed Modula-2 (Pascal++ [joke]) and even though I now do C#, Go, Node, Python, Ruby, and FreePascal, nothing matches the sheer productivity and performance that TopSpeed provided. And their IDE was incredible at the time (though Turbo Pascal 3 having a compiler and editor in around 40KB was technically more awesome).')
