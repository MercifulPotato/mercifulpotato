But in my opinion, these numbers considered over a short period aren&#x27;t necessarily a relevant base for comparison.<p>The majority of startups fails. So for an individual considering the risk of that adventure, it&#x27;s not only important to prepare for take off, it&#x27;s also important to make sure the landing will not be too rough. Especially the emergency landing. In the US, entrepreneurship is so ingrained in the culture that the costs and stigmas associated with failure are lower than in many (most?) other places in the world. They&#x27;re therefore not as big a deterrent.<p>In order for me to consider Switzerland as a possible alternative to Silicon Valley, I&#x27;d have to ask some questions like, how well is the risk of entrepreneurship understood? What happens when the majority of these startups fails in the next 5 years? How willing will entrepreneurs be to try a second time? How many current &quot;second-chance&quot; entrepreneurs (those who&#x27;ve already tried and failed at least once before) are there?')
