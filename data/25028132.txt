When it conducts &lt;50% of the time, it is class C. When it conducts &gt;50% of the time (i.e. near the middle, both devices conduct), it is class AB. When it exactly conducts 50% of the time, it is class B.<p>Turns out at the crossover point, when it&#x27;s is class AB, you get something called gm doubling where the large signal gain goes up because both devices are conducting and therefore providing gain. When you&#x27;re in class C (incorrectly called class B by noobs), no device conduct near the middle so you get crossover distortion in the opposite direction. In class B, you theoretically get near-perfect handoff which makes the crossover distortion minimal (at least compared to class A)')
