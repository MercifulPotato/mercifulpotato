Between 2000 and 2010, they released only four games: Diablo II, Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, World of Warcraft and StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty. I&#x27;m sure even today&#x27;s Blizzard can somehow manage to release four games between 2020 and 2030, although I doubt they will have as strong an impact as these four.')
