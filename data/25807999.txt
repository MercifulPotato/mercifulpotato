Item(by='Mountain_Skies', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610856382, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25807920, text='Tim Stryker, the author of Major BBS, wrote a cover article for Boardwatch Magazine about what he called &#x27;Superdemocracy&#x27;, which was a hybrid of representative and direct democracy. Stryker was a bit of a crank with some odd views but the article does have some interesting thoughts on how to make a hybrid system work. It was written in the days of dial up, so would have been rather cumbersome to implement, but easier in this age where even many homeless have phones with data plans. I don&#x27;t know how well such a system would work in practice. I suspect that it wouldn&#x27;t scale well but would be interested in seeing someone give it a try on the local level to see how it turns out.<p>Some issues of Boardwatch are available on archive.org but I&#x27;m not sure if that particular issue is. It&#x27;s been a couple of decades since I read the article so it&#x27;s also possible my much younger mind thought more of it than I would if I found it again.')
