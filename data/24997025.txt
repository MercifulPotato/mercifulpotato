Just create some tables, write some markup and you&#x27;re done. Share the URL, it&#x27;s live!<p>You could also use it for stuff like simple form submissions in otherwise static sites (Ã  la Netlify) or website hosting in general. Just have your static site generator spit out an ugliest.app bundle and deploy it using curl. You get some dynamic content generation for free!<p>Hopefully this does not sound insane but I think this idea of &quot;something like Access, kind of, but on the web&quot; is brilliant and necessary. I don&#x27;t wanna tell you what to do but maybe open sourcing this would be beneficial? Judging by how fast you&#x27;ve been fixing bugs and adding features in the comments I figure the code is not a mess. People might just prefer contributing that one feature they were missing instead of writing their own web server for their tiny app.')
