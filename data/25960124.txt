Item(by='dubcanada', descendants=None, kids=[25960644], score=None, time=1611942535, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25957688, text='@rakibtg - not sure if it&#x27;s just me (Windows, Chrome) but if I scroll down manually and then click any of the links on the left I end up in the middle of the section, rather then at the top. So go to the site, scroll down a little using the scrollbar, click &quot;Delete Data&quot; on the left. You are now in the middle of the &quot;Delete Data&quot; section. Looks like you show&#x2F;hide different sections, you should scroll to the top of the section on click.<p>Besides that it seems rather great, I am going to test it out.')
