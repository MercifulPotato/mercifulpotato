Hypothetical examples involving imaginary datasets that nobody would use don&#x27;t prove anything relevant. And note that my argument is not about whether you actually avoid bias, it&#x27;s about whether you&#x27;ve done the most you can do to avoid it. If you used all the data you&#x27;ve got, then you&#x27;ve done the most you can, even if for some reason the data you&#x27;ve got isn&#x27;t any good.')
