In a traditional vaccine, it’s learning by practice. In mRNA it is learned by teaching&#x2F;programming from a set of instructions.<p>The programming part is what got people worried. you can’t introduce proteins to get your DNA to do something it isn’t naturally programmed to do without some rewriting like mRNA has the potential to do.<p>Also I’m not a bio engineer I don’t know every set of instructions this vaccine or future vaccines contain. Couple that with a blanket authority to the government to tell you what you must put into your body is creating a terrible situation waiting to happen. Yes it’s absolutely something people should worry about.')
