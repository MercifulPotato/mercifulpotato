The UK AZ plant is yet running at 100% yield according to the AZ chairman, and the EU plants are further behind.  If there were 100% supply, the UK would be even further ahead in its doses-administered.<p>&gt; Basically the UK took advantage of EU capacity<p>It&#x27;s not the UK that took advantage, <i>if</i> the vaccines originated in an EU plant, it&#x27;s that <i>AZ</i> chose to supply doses to the UK from the EU plant to meet its contractual &#x27;best efforts&#x27; obligation, <i>not</i> the UK.<p>That&#x27;s my point from earlier that the media are trying to draw the UK into this as some kind of post-Brexit spat with the EU, and that the UK gov. have rightly been quiet on the whole thing so far.  That&#x27;s also, partly, the EU&#x27;s view on it as well, which is one of the reasons I suppose why they &#x27;raided&#x27; the plants in the EU.')
