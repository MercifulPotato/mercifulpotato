Item(by='slg', descendants=None, kids=[24865340], score=None, time=1603399277, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24862887, text='He has said multiple times that orders are &quot;placed&quot;.  He also said they aren&#x27;t &quot;executed&quot;.  Based on what other people are saying here about McDonald&#x27;s workflow, it sounds like a placed order wouldn&#x27;t actually be executed unless he shows up to the store.  That is probably what is happening here.  It may be &quot;reasonably harmless&quot; but it is still not a nice thing to do just for fun and 15 minutes of internet fame.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m not sure why, but moderators have detached this line of comments from where I was originally replying.  I really don&#x27;t think questioning the ethics of something like this is out of line on HN, but I can understand the phrase &quot;kind of an asshole move&quot; might have upset some people.  Since this is the only comment I can still edit, I will just throw in the clarification of context that detaching this comment might have removed. The &quot;asshole move&quot; I was referring to is the practice of brute forcing this information through an internal McDonald&#x27;s API by sending $18k worth of orders every minute.')
