I opened a case to ISP support and they called me back. The support guy did not believe it. He said &quot;this is not an analog network, this is digital, you either have it or not&quot;. I said I know what the analog and digital mean and also I know this is a digital network since I am a computer engineer and I checked everything so this was a issue with connection. After a couple hours later, he called me back and said that problem was caused by modem and a driver update would fix it and it did. These were good old days, however, when we can reach someone on the phone and talk about problem. Nowadays everything is either automated response or some random person whose whole job to tell you that he&#x2F;she cannot do anything about the situation.')
