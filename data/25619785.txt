But it&#x27;s a risk that&#x27;s also fine with me: I don&#x27;t want to support and develop shitty prototypes that I&#x27;ve whipped up and know to be awful from a maintenance perspective. So if my garbage gets sidelined and I go work on something else, that&#x27;s also a win and also not my problem anymore.')
