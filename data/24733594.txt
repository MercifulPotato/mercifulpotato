Google bought a company focused on this about 10 years ago, I&#x27;m sure Facebook put similar effort in.<p>I doubt either of us know that either of their ad networks does a better job. They certainly have invested more money in it, but they also run much bigger ad networks that are likely much more aggressively targeted for fraud (particularly because of their revenue models). So they may have more of the clicks that get through being fraud than Reddit.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m sure this is something they&#x27;ll work to improve over time as their ad network gains traction.<p>Yeah, but what I think is needed right now is a more mature perspective on click fraud. For starters, the underlying subtext that &quot;click fraud&quot; means that the ad network is profiting at the advertiser&#x27;s expense fails to appreciate the context. If there was no fraud, the clicks would cost proportionately more (likely <i>more</i> than proportionately more), so the advertiser would save no money and Reddit would not lose any revenue.<p>More than that though, the poster doesn&#x27;t seem to appreciate that what they are describing as obviously fraudulent is likely filled with a lot of false positives (I&#x27;d speculate that they are labeling at least a third of their <i>real</i> traffic as fraud using this heuristic). They also do not seem to understand that just because they are using a technique to detect fraud that Reddit isn&#x27;t employing the same technique on their side; click fraudsters have a strong incentive to fool ad network detection mechanisms, but no incentive to fool the landing pages. They might follow redirects, load images, use unique IPs, etc. on the ad network, but they have no incentive to fool the operator of the site the ad is sending traffic to (in fact, sometimes their objective is to convince the advertiser that the ad network isn&#x27;t providing quality traffic).')
