I created them. If i say they&#x27;re logos then they&#x27;re logos.<p>Please don&#x27;t tell me how i need to feel. That not up to you, I&#x27;m fine how i feel, if you&#x27;re not, your issue, not mine. Please don&#x27;t tell me I&#x27;m being defensive, you don&#x27;t know that, and are just projecting into the story that I&#x27;m defending against some attack, or i don&#x27;t know show. Just some story maybe so you can pretend to look down on someone else. Please don&#x27;t explain to me how show operates, i think i know better than you. I don&#x27;t see you having much good experience with show, I&#x27;ve got more. I&#x27;m not being defensive nor defending anything nor complaining. I&#x27;m being clear how i feel about it. Why don&#x27;t you criticize people trying to put down instead of criticizing me responding... Unless you support people trying to put down? If the thread is dominated by people putting down, that&#x27;s not me, and if you&#x27;re against that, you can speak up against it.<p>I just feel sad for some people they couldn&#x27;t have a good experience of this because they got hung up on the wording, and sad for others they need to put down to feel better. Be positive and supportive, not negative, mean or gratuitously critical, that&#x27;s in a show, but guidelines or not, that&#x27;s just being kind.')
