I created them. If i say they&#x27;re logos then they&#x27;re logos.<p>Please don&#x27;t tell me how i need to feel. That not up to you, I&#x27;m fine how i feel, if you&#x27;re not, your issue, not mine. Please don&#x27;t tell me I&#x27;m being defensive, you don&#x27;t know that, and are just projecting into the story that I&#x27;m defending against some attack. Just some story maybe so you can pretend to look down on someone else. I&#x27;m not being defensive nor defending anything nor complaining. I&#x27;m being clear how i feel about it. Why don&#x27;t you criticize people putting for comments down instead of criticizing what i say. If the thread is dominated by people putting down comments, that&#x27;s not me. I&#x27;m responding.<p>I just feel sad for some people they couldn&#x27;t have a good experience of this because they got hung up on the wording, and sad for others they need to put down comments to feel better. It&#x27;s a show, be positive and supportive, not negative, mean or gratuitously critical, guidelines or not that&#x27;s just being kind.')
