I like the design; a bit plain but pretty readable.  I had to go in to FontForge and fix what I felt were some issues with the font:<p>* I prefer a stroke instead of a dot in to 0 (zero)<p>* While JetBrains mono has an alternate form with a 0 stroke, the stroke is too thin.<p>* The smart quotes, such as “” look too much like each other.  I edited them to give the font Verdana-style smart quotes (where “ and ‘ point to the left)<p>* The “c” looks too much like “o”.  I have opened up the bowl in c so it’s distinct from “o”.<p>* I aggressively subsetted the font to have only English, Spanish, and some basic typography (smart quotes, em dash, bullet, right arrow).  This reduces the size, which means I could make it a webfont in the future.<p>* The changes are over at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;samboy&#x2F;CaulixtlaFonts&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;MiscFonts&#x2F;AnnaFonts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;samboy&#x2F;CaulixtlaFonts&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;MiscFon...</a> (AnnaTerm is modified Fira Mono; ElsaTerm is modified Jetbrains Mono)<p>These are issues I could quickly patch up in Fontforge, and I do like the font.')
