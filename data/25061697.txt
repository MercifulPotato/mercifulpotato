No, they’re going to take the whole thing apart, replace all the consumables and user-facing parts, the sell it as refurbished. And that’s the best case: they might have to strip it for parts or trash it depending on what it was that you bought.<p>This has nothing to do with a love of Apple or anything, and everything to do with “you’re abusing a program that they are going to either ban you from, or remove because you abused it too much”.')
