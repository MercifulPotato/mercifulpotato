Media makes a difference at the margins, sure, but clearly the reason for the higher &quot;temperature&quot; is the more extreme rhetoric from our leaders.<p>Trump led his followers into the pit of a Big Lie about evil people stealing an election, and much of the republican party and its media ecosystem followed him there.  (And this was just the final expression of a rhetorical style and relationship with the truth that he had applied through the whole administration.)  Why can&#x27;t that be the primary reason for the high &quot;temperature&quot; and not some abstract idea about media?<p>If we want people to behave like grownups we need to put grownups in charge, basically.  If you tell people that the presidency is being stolen they&#x27;re going to try to steal it back.')
