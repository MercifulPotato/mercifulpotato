The author certainly had outside stress including cancer and what sounds like an unprofitable company, but an area he spends a lot of time on and shares a full letter for is a nightmare board member he had to deal with.<p>Also if your company is not profitable and successful at a small size, why would you try and make it a hell of a lot larger? That is all VC funding does. It doesn&#x27;t suddenly magically make your bad idea a good one.')
