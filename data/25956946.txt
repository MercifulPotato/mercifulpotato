VCs need fresh young blood to push through the startup grinder.<p>That said, I haven&#x27;t noticed much of this connotation here on HN (which is ironic, this being ex-Startup News, and a board attached to an VC company). For this I have another hypothesis: HN has a slightly different bias when the EU is awake, which is now.')
