Item(by='jlgaddis', descendants=None, kids=[25493138, 25494706], score=None, time=1608527060, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25489243, text='&gt; <i>It&#x27;s beyond suspicious that 4 newly created users all have positive experience with PJON and only posted on this submission.</i><p>I will freely admit that I am, quite often, overly suspicious when there&#x27;s a bunch of &quot;green&quot; users commenting (overwhelmingly positive) on a Show HN thread too -- especially when there&#x27;s any money potentially involved (i.e., a product for sale, seemingly &quot;technical&quot; blog posts which are, in reality, just carefully prepared sales&#x2F;marketing material, and so on) [0]. To be quite honest, I&#x27;m overly suspicious of damn near <i>everything</i> and I particularly despise &quot;spam&quot; <i>of any kind</i> [1].<p>In this case, though, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything dishonest going on, though [2].<p>The project has been around for about a decade and there&#x27;s obviously a community behind it. I only spent about 20 minutes exploring the web site and Git repo and while I don&#x27;t recall seeing any obvious links to a mailing list, message board, or IRC channel, I&#x27;m sure the project has <i>someplace</i> where they &quot;hang out&quot; and collaborate.<p>To me, at least, it&#x27;s quite easy to imagine that the founder of the project -- the same person who posted this Show HN, AFAICT -- may have told the PJON community &quot;Hey everyone, I just posted a link PJON to HN; here&#x27;s the URL if anyone wants to join the discussion ...&quot; or something else similar to that. I don&#x27;t know whether something like happened here or whether the PJON users who just created their HN accounts to comment in this thread discovered it via some other means. I do think that there are several possible explanations that are more likely than all of them being (paid) shills for a piece of software that&#x27;s both free as in speech and free as in beer [3].<p>Personally, my own smell test considers things like &quot;what&#x27;s being promoted?&quot;, &quot;what&#x27;s the <i>real</i> benefit&#x2F;goal of posting this here?&quot;, and, of course, &quot;<i>who</i> benefits from this and in what ways?&quot;.<p>As I said before, I don&#x27;t have any doubt that there&#x27;s an ulterior motive here -- the goal seems to simply be to share and promote an ~10 year old open source implementation of an open network protocol that 1) is exactly the type of thing that&#x27;s generally of interest to HN&#x27;ers, 2) was founded on ideals and principles that many of us here on HN share and believe in (autonomy&#x2F;self-hosting&#x2F;decentralization), and 3) has (verifiably) been used, successfully, in the real world.<p>Besides, HN guidelines implore us all to extend the benefit of the doubt. Blatant, obvious &quot;violations&quot; should obviously be pointed out -- but this isn&#x27;t one of them.<p>In fact, this project is <i>EXACTLY</i> the type of project that <i>belongs on HN</i>. It&#x27;s a damn shame that it&#x27;s now &quot;[flagged]&quot;!<p>It&#x27;s <i>almost</i> as if &quot;somebody&quot; doesn&#x27;t want projects like this one to succeed. Who would benefit if PJON and others like it didn&#x27;t exist? Who would benefit if users instead had no other option but to pay a for-profit company for the hardware, software, and (of course!) the recurring monthly subscription fee instead of just doing it themselves? Hmm... (see how easy that is)?<p>--<p>[0] Hell, I get annoyed when User A posts a &quot;Show HN&quot; for their new project and then User X (and, sometimes, User Y and User Z) takes advantage of the &quot;opportunity&quot; to post a &quot;This is similar to $foo, $URL, which is an [app|company|service] that also does $thing&quot; comment in the thread (&quot;Submit your own Show HN, then!&quot; is what I <i>want</i> to say!). Bonus points to those who <i>somehow</i> manage to work in a reference to their own product&#x2F;service even when the two have only the most minimal of commonalities or similarities (&quot;Interesting. Our service, $bar, is also a web site&quot; is only a slight exaggeration).<p>[1]: Spam doesn&#x27;t just arrive via e-mail. To me, &quot;spam&quot; is rather loosely defined and includes any unsolicited and&#x2F;or unwanted sales&#x2F;marketing&#x2F;promotional material (or similar) and, in some cases, even includes anything &quot;off-topic&quot; (depending on the forum, usually).<p>[2]: My HN account is only ~8 years old and I only lurked for a few years before I <i>finally</i> decided to devote the time, effort, and energy necessary to create an account. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s long enough to pass your &quot;shill test&quot; or not; If necessary, I would sign a sworn affidavit attesting that I had never even heard of PJON before today but, then again, that&#x27;s just the kind of thing a shill would say!<p>[3]: It&#x27;s available under the Apache license.')
