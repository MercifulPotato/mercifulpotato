Heck, even JS and Python are. The runtimes, tools, libraries and overall developer experience for languages like these are easily on par with the Java or Microsoft ecosystems today, and in some respects far superior. They are all freely available without any strings attached, and they all work well on open platforms like Linux as well as Windows or Apple desktops.')
