The first two seem to be more about tenants feeling that an operator raises the quality of life.  The third one talks of several deaths of children.  Apparently in these cases there was a gap of 8 to ten inches between the car doors and the landing doors which accidentally trapped the children and then the car was requested from someone on another level.
