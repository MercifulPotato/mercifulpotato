This is a fine thing for performance critical systems, but for systems where Python’s performance could be described as adequate, the extra performance Rust offers is immaterial. Of course, Rust gives you a bit more type safety than Go as well, but still not enough to justify trading off so much development velocity (or rather, type safety and correctness simply aren’t nearly as important as velocity from an economic perspective).<p>Rust is getting better all the time—non-lexical lifetimes and rust-analyzer have provided a surprising improvement in development velocity, but Go is still in another class. Personally I think Go is the best language for developing quickly—even better than Python for non-toy projects (I say that as one with 15 years of Python experience and almost a decade of ago experience).')
