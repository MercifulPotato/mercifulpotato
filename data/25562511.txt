If you care about your software being correct (or let&#x27;s say less incorrect) you need to test it. And preferably you write automated tests. Games (and especially game engines) aren&#x27;t really by default an exception to this.<p>(Of course you can just say that this game is not worth the effort of getting better quality so we don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s a bug fest and that&#x27;s fine).')
