If you have that upbringing, then you&#x27;re right, nothing is stopping you from doing all of this.<p>But if you don&#x27;t, well, what are you supposed to do? Your relationship to work is what it is because you can&#x27;t afford to lose your job, and you were raised in an environment where others feel that way. Your ability to come home and learn things, rather than &quot;sit down and watch tv or do something that&#x27;s not going to progress you&quot; is severely impacted if your mental health is already suffering. Your ability to even imagine what you can accomplish is affected by having no examples that you&#x27;ve witnessed in real life.<p>You can, of course, chalk all of this up to personal responsibility. But the alternative view, backed by science, is that being raised poor impacts all of these things and more, and that&#x27;s a matter of how the human brain works. In the aggregate, it&#x27;s not a matter of personal responsibility.')
