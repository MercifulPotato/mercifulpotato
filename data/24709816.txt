Like it doesn&#x27;t completely shock me, I figured you <i>could</i> find out who I&#x27;ve donated to if you wanted to look but I never thought it would be this easy and they also have datasets you can download... If I didn&#x27;t already have too many side-projects that I&#x27;m working on then I&#x27;d love to heatmap out this data by zip code for donations to party&#x2F;candidate or play with the data in some other way. It&#x27;s quite fun to throw in your company name and see who gave how much and to where.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fec.gov&#x2F;data&#x2F;receipts&#x2F;individual-contributions&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fec.gov&#x2F;data&#x2F;receipts&#x2F;individual-contributions&#x2F;</a>')
