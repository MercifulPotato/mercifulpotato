Cancer needs a bunch of unusual major characteristics from cells, and the lymphatic system already has all but one of those characteristics, it makes cells that are intended to wander about the body (whereas say your skin cells or brain cells are designed to always stay in one place), it sometimes makes lots of them (to fight disease, whereas most cells are replaced only slowly over a long period), <i>however</i> the cells aren&#x27;t supposed to refuse to self-destruct. If a mutation disables the self-destruct in a lymphatic cell line now you&#x27;ve for a recipe for cancer.<p>So if it&#x27;s just one or two mutations, on the one hand it becomes more likely that you get it (and we see lots of 20-something men get Hodgkins whereas obviously very few of them get stuff like lung cancer) and on the other hand it is easier to cure, basically just kill the patient slowly, cross fingers the cancer cells die first then you save the patient.<p>That&#x27;s a very high level idea of the plan for the chemotherapy + radiotherapy used. In medicine the goal is to find reliable ways to do this that kill the fewest patients while reliably getting rid of the cancer, and then also aiming not to make the side effects suck too badly when you cure people (e.g. my lungs are trashed so that I permanently have a mild cough, which wasn&#x27;t a huge annoyance for a middle aged guy who frankly doesn&#x27;t eat well enough or exercise anyway, but I can see it&#x27;d ruin your life if you were previously a world class athlete and now you&#x27;ll never achieve that potential). But obviously Mother Nature could very easily randomly cure some people from a single mutation by luck.')
