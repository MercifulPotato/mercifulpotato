Compare &quot;we are [imperfect], but that doesn’t mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect.&quot; with &quot;we are [imperfect], but that doesn’t mean we aren&#x27;t striving to form a union that is perfect.&quot; The former can be reshaped to <i>we are imperfect, therefore we are trying to form a union that is imperfect</i>---it leaves open the possibility that you wish to make the union <i>worse.</i> The latter becomes <i>we are imperfect but we are trying to form a union that is perfect.</i><p>It&#x27;s probably a typo.')
