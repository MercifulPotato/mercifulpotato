Of course, at the moment there are simply some apps (like Telegram IIRC) that are thin wrappers around a web app. But taking f-droid as a reference, compared to the play store, I have great hopes to end up with a less bloated stack.<p>Cynics would call the apps on f-droid feature poor. But for me, the FOSS apps that I use day to day tend to just do the thing you need them for, no more.\nThere&#x27;s no telemetry overhead, they tend to use fewer dependencies, are less likely to be built on heavy frameworks like electron. Of course there&#x27;s heavy sampling bias involved in this since I specifically select apps that feel snappy and light.\nBut this has always been true for linux desktop apps, too. \nMy favourite comparison is the size of pdf viewers. I have never lacked a feature from the Adobe pdf reader. The 400KB binary of evince totally sufficed, and it used much fewer resources at runtime, too.<p>I really hope that this ecosystem can push the boundaries of what&#x27;s possible with lower-spec hardware, even if just to hold the mirror to the big platforms.')
