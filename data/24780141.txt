It&#x27;s like God gave the middle finger to the US in this regard but it&#x27;s something technology could potentially solve for. Much of the eastern US coastline has huge drop offs not far off the coast of windy areas. You need a max depth of ~50 meters for a good sized turbine to be installed. Florida is one of the most viable places but alas, not very windy.<p>Compare this to Northwestern Europe in this map: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britannica.com&#x2F;place&#x2F;Atlantic-Ocean" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britannica.com&#x2F;place&#x2F;Atlantic-Ocean</a>\nIt makes England&#x2F;Nordics&#x2F;Benelux the Saudi Arabia of wind power!<p>I don&#x27;t know much about the potential for California though. Has it not been invested in due to seismic risks? Or is it mainly a factor of coastal homeowners lobbying against it?')
