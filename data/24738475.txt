It may seem weird to some, but for me it&#x27;s a timesaver. The most painful thing is the installation. I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy doing things following some guide, I figure it&#x27;d be best done by some automated script. However, I find it&#x27;s an investment which yields a ton of dividends. Once it&#x27;s installed, everything is pretty much painless and I don&#x27;t usually install it that often (only when I get a new PC).<p>I usually enjoy having fairly up-to-date software and doing this is often a pain on Ubuntu. You have to chase down alternative ppas, which may or may not work well with other ppas. Sometimes there&#x27;s nothing available and you have to build your own â€“ I&#x27;ve had this issue when I was trying Ubuntu 20.04 right after it came out and wanted to have my BT LDAC headphones working [0]. Some guy came up with a custom build after a while, not sure what the situation currently is.<p>I use i3 and wanted to experiment with a compositor. At the time Ubuntu had an old version of compton. I would have had to mainain my own install of picom. I don&#x27;t much enjoy doing things manually when they can be automated. Ditto for alacritty. They used to provide .deb packages, but not anylonger. Sure, installing alacritty is fairly simple, but again, it would have to be maintained up to date separately from the main packages. I don&#x27;t enjoy that.<p>In the end, Arch just gets out of my way. I only have to run a full system update every so often (once a week works for me) and I have the latest and greateast of everything. And in case something&#x27;s missing from the official repo, there&#x27;s the AUR (a sort of &quot;user-managed ppa&quot; with packages built from source) and if using a helper, this is kept up to date automatically.<p>I understand some people don&#x27;t really care about what they&#x27;re using as long as whatever applications they run work fine, so I get the appeal of something as stable as Ubuntu, especially if not running brand new hardware requiring the absolute latest kernel for support.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;EHfive&#x2F;pulseaudio-modules-bt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;EHfive&#x2F;pulseaudio-modules-bt</a>')
