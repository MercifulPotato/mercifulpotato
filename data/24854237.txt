Item(by='rfrey', descendants=None, kids=[24854686], score=None, time=1603332368, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24853752, text='It seems like a natural pivot for Alberta, and we spent a lot of sweat trying to convince the government that it was good for drillers.  Good for pipefitters and welders and millwrights too. No dice though, if anything I&#x27;d say the government actively sabotaged our company (retracted a $7m grant from the previous administration, for example). Just too green for them.<p>There is a lot of talent available, and one of the drilling companies (Beaver Drilling) has made themselves the spokesman for the geothermal industry. That&#x27;s what got things moving with at least the government paying lip service to the industry. I left just as Beaver was stepping in, though.<p>As for costs: so many of the drilling costs are fixed - material costs for casing, consumables like drill bits and drilling slurry. Labor might be down but it&#x27;s still several million dollars per hole.')
