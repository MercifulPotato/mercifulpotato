It&#x27;s also a powerful status signal - if you tell me you enjoy working in &quot;Python and Haskell&quot; or &quot;Ruby and Erlang&quot;, versus &quot;C# and Java&quot; I&#x27;ll have a very different impression of you (as unfair as that may be).<p>In summary, I&#x27;d say, try out a few languages, and learn the ones that you enjoy the most and feel most productive in. You&#x27;ll spend most of your waking hours thinking in it, you might as well pick something that is fun for you to express yourself in, rather than a language that you have to fight.')
