I especially liked the easy collapsibility of comment threads and the indication of the comment level.<p>While I haven’t used the site much, it seemed as if one could only navigate by day for the last one week. Is it possible to enter or choose a date and go to that date in the (probably distant) past? If yes, I haven’t discovered it. I don’t have time to catch up with some posts and threads within a week, and would like to use this interface if possible. I get that it may add to your storage and server costs to keep a longer term archive.')
