The most perfidious thing centralized platforms do is promote controversial content to increase engagement. This is a double fail of centralization because, first, that&#x27;s their business model, and second, everything they screw up happens at scale.<p>Decentralizing things would create, let&#x27;s call it, algorithm diversity. Not everybody is finding things the same way as everybody else, so esoteric garbage mistakenly promoted by somebody&#x27;s bad code doesn&#x27;t have as much reach.<p>And the business model could be different. Or at least there could be more than one.')
