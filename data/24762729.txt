Large Ratios of a small number are nothing compared to even small ratios of a large number.<p>Once the repairs are done I get to know the state of those parts. Absolute worst case, and the engine needs replacement, we&#x27;re still only talking about 1 year worth of depreciation on a new car.<p>Will I need to replace the engine? Likely not. Would it have been slightly cheaper to spend 2x on a better used car? Sure, but maybe that one would have been a lemon too.<p>The scary part of used cars is spending money on repairs. Yet even expensive repairs are cheap. They are only expensive relative to the market value, but the market value is based on that lemon market risk.<p>The end result of having bought a far too cheap lemon: I&#x27;ve still spent less than a properly vetted vehicle and now I know some good mechanics down the street. The vehicle itself now has parts which are known quantities.<p>I&#x27;d really love an excuse to buy a new car. I&#x27;ve got the cash for it, but nothing modern cars can provide justify paying an engine replacement of depreciation every year.')
