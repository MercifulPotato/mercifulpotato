I don&#x27;t work in California, and instead work for a satellite office in the northeast US.<p>People in California appear to lack the ability to understand that the northeast is three hours ahead of them.  As a result, it&#x27;s not uncommon for me to have meetings that go on until 9:30pm, multiple times per week. I have brought this up to my manager (and his manager (and his manager)) multiple times, asking if they can schedule meetings a bit earlier, and they say they&#x27;ll &quot;look into it&quot;.  Apparently they&#x27;ve been &quot;looking into it&quot; for two years now.<p>Apple ostensibly supports &quot;personal development&quot;, which would be great in theory, but anything involving this involves manager approval.  While they&#x27;re usually ok with you going to conferences, I tried getting approval for tuition reimbursement (which is advertised on the people&#x2F;hrweb site).  My direct manager said &quot;ok&quot;, but his manager said that he&#x27;s afraid that me going back to school and completing my degree would be &quot;too big of a distraction from work&quot;, and will not be approving my request.<p>My job is ostensibly &quot;individual contributor&quot;, but most of what I do is read emails, and copy and paste Java from one file to another.  When I told my manager&#x27;s manager that I didn&#x27;t find the work enjoyable, and that I would like to be given another project, his response was that I simply &quot;don&#x27;t understand how cool the project is&quot;.<p>My situation is substanially less horrible than the OP&#x27;s post, I don&#x27;t have any visa issues or anything and I can fairly easily quit, and I probably will quit fairly soon.  Still, that&#x27;s a difficult thing to do, my stock packages are still vesting. Oh well.')
