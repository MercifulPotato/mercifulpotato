The thing about the back end is that there&#x27;s no satisfaction in it other than the satisfaction of doing it well and earning the esteem of peers, so most back end developers are paying attention to the quality of the code they write.  The front end has other attractions as well, and many front-end developers start out focused on those attractions, and learn by experience (if they learn at all) that writing high quality code is related to the cool stuff that got them into programming in the first place.')
