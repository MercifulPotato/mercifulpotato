(Nothing wrong with that, BTW.)<p>I just got my first utility bill with a community solar monetary credit. I wrote the following piece attempting to figure out the <i>energy</i> flows -- as opposed to the dollar flows.<p>-- cut here --<p>OK. I have a(n energetic) head scratcher with my latest unbundled\nelectricity bill. It&#x27;s the first one that includes a community solar\nsubscription.\nFor geeks, this is almost a thermodynamics question about systems and\nsurroundings -- but it&#x27;s camouflaged as a monetary problem in\ndisguise...<p>1) My utility company (NYSEG) charges me a per kW-hr fee for\n&quot;transmitting&quot; electricity and servicing their infrastructure. Fine and\ndandy. I understand that perfectly.<p>2) There is a separate per kW-hr fee from a different supplier of\nelectricity with whom I have contracted for power. Again, I understand\nthat perfectly.<p>3) Now the head scratcher. My &quot;community solar&quot; account just started\ncontributing PV energy to the grid from a recently completed solar\nfarm. My fraction of energy generated from their deployment just\nshowed up as a <i>monetary credit</i> to my total bill. They will invoice\nme of 90% of that credit, and claim that I &quot;saved 10%&quot; on my\nelectricity cost. There is no statement whatsoever of the\namount of electrical energy corresponding to that monetary credit.<p>That&#x27;s the monetary accounting. Now let&#x27;s examine the energy accounting.<p>Let&#x27;s call the amount of energy from 2) above &quot;N&quot; for my &quot;normal&quot;\nsource of electrical power. Similarly, let us call the (unknown) amount of energy\nfrom 3) above &quot;S&quot; for my solar PV power.\n(In principle, once I knew the fee per kW-hr I was being charged for\nthe PV energy, I could convert the monetary charge to the numerical\nvalue for S. Let&#x27;s leave that as an exercise to be dealt with later\nafter I receive an invoice from the community solar provider -- which\nhopefully will tell me their cost-per-unit of energy.)<p>Clearly, I paid my normal provider for producing N units of energy. However, I\nactually consumed (N-S) units of their energy, because I (notionally)\nalso received S units of solar energy. I understand perfectly that\nelectricity on a transmission line is fungible, hence I don&#x27;t actually\nreceive &quot;electrons&quot; (so to speak) from either of them.\nThe community solar project will also get paid (at their claimed\n&quot;discounted&quot; rate) for producing S units of energy and delivering it\nto me via NYSEG.<p>My conundrum: It seems to me that (N+S) units of electrical energy\nhave been produced and paid for, but only N units have been\nconsumed. Hence there are (N+S) - N = S units of electrical energy\n&quot;somewhere&quot; that are generated but not consumed via this accounting\nsystem.<p>Where are those S units? Who owns them? Are they simply going towards\nheating up the transmission lines, or is somebody benefiting from\nthem?<p>Is it simply the case that NYSEG no longer has to pay for the energy\nconsumed in heating up their transmission lines, but are still\ncharging me the same transmission fees???<p>I don&#x27;t know the answer to this problem.<p>Discuss.')
