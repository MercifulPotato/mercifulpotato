On the backend side, Rails comes with an ORM, authentication, templating system and many more out of the box, while on Node you&#x27;ll need to mix and match a bunch of 3rd party libs or roll your own, which might be a good thing depending on your priorities but certainly kills productivity. On the frontend side, you can always use react with rails backend, but developing traditional template-based ui is usually faster than developing a react app and you can take advantage of rails templating&#x2F;rendering feature to speed up development.')
