It’s more akin to someone coming out and saying “I used to be a strong supporter for the democrats and voted for Hillary in the election, but the covid pandemic has made me  a firm Trump supporter due to his beautiful handling of it!” And then someone finds a series of Tweets proving the person was openly supporting Trump during the election.<p>I would more refer to it as a false flag conversion.
