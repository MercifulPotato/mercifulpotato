The talk even had performance comparisons against protobuf and it seemed like a decent alternative that worked well for them. Was this new alternative an extension of JAM, or a full rewrite? I know they have millions of players monthly, but I can&#x27;t imagine saving a bit on bandwidth could have warranted a full rewrite, especially when the majority of their traffic is from their own datacenters.')
