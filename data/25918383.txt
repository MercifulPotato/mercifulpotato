I recently bought an Optigan (Itself worthy of a HN discussion) and it was shipped on a pallet. Despite mediocre 1970s plastic construction it arrived alive. The shipping experience is hardly door to door. I had to drive to an opposite side of Houston in a ramshackle shipping area that could best be described as sketchy. That said, the folks working there while few were great and helped me load it up and get on my way... Point being I could see that UPS doesnt see a big future in that business. There isnt really a good way to last mile stuff like that cheaply.')
