Cat&#x27;s don&#x27;t &quot;deserve&quot; to be outside wandering free and I sure as hell don&#x27;t need them on my property terrorizing wildlife, tearing up my garden and shitting all over the place.<p>And no, you&#x27;re kitty is not a &quot;natural predator&quot; rebalancing anything. It&#x27;s a pet and as such should be kept under <i>you&#x27;re</i> control.<p>Entitled &quot;free roamer&quot; cat owners are the worst - and breaking leash  laws in just about every jurisdiction out there.  I have zero problems trapping trespassing cats and turning them over to animal control.  Not sure why people feel entitled to get a pass on this - it&#x27;s BS.')
