I definitely benefitted from a lack of bullying and some extra time to explore my math and computer interests in high school.  TJHS may have helped me if I had that opportunity, but it wasn&#x27;t a requirement.<p>I think as nerds we will generally be okay as long as we&#x27;re left alone and given resources for self-study.  That said, my experience is probably not in the majority and maybe it doesn&#x27;t work for the average nerd.')
