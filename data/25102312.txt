The other maintainer didn&#x27;t ask you to do that. You&#x27;re not entitled to even a minute of another person&#x27;s time just because you unilaterally decided to dedicate hours of yours on something.<p>This is just basic human decency. If someone puts in effort to help you or contribute to something you&#x27;ve created, just be a decent person and respond to them. It costs you nothing. There&#x27;s a difference between being entitled to something and just doing something because it&#x27;s the right thing to do.<p>No one is entitled to my gratitude because they hold the door open for me. I didn&#x27;t ask them to do that. But I say &quot;thank you&quot; anyway because it&#x27;s the right thing to do and the world would be a worse place if we were all assholes to each other always worrying about what we are and aren&#x27;t &quot;entitled&quot; to.<p>This is the whole spirit of open source software. If you don&#x27;t want to be bothered by other people putting in effort to collaborate with you, then don&#x27;t make your project open source, or just keep it closed to issues and PRs altogether.')
