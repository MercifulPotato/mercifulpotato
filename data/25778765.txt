As an example, take this sentence from the intro for the Project Blue Book page [1]:<p><i>By the time Project Blue Book ended, it had collected 12,618 UFO reports, and concluded that most of them were misidentifications of natural phenomena (clouds, stars, etc.) or conventional aircraft. According to the National Reconnaissance Office a number of the reports could be explained by flights of the formerly secret reconnaissance planes U-2 and A-12.[2] A small percentage of UFO reports were classified as unexplained, even after stringent analysis.</i><p>That &quot;small percentage&quot; is actually 22%, as indicated many paragraphs below. And if we only consider the &quot;Highest quality reports&quot; category, the reports deemed unidentified goes up to 35%. That&#x27;s not a &quot;small percentage&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Project_Blue_Book" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Project_Blue_Book</a>')
