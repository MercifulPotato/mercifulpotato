However, none of that is related to what I tried to highlight.<p>Sure, the US is (rightfully so) subjecting every company within its jurisdiction to US law, no matter on which market they operate. Sometimes they go even further and say non-US companies can be held liable, when they somehow interact with the USA or its citizens. That can sometimes become a bit dicey with jurisdictions, but even that is not the point here.<p>The point is that a US-based company is operating on a market outside the US and (most likely) is operating in a way that is within the law of that market.<p>To put bluntly: I don&#x27;t give a #### about how the US treats companies on their territory, regardless where those operate. I care about US-based companies abiding to law wherever they do business. If they can not do that, they should cease to operate there. Whether it&#x27;s the US government or something else that is to blame for the situation is irrelevant.')
