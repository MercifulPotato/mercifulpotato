Every field moves on till they get stuck on problem areas that hinder progress. Kind of a Peter principle for research. And what&#x27;s worse, bad studies act as a hindrance since they make an unsolved question look like settled science, and you can&#x27;t get support for pursuing a competing hypothesis.<p>And epidemiology seems really complex to me. Every person is unique in many ways and behaving based on effects stretching back over their entire lives.')
