The way I see it you have 2 choices if you want to build a general-purpose search engine:<p>1. Scrape results from other search engines, similar to Searx<p>2. Build a Bing wrapper, similar to DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, et al.<p>With Ask.Moe I&#x27;ve tried both. The problem with scraping other search engines is that they (especially Google) are very quick to CAPTCHA your requests, so you&#x27;d need to setup and maintain tons of proxies and you&#x27;d likely struggle with search engines returning results based on the proxy location since they like to ignore URL parameters&#x2F;user settings. The problem with building a Bing wrapper is that it&#x27;s incredibly expensive ($3&#x2F;1000 transactions for just Web, $7&#x2F;1000 if you want Web&#x2F;News&#x2F;Image&#x2F;Video&#x2F;etc. as well). Let&#x27;s say reaching the frontpage of Reddit&#x2F;HN netted you 100.000 visitors submitting an average of 10 queries - that would end up costing you $3000 or $7000 depending on which plan you were using. And you most likely wouldn&#x27;t have any ads&#x2F;affiliate links to offset the costs since Microsoft Advertising (I believe that&#x27;s what DuckDuckGo&#x2F;Ecosia use) is invite-only and won&#x27;t even entertain talking to you about your new search engine.<p>The reason you see a new search engine pop-up every month and disappear again the next is because it&#x27;s easy to build a Bing wrapper but incredibly difficult to make it profitable.<p>My plan is to build various categories (so far I&#x27;ve built <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ask.moe&#x2F;math" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ask.moe&#x2F;math</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ask.moe&#x2F;currency" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ask.moe&#x2F;currency</a> - podcast or news will likely be the next) that are inexpensive to operate and can hopefully generate some revenue. I&#x27;m also strongly considering supporting accounts where users can buy credits to use the general-purpose search engine, but I think it will be very difficult to convince people to pay to use a search engine.')
