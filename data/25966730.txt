Are you referring to how the tool window layout is independent for debugging vs. developing (like in Eclipse)? That&#x27;s actually something many of us find incredibly helpful because some toolboxes don&#x27;t even make sense in the development perspective (like the Locals toolbox), so we don&#x27;t want them there. I&#x27;d bet once you got the hang of it and customized it, you wouldn&#x27;t want the exact same toolboxes in both places either. (Eclipse does this too, except it&#x27;s awful because it doesn&#x27;t switch back automatically when exiting debugging.) What you want to do there <i>is</i> to customize it when debugging, but that takes like 1-3 minutes tops, and you just do it once and never have to think about it again. Tossing it out because of that is like abandoning your home because you don&#x27;t like your room layouts and you don&#x27;t want to arrange things in more than one room... if this is what&#x27;s bugging you, you should really reconsider.<p>As for VS being slow, it mainly depends how big your project&#x2F;solution is. Where I know it can be unreasonably slow is when you have <i>lots</i> of projects (several dozen) and you&#x27;re trying to change all their settings, or something like that. However, if you&#x27;re referring to the startup time specifically, it might actually be due to your computer not having generated the native images yet (try running ngen.exe executeQueuedItems for both 64-bit and 32-bit). If you mean editing source code, it shouldn&#x27;t be sluggish at all. But if you mean features like Find Reference, Go To Definition, etc., those rely on Intellisense which takes a while to update for a complicated language like C++ (or a dynamic one like Python)â€”I don&#x27;t expect much variation across IDEs here.')
