It is now a central part of my setup and workflows. Here are two features I use regularly:<p>- The &quot;virtual home&quot; specified with --private=&#x2F;path&#x2F;to&#x2F;folder runs the app with the specified folder as a home folder. I use this for all the apps I sandbox to make sure my real home does not get polluted by tens of config files, cache, etc. Removing all traces of an app is now as easy as deleting &#x2F;path&#x2F;to&#x2F;folder; I find this pretty neat to keep my home folder organized (each app gets its own home in ~&#x2F;.sandboxes&#x2F;&lt;app name&gt;).<p>- Starting an app with --private (without any argument) will run it into a temporary&#x2F;disposable home folder which will be cleaned up when the app is stopped. I use it to run some apps I don&#x27;t really trust and don&#x27;t need persistence for (e.g. I start Chrome with this option so that I get a fresh home, hence profile, every time I need it, same for Zoom when I need to join a meeting---not very often).<p>And of course all the profiles that are built-in to customize the sandboxing to most popular apps is great!<p>I&#x27;m really thankful for the work being done on this project.')
