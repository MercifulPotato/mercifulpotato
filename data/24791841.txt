For e-mail I run a standard dovecot and postfix set up.  For drive, I just scp files to a server.  I don&#x27;t take many photos or care.  If I did, I suppose I&#x27;d just copy them over to my server as well.  I run all of this stuff on a few old boxes at home (ancient laptops, old towers, what-have-you).<p>As a side question, to those who use google drive or similar, how do you stand it?  I hate having to click through a bunch of dialogues to do stuff.  Just being able to use a plain HTTP link is much better.  I put stuff I want private in a directory that requires HTTP basic auth and it&#x27;s so much easier.  I can copy to&#x2F;from on a phone by VPNing into my house and using a samba client.  So much easier.')
