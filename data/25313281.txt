That would include homicide, suicide, accidents, poisonings, overdoses.<p>Here is the graph I got: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;N4lSSam" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;N4lSSam</a><p>The drop-off at the end is because of reporting lag. There is more of a drop-off with these than other causes, presumably because producing a final death certificate takes more time on average (forensic autopsies, toxicology testing, etc.).<p>Through week 35, there were about 13,000 more non-natural cause deaths in 2020 over 2019.<p>By comparison, the number of excess deaths through week 35 was 258,846. That implies that 95% of the excess deaths were natural causes.<p>Here are some spreadsheets I&#x27;ve made from CDC data:<p>[1] Weekly counts of deaths by select causes  \n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1G31ODc4eVgzg7etmcCV5SUfeFTtFYWN8YA4M3RkXYSw&#x2F;edit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1G31ODc4eVgzg7etmcCV5...</a><p>[2] US Deaths by Week and Year  \n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1qucznpabG1aUz0GSiDbiv0-Uy16wUhxOqiEdDYHyqYE&#x2F;edit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1qucznpabG1aUz0GSiDbi...</a><p>[3] U.S. Excess deaths by age  \n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1rcGoWRsNxS_zJQ3pJtbWn-eh-i4kxMTSWmhh4qlTFl4&#x2F;edit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;spreadsheets&#x2F;d&#x2F;1rcGoWRsNxS_zJQ3pJtbW...</a>')
