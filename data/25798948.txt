Or you just want to help me to communicate better, but then, how about reading other people&#x27;s comments without prejudice?<p>The correct way to show empathy to you seems to be to show pity or say &quot;oh my god it is so bad, I could never understand it, because I have it undeservedly so much better than you&quot;, or something along those lines?<p>&quot;You constantly ask &quot;What is the point?&quot; Why do you think the woman wrote about her spoon theory? What is her point? Do you really think padolsey wrote the comment on relativistic thinking to play thought police?&quot;<p>Indeed, I asked myself the question, I think it is a valid one. I thought her description was interesting and I therefore upvoted it. But I also resented her for the &quot;you are all so clueless and could never understand how hard it is for me&quot; vibes. To be honest, I get some &quot;identity politics&quot; vibes from that, it reminds me of the &quot;white people can never know how bad it is for black people&quot; or &quot;men can never know how bad it is for women&quot; nonsense, boiling down to &quot;I&#x27;m so special&quot;. I don&#x27;t like it also because it is so self-defeating. The spoon woman seems to think everybody else has unlimited spoons, which is of course not true.<p>And the relativistic thinking comment - I don&#x27;t know? Maybe he wants us to be aware at all times, and make everything we have our privileged access to, also accessible to people with severe illnesses? Why did he make the comment?')
