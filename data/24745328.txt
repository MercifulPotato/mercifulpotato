Nobody who is ever going to do anything with the information on that sub will ever rely on info posted there. The worst I&#x27;ve seen is some pseudo-news organization actually quoting a Reddit post on r&#x2F;spacex without attribution. People who actually build rockets don&#x27;t learn their craft from Reddit.')
