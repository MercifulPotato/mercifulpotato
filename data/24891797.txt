(Even in X, xdotool isn&#x27;t perfect and a lot of its commands won&#x27;t work if your window manager doesn&#x27;t support the right hints) Unless you feel like volunteering to make a standard for this, you&#x27;ll get the best mileage out of using an API specific to your compositor rather than waiting for someone else to come up with a standard. I know GNOME exports its internals with a javascript interface, and Sway has a way to run various commands using a JSON interface too.')
