The only reason why you don&#x27;t generally see that kind of advertising is because it offends people.<p>The amount offended is far less than when Ronald reagan began his war on drugs - meaning that offense changes with time, and that offense changes based off of what other people believe to be acceptable. By allowing that kind of advertising you reduce negative reaction to it.<p>Also retail stores sell plenty of products that give all manner of nice names. Like death coffee. Or &quot;personal massager&quot; vibrators. Don&#x27;t forget apple also hates the idea of sex, and that&#x27;s plenty acceptable to market.')
