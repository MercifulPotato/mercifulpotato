The newest paper is about the mechanism of the molecular clock, but the one that found the mutation is &quot;Mutation of the Human Circadian Clock Gene CRY1 in Familial Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder&quot; from 2017.<p>The mutation is described in that last paper as &quot;CRY1 c.1657+3A&gt;C&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m a pretty bad night owl, so I&#x27;m currently trying to figure out whether my 23andme data can tell me anything about that locus.<p>update: I think the CRY1 gene location is chromosome 12, position range 106,991,364 - 107,093,872, and I guess the &quot;1657&quot; is an offset from either the start or the end. But I don&#x27;t seem to have any raw 23andme data (genotyping chip v2) in that range. On the other hand, I do get some SNPs if I search for &quot;CRY1&quot; via their website, so I&#x27;m obviously doing something wrong.')
