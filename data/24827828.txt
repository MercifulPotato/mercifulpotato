Haskell provides such a wonderfully clean way to generate HTML via combinators and do notation. You don&#x27;t need a quasi quoter to get a DSL. See Lucid. All templating does is remove control features (like forM, for example). [1]<p>They&#x27;ve reinvented common operators. For example, (|&gt;), which is great, I&#x27;ve used it in Elm, but the Haskell version of this is (&amp;) from Data.Function.<p>These are just a few examples. They&#x27;re ignoring Haskell conventions to make it more familiar to people coming from other backgrounds, even when the community conventions are strictly better or equal. Rails was a nightmare for me, it was impossible to tell what was a language feature and what came from the framework. I suspect this will equivalently speed up initial development while slowing understanding.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mmhaskell.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;3&#x2F;16&#x2F;lucid-another-html-option" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mmhaskell.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;3&#x2F;16&#x2F;lucid-another-html-opti...</a>')
