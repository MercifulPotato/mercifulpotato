You don&#x27;t &quot;need&quot; to learn things like program complexity, but knowing it can help you write more efficient programs; you don&#x27;t need to know math, but it helps if you want to work with encryption, and in a way testing, too.<p>What does that all boil down to?  Probably curiosity, practically speaking.  If you&#x27;re genuinely interested in programming, and it&#x27;s not just about money, status or proving some point, you&#x27;ll be drawn to learn different things and have different discussions, over the whole course of your career, that will make you a good programmer, rather than just a passible coder.')
