Even if you just get shipments for the rare earth materials that aren&#x27;t present in first-world American countries, Apple would need to do the same supply chain audits all the way from shipment to mining, and they&#x27;d still be accused of using slave labor since apparently these audits don&#x27;t work and using China at all introduces slave labor into your supply chain.<p>For now it still makes sense to do last-leg manufacturing in China since moving to the US has no benefits from a PR standpoint (due to the reasons above) and has huge negatives with needing to import the raw materials instead of just shipping the final product from China -&gt; Alaska -&gt; Continental US customers.')
