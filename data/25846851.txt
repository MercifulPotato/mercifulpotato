Pardoning someone who embarrassed the government, for instance -- I can easily imagine a majority of Congress choosing to deny Chelsea Manning&#x27;s commutation.<p>It&#x27;s a bit of a parallel to the &quot;better a hundred guilty go free, than one innocent suffer&quot; philosophy that is supposed to rule the court system -- I&#x27;d rather the pardon be flawed in being too generous than too stingy with its mercy.')
