This isn&#x27;t something you can 100% exclude, of course, and what &quot;reasonable steps&quot; are differ per platform, but in the case of an app store &quot;take action against malicious scam apps when notified of their existence&quot; seems quite reasonable to me.<p>The only difference is that copyright&#x2F;DMCA has a huge industry pursuing this, and there is no one with deep pockets and free time pursuing this.')
