Too fuckin slow!!<p>I&#x27;m impatient too, but perspective is important here. Even the leading private efforts don&#x27;t have plans to put power on the grid for at least 10 years. Also, before this report, there wasn&#x27;t an official plan of any sort for the US federal fusion program to get to a pilot plant -- so this is progress. (FWIW, I participated in the early community input stages of this report.)<p>&gt;For all Musk&#x27;s faults, he recognizes such timelines are untenable, and pushes people to do the &#x27;impossible&#x27;.<p>Musk has a good nose for what&#x27;s possible to commercialize in a medium-term (5-10 year) time horizon on a few $bn budget. I have reason to believe he&#x27;s considered fusion (he has a background in physics after all).  Instead, he&#x27;s made a play in batteries &amp; solar.<p>Now, if someone had ~$1-5bn to gamble, it might be possible to leapfrog the existing crop of private efforts by ~5 years. Just pick one concept and build the engineering-breakeven experiment (gain ~ 20) without the intermediate scientific-breakeven experiment (gain ~ 1). It would be significantly riskier, but it would save time if it worked.')
