EZ Flash sells way more devices. However, it&#x27;s more power efficient than the EZ Flash I believe due to better use of the FPGA. The Omega looks good though, and it also supports save states (nice for games like Harvest Moon FOMT where it&#x27;s basically impossible to get all the best items without save scumming).')
