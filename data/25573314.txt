They&#x27;re trying to diversify and move to another low wage country, India.<p>Not - I&#x27;m not saying that China or India lacks skilled labor, or highly paid experts. But that&#x27;s not why companies like Apple are there. They&#x27;re there for cheap labor, and close to non-existent labor protections.
