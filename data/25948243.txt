IBM (and possibly Red Hat?) are mostly consulting companies---the development work they pay for is in support of their consulting.<p>Red Hat is not a consulting company. According to the Q1 FY2020 financial statements, &quot;Subscription revenue in the quarter was 87% of total revenue.&quot; which means consulting is somewhere in that leftover 13% (categorized as &quot;services&quot;).<p>What you perhaps mean, is that the number of kernel developers, gcc developers, glibc developers, (and so on) they have on staff is a benefit in terms of providing good support.  In that sense, if a customer has an issue and need support, the &quot;development work&quot; does benefit the ability to provide that service.  I wouldn&#x27;t call that consulting though.')
