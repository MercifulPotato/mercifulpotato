Shortcut combos don&#x27;t always work&#x2F;trigger at the right time&#x2F;in the right focus context. Or if you have a QMK with altogether too many virtual keys - I have like 60 x 7 layers = 420 possible two-thumb-one-finger events, I don&#x27;t use them all but I still lose track. I&#x27;m thinking of building one of these for things like &quot;jump focus to chat window and mute&quot;.<p>Also it saddens me we have a speaker mute keycode but no system-wide mute mic.')
