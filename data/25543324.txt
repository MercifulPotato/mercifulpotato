Its the next the largest event in American politics on the calendar. And obviously my assumptions that this is tied to anti government efforts means those involved would likely be stirred up by whatever is currently happening in politics. Everyone&#x27;s bias creeps into everything they do. Neither of us are immune to that. So calling it out here in such a uselessly rhetorical manner isn&#x27;t some logical fallacy flag, it&#x27;s a derailment of the discussion. I&#x27;m not even sure what bias you&#x27;re accusing me of, I guess leftist politics?')
