The Mac Pro had 32-bit EFI, which was a strange choice (it was a 64-bit machine), and which they then pretty quickly decided they didn&#x27;t want to support anymore. The first x86 Mini was a 32-bit CPU with the same result. They required specific GPU firmware, so you couldn&#x27;t just take a GPU out of a PC, but one of the GPUs they shipped with had a high failure rate (bad capacitors) and consequently became rare and expensive.<p>Who knows if they&#x27;ll do better this time. But the not knowing in itself is a pretty good reason to let somebody else be the guinea pig.')
