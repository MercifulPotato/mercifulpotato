IPv4 addresses are increasingly expensive. In a perfect world we&#x27;d just get rid of them, but instead, we live in a world where Amazon owns roughly $3B worth of them. They&#x27;re critical to serving web content; what happens when centralized corporate mega-powers are the only ones who can afford them, or own them?<p>* Email reputation. Its basically a boys club; if you don&#x27;t send your emails through a reputable provider, with their acceptable use policies which generally reach far beyond &quot;are you sending spam&quot;, you&#x27;re likely to be spam-listed by the recipients mailbox, of which there are roughly four providers (Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, AOL).<p>* &quot;Post-email&quot; customer communication channels. Companies increasingly talk to customers over iMessage, FBM, Telegram, etc. These are all closed loops; piss off Apple and you lose that channel. A truly open, federated 1:1 chat solution is necessary. Unaware of any options here; Signal feels like we&#x27;re getting there, but its not federated. Gaining market adoption is a whole other problem, but stomping on your privacy and freedom tends to be a big motivator.<p>* Domain registration. I don&#x27;t think this is a huge threat vector for market freedom, given how many registrars there are and how lax IANA&#x27;s rules are. Lets keep it that way.<p>* ARM. There&#x27;s no way to just go purchase an ARM chip and host a server in your closet; no one is selling them. Amazon and Apple have their proprietary ones they aren&#x27;t sharing. If the industry moves more toward ARM, to where hosting on x86 becomes intolerable due to software support (I expect it will, but on a timespan of decades), this is a big threat vector for increasing centralization into the mega-corp clouds. Definitely need an &quot;Intel for ARM&quot; (AMD? Nvidia? Uh, Intel?)')
