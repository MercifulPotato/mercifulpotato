But this kind of thing becomes inevitable when SJWs aka political correctness police get power through trying to enforce codes of conduct.<p>It isn&#x27;t that sometimes proponents of CoCs are their own worst enemies.  It is that there are people seeking power through CoCs who are honestly bad actors.  And we shouldn&#x27;t be putting people we can&#x27;t trust into a position to control the speech of others.')
