It seems to only let you save one solution for each level, even though there are two optimization goals.  It should let you save one for fewest components and one for fewest NAND gates.<p>2. It&#x27;s not really clear how NAND gate counts work in later levels where you&#x27;re using potentially non-optimal components you&#x27;ve built?  Like does it count each one as the number of gates that you used, or the number of gates that is optimal, or what?  Someone else told me it was the latter, but it seems like XOR counts as 6 even though there&#x27;s apparently a way to do it with fewer?<p>3. Why do some levels give me the message &quot;This is optimal!&quot; while others say &quot;This is the simplest solution!&quot;?  What&#x27;s going on here?  What do these messages mean specifically?  It&#x27;s not clear.<p>All this adds up making attempts at optimization a bit frustrating and as such I just don&#x27;t really want to play it very far.  If you&#x27;re not worried about optimization it seems fine, but if you are the interface really kind of works against you.')
