In fact even the Reuters article doesn&#x27;t say that. It&#x27;s the age-old tactic of making up something ludicrous that sounds vaguely like a group&#x27;s concerns and then claiming they all believe it so they shouldn&#x27;t be listened to.<p>What they are concerned about is the creation of a system that enables rapid marking of people to identify if they&#x27;ve had certain vaccines or not. Sometimes this surfaces as talk about &quot;quantum dots&quot; or &quot;dot tattoos&quot; which is a reference to research into a way to imprint codes underneath people&#x27;s skin. The microchip idea comes from the fact that this is already done for animals (rfid tags).<p>This provokes concern in many people for similar reasons to the (supposed) Chinese notion of &#x27;social credit&#x27;: the point of tagging the population with a physical marker of compliance is to enable very efficient stripping of their rights if they haven&#x27;t complied. Sort of a step short of imprisonment. For instance, some politicians already talk of blocking air travel for anyone who wasn&#x27;t vaccinated (against many kinds of things).<p>Now if you trust vaccines, no problem. But scientists are busy setting fire to their trust in all sorts of ways so the population of people who don&#x27;t trust them will only increase:<p>1. Rapid &quot;moonshot&quot; vaccine development programmes that are skipping the long testing process usually involved.<p>2. Rising awareness of how politicised academia has become. See the other story about Nature magazine.<p>3. A Swine Flu vaccine that caused neurological damage in a small number of cases (but Swine Flu hurt a tiny number of people too, so the cure was worse than the disease in this case).<p>4. Insistence on a waiver of liability for vaccine manufacturers.<p>5. Many examples of low standards or making contradictory statements about viruses and COVID.<p>6. Demanding that anyone criticising them is silenced.<p>And so on. The list could go on all day. Point is, it&#x27;s entirely rational to be lowering trust in scientists at the moment, so any effective system of tracking and enforcement around their decisions is going to be legitimately controversial. You don&#x27;t have to be a tinfoil hat wearer to observe that standards have been considerably loosened around vaccines this year.')
