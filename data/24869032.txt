If you want to be outside a social system, that can be your choice. If not, then you&#x27;ll have to deal with all of the constraints. That could be ICQ vs. MSN vs. AIM vs. YIM or BBM vs SMS or now iMessage vs. WhatEver.<p>The mass consumer market won&#x27;t all join IRC to chat, they could have (and still can) for decades and it just isn&#x27;t happening. And that&#x27;s fine, but that also means that other systems (like iMessage but also Facebook) gain users with all the lock-in that comes with that.')
