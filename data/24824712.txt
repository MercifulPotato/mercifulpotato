The fee for the listing of IKEA items is paid for by IKEA. I believe that IKEA are well aware that they have to cater for a 2nd hand market and find  solutions to the &quot;last mile&quot; problem in order to be taken seriously when talking about sustainability. They are on it. If they succeed is another matter.')
