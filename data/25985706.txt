The degree to which anyone at the time had a car it was a sign of luxury or great expense. Ford made it cheap.<p>What the people wanted was to go from A to B faster. How they did was &quot;via a horse&quot;. Logically &quot;faster horse&quot; is their solution (of which I&#x27;m certain there were varying qualities of horses, some of which you wouldn&#x27;t want to trust your life with).<p>What Ford did was focus on a problem &quot;transportation is slow&quot; (and horses make a lot of manure).<p>The Model T<p>&gt;prized for its low cost, durability, versatility, and ease of maintenance<p>This was 5 years after the first car (Model A) in 1903.

Ignoring that data signal suggests misaligned incentives&#x2F;goals. While I&#x27;m certain many songs share common emotions between people, the degree to which we react to an individual song or genre varies. I&#x27;m not sure how they&#x27;d hope to accurately tune an emotional scale while also refusing to block songs&#x2F;artists.<p>4. Emotes and user reactions \n  - again: gather the data surrounding how a song makes you feel. The ability to gather and train on this data should be crucial, without it how could they capture users emotions? (I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s impossible, it&#x27;s just clear to me this is aligned with the patent)<p>5. Globe Learning  \n - a suggestion to visualize music globally by artist home country&#x2F;state&#x2F;city<p>I wouldn&#x27;t consider &quot;inquisitive&quot; or &quot;learning&quot; an emotion, but perhaps it&#x27;s a higher order grouper &quot;what state is the listener in&quot;.\nThere&#x27;s an emotional component to the process of learning and ignoring &quot;confused&quot;, &quot;curious&quot; exploration of something foreign could lead to an better overall &quot;fulfilled emotional state&quot;<p>To rephrase your last sentence: People (including companies) may not realize the value of a new feature because it has been neither _implemented_ nor _measured_.')
