It&#x27;s great that some professors like her care about education and are experimenting with new classroom formats!  My point was that traditional lectures are not always the best way of teaching.<p>And, I did not say it is impossible or even uncommon for research faculty to be good at teaching.  However, being good at research does not automatically make one good at teaching, and there are other factors like time that prevent those who do care about education from giving their students a good experience in class.<p>In my own personal experience, and that of my classmates, the vast majority of research faculty simply do not have either the interest or the time to teach well.  Out of the 30 or so math courses I took as an undergrad, I would say only about 4-5 of my professors put real effort into teaching.')
