Storage is so cheap these days that it&#x27;s just much simpler and straight-forward to use mirrored vdevs. If a single drive fails, the pool is still completely usable, and all I have to do is swap out the bad drive (when I get around to it, no hurry usually) and resilver. Resilvering can take a while, but everything is still completely usable while it&#x27;s happening so it just runs in the background and I don&#x27;t even notice.<p>I just upgraded a pool of 4 drives from 4TB each to 10TB - I&#x27;d never done anything like that before and was rather nervous, but it was just so simple with the mirrored set up - just swap out each drive and resilver one- by-one.')
