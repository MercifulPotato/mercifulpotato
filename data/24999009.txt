If the wind isn&#x27;t blowing, you&#x27;re not getting any power and you&#x27;re going to have to fire up those coal&#x2F;natural gas plants.<p>&gt;when their new synchronous capacitor projects are completed they won&#x27;t need stand by gas power plants.<p>How much power can these &#x27;synchronous capacitors&#x27; store, and for how long? Can they even store enough to power a small city (~250k) for more than few mins? Let me spoil something for you, there is no battery technology that can scale to run a modern economy and hard industry. Not now, and not upcoming. If you have favorable geography, you may be able to do pumped storage, but that&#x27;s about the best you can do.<p>Keep in mind that EVEN if you miraculously had something to store grid-scale power over a long-term, you need to greatly overprovision renewables because those &#x27;batteries&#x27; need to be charged (with lots of energy loss) during peaks enough to bridge daily, seasonal and inter-year variability. And of course, land-use requirements for renewables is MASSIVE (from mining to deployment to decommissioning) - so renewables are very heavy on the environment. They aren&#x27;t going to work.<p>There&#x27;s a reason why no developed region relies on renewables without either fossil fuel backup (or if geography allows, geothermal or hydro). There&#x27;s a reason why Germany is spending billions to build pipelines to ship natural gas from Russia for decades to come. What do they know about renewables, that you don&#x27;t?')
