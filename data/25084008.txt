However a couple of years from now, there will remain a temptation to use the same tools to address whatever normal problems we have.  And that is a big step towards a planned economy like the Soviet Union had.<p>It may sound like a wild conspiracy theory, and certainly the people who are doing it don&#x27;t intend any such end.  However I cannot forget that 9&#x2F;11 has transformed us into a permanent surveillance state where our communications are tracked, travel by plane involves a search where someone gets to look at your privates, and it is considered normal in low crime neighborhoods to require security badges and&#x2F;or passing armed guards to get into office buildings.  If you&#x27;d asked the people who did that whether they had any such intent, I&#x27;m sure that they would have said no.')
