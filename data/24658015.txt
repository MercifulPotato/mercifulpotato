Even if they could stop publication in the US somehow, it would still only apply in the US. And it&#x27;s not like grandma is going to pickup this book in the store.

Seems &quot;morally interesting&quot; that he wants to monetize it like that. On the other hand, who cares about morals, but then its just a tad hypocritical.')
