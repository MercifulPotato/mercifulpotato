I feel like you are strawmanning an argument surrounding interior development that I did not make. Industrializing the interior provinces will not uplift 600M inland to parity with coast, I never claimed otherwise. The claim is that despite 600M able to work for less than ASEAN, it&#x27;s still not sufficient regardless of whether industry can be recaptured inland. In this case, lost light industry for predominantly undereducated unskilled rural labourers, for which there is no labour shortage post planned agricultural reforms. The poor will mostly remain idle&#x2F;informal. Whether the ship has sailed is ultimately secondary to the fact that the ship never had such capacity in the first place. Fully developing China simply was&#x2F;is&#x2F;will not be possible with so many people. Hence demographic decline, in China&#x27;s case is a forgone necessity, and the massive disparity between the haves &#x2F; haves nots is essential in managing the transition. The end of which will situate China to better deal with a variety of issues.<p>The blessing is the stabilized end population post decline, though far away and difficult to manage is preferable to demographic curse and uniformly unrealizable dividends due to resource constraints. It&#x27;s preferable to have an unequal society where 1&#x2F;2 underclass takes care of 1&#x2F;2 globally competitive class. It&#x27;s about as optimal for tackling demographic decline as one could hope for given Chinese geopolitical constraints, which is real and requires actual response than hypotheticals of fully automated luxury algae eating Utopia. Meanwhile, there&#x27;s going to be efforts to retain manufacturing and industrial capability in particularly strategic sectors and the inertia of demographics will generate enough new human capita to maintain relative competitiveness. Metrics &#x2F; indicators in the last few years suggest China share of global manufactured exports is maintaining &#x2F; increasing. Automation is not a panacea, it&#x27;s part of the response for competitiveness in certain sectors. Stability maintenance of the people is easier than great powers competition. The people matter, but only so much, and as component of comprehensive national power.<p>As for journey ending earlier than expected, no one expected Trump, but pivot against China happened under Hu, so friction and competition also not unanticipated. I&#x27;m less pessimistic on prognosis of domestic consumption. Savings rate is high, real estate is a bubble, capital flight and brain drain is real. All true. IMO there&#x27;s unused levers for those, though [x] doubt dual circulation. That said, 600M poor are frankly so poor that taking care of them is trivial. 1000 rmb is... so little that 600M &#x2F; 40% of the population is 7% of national GDP - they can be bought off. Alternate framing, 2 years of slow 5% Chinese growth means the economy has expanded enough to take care of these people with 40% income increase. Forever. Manufacturing won&#x27;t save China, less people will, the sooner the better, preferably the poor. It&#x27;s ugly. Hard times are ahead. I&#x27;m rooting for algae utopia, but not holding breath.')
