Yes, hedge funds are bad.  Yes, it&#x27;s hilarious watching those shorts get squeezed.  No, WSB are not modern Sherwood bandits trading on Robinhood.  They are <i>also</i> engaged in what is pretty clearly a criminal conspiracy to commit securities fraud (and <i>yes</i>, a deliberate attempt to trigger a short squeeze is securities fraud), and they&#x27;re doing it on an open internet forum.

Yes, it&#x27;s probably going to be the &quot;little guys&quot; holding the bag at the end of this.<p>It&#x27;s criminals all around as far as I can see.')
