I heard at one time that the single largest computer at Google was the Perforce server. They ended up completely re-writing it (called &quot;Piper&quot;) for scaling.\nThis is sort of what I was alluding to with my comment about Google having different concerns than many other companies. They can afford to dedicate a number of engineers to maintaining a monorepo system and then re-writing when it doesn&#x27;t scale. That said, I personally believe that there are a lot of benefits to monorepos, and I think those tradeoffs are worth it for other companies too.')
