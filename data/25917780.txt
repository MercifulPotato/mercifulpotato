You can park 8 or more bikes in a car space. You lose meter $$ from cars - not sure if bikes would pay a fee unless you had the fully enclosed, hard sided bike boxes that would keep an expensive e-bike safe. Locks? Some sort of unhackable app based lock?? I have seen prototypes online, but will they succeed in the open market and also prove to be unhackable?')
