Item(by='awillen', descendants=None, kids=[25071090], score=None, time=1605194529, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25069120, text='I feel like the timing of the election couldn&#x27;t have been worse - it has taken so much focus off of Covid (and continues to do so as Republicans claim it&#x27;s not over) at the worst possible time. The whole Midwest is in terrible shape and rapidly getting worse, but they&#x27;re still slow to implement serious restrictions. Meanwhile, unlike the earlier surge in NY (and the one in AZ that came later), these are nationwide, so doctors and nurses can&#x27;t be brought in from elsewhere. It feels like we&#x27;re at the point where no one&#x27;s going to declare a lockdown until people start dying while they wait in line for a hospital bed, and by that point it&#x27;s going to be way too late and cost thousands and thousands of lives.')
