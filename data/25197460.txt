Item(by='ppf', descendants=None, kids=[25197833], score=None, time=1606216961, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25196715, text='This lines up perfectly with my predictions for the future of UK roads - they will be filled with leased, oversized hybrid SUVs, driven by people who care about nothing except getting to their destination.<p>These vehicles will be hybrids, because it&#x27;s now almost impossible to sell a new ICE only car in Europe&#x2F;the UK. Following from that, they will be SUV-sized, because hybrids add lots of extra drivetrain components and weight. Also following from that, they will be leased, because of the increased cost.<p>I am particularly aggrieved about this, because I generally cycle everywhere I can, and despise this new &quot;green&quot; future for motoring. I also tend to buy 10 year old second hand cars, which was already getting hard enough with all of the extra electronics on newer cars. The idea of buying a 10 year old, ex-lease, completely thrashed, hybrid SUV - well. I&#x27;d rather walk.')
