Some people order food, my friend&#x27;s business delivers the food and a few hours after the food was delivered the order is cancelled. Grubhub refunds the money to the person who ordered and refuses to do absolutely anything about it for the business. He filmed on his phone when dropping the food, handing it to a customer and Grubhub shrugs their shoulders. They suggested he creates a a black list of numbers+addresses to refuse orders but that isn&#x27;t fool proof, the sketchy customers use different numbers and order at a slightly different address and wait outside for it. They may add numbers to a black list as well but some of these bad customers use burner phones.<p>So a big problem with these middleman services is that control is completely ceded to the middleman and one can&#x27;t really do anything about it. It is extremely frustrating for business owners, but probably not as bad for the customers. This type of competition a la Grubhub&#x2F;Amazon will kill a lot of legitimate business and create their own generic services instead. It is a subjugating experience and business owners don&#x27;t feel that they are control of their own destiny. It saddens me that this trend doesn&#x27;t seem to get any better but only exacerbate over time.')
