Zoom is software developed almost entirely in China, meaning it is subject to Chinese law and the very strong influence of the CCP.<p>It is fact to say that Zoom could be compelled by the CCP to plant backdoors in software to siphon valuable IP for use by Chinese companies, as is usually the case with CCP-aligned companies like Huawei (Huawei had a cash incentive program for employees who delivered stolen IP to them).')
