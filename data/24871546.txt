Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[24873834, 24876188, 24871583], score=None, time=1603472574, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24871369, text='&gt; What is broken is not the number of electoral votes per state but the winner takes all allocation system of the EC.<p>No, what is broken is indirect election with voting power distributed by state (no matter how you allocate the electoral votes based on the popular vote in the state, whether its winner-take-all, by-congressional-district with winner-take-the-extra-two, or proportional allocation), since the basic model, irrespective of allocation, creates a intense systemic incentive for voter disenfranchisement within states, since by disenfranchising people in your state that aren&#x27;t likely to vote like you, you not only <i>nullify</i> their vote (but reduce your states overall vote) as you would with direct election, but <i>seize their voting power for yourself</i> (well, at least, redistribute it among those you do not disenfranchise within your state.)<p>This is, of course, the <i>intended effect</i> of the EC and 3&#x2F;5 compromise, with the original focal disenfranchisement being chattel slavery. But it works <i>even more powerfully</i> without chattel slavery, because then you don&#x27;t have the voting power from the disenfranchised population deweighted the way the 3&#x2F;5 compromise did.')
