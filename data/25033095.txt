However finding such a community day-to-day is more difficult.<p>I find some of the trademark qualities of this community to be innovation and intellect, but more importantly, level-headed discourse between differing perspectives. Am I alone in finding that these qualities embody a minority?<p>How would you bring to life such an environment in the real world? Exclusive bar? Intellectual cafe? Or am I simply seeking a phantom of the past?')
