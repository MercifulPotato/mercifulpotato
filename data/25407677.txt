You want to make complex things easier to understand by refining abstractions and eliminate complicated things alltogether. Constant refactoring and tabu word - intelligence - is the key here. It doesn&#x27;t mean you have to reshuffle everything every week. It means spending maybe 5% - 20% of time on small things to improve code based on current knowledge. This has to be pushed by developers because semi-agile methodologies most companies use have built-in forces to move those tasks out of sprints.')
