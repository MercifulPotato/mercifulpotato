I have no illusions that that I&#x27;m not working class though. I watched my parents nearly get crushed in 07&#x2F;08. I graduated into a economic war zone. Watching the banks get bailed out as I went to parties hosted by kids whose parents were losing the house. Seeing the kids who used to live in the house encourage everyone to punch holes in the drywall because fuck the bank.<p>I haven&#x27;t forgotten what Wall Street did to us. The wealth inequality in this country is insane. The elites have been treating the working class like dirt for decades now.<p>With that context... those CNBC clips made me livid. Fuck the Wall Street propaganda. I&#x27;ll chip in my little piece if there&#x27;s a remote chance of taking down one or two of the vultures who are destroying this country with their greed. Much of the finance class that runs this country builds nothing, provides nothing, and tears down communities so they can shake a few coins out of the wreckage.<p>In talking with my friends who voted for Trump, this is the first time I&#x27;ve been able to feel on the page as them in a long time. There is class rage at play here. People are sick of this system.')
