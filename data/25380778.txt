Feels bad that people did that.<p>I think Airbnb when it first came out was great.  Like all things tech (a bit broad of a statement) once it got out into the world in a real way it lost its allure.  Facebook was great when it started, reddit, instagram, google, etc.  Once people figure out how to co-opt the technology for their own uses (or maybe just the drive for ad revenue kills off all the fun or novelty wears off) it loses its lustre quite a bit.  Sorry to be downbeat - technology doesn&#x27;t feel as fun as it was even like 3-4 years ago let alone back in the 00s or the 90s.  Or maybe I&#x27;m just aging out.')
