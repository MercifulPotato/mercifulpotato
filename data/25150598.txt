Nor would any platform. But that&#x27;s why every forum, website, blog, social media platform, whatever, would then have to adopt your preferred speech policy. Which, of course, is your intent.<p>I think the key dishonesty in your comment, whether you&#x27;re aware of it or not, is this idea that &quot;moderation, badging, or editing&quot; is what would be &quot;amplifying&quot; libel. What sense does that make? How does removing a post that, say, promotes the KKK in a woodworking forum have anything to do with a user possibly-falsely claiming in the public forum that &quot;Joe&#x27;s Tables and Chairs&quot; doesn&#x27;t use walnut like they claim?<p>It&#x27;s a bizarre claim you&#x27;re making to justify tremendous government overreach in forcing tiny forums and a billion other websites like it on the web to adopt your preferred speech policies.<p>Edit: And by the way, I&#x27;m being very generous with my examples. For one, I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re okay with removing ILLEGAL content, such as child porn, without the website owners being subject to lawsuits for libel and other things -- since they&#x27;re required to remove those things regardless of 230. But also, what about very legal porn? Or what if a Nintendo Switch game forum removes somebody who posts &quot;first!&quot; as a reply to every thread?<p>If I&#x27;m misreading you, and your preferred policy is instead that these websites should be responsible for claims THEY make -- such as, if the owners call a user a Nazi -- well that&#x27;s already CURRENT LAW! 230 doesn&#x27;t grant protection there now. But they&#x27;re not calling people Nazis -- also, I don&#x27;t think that lawsuit would go far for reasons based in libel law -- so this never comes up. If you&#x27;re saying they&#x27;re &quot;implying&quot; people are Nazi&#x27;s simply by removing content based on hate speech policies, again, 230 doesn&#x27;t really apply there. It&#x27;d still fail under our libel laws, and any suit would fail on the merits.<p>Now, maybe you want to rewrite libel laws, too! That&#x27;d be a big government approach to even FURTHER regulate free speech, but it&#x27;d be difficult to write a law that made it possible to be sued just for implying somebody is a Nazi for something they wrote. Certainly it wouldn&#x27;t pass Constitutional muster, so you&#x27;d have to rewrite the Constitution, too. The only Justice who has shown any openness to re-interpreting libel laws to further restrict speech is Justice Thomas and you&#x27;d have to go FAR beyond what he&#x27;s called for.')
