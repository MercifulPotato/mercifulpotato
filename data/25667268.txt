I now believe it&#x27;s likely that Trump was probably compromised by the very same cabal of interests who got him to dance to the tune they wanted as a puppet for 4 years as part of his great charade<p>In essence all of this Democratic theater is more window dressing for business as usual.<p>I&#x27;m happy to hear different opinions and to update my own perspective but I&#x27;m not going to debate this it simply the belief that I&#x27;ve arrived at at this time after many years of reflection and thought.')
