All I&#x27;m saying is that in everyday parlance, &quot;protesting&quot; implies that you&#x27;re not infringing on someone else&#x27;s rights. The gold standard of protesting is something like MLK&#x27;s Selma to Montgomery March or Gandhi&#x27;s hunger strike. Nevertheless, figures like Malcolm X or Che Guevara would vehemently disagree.<p>This definition applies to all spectrums of political discourse.
