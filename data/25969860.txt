I really don&#x27;t understand why my fellow developers choose to go with Apple as their work machine.<p>Because many of your fellow developers do not have and don&#x27;t want a separate machine for just conding? Why is this idea so alien for some people?<p>I&#x27;ve been using linux distros (mainly Ubuntu before unity nonsense and then arch and even maintained a package in AUR) since around 2006 to 2013-14. Every now and then I install Fedora\\Ubuntu\\Manjaro etc to see if anything got better to allow me to use it as a universal device should be used. Every time the answer is a firm NO.<p>In fact sometimes the disto won&#x27;t even install because of some weird reasons. For example I only managed to install Fedora on my current PC (build mainly for gaming) after changing some GRUB options (and spending two hours searching all over the web for a needed recipe). What the hell is this?<p>As a sibling commenter said - Linux is still only good as close-to-targed (server) work machine. And it also has a few OSS tools for musicians and painters (like MuseScore and Krita). But that&#x27;s it.<p>Installation is still a mess, updates are still unpredictable. Software distribution is still a nightmare. General consumer software availability is ... there is almost none.<p>If at some point my mac will become too unfriendly to work with as a dev tool (I don&#x27;t see it coming really. Some people on HN usually treat some minor things as a catastrophe) - I will build a small dev server (or rent one).')
