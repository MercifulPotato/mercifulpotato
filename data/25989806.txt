Item(by='qohen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612195383, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25989014, text='There are a bunch of posts on the front page of WallStreetBets stating that it&#x27;s all B.S. And, apparently, the hedge-fund Citadel owns a ton of silver options, meaning that people buying silver would be helping the GME (GameStop) short-sellers, so WSB is advising people to steer clear of silver. So, it seems clear where this spate of silver stories is coming from.<p><i>Either I am blind or Bloomberg is peddling misinformation.</i><p>Hedge funds have been using the media (as well as financial institutions) to advance their goals by attempting to create false narratives for a long time -- here&#x27;s Jim Cramer explaining it in (surprising) detail a few years ago (he used to have a hedge fund and used to do these things): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=VMuEis3byY4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=VMuEis3byY4</a><p>The money quote, talking about manipulating the market in this way when in a bad position (at 5:09): &quot;What&#x27;s important is when you&#x27;re in that hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful. Because the truth is so against your view that it&#x27;s important to create a new truth to develop a fiction and the fiction is developed by almost anybody who&#x27;s down like two percent to up six percent here. You can&#x27;t take any chances, you can&#x27;t have the market up any more than it is if you&#x27;re up six because starting Jan. 2 you&#x27;ll have all your money come out, so what would you do if you were in that situation and you feel like you&#x27;re desperate is that you would do these actions.&quot;')
