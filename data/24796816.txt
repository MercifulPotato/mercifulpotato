Item(by='dahart', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602815366, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24796316, text='&gt; The bottom quartile of people thought that they would perform at around the 57th percentile. They clearly expected to perform better than more competent individuals.<p>I think you’re misunderstanding what Dunning &amp; Kruger presented, which is precisely why references to this paper need to stop. You cannot read literally into the graph as saying that the bottom quartile of people believed they were at the 57th percentile of ability, that’s not what the experiment measured.<p>Have you read the actual paper? The respondents were 1- all Cornell undergrads volunteering for extra class credit, 2- asked to <i>rank</i> themselves, <i>not</i> to rate their abilities, 3- asked about such “skills” as the ability to get a joke. It seems pretty wild that anyone ever took this paper seriously. The conclusions that it makes in it’s wordy prose are not supported by the data they present.<p>Take a little more time to understand Tal’s primary argument - that this paper most likely is measuring regression to the mean. Because these kids were asked to rank themselves, and they didn’t know how good their peers were, there is good reason to expect a correllation less than 1. Because the authors were barely out of undergrad school themselves at the time, and not studying statistics per se, there is plenty of reason to suspect that the methodology isn’t perfect ... beyond the fact that it wasn’t a random sample of the population, it studied all rich kids who (self-selected) needed extra credit, it included no difficult mental skills, and that followup papers have shown a complete reversal of whatever effect is there, when applied to more difficult skills like law or engineering.')
