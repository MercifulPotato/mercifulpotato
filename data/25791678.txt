MagSafe in this context could be referring to wireless charging. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MagSafe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MagSafe</a><p>The quote from Kuo specifically mentions MagSafe charging connector design, but he could have mistakenly assumed his source was still referring to the wired connector if they mentioned MagSafe.<p>Curious about changes to I&#x2F;O ports. I would expect additional (more than two) USB-C ports, but unsure which I&#x2F;O types may be considered a &quot;standard&quot; need for pro users at this point. Perhaps video output and&#x2F;or legacy USB?<p>The touch bar is visually appealing and likely great for most consumers, but the bar has not been as functional as physical function keys during my time touch-typing&#x2F; programming due to lack of tactile feedback. I frequently have to look at the bar, else I tap the wrong button. I often trigger the bar unintentionally while hovering over number keys. I am thankful the M1 Pro has an Escape key. I would be very likely to upgrade to a higher end MacBook Pro to have physical function keys again.')
