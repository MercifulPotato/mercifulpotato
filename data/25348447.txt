The woods behind the house we currently live in are where I spent most of my childhood. Ticks are just part of the territory (many springs and seeps = many ticks).<p>I have never had problems with tick-borne illnesses.<p>We moved back here 14 years ago, and within one month my spouse was diagnosed with Lyme disease.<p>My theory is that I&#x27;m immune to it due to repeated tick exposure as a kid. Otherwise, it just doesn&#x27;t make any sense.')
