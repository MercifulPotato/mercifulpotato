I have a small collection of slide rules, all normal sized linear types, which I still am fascinated with. They&#x27;re all made between the 1940s and 1960s and aren&#x27;t terribly rare but the care and precision that went into their manufacture is amazing given that they weren&#x27;t terribly expensive back in the day. I especially like the one&#x27;s made of bamboo. Not as much precision nor speed as a calculator or computer but always remember that we got to the moon on them.')
