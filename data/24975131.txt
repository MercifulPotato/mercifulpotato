Restricting how that source is distributed seems to me like a violation of that license, if not in letter at least in spirit.<p>(Of course, it goes without saying that I&#x27;m not a lawyer, which is why I said it <i>feels</i> like a violation.)<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.joeyh.name&#x2F;index.cgi&#x2F;haskell-mountpoints.git&#x2F;tree&#x2F;LICENSE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.joeyh.name&#x2F;index.cgi&#x2F;haskell-mountpoints.git&#x2F;tre...</a>')
