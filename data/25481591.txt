I&#x27;ve never seen worst case quadratic complexity, like quicksort&#x27;s, labelled exponential before, which seems misleading.  I think there&#x27;s more to practical scalability than worst-case asymptotic complexity, even if guaranteed linear is likely a good start; have the two been compared for Linux or GCC, for instance?  I&#x27;d be happy to use the best combination of speed and features&#x2F;usability.<p>I just set up Trac for Darcs hosting -- though it has some tension with the Subversion model -- exporting to git for people who want the pain.  I&#x27;d investigate Sourcehut integration if I had the time.')
