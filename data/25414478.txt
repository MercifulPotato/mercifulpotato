We&#x27;re pretty spoiled when it comes to Tesla news; there&#x27;s been no shortage.<p>In the last year they&#x27;ve announced and built most of the Berlin factory. It seems on track to start producing next year. That&#x27;s on the home turf of Volkswagen, Daimler, and BMW. Pretty big news. The same year also saw the announcement of the Texas factory where they are also executing rapidly. And that of course came on the back of the Chinese factory. The news for Tesla in the last few months has been of them executing extremely well. They&#x27;re growing production and turning profits in a market where all their competitors are shrinking production and losing money. There&#x27;s also been some minor news about them ramping up production of their in house designed batteries a few new models and model variants. The cyber truck announcement was only a year ago; so that counts as well and half a million reservations for such a thing is nothing to sneeze at. Then there was a minor thing called Corona which should have put the brakes on profits; except it didn&#x27;t in Tesla&#x27;s case.<p>Tesla&#x27;s valuation is based on their historic ability to execute and their competitors apparent struggle to do so. Turning profits in the middle of two major lock downs is pretty hard evidence that they are doing something right. So, maybe it&#x27;s not that irrational for investors to look at Tesla and see a strategy that while ballsy is apparently working and looking like it might be just the right strategy for the foreseeable future as well.<p>Your picking nits over government subsidies. Everybody else has that same advantage. In any case, without government subsidies, most of the Detroit based car manufacturers would have gone bust around the 2008 crisis already. I&#x27;d say 700M is peanuts compared to that probably; and they are still losing money. General Motors&#x27; losses alone this year exceed that.')
