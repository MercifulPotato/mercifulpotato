I honestly believe this will dissuade people from making small, quick fixes and ultimately drive away contributors.<p>When I last brought this up, I was told that there were a number of contributors put off by the wiki-based nature of the previous iteration and they will now be excited to be able to contribute using Git.<p>I&#x27;d honestly be interested to hear from any of these people. Given you could seamlessly login with your GitHub account, easily author your documentation and one-click preview your changes, what exactly are you gaining from having the editor gone and now requiring a local docs environment to do all of the preview&#x2F;edit&#x2F;commit steps manually?')
