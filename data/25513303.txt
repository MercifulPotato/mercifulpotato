My manager started to get a little concerned. One day I realized that If I just got stuff done that mattered, the judgment of other people about my code quality really wouldn&#x27;t matter. Ever since then, I have just written the code I thought needed to be written, without a care about how anyone might look down on it, regardless of whether they are a higher or lower level than me. I have gotten consistently good ratings with this approach.<p>Later I learned about an experiment that compared different groups of photography students, and the ones that were instructed to produce more pictures without regard to quality actually produced better pictures in the end than groups who were told to produce 1 perfect picture. Produce a lot and the quality will naturally come! <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamesclear.com&#x2F;repetitions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamesclear.com&#x2F;repetitions</a>')
