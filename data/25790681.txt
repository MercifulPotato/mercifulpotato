At this point it&#x27;d be silly for Apple to keep ignoring this. Besides, it&#x27;s just strange to see a computer positioned for photographers, among others, lacking an SD card slot. And HDMI for connecting to TVs and projectors isn&#x27;t going away any time soon either. So I&#x27;d expect them to add these two, at least.<p>As for the touch bar, if I were Apple, I&#x27;d have made it an optional upgrade a long time ago. It&#x27;s always been very divisive.')
