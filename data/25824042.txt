The Ubuntu Certbot packages are maintained and work fine. What you&#x27;re referring to is the PPA, which is no longer required (since Ubuntu&#x27;s distribution-shipped certbot packages have worked fine for a long time now).<p>Or, if not, can you point to specific issues with Ubuntu&#x27;s own certbot packages please?')
