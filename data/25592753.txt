Even in the situation above... a bit warm, but not what anyone would call hot. I have a MacBook Pro 2017, and this thing feels way happier connected to an external monitor than the Intel Macs ever did.<p>Plus, there&#x27;s some additional &quot;magic&quot; Apple has put in for external monitors that&#x27;s really nice. For example, you can shut your laptop lid and all of the apps instantly switch to the 4K Monitor without the old screen resolution change (the 5-10 seconds of black screens and weirdness).')
