Nothing good will come to you from it.<p>You abandoned it for a reason and only people who&#x27;ll benefit from it are other people. That would be fine if it was not at your expense. Someone may look at the source code and contact your support or even take you to court because one of your programmers ignored license of a third party library. You could get it audited and re-write parts of it... even so, there is a non-zero risk that someone will come after you.<p>If you&#x27;re OK with that, do what you want. Otherwise, by default, don&#x27;t opensource your abandonware.')
