They&#x27;re describing a pretty exceptional situation &#x2F; distant from what I would think of as security research.<p>Obviously that&#x27;s not a legally binding statement or anything but I think that at least illustrates what this situation is about.<p>This isn&#x27;t a case of someone being mistaken or putting forth a good faith concern about security.<p>These accusations are based in nothing at all, disproven, and Giuliani and others just kept at it.<p>Researchers usually have actual evidence for concerns and so forth.  And their motivations usually really is security.<p>This situation with Giuliani and actual security research seem completely disconnected.')
