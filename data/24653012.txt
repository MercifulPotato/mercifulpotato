Are you comfortable sitting next to someone who is capable of a &quot;serious, violent crime&quot;? Are there certain crimes that cross the line for you? Would you expect your employer to inform you of their record?&quot;<p>I would not feel comfortable sitting next to someone who was substantially more capable of committing a serious, violent crime (which might indeed have been murder if she did 13 years) than an average member of the population and I would expect an employer to take my welfare and safety into account.<p>The question is whether someone who did do that and went to prison for it is so much more likely to commit such a crime than average. I don&#x27;t know the answer to that but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s outrageous to think the answer is &quot;no&quot;.')
