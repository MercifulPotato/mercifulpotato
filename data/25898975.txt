Mostly because I am a GNU type of person, (almost all of my stack is gpl, for example) and Guile is now not only the preferred GNU extension language, but it is also the core part of GUIX, and a few other tools I really like (mcron, a cron replacement).<p>So to explain just a bit, often I do a lot of paralysis by analysis of tooling, but as a side effect one of the things I&#x27;ve learned to help me get past it is to filter first based on licensing. I like Nixos, and I think the principles there are going to go far into the future, but I don&#x27;t like MIT&#x2F;BSD licenses. So if I want the same kind of tech, but in GNU-land, that leaves me with GUIX (the os and the package manager). Decision made.<p>Only in the most extreme circumstances do I violate these principles (steam for gaming!) and am always looking for alternatives as they pop up.<p>I really like the idea of compiled lisp eg common lisp, but most of the gpl friendly versions are not in active development, besides maybe Clozure CL. Clisp website shows last update was in 2010, and for some reason that really rubs me the wrong way.<p>It&#x27;s funny because I still really don&#x27;t know that much about lisp, it&#x27;s just on my &quot;to get into&quot; list, besides elisp.')
