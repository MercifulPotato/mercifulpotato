I didn&#x27;t get it till I took a biostatistics class.  (We could use Stata&#x2F;Excel or R for the class).  It really shines analyzing data.  Its loved by statisticians and some programmable attributes too.<p>Biologists like it for single cell analysis.  They use Seurat and save the data as an object and load it up&#x2F; pass around around for analysis.  Its actually kinda neat.<p>R&#x27;s ggplot2 library is top tier in making graphs.<p>RStudio makes it very accessible.')
