Item(by='aftbit', descendants=None, kids=[25736781], score=None, time=1610398090, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25732987, text='&gt;&gt; free speech<p>&gt; First Amendment<p>These things are different. First Amendment protections restrict the US government from censoring protected speech. Free speech is a broader concept that covers any restrictions upon speech, including restrictions that are legal in the US.<p>It seems that the right to free speech must be balanced against the harms that speech can cause, but I am tired of this meme that just because they&#x27;re a private company, AWS et al should be able to block whatever they like. These tech companies have more power and knowledge than many governments of the previous century. We should be cautious advocating for a totally hands-off policy on how they use that power.')
