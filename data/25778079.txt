If you wanted to do something real wild you&#x27;d use some app delivery plugin (java&#x2F;flash&#x2F;etc) which just happened to display in the page but that was the extent of involving the browser. Then browsers started supporting some of these abilities natively in response and complexity exploded to try to patch what the browsers shipped with at the time vs what people wanted in total resulting in many tools&#x2F;libraries&#x2F;frameworks to deal with the gap. Now the out of the box environment isn&#x27;t very limited or fractured for the majority of use cases and so we have the option to go back to the simple era where &quot;I can just use what&#x27;s in the browser&quot; again for most things, except now that generally covers whatever we want to make not &quot;what a webpage should be&quot; like it used to.')
