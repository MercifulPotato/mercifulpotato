Normalizing data and storing it relationally seems way more flexible for a lot of use cases which is why most databases are relational and not hierarchical.<p>However, I&#x27;ve tried to figure out how to actually store and query data relationally in a language like C++ and haven&#x27;t been able to figure out a good way. I don&#x27;t want to use SQLite because of performance, this needs to be close to real time (like a game or something similar). I just want a way to store data relationally in memory in C++. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out the right approach here. C++ is very static which makes it difficult. I&#x27;ve been able to figure it out in Javascript though.')
