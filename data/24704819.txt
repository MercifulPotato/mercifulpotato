Item(by='vvhn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602038349, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24704547, text='&gt;It was a GC via marriage though, rules ma be different for employer sponsored GCs<p>Rules are indeed different for Employment based green cards. Marriage based green cards don&#x27;t have a limit while the number of employment based Green cards that can be given out in a year is fixed ( in total and within that there is a 7% cap on how much each individual country can receive)<p>People stuck this way from India &amp; China aren&#x27;t even able to file for GC&#x27;s. You can only file for a GC if your country&#x27;s date is &quot;current&quot; (which is not the case for marriage based GC)<p>Their only legal basis to stay in the US is the H1-B which they can keep on renewing because they have an approved I-140. In my current situation, i have an approved immigrant petition and i will have to continue to get H1-Bs approved\ntill i get current (which current projections are about 40-50\nyears). I&#x27;ve been in the US for a decade and it will be many many decades before i can remove the dependence on the H1.<p>The math is simple - there are about 400K Indians with approved immigrant petitions. And across 2 categories the maximum number of green cards that Indians can receive in a year is about ~6K. Each petition is roughly 2 green cards<p>So if an Indian gets an immigrant visa approved today in 2020 , they&#x27;re looking at wait of 800&#x2F;6 (133) years even be able to file for a green card.')
