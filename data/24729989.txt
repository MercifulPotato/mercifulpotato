If you &quot;personally identify as certain characteristics&quot; it&#x27;s literally impossible for that to be a &quot;moot point&quot; because of how society is structured.<p>Which bathroom do you walk into? Will you be fired for wearing a dress when your boss sees you as a man? If you change your name to a feminine one, will people ignore it and continue to call you a masculine name? If get a new job and try to hide that you were &quot;once a man&quot;, can you actually or will they force you to put your biological sex on the application form? If you are forced to put your biological sex on the application form, what if your new workplace outs you as &quot;a man&quot; to your coworkers despite you having a feminine name, a feminine appearance, and using the women&#x27;s bathroom? When coworkers find out you are biologically a man but using the women&#x27;s bathroom, will they ostracize you, call the police, or exact violence on you because you don&#x27;t fit in their worldview of acceptable behavior?<p>These are real questions that matter to real people and you can&#x27;t wave it away as &quot;a moot point&quot;. Answering these questions, and more, is the entry point to gender studies.')
