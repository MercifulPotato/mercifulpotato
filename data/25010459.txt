It works flawlessly on Linux; but it doesn’t work flawlessly on Macs, and I’ve found bug reports for the same thing going back to 2015.<p>When you use the Mac OS built in “scanner” app to scan to PDF, it will scan in color even when you ask it to scan in B&amp;W; unfortunately, this will confuse the app and the pdf will be corrupted.<p>The recommended workaround is “scan in color” (which I do, and then use Ghostscript to convert to b&amp;w), but it’s ridiculous.<p>That said, as far as quality, speed, robustness and reliability, this is the best printer&#x2F;scanner&#x2F;fax machine I ever used. And it works perfectly well on Linux.')
