You might have missed that the benchmark was missing Nvidia (or even AMD) graphics cards; I can&#x27;t think of a lower bar for comparing ML performance than against Intel GPUs - perhaps Intel CPUs?<p>If you&#x27;re dabbling, you&#x27;re better off with Google&#x27;s Colab[1] which has (free) hardware acceleration which is roughly on par with my 3-year-old RX580 for my Tensorflow projects. Colab will work on anything that can run a browser.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;colab.research.google.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;colab.research.google.com&#x2F;</a>')
