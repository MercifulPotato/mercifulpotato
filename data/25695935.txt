My main client bought a Sunfire V1280 box (12 CPUs, and the server room guys hated me for the amount of power it drew&#x2F;heat it put out) to run network simulations.  As I remember, the main two advantages SPARC and POWER systems being sold at that time over x86 were (1) reliability and (2) memory &#x2F; I&#x2F;O bandwidth.<p>I tried to look up who first said something along the lines of &quot;A supercomuter is a tool for turning a compute-bound problem into an I&#x2F;O-bound problem&quot; and all I could find was an ArsTechnica article referencing it as an old joke.  I thought it was an old joke by someone of the stature of Cray or Amdahl, but maybe that&#x27;s apocryphal.<p>In any case, our network simulations attempted to perform a min-cut (using number of packets as the cost metric) to partition simulation nodes among threads, run one thread per  core, and pin a thread to each core.  With a network simulation, though, as you can imagine, the problem was usually bound by memory bandwidth.<p>Also, the client was a defense contractor, and the 400k+ USD box was an artefact of &quot;use it or lose it&quot; budgeting.  If they didn&#x27;t spend all of their budget by December 31st, the group&#x27;s budget would be reduced the following year.  In their case, the high cost of the box was a feature.')
