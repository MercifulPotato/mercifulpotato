The problem of &quot;page tearing&quot; (not to be confused with vsync) means you either need to render frames continuously, or at least 2 frames for every time you get input or need to implement some kind of &quot;retained mode state tracking&quot; on top of Imgui. It&#x27;s good for games, but for applications where you&#x27;re not rendering new frames constantly, the paradigm doesn&#x27;t seem a very good fit.<p>Writing a desktop app using ImGui I had the same problems. In many instances it can be resolved by re-ordering operations such that in a frame you first update the state and then render it, but this isn&#x27;t always possible or easy. For those cases I eventually resorted to having a requestFrame() function (which posts an empty event to the input queue at the end of the frame, causing another frame to be rendered immediately).')
