However, action (and inaction) by the Executive and <i>inaction</i> by Congress, not just recently either, complicates matters.<p>A pretty good article at Lawfare[0] discusses this at some length.<p>Also a bill[1] was introduced in the House last June to clarify some of these issues.<p>Hopefully more attention will be paid to ensuring that Congressional oversight is able to function effectively.<p>However, one must also guard against politicization of those processes -- but, IMHO, that&#x27;s less important than making sure the Congress can effectively exercise its oversight role.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lawfareblog.com&#x2F;can-congress-fine-federal-officials-under-its-contempt-power" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lawfareblog.com&#x2F;can-congress-fine-federal-offici...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lieu.house.gov&#x2F;media-center&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;rep-lieu-introduces-bill-levy-penalties-officials-who-defy-congressional" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lieu.house.gov&#x2F;media-center&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;rep-lieu-...</a>')
