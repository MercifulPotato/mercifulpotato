[..] At the chapter on constitution, our teacher briefly mentioned the &quot;turbulence&quot;: basically, in 1989 students used to take the streets and things &quot;ended up messy&quot;. But he didn&#x27;t give much detail.&quot;<p>This matches other stuff I&#x27;ve read in the past - it&#x27;s not heavily discussed, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it suppressed either.<p>EDIT: There&#x27;s another aspect to this: I have no idea how it looks like in schools in various western countries, but from what I remember from Poland, it&#x27;s all about &quot;government murdering protesters&quot;.  It doesn&#x27;t mention whatsoever that it was much more complicated and there victims on all sides.')
