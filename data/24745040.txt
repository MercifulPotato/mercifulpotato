Muffled thoughts don&#x27;t make good sentences. A collection of sentences makes a paragraph. Therefore, muffled thoughts can&#x27;t make a paragraph.<p>Where am I going with the above: By writing, we find out if our thoughts are muffled or not. This means that writing is like a mirror to our thoughts.<p>Now there is a difference between writing for personal use and writing for the public. I think everyone should write for personal use. Examples of writing for personal use are<p>1. Journalling.<p>2. Self Reflection.<p>3. Project analysis.<p>When it comes to writing for public consumption, it&#x27;s a different thing all together.
