This isn&#x27;t a criticism of JS best practices, instead it&#x27;s a criticism of how it&#x27;s taught, specifically in this curriculum that&#x27;s sold as a white-label curriculum and used by MANY bootcamps across the US. It might even be the most popular coding bootcamp curriculum in the country. It&#x27;s possible they&#x27;ve improved it since I was teaching it, but definitely it was not the case a few years ago!')
