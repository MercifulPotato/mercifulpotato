Thank you for sharing it.<p>Even if I am moving my first steps into the industry (I&#x27;m a simple trainee at a Tech-StartUp and MSc student) I&#x27;ve already experienced many times the first point. I think trying to keep your feet (and mind) on the ground, even when you have a huge expertise is fundamental in communication, teamwork and goals&#x27; chasing.<p>For example a friend of mine, graduated in one of the top programs in europe at Rotterdham Business School, has a huge expertise in the R language, he is able to manage data promptly at work, efficiently delivering in 2 hours what his colleagues do on Excel in the whole day. However he has big problems in communication here in Italy, he is not able to understand what other people with different background&#x2F;expertise are asking to him precisely and this is becoming a huge issue in terms of career development.')
