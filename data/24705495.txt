It was an interesting experience, but it took me about 2 weeks to understand how it was not about &quot;best and brightest&quot; but about US multinationals gaming the system to push down wages and use indentured servants.<p>If it were up to me, I&#x27;d set the limit at something like $250K tied to average home prices in the area where the H1B worked. If home prices go up, so must the minimum salary.<p>This would push wages up rapidly for medium IT and software jobs for Americans, including American blacks, hispanics, etc. who Corporate America pretends to care about while employing 80% Indians in their tech departments.<p>Google, Apple, and etc. could still pick the cream of the crop from around the world, while all the banks, IT staffing companies, and others making CRUD apps on AWS would be forced to hire and train Americans at higher wages which would push more smart students into the field and out of law, finance, etc.<p>Companies that play games like opening offices in India or Canada or wherever would eventually be caught by the local cities and states who need that tax revenue more than ever, so I don&#x27;t fear a huge loss of talent and jobs overseas.')
