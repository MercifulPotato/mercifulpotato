I&#x27;d point to the Miles Taylor essay as a good concrete example of what goes wrong:<p>* They granted him journalistic anonymity for an opinion piece, which is very much not a common practice.<p>* The NYT published no corroboration of Taylor&#x27;s claims, and their descriptions of how the editorial got published suggest they didn&#x27;t even attempt to find corroboration.<p>* Their description of him as a &quot;senior administration official&quot; substantively misled people - the phrase is generally understood, and was understood at the time, to refer to people like agency heads or cabinet secretaries with direct accountability to the President.<p>And this is from an uncommonly responsible outlet! Many others will happily publish detailed claims of fact attributed only to &quot;one person with knowledge of the matter&quot;.')
