Nixery is a similar with Nix, where an image can be constructed ad-hoc by specifying the dependencies of an image&#x27;s path.<p>That&#x27;s cool. And I can imagine cases where it&#x27;s useful.<p>Stuff like Nixery isn&#x27;t itself enough to claim &quot;nix is better than Docker&quot;, though. -- The questions I&#x27;d want to think about are &quot;what happens when I run into a problem? how hard is it to fix this?&quot;. I feel like Nix does solve some problems that I&#x27;ve had with Dockerfiles. But there are also problems I&#x27;ve run into with Nix that I wouldn&#x27;t&#x27;ve had with Nix.<p>I like nix well enough. But I&#x27;ve also used it enough that I&#x27;m not surprised if people have difficulties with it, and are more comfortable with other solutions.')
