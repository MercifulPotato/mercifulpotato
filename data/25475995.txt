I didn’t actually fall or hit anything hard. I had a pain behind my shoulder for a few days and really noticed it while trying to climb. Got worse progressively for about 3 days. On the 4th day, I tried to play a game and went to climb and through my had up and heard a pop. Went to the hospital and my c7 vertebrae was displaced and fractured.<p>So this is what the doctor tried to explain to me: the muscle &#x2F;ligaments connected to the vertebrae were under stress from a strained muscle behind my shoulder. The strain was so bad it tugged hard enough on my vertebrae to cause it to crack. He said it was a very strange event and does not see it happen often.&quot;')
