On on hand, they want to stop AWS using &quot;Elasticsearch&quot; in a product name because it isn&#x27;t in partnership with Elastic co., but on the other hand AWS&#x27;s product really does contain Elasticsearch, which is why they are changing their license. If AWS had a product called &quot;Elasticsearch Service&quot; which didn&#x27;t contain Elasticsearch, then it would be pretty clear cut as that would be very confusing, but a product called &quot;Elasticsearch Service&quot; that really does contain &quot;Elasticsearch&quot; seems pretty self-explanatory.')
