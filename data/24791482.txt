It&#x27;s absurd to me that the reproducibility path for so much modern day research in nearly every field passes through proprietary closed source software, proprietary pre-compiled signed binaries, ditto for firmware, and then (sometimes) hardware where the entirety of the documentation consists of &#x27;A service contract with the vendor&#x27;.<p>The reproducibility crisis in the sciences right now is essentially an excess of inputs and deficit of testing those inputs -- closed source hardware&#x2F;software is not helping.')
