Many of the pages just contain (mostly) a list of links. There are barely any notes.<p>I actually do this as well. Just some text files, where I put links I stumble upon, which I find interesting. Not always all links but only really interesting ones. Also maybe only for topics where I think it&#x27;s not so easy to find such links later on via Google. Also, I don&#x27;t really intend this to be complete.<p>Sometimes I also do research on some new topic, and for that I keep notes. If I think the research &#x2F; overview &#x2F; my notes of this topic are of any value to others, I would maybe just make it public somewhere.<p>Some of these links and notes I keep private. If it is public, I would probably just put it here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;albertz&#x2F;wiki" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;albertz&#x2F;wiki</a>')
