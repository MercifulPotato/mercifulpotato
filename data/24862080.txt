Instead of a zillion knobs for adjustments, it lets gravity do the work. The chair adjusts with you. Lean back and the head rest comes forward to meet your head, the arm rests tilt up to keep your arms at a comfortable angle, but the seat remains level to the floor to prevent the seat from cutting off your blood flow to the legs. It’s an amazing design. Word of caution, it has almost no padding. If a mushy chair is your thing, this one isn’t for you.<p>For a sit&#x2F;stand desk, the best chair is the original HÅG Capisco with the tall lift column. It adjusts from sitting height to standing height, so you don’t have to lower your desk if you just need to rest for a moment. The other unique feature I love is that you can turn it around and lean against the “back” with your stomach. It’s a very different chair that may take some getting used to, but it really helps your back and posture.<p>I enjoy both of these chairs depending on mood. I think the key to keeping your back happy is to move around, and not sit for too long in any one position. Both of these chairs are pricey, but I’ve had them forever and they are one of the best investments I’ve made. If you are sitting on what office stores call ergonomic chairs, then you don’t know what you are missing.  :-)')
