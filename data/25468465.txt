I don&#x27;t care about selling ads, I don&#x27;t care about winning the stock option lottery, and I don&#x27;t care about chasing only the shiniest newest tech. I care about getting stuff done efficiently with boring tech and helping people solve real problems.<p>Is higher ed perfect? Certainly not. But I feel like I&#x27;m contributing to a broader, useful mission. If I ever leave higher ed, it would almost certainly be for a non-profit or government job.')
