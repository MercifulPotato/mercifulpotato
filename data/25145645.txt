I&#x27;m sure it costs over $100k, but I wish that kind of case design and cooling system could be available at a more reasonable price point. I wonder how long it will take for a computer with the performance specs of the DGX Station A100 to be available for under $3,000. Will that take 5 years? 10 years? Based on the historical trends of the last decade, those estimates strike me as pretty optimistic.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nvidia.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;data-center&#x2F;dgx-station-a100&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nvidia.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;data-center&#x2F;dgx-station-a100&#x2F;</a>')
