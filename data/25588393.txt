You will not go to prison. You will be able to share your opinion on the matter without restriction. You may continue to practice your chosen religion. You will not be taxed. You will not have additional restrictions placed upon your travel. You will not be required to house troops in your residence.<p>You can even choose to <i>not</i> install the OS update, and your old software will continue to work. You can choose to reinstall an old version of the OS, and your old software will continue to work.<p>Perhaps you desire an ongoing and perpetual right to download new versions of a commercial software product, which will never include changes that you do not personally desire. That right does not exist and it never has. This is not a threat to your freedom.')
