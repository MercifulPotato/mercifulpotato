The trains in the article (Cuxhaven-Bremerhaven) go once per hour. That entire region of Germany, and the area of the Netherlands that borders it, has an enormous amount of trains running on a 1x&#x2F;hourly schedule. Groningen-Leeuwarden, Groningen-Delfzijl etc etc. All running (diesel-electric) Stadler FLIRT trains, which have taken the world by storm.<p>The political decisions in these less populated regions are similar to small town politics in two ways: the budgets are tiny (aka no money for electrification) and a fairly small group can push things through if it fits their agenda. For those reasons I think these hydrogen trains could totally become popular for less densely populated areas like this.')
