I&#x27;m in a rural area, and I get 5-second power cuts every couple of months. It&#x27;s the main reason I have a UPS under my computer desk.<p>This. Can&#x27;t put the coffee maker on an UPS though. Or not on a cost effective UPS.<p>&gt; So your answer is probably that demand for that feature is far from universal, and a coffee machine is much lower stakes than for example an alarm clock.<p>Actually for the alarm clock i&#x27;m just going to be late.
