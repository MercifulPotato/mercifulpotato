(Duration to be bikeshed)<p>The &quot;after publication&quot; part is the common case and easy to handle this publication dates are easy to figure out. The &quot;after creation&quot; part is a fallback in case works are discovered long a after their creation. I don&#x27;t like basing it on the Author&#x27;s lifetime, it feels both unfair and complicates the rule significantly.')
