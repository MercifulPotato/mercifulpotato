Wolves induce panic in herds, causing them to go over cliffs or trample down fences and cross busy roads, causing accidents. In Germany this isn&#x27;t currently paid for by the state, because the law doesn&#x27;t say so, the causality is hard to prove (basically you need a piece of flesh with a wolve&#x27;s dental pattern) and the farmer is often first in line and goes bancrupt, because damage to the vehicles was done by his sheep&#x2F;cows&#x2F;whatever, not the wolves directly.<p>Also, grazing cattle outside is desirable for better land use (usually grassland isn&#x27;t good for much else) and keeping the current state of ecosystems (without grazing, bushes and trees will take over). Also, regions where cattle is grazed are typically also tourist hotspots, but cattle frequently scared by wolves is much more aggresive towards hikers. So basically, wolves screw over a lot more than just the few cows they eat...')
