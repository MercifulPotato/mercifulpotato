Of course western is reductive, not only western powers are exploitative. But check what western powers did in Africa for example. Check what they do and did in Latin America. In the middle east and part of Asia too.<p>What makes us exploitative is the fact that we go in poor countries and buy their best resources&#x2F;workforce for the cheapest price possible, without caring if the money we pay even goes to benefit the population, (as often it only goes to benefit a few corrupt politicans&#x2F;corporations). It&#x27;s exploitation because we don&#x27;t really help them get out of poverty but rather condemn them to a vicious circle of being dependent from us.')
