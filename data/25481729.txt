Haven&#x27;t been on one to verify use by ridership, or to see what the driver&#x27;s reaction to noncompliant riders is.  The higher staff-to-rider ratio might help?<p>Outdoor mask use is limited (50%?) but at least quite sparse and distant (it&#x27;s pretty cold, and wet, and everyone drives anyways.)  Indoors the numbers are much higher (I&#x27;m guessing at least 90%), including for smaller businesses.  I&#x27;m trying to think of a single business around here (small or large) without at least a sign saying you need to mask up before entry, and I&#x27;m drawing a blank.  Several have soap dispensers too, and haphazard plexiglass sheets to help physically separate staff from customers.<p>Food is strictly delivery and take-out.  Even when dine-in was still AFAIK legal, some places had it already voluntarilly closed off anyways.')
