Starting with Plato to learn philosophy is like starting with Archimedes to learn physics.</i><p>I&#x27;d suggest the opposite, do start from the Socratic dialogues if you are really interested in philosophy.<p>On the other hand, if you want to be a tech guy with the common tech preconceptions about philosophy, feel free to skip Plato and his ilk.<p>And to answer my immediate parent, first, there&#x27;s no &quot;state of the art&quot; in philosophy. Same way there&#x27;s no &quot;state of the art&quot; in actual art (ancient art can be as good or better as modern art, and Bach e.g. can be as good or better than a modern composer, and in any case as relevant and enjoyable).<p>The concept of &quot;state of the art&quot; exists for engineering not art (and is within an engineering&#x2F;tech context where the term first appeared in the 19th century, not in an art or philosophical context).<p>While technology can be accumulated, philosophy is a discourse and exchange of ideas. And, like in art, the formulation matters, and more often than not the best formulation is the original (because its closer to their source, the thinker who came up with those ideas). Plus, the main questions haven&#x27;t changed the last 5000 years, to make answers outdated. Smartphones or cars change messaging methods and habbits, not philosophy.<p>&gt;<i>In my opinion, the reason for this is that philosophy as a means of understanding ourselves and our world beyond what science can tell us is essentially futile.</i><p>Restricting ourselves and our understanding to &quot;what science can tell us&quot; is absolutely futile, like trapped in a tautology (science is a closed system explaining what is, not what should be, as by itself it has no value, morals, aesthetics, and so on. You can be a scientist and a Nazi - and many were, without anything being problematic in that scientifically as long as you perform your experiments with the scientific method. The only objections to that would be moral and thus, the realm of philosophy).<p>Science is a tool, we don&#x27;t ask tools for their opinions or for our goals or for what to do with them. We use them to make things or to examine things, no to think about what we want to make, or to think about what is best to make. That&#x27;s for philosophy.')
