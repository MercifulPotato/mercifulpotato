If PR was a red state instead of solid blue, I&#x27;d sincerely doubt you&#x27;d see statehood regularly discussed at the top of &#x2F;r&#x2F;politics.<p>Probably, but that&#x27;s also been the case for basically every state ever admitted to the union.  Remember when the US used to consider whether a state was slave for free before admission?<p>Even the statehood of Hawaii was politically charged.  People genuinely feared the kind of people Hawaiian would send as representatives.  Including, but not limited to Communists and anti-segregationists.<p>Alaska was opposed on the grounds that it would be a welfare state and that it would add a bunch of democrats to Congress.')
