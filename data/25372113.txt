They showed up in Charlottesville to protest --&quot;<p>Trump: &quot;Excuse me, excuse me. They didnâ€™t put themselves -- and you had some very bad people in that group, but you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides.<p>So. Trump admitted that the neo-Nazis are very bad people, but the group ALSO had some very fine people.<p>To Trump supporters or &quot;enlightened centrists&quot;, this is proof that the left is also deliberately distorting the truth, but you&#x27;re missing the point.<p>The point isn&#x27;t that Trump drew a distinction between the Nazis (who were bad) and the non-Nazis (who were good), and therefore he didn&#x27;t call Nazis good people.<p>The point is that there people marching with Neo-Nazis are not better than Neo-Nazis.<p>If you have a political position and you find yourself attracting neo-Nazis, you have to take a long hard look at what you&#x27;re doing.<p>This is the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Good_German" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Good_German</a> fallacy. Silently and tacitly accepting fascism because you benefit from it is still fascism.<p>So in conclusion, yes, Trump called Nazis &quot;very fine people&quot;. It&#x27;s just that you and Trump don&#x27;t consider those people Nazis, when they are.<p>&gt; &quot;Trump told people to drink bleach&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-us-canada-52407177" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-us-canada-52407177</a><p>The exact quote:<p>&quot;And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning? So it&#x27;d be interesting to check that.&quot;<p>Pointing to his head, Mr Trump went on: &quot;I&#x27;m not a doctor. But I&#x27;m, like, a person that has a good you-know-what.&quot;<p>OK. First of all, let&#x27;s start with the fact that Trump has a Cult of Personality. His supporters don&#x27;t just love him, they TRUST him implicitly - more than any other authority figure. More than other politicians, but also more than DOCTORS.<p>An idea from Trump matters more to his supporters than an idea from any medical expert.<p>So. You have Trump &quot;just asking questions&quot; that if a disinfectant can be shown to knock out the virus on a kitchen counter (and at that point there were COUNTLESS news articles about how to protect yourself from the virus by bleaching and disenfecting all your things. He goes a step further and says maybe there is a way to do the same by taking the same disinfectant INSIDE the body. Finally, he says I&#x27;m not a doctor, but I know things. Which basically seals the deal and confirms he thinks it&#x27;s a promising idea.<p>So, no, he didn&#x27;t say the words &quot;MAGA NATION! Go buy bleach and drink it!&quot;<p>But he did say that he believes that: Disinfectant inside the body could help with the virus through injection or something like it.<p>It is a plausibly deniable one, but it is an endorsement nonetheless.')
