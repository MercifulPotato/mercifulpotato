I see history in a completely different light now. No matter what you say to these people, they&#x27;ll either ignore it, or find some other lie to hang their hat on. If you point out the facts, they&#x27;ll deny the source, or say, &quot;How do YOU know? Did YOU count all the votes?&quot; or some other nonsense.<p>What&#x27;s the cure for this? (Not asking OP, he&#x27;s one of the zombie hoards. He&#x27;ll go to his deathbed convinced of his own delusions.) We used to just ignore these types of stubborn, brain washed conspiracy theory wackos, but now there&#x27;s tens of millions of them.<p>It&#x27;s truly frightening.')
