Saw recently someone say they talked to CalDigit support and they said to clear the NVRAM with sudo nvram -c<p>I upgraded to Catalina again, ran this to be certain, and it worked! No more crashing in a whole month. Previous reinstalls of Catalina did not fix it.<p>My theory is the NVRAM seems to hold some values that look like hints of hardware configuration (I forget the label this long string is under) and if this string gets anything incorrect it panics on wake or even on boot because it doesn&#x27;t see all the hardware supposedly plugged in and can&#x27;t speed up the boot&#x2F;wake using these hints.<p>This makes sense why it would panic if you unplug while it&#x27;s sleeping and then it crashes on wake.')
