All of us developers had this thought at some point.<p>I&#x27;ve seen terrible code with plenty of quick hacks on top of that, which was running very stable, because it was battle tested for years in production.<p>What do you think will happen when you refactor such code to a better design? All juniors would think this is the best way to get a stable codebase.<p>Reality is that you will introduce bugs by refactoring, not get rid of it. Writing code means writing bugs, no matter how pretty your code is.<p>This reminds me of some quote that &quot;Junior developers write 1 bug per 10 lines of code, experienced coders know they write 1 bug per 10 lines of code&quot;')
