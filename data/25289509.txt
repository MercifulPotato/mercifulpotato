Item(by='lucideer', descendants=None, kids=[25289679], score=None, time=1607008062, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25288992, text='I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d agree that nobody agrees on what &quot;strongly typed&quot; means (yes I understand that sounds like an oxymoron but bear with me).<p>I think the confusion around the term mainly arises from people in computer science having a strong ;) preference for binary definitions. To be able to say &quot;X is strongly typed&quot; and &quot;Y is not strongly typed&quot; is desirable.<p>However, linguistically, &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;weak&quot; are not binary terms. Static is: something is static or is not. But strength&#x2F;weakness is an assessment on a scale. Defining something as &quot;strong&quot; is always, by definition, relative and somewhat subjective in nature.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say that the <i>definition</i> of &quot;strongly typed&quot; is subjective; we can find agreement on what scale &quot;strong types&quot; live upon. But the application of the term to any given object is subjective. We cannot say &quot;X is strongly typed&quot;, we can only say &quot;X is more&#x2F;less&#x2F;very&#x2F;not very strongly typed&quot;.')
