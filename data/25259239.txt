Contrary to my first assumption, Bio NMR (in contrast to crystallography) will become more and more important, since the method allows to study the dynamic properties of proteins. With the structure predicted by DNNs, the chemical shifts to be expected in the NMR spectra can be calculated; the assignment problem is thus largely eliminated. Bio NMR can then be used specifically to study the &quot;parts that move&quot;.')
