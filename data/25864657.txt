What you need is sufficiently distributed hashpower that no actor can perform a 51% attack. That&#x27;s all.<p>Small-time users can use thin wallets; mega-power users can download the whole blockchain and spend whatever (in perspective, not super significant) amount of money they need for sufficient storage. Users in between can carry a reduced form of the blockchain that doesn&#x27;t care so much about a full transaction log but accurately describes the state of every wallet&#x27;s balance (thereby functioning the same from a &quot;verify that they&#x27;re not bullshitting me&quot; perspective).')
