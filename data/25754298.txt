So if you stare at a computer all day, maybe it’s time to consider an E Ink monitor for at least one of your displays.<p>That’s how the DASUNG Paperlike Monitor is designed to be used: as a 13.3-inch desktop display that forgoes LCD or OLED technologies for a black and white (256 shades of grey) E Ink display with a resolution of 2200 x 1650 pixels. It’s larger than the screens used on the Amazon Kindles and most other ebook readers, it’s the largest E Ink screen you can get in the e-ink market.<p>The E Ink monitor doesn’t include touchscreen functionality, but on the side and on its bezel are a collection of small buttons that can be used for adjusting contrast, forcing a full-screen refresh to get rid of artifacts, and switching between display modes. Unlike an ebook reader it’s also lacking its own processor or operating system, so it won’t do anything until you pass it a signal from another device through its mini HDMI port. The display doesn’t even have a backlight or any kind of self-illumination, so if you’re working through the night, you’ll need to keep the lights on or a lamp nearby. If you buy our HD-F with frontlight version, features front light, illuminating LED light running parallel to the device from the side. The light guide plate attached to the surface of the screen ensures the light illuminates the E-ink screen, and the light will not directly shine into your eyes. Protecting eyes to the fullest while achieving the fill light effect. Switch between cool and warm light freely, adjustable front light brightness, the front light can also be turned off completely.<p>It’s doubtful you’ll ever want to try watching YouTube or Netflix movies on this display, but for other daily tasks, like monitoring social media or writing emails, it sounds like it could be a nice backup for your main LCD screen.')
