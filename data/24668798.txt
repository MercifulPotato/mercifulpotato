I suspect this attitude comes primarily from people in STEM fields, because there only the most recent content is relevant, and recent content is available in digital form. But there are still whole fields – e.g. archaeology, linguistics, history, literature – where so many books have never been digitized.  Anyone interested in such topics today often has to turn to a paper book that is a few decades old, and so thank goodness for libraries that have abundant stacks or can get you quick and cheap ILL.<p>That is true even for many things that a layman readership might want to read, not just a scholarly audience. For example, a lot of 20th-century poetry is not available in ebook form, and with their limited typesetting capabilities, MOBI&#x2F;EPUB are terrible formats for reading that genre anyway.')
