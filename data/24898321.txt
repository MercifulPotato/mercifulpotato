As a user, how do you know what Google Home can do and cannot do?<p>It is just trial and error. And if Google Home introduces a new feature to be able to complete new types of queries. What now? How does a user know that last month it wasn&#x27;t able to do something and this month it is able to do that thing.<p>And lastly, the interface of voice is very clunky. It has no concept of temporal memory like<p>Me: &quot;Ok Google, navigate to the nearest safeway&quot;\nGoogle: &quot;navigating you to the nearest gas station&quot;<p>The natural thing to say is &quot;no, I meant safeway nott gas station&quot;\nhowever, I now have to say &quot;Ok Google, navigate to the nearest safeway&quot;.<p>This is analogous to if keyboard had no backspace and you have to retype everything everytime you have a typo. Well that&#x27;s the state of speech technology right now')
