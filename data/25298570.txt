It&#x27;s harder for writing) regardless of direction. You give me a native speaker who has only ever seen one character set in their whole life (which is actually quite rare) and I can have them reading slowly in the other character set by the end of the day, and fluently by the end of a week. There&#x27;s a set of rules for translating between radicals and then maybe in the ballpark of 100 exceptions (in either direction) on top of that and that gets you effectively full fluency.<p>&gt; But in that case it also says something that the software didn&#x27;t handle the conversion well (implying that perhaps whoever wrote it didn&#x27;t know about it), and that people posting this stuff also didn&#x27;t correct the obvious mistake (suggesting they didn&#x27;t know either).<p>The automated translation error is usually an artifact of people being lazy and not checking the translation (see e.g. my 著 example). The fact the software doesn&#x27;t get it is because differentiating the different cases is a hard NLP problem but an easy human-solvable problem so the investment isn&#x27;t usually made. But probably part of it too is that this is starting to get into writing in a different character set, which is harder than just reading it.<p>But to get back up out of the weeds, I was mainly reacting to support mrslave&#x27;s assertion that<p>&gt; The Chinese I have asked who learnt Simplified Chinese characters in school attest to being able to read Traditional Chinese characters with very little additional effort<p>which is true and holds up even if you strip context as you mention.<p>&gt; If you really wanted to know, you&#x27;d have to show them the characters in isolation. Try for example 發. I bet it&#x27;s not going to be so straightforward.<p>I&#x27;ve actually played this game with friends (all PRC speakers) once before, i.e. quizzing each other on individual traditional characters. There was only one that threw even one of us for a loop (叢) and would&#x27;ve been obvious given context. Everyone got everything else out of maybe 30 irregular characters (i.e. don&#x27;t just follow standard simplified radicals).<p>I think &quot;on the spot&quot; was supposed to mean &quot;without having seen the character before but seeing its context,&quot; I don&#x27;t think mrslave meant literally ab initio but I dunno at that point I&#x27;m putting words in mrslave&#x27;s mouth.<p>While I agree with your three points in the second half of your reply, I don&#x27;t think that was the initial thrust of your parent comment.<p>I interpreted your initial comment to mean that switching from simplified characters to traditional characters is both non-trivial and harder than going from traditional to simplified. Moreover there was the added implication that PRC speakers don&#x27;t generally know individual traditional characters, but are only able to guess at them when given additional contextual clues. Perhaps I&#x27;m completely distorting your claim, but it is regardless a common claim I see on English language forums, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m pedantically attacking a strawman.<p>I disagree with those points.<p>It is trivial (relative to most other things language-learning-related) to go from simplified characters to traditional characters (and indeed to go the opposite direction) and it is not appreciably more difficult in either direction. Moreover I think you&#x27;re drastically underestimating the proficiency of the average literate PRC speaker in understanding traditional characters. Keep in mind there&#x27;s still quite a lot of exposure to traditional characters despite its absence in the educational system. Signs, foreign film subtitles, decorations, trademarks, etc. traditional characters pop up all over. There&#x27;s also a ton of cultural imports from Taiwan that preserve their traditional characters. Because it&#x27;s so trivial, this passive osmosis is enough to attain essentially full fluency in reading traditional characters.<p>I have such a strong reaction to this not because of insider nit-picking, because I&#x27;ve seen so many examples of Chinese language learners hemming and hawing over whether they should go for traditional characters or simplified characters when there&#x27;s effectively no difference. Fluency in one makes fluency in the other trivial, at least if you don&#x27;t care about being able to handwrite both. Choose whichever has the better teachers&#x2F;resources&#x2F;etc. or just flip a coin. There&#x27;s no advantage to one over the other. Barring your environment, the only time I could find even a shred of advantage to choose traditional characters over simplified characters is if you&#x27;re exclusively studying Classical Chinese and not any modern variety. Even then the advantage is far far less than a lot of people proclaim.')
