Still interesting to see the comparisons.<p>The leaked Geekbench results of AMD&#x27;s upcoming 5800H laptop parts are about 85% of the M1&#x27;s single core score and matching the M1&#x27;s multi-core score. TDP is still higher than the M1, obviously, but AMD is also using a 7nm process while Apple got the jump on 5nm by buying exclusivity on TMSC&#x27;s 5nm process through the end of the year.<p>I&#x27;m extremely impressed with the M1 and I&#x27;ll be buying an Apple Silicon device as soon as they have something with 32GB or more of RAM. However, the sentiment that the M1 chip obliterates any and every desktop part on the market is getting kind of silly at this point.')
