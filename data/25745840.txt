I don&#x27;t have a complicated setup, just some basic VLANs, firewall rules, radius assigned VLANs via MAC, and IDS&#x2F;IPS, so maybe that&#x27;s why i&#x27;m not having any issues with it.<p>I have the technical skill to set it up from scratch if i wanted a second day job, but i don&#x27;t anymore. I&#x27;ve run on homebuilt devices, on a Soekris net4801, on an Alix APU1D4, on m0n0wall and PfSense in various configurations, latest on a Netgate SG-3100, and while the SG-3100 comes very close to being a network appliance, it still managed to crash to a point where i was flashing it and setting it up over a USB cable, and while Netgate support was very helpfull, that&#x27;s hardly something you&#x27;d ask the average consumer to do.<p>On the access point side of things the only real contender would be Meraki, but those are 2-3 times the cost of UniFi gear. You could of course also get a bunch of Zyxel&#x2F;Netgear&#x2F;whatever consumer devices and put them in bridge mode, and lose all central management.')
