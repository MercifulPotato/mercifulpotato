Item(by='t0astbread', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605380586, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25093436, text='Well, you&#x27;re right, Android does offer more extensibility than people give it credit for: If you&#x27;re okay with its heavyweight development tools you can (for example) write a custom launcher to change some of the UI and you can extend&#x2F;intercept some system functionality with apps. There&#x27;s also Termux which offers a Linux shell environment based on the underlying kernel combined with APIs for Android-specific functionality. It&#x27;s actually quite powerful, you can run scripts or daemons in the background without a problem.<p>But what I mean is most of the system isn&#x27;t really open like that. Configuration, application data and stuff like that is mostly managed by the system and you can&#x27;t access or change that data without major hacks. Termux feels like a second-class citizen because most of the ecosystem isn&#x27;t built with something like it in mind (in contrast to the &quot;CLI-by-default&quot; experience on other Linux systems). There&#x27;s also a few (non-embedded) system components like the backup system (which, if I&#x27;m not mistaken, is provided by the Google Services Framework) which you can&#x27;t easily replace.<p>Of course, when it comes to security this is not something you should give to anyone who doesn&#x27;t know to protect themselves using it. And I assume it wouldn&#x27;t be a financial success either, I just guessed this is what people mean when they say they don&#x27;t like Android because it&#x27;s too restrictive.')
