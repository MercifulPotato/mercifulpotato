I know that it&#x27;s much higher overhead, and if I was doing something with a minimal UI, or something that persisted in a tray I&#x27;d probably reach for something more minimal.  It really depends on the use case.<p>React Native options may be another target that I might look into if I needed native, thought he UI kits aren&#x27;t quite as interoperable as I&#x27;d necessarily like, it&#x27;s a pretty decent option.<p>I mostly do full-stack service layers with react&#x2F;web ui these days so anything that leans on what I already do is likely the best use of my time.  A browser surface, while massive, memory hungry etc, is still often the best option for any app UI work as it solves so many issues and can run everywhere.
