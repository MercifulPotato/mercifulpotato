Personally I&#x27;ve always noticed significantly more input lag on Linux than Windows for games. I even used to hack on ezquake&#x27;s Linux port to try and get the input lag down, but the Linux kernel just caused too much latency. This could have changed since then though. You have to realize MS invested significantly in &quot;gaming APIs&quot; like DirectInput, DirectX all tuned to low latency gaming. Linux never really had anything like that. I&#x27;d love to see results showing otherwise, I&#x27;d far prefer to game in Linux if possible.')
