I have little confidence in either on it&#x27;s own. And I&#x27;ve been burned too much by vendor lock-in in the past to ever advocate for ANY service that isn&#x27;t federated (I use many non-federated services but out of necessity, I would never sell others on them).<p>I should add that successful &amp; popular federated online messaging services are something we&#x27;ve had since the 1960s so I have yet to see any compelling reason to be perpetuating the walled-garden approach beyond a preference for a totalitarian approach to ecosystem control.')
