Since the M1 MacBooks came out, all of a sudden people are talking like every MBP version prior is junk.  Top-of-the-line MBP that can&#x27;t run dual monitors? Where were these conversations about poor MBP performance 6 months ago?<p>FWIW, the last MBP I had was a 2015 i5, and I used a single 4k monitor and no had zero issues in regular usage.')
