They are:<p>1.The primacy of the group. Supporting the group feels more important than maintaining either individual or universal rights.<p>2. Believing that one&#x27;s group is a victim. This justifies any behavior against the group&#x27;s enemies.<p>3. The belief that individualism and liberalism enable dangerous decadence and have a negative effect on the group.<p>4. A strong sense of community or brotherhood. This brotherhood&#x27;s &quot;unity and purity are forged by common conviction, if possible, or by exclusionary violence if necessary.&quot;<p>5. Individual self-esteem is tied up in the grandeur of the group. Paxton called this an &quot;enhanced sense of identity and belonging.&quot;<p>6. Extreme support of a &quot;natural&quot; leader, who is always male. This results in one man taking on the role of national savior.<p>7. &quot;The beauty of violence and of will, when they are devoted to the group&#x27;s success in a Darwinian struggle,&quot; Paxton wrote. The idea of a naturally superior group or, especially in Hitler&#x27;s case, biological racism, fits into a fascist interpretation of Darwinism.&quot;</i>')
