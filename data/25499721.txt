Its not very rigorous.<p>Lets start with a more rigorous approach: E(heads) == .75 on a biased coin.<p>Maybe with 100-coin flips, with an average of 75-heads. We have a normalish-distribution centered around 75 where we can still draw a good random number from. It probably wouldn&#x27;t be too hard to &quot;subtract 25&quot; after 75-flips and get something less biased as a result. That&#x27;s the idea anyway.<p>Variance of a single coin flip, or variance(heads) == .75 * .25 == 0.1875. Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure where that 62.5% figure comes from at all.')
