THAT is probably the biggest concern of your average internet surfer. They think, &quot;I don&#x27;t trade any high level secrets... I&#x27;m a nobody&quot;. So the worst thing they can conceive is, &quot;but I did send some pics to that person I met on Facebook. I sure would hate for my significant other to find out&quot;. That&#x27;s something that can resonate with a far larger group. Many honestly don&#x27;t care because they feel there&#x27;s nothing they can do. Perhaps they&#x27;re right. It&#x27;s not like the US Gov (or any other) said, &quot;oh, you caught us.... fine we&#x27;ll shut down the program&quot;<p>I totally agree that it&#x27;s sad that we&#x27;re in this place of apathy. But it&#x27;s hard to get folks all excited when they don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;ll really affect them personally.')
