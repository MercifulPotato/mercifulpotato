Item(by='cosmotic', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609276783, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25575030, text='I have not yet seen a pi or pi-related board that supports 802.3af right into the jack and right out of the box. A few support surprisingly large add-on boards that connect to the GPIO pins and to a set of pins near the RJ45 so you can still use the built in jack for data and power. You can always use a non-standard or even standard injector&#x2F;tap but that&#x27;s probably not what you&#x27;re after.<p>I have a side project where I disassembled a 802.3af tap and USB ethernet board and wired it all directly into a PiZero. The POE tap and USB ethernet boards are pretty small internally. The POE tap has a cat5-like header that comes off I just wired straight into the pads the ethernet controller was using while removing the RJ45 plug on the board. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;0gBj23G" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;0gBj23G</a>')
