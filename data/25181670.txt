Im in the US, so the Minimum Advertised Price is the default unless you find a store that will work with you and offer a discount privately. Those exist, but not for every piece of gear(popular stuff usually wont get a discount, because why?) I feel like this is the kind of problem that is solve-able, but Im not quite sure how just yet. If I can figure it out, maybe there is a startup idea :)')
