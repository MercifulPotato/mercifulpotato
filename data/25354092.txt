However, there&#x27;s likely only a few people who have a full grasp of what tech exists in the space. Reputation-wise, the largest companies in these fields often aren&#x27;t as &quot;sexy&quot; and aren&#x27;t known to have the career trajectory or compensation of more mainstream firms (regardless of whether that&#x27;s true), so I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re getting as many strong applicants into these vital fields.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear from folks in these industries on how you got into it, and how you recommend others do so?<p>Thank you!')
