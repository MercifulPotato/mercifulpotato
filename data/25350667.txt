I have a pair of entry level Philips BT headphones (designed by Gibson) and they sound well above its price point. It&#x27;s no Sennheiser, Grado, RHA or similar but, they&#x27;re not a pair of cheap cans either.<p>So, for $549, they should rather sound detailed and balanced. Otherwise, It&#x27;s meaningless for me.')
