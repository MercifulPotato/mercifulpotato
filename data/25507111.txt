So the immediate question may be whether your co-founder can fire you.<p>In 1 month, you&#x27;ve vested 25% of your grant, or 10% of the company. So I would try to get to that mark to strengthen your negotiating position. Any references to 40% are red herrings at this point.<p>Unless there&#x27;s a specific buyback clause in your stakeholder agreement, they&#x27;re under no obligation to buy you out at any time. (They may have the <i>right</i> to do so. That&#x27;s not uncommon.)<p>Of course, you&#x27;re under no obligation to resign, either. So this is a negotiation.<p>So the way I see it, you have a few options:<p>1. You take your 10% and leave. You &quot;don&#x27;t want any equity&quot;, but better something you don&#x27;t want than nothing.<p>2. You agree to a buyback, potentially at a discount to FMV. If you don&#x27;t know what FMV is, it&#x27;s hard to negotiate one way or another. It&#x27;s v. likely not $1M. Sounds like this is a no-go.<p>2B. You agree to a non-cash buyback, e.g., in IP. You spent 11 months building the tech: what if you took that with you?<p>3. You flip the script and buy your co-founder out.<p>In any case, your relationship is over. You might walk away with nothing.')
