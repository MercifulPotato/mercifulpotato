It&#x27;s another to attempt to invalidate the entire debate by stating that &quot;morals are relative.&quot;<p>You may think you&#x27;re just stating &quot;morals are relative, just that,&quot; but in reality, the context within which you state it serves only to move the discussion away from the morals of the act in question into some abstract debate about morals in general.  It&#x27;s a distraction.  Sometimes the &quot;root cause&quot; cannot be resolved and we should focus on the symptoms and more surface level issues.')
