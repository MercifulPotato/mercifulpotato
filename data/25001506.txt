Lack of object-oriented features make it a bit old-fashioned and not a good replacement for Realbasic (which I really found useful when it was still affordable).<p>However, the biggest drawback that holds this Basic dialect consistently back is that the cross-platform functionality is always only 85% there. It&#x27;s cross platform, just not <i>enough</i> cross-platform. There are hacks to get functionality on Windows that won&#x27;t work on Mac and Linux, and vice versa, and some essential functionality has never been implemented. Most importantly, a working cross-platform rich text editor widget with image support is missing. Other smaller things are also missing or not fully featured enough. All of the missing cross-platform functionality could have been implemented years ago, but the very nice main developer seems to have other priorities. There are just too many hacks and tricks that only work on Windows.<p>It&#x27;s fine for small tools and quick hacks, though, and has a lot of supporting libraries. Among the existing cross-platform Basic dialects, it&#x27;s probably the most complete.')
