Those law changes are significant, and may portend similar measures being considered across states in the coming years.<p>This report is the latest in our annual series looking into the state of municipal broadband in America, and provides a state-by-state breakdown of the various roadblocks and restrictions used to prevent their establishment. This year, we’ve also compared access to low-price broadband in states that have no municipal restrictions versus those that do, and we’ve found that the former have lower internet prices on average.<p>State legislatures around the country considered a wave of broadband-focused bills in 2019. That signals not only the importance of addressing broadband access gaps for state lawmakers, but also a growing acknowledgment among state and local governments that they have a larger role to play in ensuring all residents have access to the high-speed internet.&quot;<p>&gt;I&#x27;m not confident that municipal broadband will ever really take off in the US but I think local loop unbundling might have a chance since I&#x27;m sure companies are more than happy to unload all the expensive construction work to the local gov&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;d tend to agree, as long as state and local government officials continue to be bought (and critically, <i>stay</i> bought) by industry groups.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that municipal broadband is <i>the</i> solution for every county&#x2F;city&#x2F;town.  Rather, it&#x27;s <i>a</i> solution that, under the right circumstances, can improve the livability, access to commercial opportunities, higher-paid residents and a raft of other positive outcomes.<p>These are local and state issues that aren&#x27;t well suited to regulation&#x2F;lawmaking from the Federal government, and should be addressed in that fashion.  A good place to start would be to reverse the anti-competitive laws in place in 22 states that limit the ability of local governments to implement municipal broadband.<p>I&#x27;d say that if the big ISP&#x27;s don&#x27;t want it, it&#x27;s probably a good thing to do.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sourcewatch.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;ALEC_Communications_and_Technology_Task_Force" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sourcewatch.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;ALEC_Communications_an...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.govtech.com&#x2F;network&#x2F;Lawmakers-Mount-Federal-Effort-to-Block-Bans-on-Municipal-Internet.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.govtech.com&#x2F;network&#x2F;Lawmakers-Mount-Federal-Effo...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;tech-policy&#x2F;2015&#x2F;04&#x2F;anti-municipal-broadband-group-tries-to-silence-a-critic&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;tech-policy&#x2F;2015&#x2F;04&#x2F;anti-municipal-b...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;broadbandnow.com&#x2F;report&#x2F;municipal-broadband-roadblocks&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;broadbandnow.com&#x2F;report&#x2F;municipal-broadband-roadbloc...</a>')
