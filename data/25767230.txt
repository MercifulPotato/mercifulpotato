I only ask because there are more factors than salary. I have friends who have moved to work in France, Norway, and Germany. They do make markedly less than I do on my US salary. However, they also get:<p>* Substantially more actual vacation time<p>* Substantially cheaper and yet similar health, dental, and vision coverage<p>* Less risk&#x2F;stress associated with job security<p>* A very similar job market<p>I don&#x27;t imagine this is the same in every country in the EU, just as technical job markets are different in the US. But working in the US Tech Sector isn&#x27;t the panacea of work related issues.')
