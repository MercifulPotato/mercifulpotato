Like Chernobyl had 4 nuclear reactors powering 1 steam turbine, because the engineering required to build a high quality high capacity one is super expensive. With aneutronic fusion you could just use the energy from the generated charged particles and directly turn that into juice.<p>The huge, huge, huge thing though would be no more neutron radiation. It would vastly simplify reactor construction, reactor cleanup, biological shielding, etc. etc.<p>Aneutronic fusion would also us to just <i>spam</i> power plants, safely and cheaply, in a way that&#x27;s difficult for modern society to even understand. Assuming the aneutronic reactor itself isn&#x27;t mega expense of course.')
