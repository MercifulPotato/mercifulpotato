Use your strongest language: being visibly fluent in any language gives a much better impression than trying to stumble through in a language you&#x27;re rusty or unfamiliar with.  The interview is (meant to, anyway) focusing on your thinking process, logic and data structures, not the details of syntax.<p>I <i>would</i> avoid functional languages like Lisp or Haskell though, they&#x27;re just too weird&#x2F;different for most people and you risk coming off as an impractical idealist.')
