As a person who gets sick a lot I almost always end up having to take unpaid days off when I’m sick because I blew though my 3-5 sick days.<p>Places with PTO I can take my entire pool off as sick time. Never took an unpaid day at a PTO business.<p>Right now. I have 400+ hours of banked vacation time, but I have used all of my sick days for the year. If I get sick I have to take it unpaid or work. It doesn’t make any sense.<p>Honestly I think they should outlaw having them separate.')
