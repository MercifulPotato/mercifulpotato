Looks like a lot of catching up to do.<p>Plus many people might not have actually been trying continuously to improve it that much in one single recent century compared to previous ancient centuries.<p>Like Buckminster Fuller says most of the time for the masses once something novel and badly needed achieves popular adoption, further progress can halt right there.<p>Barely good enough is the enemy of perfect.<p>Now with a geologist like Jackson and her rare x-ray technique this is a 21st century workaround to try and compensate in only one lifetime for the loss of possibly millennia of previous actual human development.<p>This could take a while and arrangements should be made to continue for more than one lifetime, or at least as long as possible beyond one university tenure.<p>Even more so in this case since the materials testing phase can be expected to last more than a century itself after each cycle of continuous improvement, once cumulative progress has moved the overall longevity far enough beyond what we have now.<p>This is survivorship bias in action, put to use.<p>Many times employed in materials testing.<p>The ancients definitely didn&#x27;t have the same technolgy we have today, but what if many more of them were giving it all they had with greater determination compounded over very much longer periods of times?<p>No doubt superior outcomes can be had from earlier, sometimes lost, technology.<p>In finance more wealth can usually be extracted more quickly from generous reservoirs while they last compared to being built and protected from the ground up.<p>For technology the biggest reservoir is the very long trailing edge which has more area under the curve than you are ever going to get in your little time no matter how late you come to the table and how long you stay.<p>As I suspected, the longer you compound your concrete knowledge the better.<p>With the wealth of more centuries of research behind you, it would be a lot easier to justify any increased cost of raw materials to fill a cement truck.')
