Ie. no 4. has implications when iterating ie. Object.keys({ foo: undefined }).length === 1.<p>Education around those - yes, but blacklisting null? Sounds a bit silly, however I agree that most developers overuse null when they actually mean undefined.<p>One example in code where null vs undefined can be used is sql.update(table, where, { foo: null, bar: 1 }) - meaning update foo to null vs sql.update(table, where, { foo: undefined, bar: 1 }) - where undefined means, don&#x27;t do anything with that column. This helps a lot because it&#x27;s much more verbose to conditionally construct object with a property or without it, however it&#x27;s easy to set it defined&#x2F;undefined.')
