I readily acknowledge that cars are a different bucket of fish, but the benefits of open-sourced firmware have been well-established in areas like routers.<p>It&#x27;s also (hopefully) not a binary choice between OEM firmware and a clean-room from-scratch implementation. If it was I might agree, but the ideal scenario is that the OEM releases the firmware, then community members (okay, whatever, generalists and amateurs) get to fix bugs&#x2F;do long-term support when the business has moved on. Complimentary rather than adversarial. For instance, even a generalist could throw some static analysis at some code and come up with a bunch of trivial (but useful!) memory correctness fixes or something like that.')
