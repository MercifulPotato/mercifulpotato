The player can do it to using things like &quot;ping&quot; or taking control of cameras, so I don&#x27;t mind if enemies can too. Trying to attack through doors isn&#x27;t very smart though. However I also very much enjoy when AI has an enemy hiding away in some corner trying to hack my brain while I fight off a few others directly. Or when an enemy I&#x27;d tagged but lost track of visually has taken a path around me &amp; come up from behind. So there&#x27;s some problems, but in general it seems okay to me.')
