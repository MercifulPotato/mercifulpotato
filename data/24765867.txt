From some open-source foundation?<p>From our dead ancestors.<p><i>“A patent is a device that enables one man to claim special financial rewards for being the last link in the complicated social process that produced the invention.”</i><p>— Lewis Mumford<p><i>&quot;Every machine has had the same history — a long record of sleepless nights and of poverty, of disillusions and of joys, of partial improvements discovered by several generations of nameless workers, who have added to the original invention these little nothings, without which the most fertile idea would remain fruitless. More than that: every new invention is a synthesis, the resultant of innumerable inventions which have preceded it in the vast field of mechanics and industry.<p>Science and industry, knowledge and application, discovery and practical realization leading to new discoveries, cunning of brain and of hand, toil of mind and muscle-all work together. Each discovery, each advance, each increase in the sum of human riches, owes its being to the physical and mental travail of the past and the present.<p>By what right then can any one whatever appropriate the least morsel of this immense whole and say — This is mine, not yours?&quot;</i><p>— Peter Kropotkin<p>We are all standing on the shoulders of giants.')
