I like Python, and I think ExitStack is a fantastic way to manage resources.  However, that is because it most closely emulates RAII in C++.<p>The limitation that I still run into is when a class needs to have some cleanup code added to it.  In C++, you just add a destructor.  In Python, you are forced to choose between non-deterministic release of resources through __del__, or changing the interface by requiring users to use a &quot;with&quot; block.  Neither of those is a particularly satisfying option.')
