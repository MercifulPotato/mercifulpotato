It certainly might exist, but I suspect that such an approach would be full of incompatibilities. Consider that Vimium works by (among other things) parsing the DOM and making changes to it in real time. What would that look like for a desktop application with a GUI backend that&#x27;s effectively a black box?<p>For Linux, the obvious pragmatic answer is to use a tiling window manager (i3, awm, etc) combined with terminal based programs (since they are keyboard driven by default).<p>Alternatively, you might have some amount of luck configuring lots of keyboard shortcuts in your window manager. You&#x27;d have to pick your programs very carefully though since most GUIs just aren&#x27;t that compatible with being driven by a keyboard.')
