But we (mostly) agreed on facts and what is true and what is not - and then argued conclusions or actions.<p>What is different these days is that we simply deny the facts, provide &quot;alternate facts&quot;, or simply lie about facts. As a result we no longer agree on a basic basis of truth, truth has become a belief or a choice.<p>That is toxic, since it is used to simply avoid meaningful discussion. It is a fundamental change in how we conduct our discourse. And so new measures are needed.<p>Rather than censoring speech, I&#x27;d prefer fact checking, which may or may not amount to the same.')
