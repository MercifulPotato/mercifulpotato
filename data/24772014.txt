Eventually the binary groups got dropped by ISPs, but you could pay to use someone else&#x27;s servers and pull a couple hundred gigabytes of content at fiber speeds. This all while people were struggling for weeks to get a single torrent to finish. Of course, FXP servers and IRC D&#x2F;C were the OG pirating method, but usenet binaries were accessible to pretty much anybody and in no way illegal (&quot;I&#x27;m just downloading the news!&quot;). Though it also seemed like nobody even noticed anything illegal was going on, because most people were stuck on P2P alternatives even though they sucked in comparison. I&#x27;m pretty sure Napster succeeded because normal people couldn&#x27;t comprehend Usenet.')
