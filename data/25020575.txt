The US government isn&#x27;t a beneficient association that is organized to make things better for people in other countries at the expense of US citizens -- it&#x27;s not an aid organization or a charity or something like that. The interests of non-citizens don&#x27;t have any representation in it (it&#x27;s like every other government in that regard) -- it&#x27;s just the wrong organization to do something like that.')
