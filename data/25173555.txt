Because perf is decided at the design level, in the architecture, data structures and algorithms. In fact, if you get massive speedups in your optimization phase, I would view that as a sign that your process has issues. There should not be that much potential left after you wrote the code down.<p>Elite fit on one floppy disk. Do you think they got there by taking a slow implementation and optimizing it?<p>Have you ever used Turbo Pascal? You think you could get that kind of speed by taking an existing pascal compiler and optimizing it a bit?')
