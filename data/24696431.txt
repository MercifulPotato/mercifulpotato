And this is not even taking into account Asians in the US and elsewhere outside of Asia. You say it shouldn&#x27;t matter yet you also admit your argument is weakened by using the bigger data set.<p>Claims about inherent racial strengths and weaknesses always break down once the actual genetic diversity within the population of a &quot;race&quot; is taken into account, because what we consider to be &quot;race&quot; is broad and mostly defined by cultural and political factors, rather than genetics.<p>By definition, professional athletes are genetic exceptions. So it would make no sense to compare the average member of any population to the elites in the NBA and make claims about race in general. Particularly with something as trivial and variant as height.')
