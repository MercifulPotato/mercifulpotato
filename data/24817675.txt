(Well, if there were any to dislike.)<p>&gt;i would love to see alternatives that actually work and are competitive.<p>Why not ask for the moon and the stars while you&#x27;re at it? You make it sound like all that is needed to develop (as tachyonbeam pointed out) European equivalents to &quot;Google, Duckduckgo, YouTube, Uber, Facebook, Dropbox, Amazon, Netflix, etc&quot; is to shut down access from anywhere in Europe to and from these companies. Do this today and tomorrow EUGoogle and EuroFacebook will appear as if out of nowhere! Why didn&#x27;t Brussels (or Paris, or Berlin) think of this already?')
