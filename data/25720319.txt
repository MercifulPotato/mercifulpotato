Almost every multi-meter has an frustrating &quot;beep after X minutes&quot; when it&#x27;s on. It&#x27;s become a pet peeve! Are there any solar powered voltmeters out there? I want it to just always have power.<p>I know solar panels + indoor lighting don&#x27;t work too well together. A second best would be one with a nice lithium rechargeable and adjustable &quot;shut off period&quot;.')
