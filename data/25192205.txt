Item(by='wolverine876', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606167249, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25190645, text='&gt; It&#x27;s extremely important to most people. We go out of our way to look good. Just look at any shopping street. Clothes, makeup, gyms, etc.<p>It&#x27;s a continuum, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s &#x27;extremely important&#x27; to many people at all in my experience.<p>Far more people are not shopping and don&#x27;t go to gyms, and shopping and gyms serve other purposes too. Also, when someone does those things to enhance appearance it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s &#x27;extremely important&#x27; to them; I watched a sporting event over the weekend, went grocery shopping, and I post on HN, but none of those tings are extremely important or even important to me (beyond avoiding starvation).<p>It&#x27;s not binary; humans cover a very wide range - much wider than you or I experience or imagine.')
