It&#x27;s unearned familiarity.<p>I mentioned your name to drop a hint at how I confirmed you and the person on the thread were the same person. Should have just been explicit about that. The hint in my mind is more obvious when communication is verbal and face to face but much of it is lost with text. My mistake. Apologies.')
