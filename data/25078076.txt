Should they be put in jail for attempted murder?</i><p>Are you equating being suspended off Twitter to being thrown in Jail? For the record, people commonly do get suspended for harassments for sending death threats to public figures. Unfortunately they aren&#x27;t as high profile as bannon, so they don&#x27;t get op-ed&#x27;s written about them.<p>&gt;<i>How about Kathy Griffin, who posted a video of herself beheading Trump in effigy?</i><p>Why would you bring up Kathy Griffin when she got Twitter account suspended as well for that stunt? The answer to your question is &quot;no I don&#x27;t think Bannon should get better treatment then Kathy Griffin&quot;.')
