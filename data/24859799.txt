Application developers won&#x27;t use an IDP that protects user data.  They want that data, that&#x27;s why they wrote their app!  Because nobody would use such an IDP (at least not without being forced to in order to be on a large platform), nobody will write such an IDP.<p>I&#x27;m actually working on an open-source IDP in my spare time, and to me this sounds like something to seriously consider doing right.  I appreciate the idea and the discussion.  I doubt anyone in the real world will care, though.  (Sometimes you need to get the early adopters that do care about these things, though :)')
