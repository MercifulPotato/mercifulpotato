Pro athletes can get away with so much, because they exercise. An average sedentary person will not have the same allowances.<p>Most pro athletes get fat and sick once they retire, because old food habits stay.<p>I had a friend who was in a soccer team for the uni. He was a really good and dedicated athlete. He ate a bucket of KFC and 1.5L of Coke (sugar version) almost every day. He was shredded with six pack abs.
