And IMO the biggest reason for that is because these problems aren&#x27;t AI problems, they&#x27;re product management, UI&#x2F;UX, development problems. If you have high quality user interaction, you can harness real quality data. Better data usually beats better algorithms. Not to mention all the time and effort saved in feature engineering. Instead of being a synchronized effort, it often feels like companies just take their useless slop and hand it over to their data scientists expecting them to churn out black magic.<p>And even if you don&#x27;t get useful data, at the very least you can  soften out a lot of the issues with integrating AI in a product. A few of the AI products I&#x27;ve seen give way too little control to the users and instead rely on opaque algorithms. Which is a very frustrating experience especially because those products will often charge a premium for the AI and try to create products where they wall you into their ecosystem and so it&#x27;s very difficult to maybe export to a different solution that might give the user more control.')
