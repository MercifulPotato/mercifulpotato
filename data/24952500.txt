The meaning could be just a statistical average, in some cases. But in any case when we say &quot;normal&quot; the receiving side of communication hears <i>all</i> meanings of a word &quot;normal&quot;. Even if the receiving side managed to filter irrelevant meanings of the word &quot;normal&quot; correctly, nevertheless all filtered meanings were heard.<p>Moreover in this particular case it is not just about statistical averages, it is about social norms which were built around statistical averages. So a normality in this case it is also the rights to have social norms to be built with a respect to my needs.')
