It&#x27;s about the cognitive dissonance caused by making the internals of our code for ourselves but then expecting all of the users to read - or more likely, step through - that code to figure out why it&#x27;s behaving oddly with empty strings.<p>What I&#x27;d like to see us do is to make the shape and contents of the stack frames one of the criteria by which we judge the quality of our code. This also affects the quality of the error stack traces, but it&#x27;s more of a &#x27;pro&#x27; than a reason.<p>Most of the time I&#x27;m only reading your (general you, not just API designers) because I am having an issue. It&#x27;s a basic psychological reaction that the people near a pleasant or unpleasant experience are partly blamed for that feeling. If I&#x27;m trying to be sympathetic to that, or my user, then I have to think about my code as something people mostly look at (and almost entirely remember) when they&#x27;re already having a bad day.<p>Any work I do to honor that relationship has often paid dividends the next time I&#x27;m having a hard day, and especially when we&#x27;re having a hard day together (eg, a production outage or a missed milestone)')
