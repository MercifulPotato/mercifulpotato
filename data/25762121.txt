If you&#x27;re LGBTQ, you find really wholesome content. If you&#x27;re depressed, you can find people being open about their depression. If you self-harm, you can find other people discussing and opening up about it. If you&#x27;re in a toxic household, there&#x27;s basically a whole support network for you. It&#x27;s an exceptionally human way to interact with people online, and it&#x27;s so much fun.<p>IMHO, TikTok has been the most wholesome social network I&#x27;ve ever used and participated in. Even as an adult (24yo), it&#x27;s even helped me explore my own identity and how I relate to the rest of the communities I&#x27;m a part of. Legitimately, TikTok has helped me feel comfortable opening up and be more &quot;myself&quot; in public.')
