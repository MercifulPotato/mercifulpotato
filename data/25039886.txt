I also appreciate the discussion. I understand people have different opinions or see the world different ways. I&#x27;d also like to try to understand that. I agree that&#x27;s really important.<p>I think there is often a tendency to see the other side as somehow brainwashed or ill informed and maybe that can be fixed. But maybe it&#x27;s less of that and more just different priorities.<p>From my perspective #1 was the removal of the neocon war machine. I don&#x27;t care about stupid, nonprofessional or offensive comments that offend &quot;nice&quot; people (well I do but not very much). I think some people even go a step further and actually like that. I think it&#x27;s a selling point to a certain crowd.<p>What the liberal prime minister of Canada thinks of the US, what nice people in Canada in offices engaged in upspeak and office talk think of the US is just not that important to me. Perhaps that is a personal failing but it&#x27;s just not. I have other higher priorities.<p>What is important to me is anyone who voted for the Iraq War, anyone who was a prosecutor in our justice system, anyone that has neocon &quot;democracy&quot; building tendencies or agendas to change the social fabric of the country through various engineering schemes is not given the levers of government. I regard both of those efforts as harmful and doomed to fail. So that&#x27;s first on my list.<p>There&#x27;s a lot more I could say, and I will. Let me read through your post again and think. Again, appreciate the chance to express myself without the flame-baiting. I actually had to close my real HN account just after the 2016 election the hatred was so intense. It looks like one can almost admit in polite company now though :)')
