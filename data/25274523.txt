This means there&#x27;s stuff that&#x27;s clearly lawful, stuff that&#x27;s clearly unlawful, and then a grey area where reasonable people can interpret the law in different ways and we need the courts to rule.<p>This works well when you have cases that go to court. But some tax authorities prefer a light-touch or right-touch regulatory approach, and so they prefer to persuade people to pay tax that&#x27;s owed and they leave court cases for the blatant offenders. That means we don&#x27;t get the case law.')
