Mixpanel it’s just one end-to-end suite, mostly behavioral data that is captured from user sessions or user derived events&#x2F;sub-events. Basically web analytics.<p>The whole point of data infrastructure is that sometimes you’re collecting data from the most random places. Many of that data is not necessarily user behavior. \nSometimes it’s things like temperatures, latencies, CPU usage or instrument tallies. Sometimes it’s a stream\nof minute to minute weather data or timings or anything, really. Besides many companies have been collecting data for decades but it all live in silos where it can’t be used for anything.<p>Mixpanel can’t capture all that data, or query it, or analyze it. \nMixpanel is just capturing a super small subset of web event data and it happens to provide an analysis suite on top that data they collect.<p>That’s why Segment shows up in this list instead. They help to move a lot of siloed data into a common systems.\nMixpanel is just another source of data. You need something like Snowflake to put everything together and be able to do queries across multiple datasets.')
