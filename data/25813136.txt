There are for example in org mode keyboard shortcuts for moving the current line up a line and down a line. Even before I saw vscode my reaction to learning about those 2 shortcuts was that such functionality would be useful (particularly in to-do lists), but I would prefer to execute the functionality by dragging with the mouse, which it turns out that vscode lets me do (in its default configuration): particularly, I click on the line&#x27;s line number to select the line (to set the mark and activate the region in Emacs terminology) then move the mouse cursor into the selection, then drag. (In emacs, I&#x27;d kill and yank to move a line relative to the other lines -- and I configured my emacs to have a menu on the right mouse button with the kill and yank actions on it.)<p>In general, vscode is a nice environment for keeping to-do lists. Consider for example this next small &quot;hierarchy&quot; of actions:<p><pre><code>  buy milk\n\n      drive to store\n\n          find car keys\n</code></pre>\nIf we replace &quot;find car keys&quot; above with a string of text too long to fit on one line, then the basic structure of the small hierarchy becomes obscured in Emacs (even with visual-line mode on) but not in vscode as I explain in greater detail here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25311743" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25311743</a>')
