Nor do they make the illness more severe nor otherwise affect clinical outcomes, nor make treatment any less effective.<p>People just love to talk up the discovery of new strains, thinking that coronavirus mutations are like flu mutations (which actually do require new vaccines every year), but they&#x27;re not.<p>Coronavirus strains are kept an eye on by scientists for the purpose of tracking the spread and origin of the disease, and there&#x27;ll always be one strain that will be more common than others, but it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s something we have to fear any more than any other strain.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;health-55308211" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;health-55308211</a><p>[2] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microbe.tv&#x2F;twiv&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microbe.tv&#x2F;twiv&#x2F;</a>')
