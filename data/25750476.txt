It&#x27;s very much a vendor lock-in tactic.<p>I would argue they actively make sure their compiler optimisation works <i>only</i> on Intel CPU. Which is actually a fair deal. Those optimisation work isn&#x27;t free.<p>It is BS tactics? Yes. \nDo I Like it ? No. \nIt is wrong to do it? That is up to debate.<p>The point is using an Intel Compiler on Non Intel CPU comparison makes the benchmarks pretty much useless. Something like GCC &#x2F; LLVM should have been used to be vendor neutral.')
