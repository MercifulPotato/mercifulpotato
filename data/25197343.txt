Many have said that this action is about removing him from his own project - it is not, it is a statement that he should not lead a collective project which he founded. He is a founder and a leader, not a king. He’s not even a BDFL. It is not disrespectful or unethical to espouse this view. I don’t think it’s necessarily disrespectful or unethical to oppose this view either, but it is disrespectful to the child victims of sex crimes to accuse the signatories of the statement of acting unethically or underhandedly.<p>It’s good that you don’t want them to leave GNU, but then asking ‘Why wouldn&#x27;t Guix just leave the RMS&#x27;s GNU Project then?’ seems strange - why would they indeed? I think it’s not unreasonable to take them at face value: they made a statement about their belief that the personal conduct of RMS made him unfit to lead the GNU Project.<p>For what it’s worth, RMS is someone who I think can change his mind when he believes he is honestly wrong, which is not something you always get with people in his position. This however doesn’t mean his statements should go uncriticised. Linus Torvalds is a gold standard here, where his professional conduct was called into question and he took a serious look at himself, made some changes to his behaviour, and came back stronger than ever. RMS could take a leaf out of his book.')
