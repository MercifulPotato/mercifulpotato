Short form TV will take a huge market share.<p>Quibi failed due to a content issue. This is hard. It takes a lot of money and a long time to pull this off. Pre-existing content is rarer.<p>It&#x27;s possible short form TV will come into play first going through places like Netflix. But if you wanted to own the market this was an ok attempt.<p>And yes forcing people to use phones and having different views was wrong. People want to be on a couch and passively watching TV but next week everyone on HN believes in VR. HN has no idea of the world and IT.')
