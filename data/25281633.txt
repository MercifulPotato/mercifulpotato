The problem is that people underestimate how often one-in-a-million chances happen, because they don&#x27;t think about how many times you actually roll for that one-in-a-million chance.<p>Take the Bulgaria example. How many lotteries are run around the world, such that we&#x27;d hear about a rare coincidence like this? Probably about a 1000 a week. So now the one-in-a-million chance is a one-in-a-thousand chance on a weekly basis, or put differently, we should expect to see it happen about every 20 years.')
