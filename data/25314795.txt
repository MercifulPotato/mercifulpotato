In transportation it&#x27;s significantly trickier to replace petrol-based fuels (<i>especially</i> for airplanes), but it&#x27;s straightforward enough in power plants.  And crucially, you can convert all the petrol-powered vehicles to EVs that you want, but if the electricity they&#x27;re getting from the wall is still provided by burning petroleum then you haven&#x27;t actually done that much.<p>Luckily, computation can for the most part be located anywhere (exactly the opposite of transportation), and thus you have a lot of data centers near hydro and other renewable sources so that they can use the cheapest green power available.')
