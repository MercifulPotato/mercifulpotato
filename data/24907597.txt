I took it up as a very awkward teenager, and it had incalculable benefits for my social comfort and development. And I&#x27;ve seen it do the same for others, beyond what might be expected for an athletic&#x2F;social hobby.<p>Part of the effect seems straightforward enough - self-confidence at gaining newfound abilities, exercise, socializing, maintaining emotional self-regulation while engaging in controlled &quot;fighting&quot;, etc.<p>But I think there is also something to the mere act of touching other humans and being touched several times a week. As the article suggests, it&#x27;s comforting, fulfilling a basic human need. I wonder how this all plays out in the brain - can someone with a neuroscience background comment? Is the sense of touch specifically connected to brain areas of social well-being?<p>Edit:<p>&quot;Many neuroscientists and psychologists believe that we have a dedicated system just for the perception of social – affective – touch distinct from the one that we use to touch objects. This system seems to be able to selectively recognise caress-like touch; this is then processed in the insula, a brain area connected to maintaining our sense of self and an awareness of our body. Slow, caress-like touch is not only important for our survival, but also for our cognitive and social development: for example, it can influence the way we learn to identify and recognise other people from early in life.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aeon.co&#x2F;essays&#x2F;touch-is-a-language-we-cannot-afford-to-forget" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aeon.co&#x2F;essays&#x2F;touch-is-a-language-we-cannot-afford-...</a>')
