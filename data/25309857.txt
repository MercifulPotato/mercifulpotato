Oh, and it might also be offensive to people in developing countries who can afford developed countries&#x27; lifestyles.<p>I may not agree with the usage either, but that&#x27;s what I see all around the third world countries that I&#x27;ve been to, and the one where I have lived since I was born. No one really cares, and no one is offended (except see previous paragraph).')
