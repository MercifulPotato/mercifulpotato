You need to cite a source.<p>&gt;It is, but it is still legally clearly defined who is consent and who is not, because of insanity etc. (the problems of this process is a seperate issue)<p>Durr. No. It&#x27;s not clear. Many countries have legal definitions of adult but many countries also have treatment and government rehabilitation plans in place for adults who act &quot;immature&quot; this includes crime and drug use. It is not clear at what age range does a human suddenly deserve zero treatment and enforcement.<p>&gt;But feel free to discuss your personal agenda of war on drugs with someone else.<p>Likely your personal clarity comes from the fact that you&#x27;re a drug user yourself. You have a personal agenda.<p>I have no agenda. If you want to shoot yourself with heroin and make it legal I honestly can care less. But what I came here to discuss is whether decriminalization is an effective deterrent or not. I may think it&#x27;s right or wrong to implement something but I personally don&#x27;t care whether it&#x27;s implemented in actuality because it doesn&#x27;t effect me personally at all. I am possibly the most unbiased person here because I have no foot in the game.<p>If you don&#x27;t have a personal agenda then I&#x27;m wrong. But tell me, do you use drugs yourself? Likely you do...<p>&gt;Drug taking is at most directly hurting yourself.<p>This is my entire argument. We protect kids from hurting themselves because they are immature. The question is why can&#x27;t we protect adults from hurting themselves because they are immature. That is the controversy.')
