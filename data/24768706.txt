Compare and contrast with 2008 for example, where the asset money creation was restricted to the asset side because it was used to take dodgy loans out of the banking system and put them into runoff.<p>As to why there isn&#x27;t much inflation yet, well there is. The stock market is considerably inflated due to this, and inflation will creep into the rest of the financial system over time, as this works its way into regulatory capital.<p>but tldr: it is absolutely printing money - arguably it was the only thing they could do at the time, and the European Central Bank has done similar although less dramatic things, but the longer term consequences will definitely be interesting.')
