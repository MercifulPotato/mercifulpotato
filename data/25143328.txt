Banks have obscene amounts of regulations, audits, compliance that would seem archaic and insane to most tech companies.  This is already baked into banks operating expenses and procedures.  Tech companies would have to take on massive amounts of cost and this would affect their reported earnings.  Then there is the aspect of operational speed, agility, speed of R&amp;D.  Banks move incredibly slow because of the compliance burdens, at least that was my experience.')
