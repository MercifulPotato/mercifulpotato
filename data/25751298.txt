Parler hosted people calling for specific acts of violence and did hardly anything to moderate them. Those people were almost entirely right wing and you can see for yourself looking through the data dumps provided recently by a hacker or looking up articles about Parler.<p>If you have evidence o some other app hosted on AWS where left wing groups calling for violence and applauding it when it materializes, but not being shut down, please show everyone. I won&#x27;t even go to the extreme of saying it has to be at the same level or quantity of violent speech we saw on Parler.')
