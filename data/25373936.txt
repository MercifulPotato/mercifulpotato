That seems to be the thing that we&#x27;ve had the most problem with: two people start talking and the combined audio is harder to understand over videoconferencing than in person.  But stereo output is pretty easy and nearly universally supported (one co-worker has a little puck-mic&#x2F;speaker that&#x27;s designed for conferencing and works pretty well, but has no stereo separation, for example).<p>This seems to take it to the next level.')
