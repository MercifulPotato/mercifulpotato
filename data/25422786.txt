However, I think too much of the discussion is around the negatives of major time zone differences. There&#x27;s also plenty of benefits<p>1) Oncall can be split, meaning you no longer have to fear being woken up in the middle of the night<p>2) Code is being pushed all the time, meaning less chances of merge conflicts and more version control happiness<p>3) Naturally, your employee base gets more diverse, and thus you&#x27;ll have more diversity of opinion and better products :)')
