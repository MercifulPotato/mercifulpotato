Trust is all or none. If you allow a switch in {x} country to connect to your switches, then they can spoof calls.<p>Why does the problem <i>have</i> to be tackled from the direction of extending the wire protocol? It seems like it would be straightforward to tackle it from the business end first: a major phone company declares that it will block spoofing on calls originating in its network, and will only accept calls coming into its network from partners who make the same commitment to not allow spoofed calls onto their networks. This doesn&#x27;t require any changes to the technology used to connect phone networks, just changes to the business arrangements (a threat of blacklisting).<p>(If you don&#x27;t want to take quite such a hardline approach, then require that all calls either originate from a network that is trusted to have valid caller ID data, or the caller ID data is stripped from the call. And then give all end users the option of blocking calls with blank caller ID.)')
