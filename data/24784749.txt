Age, medications, and infections may all lead to reduced stomach acid production, which leads to unwanted fermentation and impaired digestion of carbohydrates in the stomach, which increases the production of gas, which increases intra-abdominal pressure, which causes the lower esophageal sphincter to malfunction and let the little acid that is left travel up into the esophagus, where it irritates the lining and can cause symptoms like you describe.<p>Might be worth looking into. A simple way to test this theory would be to get a &quot;Betaine HCL with Pepsin&quot; supplement and take it with meals to see if that helps. Do not try this if you have ulcers or other issues with the integrity of your stomach lining.<p>I only mention it because this approach cured my persistent heartburn and sore throat issues, after various PPIs worked for a bit and then failed. Conventional medicine is great, but why they continue to recommend PPIs for chronic GERD cases is a mystery to me. The stomach is meant to be acidic - the goal should not be to neutralize the acid.<p>Good luck!')
