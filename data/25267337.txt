When I visited Pittsburgh last year, I only found one (!!!) downtown. It was a small hole-in-the-wall, dusty, and a disorganized mess — just how I like my bookstores to be. I bought a couple of books (I always buy books as souvenirs) and I tipped the owner, a young man, maybe in his 30s, an extra 20 dollars and he was surprised to hear that I wanted to support his store. I really hope it survives the pandemic. In West LA, where I live, bookstores are equally rare. With Borders shuttering it’s doors, and my local Barnes and Noble closing, there’s just one bookstore left in Santa Monica. This is sad, and maybe says more about our culture than it should.')
