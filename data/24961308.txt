It&#x27;s basically skipping breakfast. Shortening the eating window until you&#x27;re eating one meal a day is tougher. Then extending the fasting period &gt; 24 hrs is tougher still. You can&#x27;t just jump into this stuff while you&#x27;re carb-addicted and your body is screaming for glucose. Getting used to a keto-style diet, even if your carb intake is just low but not keto-low, helps a lot.')
