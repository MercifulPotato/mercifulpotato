Rather I think this is the influence of the &#x27;Anglosphere&#x27; online both in term of culture and of tech (for example in Spanish autocompletion could insert the opening marks but it&#x27;s probably often not even considered by the devs).<p>Perhaps the software culture has also changed. When people were mostly typing &quot;seriously&quot; in Word or email all the correct typography was implemented. For example Word selects the correct quotation marks automatically based on locale.<p>Twitter, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc. do not care. Just ship fast.')
