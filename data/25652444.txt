Our &quot;neighborhood&quot; is 14 homes on 1 1&#x2F;2 streets. A few years ago, the amazon sprinter van started making some some deliveries but fedex was more likely. Today not only does amazon exclusively deliver all their orders here, we&#x27;ve been upgraded to the larger boxy bread truck style van which makes deliveries to multiple homes in our micro neighborhood every day including Sunday.<p>All anecdotal but it seems like amazon has made huge progress in their delivery infrastructure in a short period of time.')
