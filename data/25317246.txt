Advice for beginning academics is filled with blog posts with titles like &quot;how to gut a book.&quot;<p>This continues even post tenure.  There are dozens to hundreds of important works on anything about which one might write; unless one wishes to publish one paper per five years, one continues one&#x27;s grad school habit of reading at breakneck speed and with a sense of panic about the possibility that more works on one&#x27;s subject are actually being published at the very moment that one is reading the previous literature.')
