The question implicitly suggests that there&#x27;s no definite answer when in fact it&#x27;s simply a question of fact, a knowledge question not a wisdom question. I feel that the person asking the question is somehow trying to shield themself from the &quot;shame&quot; of not knowing the answer by framing it as a request for discussion.')
