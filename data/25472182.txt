Of course, immune responses can cause long-term damage. So the question is: should we wait to find out?<p>The doses have 30-100 ug. Assume 1)this is pure RNA, and 2)the molecules are about the same size as the spike protein sequence. With these assumptions, a dose gives you 10^10 RNA molecules. Average sputum samples show about 10^6 molecules&#x2F;mL; max samples show 10^9&#x2F;mL. I don&#x27;t know how vaccines dilute when you inject it into somebody&#x27;s shoulder, but it doesn&#x27;t seem unreasonable to say the final conc will be between 10^6 and 10^9 RNA&#x2F;mL.<p>So RNA is going to be in us, whether we want it or not. The question is, do you want the whole genome, or part of the genome. I&#x27;m picking the one that doesn&#x27;t make more virus.')
