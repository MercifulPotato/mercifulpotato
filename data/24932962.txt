So even if we are off by nearly a factor of two, they are hardly raking it in.<p>By comparison if you are in larger firms, more of the hourly rate is captured but it is also paying for multiple people.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there are lawyers out there making great money (e.g. partners in those same NYC biglaw firms).  But thinking that is the experience of the average lawyers is a bit like looking at levels.fyi and deciding that all over the country most software engineers are making 250k+.')
