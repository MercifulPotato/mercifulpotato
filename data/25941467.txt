Item(by='that_guy_iain', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611840499, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25941421, text='&gt; Why do you separate users of &#x2F;r&#x2F;wsb from traders and hedge funds, as if those are different people? My guess is that majority of users there are traders and employees of such funds, simply using yet another talking space.<p>Because the subreddit is famous for just losing money and lots of people just not knowing what they&#x27;re doing. I&#x27;m sure there are a few traders on that reddit but I suspect it&#x27;s like a professional programmer joining a dev bootcamp community. A whole bunch of people who are just learning and are doing crazy things. (I did crazy things when I was learning, hell, I sometimes do crazy things now)')
