The issue with full rewrites is that you have to rewrite everything - which I suppose sounds good to some engineers, but I dread being forced to spent weeks on parts of the product that are not an issue.  Usually you do the rewrite to make things faster, more maintainable, and easier to add features.  The issue is, the larger the rewrite, the worse you make all those things in the short-term.')
