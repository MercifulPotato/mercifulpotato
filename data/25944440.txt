Cannabis is not a good drug for such coping because with sustained heavy use it will inevitably lose it&#x27;s efficacy.  When a well adjusted healthy person develops a cannabis tolerance, they can take a break for a few weeks to reset their tolerance.  Not a big deal.  But somebody who&#x27;s using cannabis to cope?  Going sober for a few weeks may be intolerable, but weed is no longer helping them, so many turn to another drug.  Consider that coping with problems instead of addressing them directly often leads to worse outcomes in the long run, since many problems can get worse the longer you ignore them.  This makes the apparent need for another drug feel even stronger in this sort of person.<p>In brief, cannabis cannot solve your problems and trying to mask your problems with cannabis is often the start of a downward spiral.')
