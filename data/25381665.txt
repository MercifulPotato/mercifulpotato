Just tonight I picked up an open-box samsung galaxy tablet from the store down the street from me.  Discounted by nearly half, in like-new condition, and if there&#x27;s anything wrong with it I can return it back to the store, instead of having to ship it back to an online retailer.<p>I have likewise been impressed with the blue-shirts in the stores. They seem generally on par with Microcenter employees nowadays, with more than enough technical knowledge to help me make buying decisions.')
