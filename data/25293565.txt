Look at how many Parkinson&#x27;s related deaths there were per year per 100k over the last 50 years, it&#x27;s been ever increasing, same with cancer. When I have to pick between &quot;this is complete coincidence and out of our control&quot; and &quot;this might be because of some chemical we started using excessively for a dozen different things during the last century&quot; I know what my choice will be.<p>And I do see the problem that there are too many possibilities here to make an educated guess, and it&#x27;s possible that PFAS and whatever is in detergent ultimately doesn&#x27;t cause any significant harm to you, but my choice has simply been to change my everyday behavior in minor ways where it might have a positive impact in the best case, and worst case is placebo for peace of mind and will cost me a bit of time and convenience. Hope that cleared things up.')
