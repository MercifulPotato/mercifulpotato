Item(by='anonymouszx', descendants=None, kids=[24818630], score=None, time=1603029487, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24817114, text='&gt; Tor pretends to be secure, but is dark and compromised.<p>Citation needed. Please stop with the &quot;tor is compromised&quot; meme... and what do you even mean by &quot;dark&quot;? What the hell... Tor is by no means a perfect anonymity solution but it&#x27;s to my knowledge the best we&#x27;ve got. It&#x27;s certainly way better than a VPN or no anonymization at all.<p>More specifically, tor anonymity is limited by the fact that it&#x27;s low-latency. This is a fundamental limitation of any low-latency transport layer and not the fault of the tor developers or any obscure forces. In particular, if your attacker has control of both your entry point (your tor guard node or your ISP) and your exit point (tor exit node, or the tor hidden service or website you are connecting to) , it becomes possible to de-anonymize your connection (to the specific exit point in question) through traffic analysis. There&#x27;s just no way around that for a network meant to transport real-time traffic (as opposed to plain data or email for instance). And yes, it stands to reason that various intelligence agencies will have invested in running exit nodes or entry nodes but this is just unavoidable. What you can do counteract this is to run your own nodes or to donate to (presumably) trustworthy node operators.<p>I think it&#x27;s also worth noting that although tor can by no means 100% guarantee that you will be free from government surveillance at all times, it does make mass surveillance more difficult and more error-prone, and to me that&#x27;s the whole point. Furthermore, although government surveillance cannot be thwarted 100%, tor does make corporate surveillance basically impossible (assuming you can avoid browser fingerprinting; this is what the tor browser is for).<p>All in all, I can&#x27;t claim tor is perfect (because it can&#x27;t be!) but the more people use it the better it gets and it&#x27;s certainly better than anything else, so please stop spreading FUD and encourage people to use it instead.<p>Also, it&#x27;s unclear to me how Stealth helps at all with hiding the IP addresses of its participants... It claims to be &quot;private&quot; but the README doesn&#x27;t say anything about network privacy...')
