I gave it a shot but couldn&#x27;t get into it 100%. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s bad. In my experience of mostly frontend work, I give vim #1, Code #2, and JetBrains x edition #3.<p>Something about Code just works well for me for Typescript&#x2F;Vue frontend work. But TBH I haven&#x27;t tried TS in JetBrains. All I know is all the main TS devs seem to use Code and all the latest and greatest plugins get there first. It takes quite some time for them to filter down to Vim&#x27;s community.<p>Maybe I&#x27;ll give it another shot one day as TS matures.')
