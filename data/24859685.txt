Item(by='throw_m239339', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603383515, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24859462, text='&gt; I am gobsmacked that Twitter allowed his account to continue without some kind of additional security measures like 2FA or geo-IP checking. This is a guy that could literally start World War III by sending a tweet like, &quot;Eat shit, China! Missiles on their way!&quot; And Twitter didn&#x27;t think it should be locked down beyond a simple password!?!<p>I mean remember how bitcoin scammers got access to Twitter admin panels recently? I don&#x27;t think security is Twitter&#x27;s biggest concern... My old Twitter account has been hacked by a Russian spammer despite having 2FA, I just decided to close it, it became a liability.')
