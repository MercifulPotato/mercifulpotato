If the situation gets out of hand, then the police can call in the SWAT.<p>But we shouldn&#x27;t be expect regular beat cops and detectives to be the people kicking down doors with bullet proof vests. The two jobs require very different skillsets and temperaments. Unfortunately because of the long-running wars in the Middle East, the US has no shortage of combat veterans with experience in these types of urban warfare situations. I&#x27;d definitely a trust a SWAT department filled with ex-special forces more than I&#x27;d trust a small-town cop LARPing in military gear.<p>The second benefit is that a lot of times, I think police start itching to break out the military gear because they have it and think it looks cool. By separating the departments, it removes that incentive. They&#x27;re not going to hesitate calling in SWAT, when the situation&#x27;s genuinely dangerous. But they&#x27;re going to think about letting an outside agency step on their turf for everyday situations.')
