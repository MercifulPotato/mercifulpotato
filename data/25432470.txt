I&#x27;ve definitely run into extension issues on mobile that don&#x27;t exist on desktop.<p>I also only run two: Dark Reader, and uBlock Origin. It&#x27;s uBlock that I find causes rendering issues on some releases of the Android app, but I haven&#x27;t seen that happen in a while.<p>The only thing I do find painful was the app redesign removing the feature to clear all tabs on close-swiping the app. You can clear all tabs by selecting &#x27;Quit&#x27; from the menu, but it&#x27;s a hassle. I wish we could drop the forced tab persistence when closing the app as a setting, like used to be the case.')
