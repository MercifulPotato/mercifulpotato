As someone who takes privacy and security very seriously, I felt extremely uncomfortable generating passwords over closed source, online tools. That&#x27;s why I created SGen Libre, which is designed to be a quick and convenient way to generate passwords on GNU&#x2F;Linux without having to worry about backdoors of any kind.<p>SGen Libre works completely offline, and has no dependence on any third party services. It&#x27;s written entirely in Python, and is properly commented with full documentation, making it easy for even those less experienced with coding to modify it to fit their needs. Unlike many existing password generators on Linux, I tried to make SGen Libre as simple as possible. While you lose the ability to generate passwords using it from the command line, you gain the ability to easily configure the parameters that will be used to generate your passwords in an easy to understand GUI interface. SGen Libre also comes built in a several tools that can be used to analyse basic characteristics of generated passwords, including length, unique character count, and how many other passwords share the length and number of characters as yours.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in giving it a try, I would really appreciate any feedback you can provide!<p>If you use MacOS, you can also try SGen Desktop, which is a very similar program for MacOS (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;v0lttech.com&#x2F;sgendesktop.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;v0lttech.com&#x2F;sgendesktop.php</a>)')
