It is understandable that the government would eventually use AML against Bitcoin mixing services. But how will the government go after cryptocurrencies that have mixing and transaction obfuscation built into their protocols?<p>I&#x27;ve heard the argument that it is impossible for the US Government to regulate decentralized cryptocurrencies. FinCEN cannot force a change in the Bitcoin or Monero protocols. However it is entirely within the government&#x27;s authority to regulate the users of said currencies. So I imagine the government would add onerous reporting requirements for any citizen or corporation holding privacy based coins in order to circumvent their privacy features.')
