Consider the following hypothetical:<p>Suppose the Big Tech companies are far-right instead of left. Instead of banning racism and insurrection, they are banning people calling for higher taxes on the wealthy and UBI. Twitter censors posts by supporters and politicians like Bernie Sanders. In response, Sanders supporters create an alternate social network like a liberal Parler, but it gets removed from the App Store and deactivated by AWS.<p>In this scenario people wouldn&#x27;t be saying &quot;freedom of speech is freedom from compelled speech; you can say what you want but you just need to create your own platform &#x2F; internet; etc.&quot; There would be legislation drafted aimed at breaking up or regulating these near-monopolistic private companies. The argument that private companies can censor what they want works with small businesses and competitive environments, but not when private companies essentially control the #1 means of communication.<p>To be clear, I <i>don&#x27;t</i> believe that violent insurrectionists should get a platform. I <i>don&#x27;t</i> believe that racists and bigots should get a platform. I don&#x27;t even support this bill because it&#x27;s way too broad. But the amount of people supporting this argument - that private companies with near-monopolies on a means of communication, can control and censor said communication however they want - is crazy.')
