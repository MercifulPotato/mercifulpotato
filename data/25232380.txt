Most people never choose the relocation package, and so a big chunk of black employees end up quitting. That&#x27;s the event that triggered 8 black employees of the 15 who left as I understand it from the article.<p>&gt; what are your priors on whether or not a given company engaged in discrimination, and how do these change if you&#x27;re told 75% of employees of a particular demographic stated there was discrimination?<p>I completely agree that it&#x27;s a very bad look. It is probably even more likely than not that given those facts, it is due to racism. I guess the question comes down to, philosophically, how one answers the following question: In the quest to eradicate racism and racists, is it better to be over-zealous and destroy a few non-racists to make sure you get all the actual racists(the chemo approach) - or is it better to be slightly more circumspect and let a few racists slip through the cracks so that far fewer non-racists are punished (the US judicial system <i>ideal</i>)?')
