If you can get a 4% lift in sales by using a complicated ML model with 100k features instead of a handful of basic heuristics, then whether it&#x27;s worth spending engineering effort on depends on what your sales are.<p>[0] Inefficient in the sense that they&#x27;re wasting money which could be easily reclaimed - they&#x27;re probably going to be improved over time as the state of the art improves, but that relies on the whole field moving forward.')
