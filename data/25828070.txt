Advertisers set the guidelines, and they include many things common to the right wing narrative.<p>&gt;I&#x27;d argue that the current incarnation of the Democratic Party is incredibly far left, and it has plenty of financial support.<p>Note that I called the far left &quot;socialism,&quot; and that neither Biden nor the Democratic party strongly support socialized healthcare, something common worldwide. The Democratic party isn&#x27;t remotely far left, it&#x27;s center left at best.')
