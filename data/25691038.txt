I&#x27;m one of the people that values the chat history. Mostly as there are often occasions where I would look up something like a product or a website someone sent me. Also for nostalgia.<p>It would be perfectly fine if exporting&#x2F;importing chat history would be a manual process via encrypted files and if it was disable by default. But not having it at all is an issue for me.<p>That said: It isn&#x27;t exactly easy with other messengers. WhatsApp does have some backup&#x2F;restore. But afaik it is limited to the platform you are using (Android or iPhone). The export is limited and cannot be imported again. Telegram has all the messages on their servers... which... ah well, let&#x27;s just leave it at that.<p>Makes me think that I need some private third party database that just ingests and consolidates all my chat data for me. With something like that it might be okay just having a few days worth of chat history on the phone.')
