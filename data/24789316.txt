It&#x27;s very type safe.<p>Nim being able to compile to Javascript and, say, C means you can write your server and web client in the same language. This means you can share code between client and server which is particularly handy for having modules with type declarations imported by both for example, so you have a unified place to update them.<p>You also get to use Nim&#x27;s strong type guarantees and metaprogramming when outputting Javascript. An example of why this is useful is generating say, RPC calls from a static JSON file that are automatically unified between server and client.')
