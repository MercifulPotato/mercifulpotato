If the electricity was stored at 40% efficiency, that means I&#x27;m getting back 108% of the energy if combusting iron is used to store the energy!<p>Note: Where I live we have an old oil plant that only runs during cold snaps; and a newer gas plant next to it that runs when renewables are scarce.')
