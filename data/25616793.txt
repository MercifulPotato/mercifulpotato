Are some of those missing?<p>&gt; <i>Further, it appears that only official LineageOS versions are taken into account</i><p>That&#x27;s correct. There are of course many more roms available on xda, unofficial lineage roms and other projects, but for one I do not know a structured way to list them, and second I think that if one decides on a device it should be based on official support by a bigger project.<p>If there are more of those bigger projects that should be listed (and that have a list of devices they support published somewhere) I&#x27;m happy to add them to the list. It does not have to be only MoKee and LineageOS.')
