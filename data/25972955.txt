I just checked the price for insuring a 2019 Mercedes-Benz E-Class (hybrid). It was 1350 €&#x2F;year or 2100 €&#x2F;year if I choose the premium coverage options. For a 2019 Tesla Model 3, the same prices were 2030 €&#x2F;year and 2670 €&#x2F;year.<p>2019 Tesla Model S was even worse at 2400 €&#x2F;year and 3260 €&#x2F;year. Model S is definitely more expensive than an E-Class, so I also compared to a 2019 Mercedes-Benz S-Class (hybrid), which was about 16,000 € more expensive to buy than the Model S. Got 1920 €&#x2F;year and 3060 €&#x2F;year.<p>(Premium coverage options were parking coverage, glass insurance, better write-off compensation and temp car coverage.)')
