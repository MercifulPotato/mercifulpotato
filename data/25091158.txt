I personally prefer 3NF tables, event streams or Kimball, in that order, as solutions to create a better DW.  The reality is ugly behavior in data modeling can be overcome by Analysts &amp; BI tools.  And that seems to be the norm these days...use a DW to structure data to make data accessible, then let Analysts figure out the metrics.  With the recent emphasis on tools like Looker or Tableau, this pattern seems to be working.')
