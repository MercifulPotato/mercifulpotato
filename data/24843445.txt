Everything now will use the GPU from web browsing to full on video&#x2F;photo editing and color correction. Your 2012 GPU might as well be hanging out with Moses its so old in GPU years. The speed difference you&#x27;ll see in a photo edit standpoint will justify your upgrade. If you are even halfway serious about using Resolve, you cannot put enough GPU power in a box. (I&#x27;ve built Resolve desktop systems with 3 GPUs in a Mac PCIe external chasis. PCs&#x2F;Linux Resolve systems can have even more GPUs.)')
