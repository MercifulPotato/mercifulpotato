High availability represents architectural decisions to maintain operation in the face of subsystem failures. With respect to high availability within a data center, this can be achieved with a passive secondary system and a mechanism to failover to this secondary in the face of a primary failure.<p>Such an HA strategy is valid, but provides no horizontal scalability.<p>Scalability is the ability to serve more traffic. Scaling horizontally implies adding hardware.<p>Though the HA example given above includes additional hardware compared to a single primary node, it does not support any additional traffic. Scaling would imply that the addition of the secondary server allows the system to serve more traffic.')
