I can&#x27;t say if it will or won&#x27;t be handled properly, because I never tested it, but roughly you have three options:<p>a) software ignores it, and your clock is a second behind as of the discontinuity, and adjusts eventually<p>b) software handles it properly and jumps ahead<p>c) software handles it by explicitly dithering the difference over a day<p>d) c, but it also jumps ahead at the discontinuity<p>e) your network has a mix of b, c, and d, resulting in wonky clocks throughout the day, but generally still +&#x2F;- 1 second of real time. This could be problematic for forensics, or for distributed software that uses time as measured on nodes to determine order of operations, but using time as measured on nodes requires constant vigilence to ensure clocks are in sync enough.<p>An added leap second is a lot trickier because at least Linux and FreeBSD simply repeat the last second of the minute at the discontinuity if you don&#x27;t take special action to dither it. That brings two new problems:<p>a) real time is no longer monotonic<p>b) a logic error can result in repeating that second forever')
