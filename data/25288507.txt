Any monetization strategy will lead to conflicts of interest and poor decisions along the way.<p>For example, adspace is the biggest offender in terms of cripling browser resource overload.  If they implemented, say a 500kb cap for JS in IFRAME, and disabled JS entirely for IFrames more than two layers in HTML&gt;IFRAME&gt;IFRAME get JS, another layer doesn&#x27;t... that would be a massive boost to actual performance, especially in low-resource devices.<p>Unfortunately, such limitations will <i>NEVER</i> be implemented by Google, and Firefox getting most of their funding from Google as well won&#x27;t do it.  MS might, but I don&#x27;t see them making those kinds of changes in their fork.<p>Even as a separate entity, Chrome would have to get funding from somewhere.  Also, where would ChromeOS fall, or Android?  What would stop Google from forking and starting all over again?')
