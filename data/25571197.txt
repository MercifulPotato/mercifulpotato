Worse, when I did get my hearing checked, the supposed test for difficulty picking up speech against background noise was terribly and obviously flawed.  They used a very short (few seconds) clip that looped.  My brain quickly learned the loop and subtracted it.  What I can&#x27;t do is filter out <i>unpredictable</i> background noise.  Plus the lab is an idealized environment without distractions.<p>Want to accurately test it?  Put me in the lobby of your hearing center with a wall phone and try to have a conversation with me, it would be immediately apparent.  Of course they won&#x27;t do that (too many uncontrolled variables) but they could at least <i>try</i> to make the test more lifelike.<p>It&#x27;s very frustrating because I feel like if I could get a formal diagnosis I could ask for accommodations at work like not using the telephone for support calls (email and instant message instead).<p>It also makes relationships difficult; I&#x27;ve been married four years and my wife is only now starting to actually understand and believe me when I say I didn&#x27;t hear what she said (vs just not caring &#x2F; not listening).<p>I feel like if I could say up front, &quot;I have a diagnosed condition that affects my hearing,&quot; I could avoid a lot of problems and confusion.  Unfortunately I can&#x27;t seem to get a diagnosis.')
