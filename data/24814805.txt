What is interesting there that MIPS introduced BALIGN instruction which reminds me of first generation of Alpha ISA.<p>Alpha did not had byte or word (16-bit) memory access. These should be provided using 32-bit word access and some shuffling. They walked back on that for code size reasons and later Alpha ISAs had byte and 16-bit loads and stores. I do not have reference ready but I believe they were aligned accesses.')
