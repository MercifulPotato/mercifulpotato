We used our military to kill iraqis, syrians, libyans, vietnamese, etc.<p>If chinese did 1&#x2F;100th of what we did, hypocrites would be crying they were the most evil nation on earth.<p>We have nukes to deal with china. We don&#x27;t have armies to deal with china. They&#x27;ve got 1.4 billion people.<p>Pretty much all our wars have been offensive wars of conquest&#x2F;genocide&#x2F;domination. But yeah, it&#x27;s china that&#x27;s the bad guy.<p>Can you think of the last defensive war we&#x27;ve fought? Even ww2 wasn&#x27;t really a defensive war as we already attacked japan with sanctions.<p>Edit:<p>&gt; China is not yet strong enough to do that outright with the west like it does within Asia and its maritime claims.<p>Within Asia? Are you saying it&#x27;s china that has troops in korea, japan, etc? It isn&#x27;t china that colonized philippines, indonesia, india, etc. Lets be honest here, asia isn&#x27;t in need of liberation from china, it&#x27;s in need of liberation from the west. Just think about it.<p>&gt; With the west, it has taken on a different approach: infiltrate all levels of political, educational, and corporate institutions.<p>Is that why everyone has a good opinion of china? China has infiltrated everything, that&#x27;s why we started a trade war with china? If anything, I could understand if you said israel or saudi arabia has infiltrated all levels. But certainly not china or russia.<p>When it comes to china, all I see is projection. Everything we are accusing china of doing, we are guilty of. We are the ones who invaded and brutalized asia ( including china, india, etc ). We are ones that invaded and occupied. And as best as I can tell, it&#x27;s us who are meddling in chinese affairs and telling them what they should do or not do.<p>Edit1:<p>&gt; I can&#x27;t name another empire or superpower in human history that has shown more restraint.<p>Is this a joke? We wiped out an entire continent full of people. Dozens of native nations were exterminated. We dropped nukes on civilians. That&#x27;s restraint? And we&#x27;ve been involved in wars in every corner of the earth. What amazing restraint.<p>For those hypocrites downvoting me, try replacing US with china for every historical act. 9&#x2F;11 happens and china invades afghanistan and iraq murdering hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians. I bet every hypocrite downvoting would call them monsters.')
