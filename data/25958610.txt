If a couple of billionaires hadn&#x27;t funded efforts with very generous personal donations there would be almost no SETI at all.<p>And if SETI had been funded properly - which would still be a drop in the ocean compared to other government spending, nationally and internationally - we&#x27;d have more observations to draw on from other sources.<p>This is all quite strange considering how much of a game changer and scientific motivator evidence of ETI would be.')
