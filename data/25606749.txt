No one is saying ban everything offensive. But many people, including me, will think twice about buying anything called &quot;Amphetamine&quot;. I also wouldn&#x27;t buy anything with &quot;Cannabis&quot; in the name. Both may have good uses but they are still narcotics which are most well known for being recreationally abused. Everything can have a good use. But that doesn&#x27;t mean everything is the same or is going to be treated the same by people.<p>Names matter, they are signals meant for humans to understand in specific ways. And names which refer to taboo or suggestive topics are going to prick up the ears of some customers and turn others away. Names related to drugs, sex, etc. are going to turn off many customers (especially those with kids), enough for stores to have policies against them. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.')
