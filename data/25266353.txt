Nonetheless, most people don&#x27;t expect to monetize their hobbies but somehow, at least in the context of somewhere like HN, a lot of people seem to expect that any personal project has to be a side hustle.<p>As to other comments about &quot;having something to say,&quot; I&#x27;d just observe that many of the earliest blogs and proto-blogs (think  Jerry Pournelle&#x27;s Chaos Manner column in Byte) were basically just journals. Not everything has to be great thought.')
