Recent Windows 10 version have a feature called &#x27;Controlled folder access&#x27; where you can designate certain folders as being protected (besides the Windows system folders). If any non-whitelisted application attempts to access these folders, you get a notification and their access is blocked by default. You can then whitelist the application if you want to grant it access.<p>It&#x27;s more course-grained than fully sandboxes application, but it&#x27;s a nice extra layer of defense for application that do not use sandboxing by default with a portal-based mechanism to request access to certain files&#x2F;folders.<p>There is more information here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows&#x2F;security&#x2F;threat-protection&#x2F;microsoft-defender-atp&#x2F;controlled-folders" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows&#x2F;security&#x2F;threat-pro...</a><p>(This should be fairly easy to implement in Linux with a MAC framework like AppArmor&#x2F;SELinux or perhaps eBPF. But it&#x27;s not useful for most people until someone actually implements this in a user-friendly manner.)')
