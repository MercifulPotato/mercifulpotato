I&#x27;m not saying that the void doesn&#x27;t exist, it&#x27;s just that the void currently is too big and all solutions are nowhere near filling the void.<p>With a whiteboard my experience is that everyone can pick up a pen and start contributing immediately.<p>Some times, to be able to discuss your problem space you need to remove all distractions.<p>I have had countless amazing meetings where we leave technology at the desk and sit down in a meeting room with a huge whiteboard and map everything out.<p>Heck, I even asked for a whiteboard to be installed in my office just to draw things out whenever I need to explain something.<p>It is even good for personal stuff.
