Yes, the bug is egregiously bad, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s likely the developer purposely designed it to work like that. Some simple possibilities: (a) perhaps the page was originally intended only to be accessible from a user hitting from a private link sent to their email address (i.e. how normal password resets work, or (b) The API in use was designed to only be accessed server-side, but it was inadvertently proxied through to a client-side call.<p>Again, yes, the bug is very bad. Software is complex, and humans are humans, and it&#x27;s not difficult to imagine how these bugs occur.')
