Item(by='throwaway894345', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604340899, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24967925, text='In my mind, one of the big (but seldomly discussed) pros for using AWS and especially their high-level services (especially WRT containers) is that they allow rank-and-file developers to do a lot more of the work that was traditionally considered &#x27;ops&#x27;. This is advantageous because developer teams don&#x27;t need to coordinate with a single ops team when they need something, which allows the whole organization to be more agile. Another advantage is that you don&#x27;t have to hire and develop a high functioning ops competency in your business--you can outsource much of that to AWS and focus your time&#x2F;resources on more valuable opportunities (in general, I wish the on-prem side of the debate would acknowledge opportunity costs in their talking points).')
