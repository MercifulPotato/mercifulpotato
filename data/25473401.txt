Even your own experiences! The world is a very big place. The few different jobs I&#x27;ve worked over the past, say... 5 years... I&#x27;ve seen lots of places that were Dell from door to door, a mix of Macbooks and Surface, all Macbooks but a few had Surface as personal&#x2F;toys, etc. At some places, they are popular and I think when you see them all the time you&#x27;re more likely to buy one yourself. When no one you know has one you&#x27;re less likely to get one. So it&#x27;s helpful to dig up sales statistics if you can find them...<p>Perhaps the closest thing to a Zune that Microsoft makes today is the Surface Duo. It&#x27;s very expensive with nice hardware, but the initial launch got some bad press from mediocre software. The software has likely gotten a lot better over time, so it will be interesting to see a version 2 here. But no one will be buying a $1400 Zune :)')
