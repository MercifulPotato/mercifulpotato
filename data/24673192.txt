Marijuana definitely makes me feel stupider, but it slows my brain down enough that I can actually focus on one thing at a time so I actually end up more productive overall. Kind of a worse is better situation. I&#x27;ve found the best combination for me to be XR Adderall with a very low dose of THC. Unfortunately my addictive personality makes not abusing marijuana difficult, so I just don&#x27;t use it these days.')
