I just don&#x27;t think it has anything to do with the web.<p>When people brought up replacing the Flash runtime with the web, there were two things being claimed:<p>A) that the platform itself could handle all of the technical requirements of Flash<p>and<p>B) that tools would exist that replaced Flash.<p>I believe that the first claim mostly came true, that the web today is about as powerful as Flash was. The second claim never even came close to happening. A lot of platforms exist that export to the web, but even the really popular ones like Unity just don&#x27;t feel the same. Unity is, unfortunately, not an adequate substitute for Flash.<p>And I think that&#x27;s a real tragedy, but I feel like we&#x27;re at a point where the web should be left out of the conversation. There are game-related APIs that I want on the web, but for the most part there is nothing that browser makers can do to solve your problem.<p>Someone has to make a development environment. It&#x27;s a separate problem. The web today is capable of doing the stuff you want it to do, but there is no development environment that replaces Flash.<p>And that&#x27;s kind of revealing because it&#x27;s not just that there isn&#x27;t a web-compatible alternative to Flash, or there isn&#x27;t an Open Source alternative. <i>Proprietary</i> game engines that aren&#x27;t even targeting the web are not as good as Flash was for rapid content prototyping. Why can&#x27;t anyone, commercial or Open Source, build a Flash replacement for any platform&#x2F;runtime? That&#x27;s the conversation we need to be having, not whether or not the web is mature enough as a runtime.')
