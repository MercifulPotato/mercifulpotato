Item(by='pratik661', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604208551, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24956483, text='The context behind the specific passage referred to in the show (about the races baked in the oven) is that it is a conversational exchange (banter, if you will) between an Indian and a Briton. I believe the protagonist of that passage was &quot;throwing shade&quot; at the Briton after he makes a haughty statement.<p>This entire exchange sounds ridiculously stupid and implausible to us now. However, in the 1940s (I think thats when the protagonist of the passage is from), casual racism towards Indians made that a plausible situation. I think this aphorism dates back to the 1930s&#x2F;40s as a standard reply to casual racism from Europeans. Its obviously outdated (and racist) in today&#x27;s context. However to claim that this is a &quot;lesson taught in Indian schools&quot; is a mischaracterization.')
