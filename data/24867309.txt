It isn&#x27;t impossible... wind speed and turbine size have an exponential relationship to power generated.<p>This site has various maps of average wind speeds at 30m: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;windexchange.energy.gov&#x2F;maps-data?category=residential" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;windexchange.energy.gov&#x2F;maps-data?category=residenti...</a><p>Parts of the bay are are in the 5-5.5 range, which is only around 18km&#x2F;h. That isn&#x27;t a huge amount of power - assuming you could get permission to put up a 30m tall pole (LOL not a chance).<p>If you live in the sticks and if your location happens to have good average wind speeds this can be useful but as I noted: wind generation is not linear scaling like solar. You get exponentially more energy as you scale up wind. Solar is probably a much better fit for almost everyone at the residential and small commercial level. Solar is basically not sensitive to height at all. Solar can be deployed at small but useful scales and expanded over time.')
