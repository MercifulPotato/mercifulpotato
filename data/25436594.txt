Facebook absolutely could keep the data within the EU, they just think it&#x27;s more profitable to move <i>UK</i> user data to California. Now, it&#x27;s a valid question as to why the UK would allow their constituents most personal data to be transferred out of their jurisdiction, but that&#x27;s up to the UK government. Facebook exists in hundreds of jurisdictions, it&#x27;s not rare for them to move user data out of a jurisdiction or intio a jurisdiction. It&#x27;s almost unique that a govenrment encourages that by reducing regulation though.')
