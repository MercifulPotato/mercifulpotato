I live in Philadelphia, a fairly large city that&#x27;s still extremely walkable in certain parts.<p>Before I moved recently, I was paying around $900&#x2F;month for a studio apartment in the city center. From there, it was a short walk to any number of nearby restaurants (including a corner store on my block), a &lt;5 minute walk to the nearby commuter rail station, a &lt;10 minute walk to the nearby city subway station, a &lt;15 minute walk to a major regional hospital, and about a 30 minute walk to my office (this was generally the longest trip I&#x27;d have to make with any frequency, and honestly a walking commute was pretty nice). I did keep my car around largely because I have friends and family outside the city, but if it weren&#x27;t for that it would largely not be necessary. Within the city, the subway system gets you pretty far outside of the immediate walkable area near my old apartment; my only complaint is that there are parts of the city that aren&#x27;t as well-connected by public transit.<p>Philadelphia is an extremely human-centric city, which makes sense as it was established well before cars were invented.')
