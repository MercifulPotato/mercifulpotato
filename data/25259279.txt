Charging because the traffic is unbalanced, even though it&#x27;s the ISP&#x27;s customers requesting the data?  What, they&#x27;d peer for free if netflix clients <i>uploaded</i> 5mbps of random data so that uplink and downlink are perfectly matched?<p>So sure, Netflix and Google are a monopolistic threat in other areas.  But when it comes to ISPs getting into conflicts, it&#x27;s almost always the ISPs in the wrong.')
