When using gas I would often turn the stove on as I finished chopping vegetables to let it preheat, but after burning a few things on the induction cooktop I realized I need to have everything ready to go in.<p>Other trouble I had was largely due to the Ikea Tillreda cooktop I purchased first; it only has ten temperature settings which made it difficult or impossible to find the correct setting when sauteeing. The second cooktop I purchased was a Duxtop model which has twenty temperature settings which seems to work just fine, and the Ikea cooktop still finds use boiling water and other tasks where precise temperature control does not matter.<p>Another problem that I have with both cooktops is that the actual heated area of the pan is only about 6&quot; in diameter, whereas it seems to be common for a full size induction range or cooktop to have at least one 12&quot; element. This is more noticeable than with a standard electric stove because the heated area on induction comes up to temperature almost immediately whereas the unheated areas of the pan take a long time to warm up through conduction.<p>Edit: I should add in case the above sounds negative that I love using induction and can&#x27;t wait to have a full size version! The digital control and fast heating give me better consistency and less time standing around waiting than gas. I would however recommend that anyone thinking about switching to induction first buy a portable unit to try out as decent ones are well under $100.')
