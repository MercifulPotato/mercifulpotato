Sites like Twitter and Facebook are of unprecedented historical size. Nobody really worried about whether some little discussion forum allows free speech or censors itself. But Twitter and Facebook want to become &quot;the world&#x27;s discussion forum&quot;, and I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s even a thing that should exist. You can&#x27;t really have free speech if there&#x27;s only a small number of platforms for speech.')
