My understanding is, that CentOS will be exactly in the middle ground between Fedora and Red Hat. So it will be ahead of Red Hat a bit, which is a good thing if you want more current software versions. But not quite as cutting edge as Fedora. Personally, I am fully on Fedora for my development machine as I want current versions of software. I didn&#x27;t have stability problems with it.<p>There seems to be also a (planned?) free version of Red Had, if you want complete stability and only security updates.')
