I do clean the humidifier with vinegar every week to keep the mineral buildup down. Then again, I do that with the shower head and tea kettle too (though a bit less frequently).<p>The big thing, as I&#x27;ve found it, is keeping the output down to a visible minimum. A big plume of mist that visibly lands anywhere isn&#x27;t adding more water to the air - it&#x27;s putting water droplets on the surface much like a spray bottle.
