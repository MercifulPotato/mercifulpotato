I find the people ignorant and topics discussed there of little value. It&#x27;s mostly just actual lies, misunderstandings, blatant propaganda, stupidity, circlejerking, echo chambers. It&#x27;s shit, to be blunt. I find it endlessly annoying.<p>But I sorta think they should be able to have their space? I don&#x27;t like the way corporations and governments build these huge marketplaces, make them more and more restrictive such that no one can really get huge market-share without them and then they start curating (censoring). I understand why they do it: image, ethics (lol), they can, network effects, control over product quality, increased community cohesion, customer comfort, &quot;safety&quot; (lol), legal (i don&#x27;t buy this one) and so on. But it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if the internet remained decentralized...these big companies should never be in the position to have this power.<p>At a certain point you get so locked out that you can&#x27;t even pay the bills anymore because even payment processors won&#x27;t take your money!')
