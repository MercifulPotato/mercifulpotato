Adding Ninja...<p>Your comment makes no sense at all. Both cmake and qmake are competing build systems, and qmake already lost and was superceded by cmake.<p>Cmake works as a high-level makefile generator, which pretty much outputs the DAG of a project&#x27;s build targets in any of the supported lower-level systems. Right now it supports Make and also Ninja.<p>Cmake&#x27;s support for ninja is a nice-to-have, just like it&#x27;s support for Visual Studio and Xcode project generation. No cmake user was ever blocked by cmake&#x27;s lack of support for ninja. In fact, no one barely notices any change if you replace make with ninja. In fact, I was surprised to know that Qt Creator started configuring Cmake projects to use Ninja by default because things just worked the same anyway, and honestly I didn&#x27;t bothered to change anything because there was no discernible difference at all.')
