Not that they&#x27;re really &quot;friends&quot; per se, but you feel like you know them even though you&#x27;ve never talked to them.<p>Sometimes those people change, and the tone and content of what they tweet becomes less enjoyable. The thought of unfollowing them can be strange, but the day after you do you&#x27;ll realize you don&#x27;t miss them at all.')
