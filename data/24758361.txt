I had always assumed OS X usage was still at about 10%, which is where it was a decade ago.<p>I suspect we&#x27;ll see this creep up even further in the coming years, if Apple releases cheaper MacBooks (~$700), in response to Apple Silicon lowering their manufacturing costs. They&#x27;ve dramatically lowered the costs of the entry-level iPhones, iPads and watches and I don&#x27;t see why that same strategy wouldn&#x27;t come to the Mac.')
