It very obviously got us into WW-1 (the British -a largely untold but very obvious info ops campaign for something that served no US national interest), it got us into the middle east (nothing the US does there happens but for foreign interference from Saudis, Emirates and Israelis, who overtly bribe our think tanks and politicians), and it fairly obviously got us our &quot;free trade&quot; policies which gutted the US manufacturing capabilities to the point we can&#x27;t make enough surgical masks in the US to protect our people (thanks, China).<p>None of the above happened because of dipshits saying things on twitter or facebook or sharing Russia Today articles. None of the above will go away if the CIA, the political center and the tech oligarchs censor the internet to protect us from meaningless internet bugaboos.<p>It&#x27;s a naked power grab, and anyone who supports it because of &quot;muh democracy&quot; is a collaborator with tyranny.')
