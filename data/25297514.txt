I have heard of VoltDB and the only thing I remembered was that it was in-memory...<p>I&#x27;m still not 100% sure what SciDB is for but it looks like none of the databases we&#x27;re mentioning are directly comparable:<p>- SciDB for scientific computing (??)<p>- VoltDB for in memory + SQL<p>- Druid for OLAP queries<p>- TimescaleDB for row-based timeseries storage<p>Seems like all apples to oranges to me. I personally like TimescaleDB because it runs on Postgres and I can usually find a way to do all those other things in postgres relatively efficiently (memory requires some squinting while using UNLOGGED tables).')
