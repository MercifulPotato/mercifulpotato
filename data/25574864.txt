She&#x27;d walk her on the nearby river path and generally disliked the way Boston Dynamics would periodically take over the path and keep her from using.<p>Part of the reason the robots evoke little excitement is because after a short look, you can realize they&#x27;re just large puppets. We&#x27;ve had dancing puppets like Walt Disney&#x27;s Small World. The reason Boston Dynamics takes over paths and shows robots dancing with each other is their robots still generally can&#x27;t interact with humans or the environment in an unstructured way. Unstructured, &quot;soft&quot; interaction seem pretty easy to us but might actually close to &quot;AI complete&quot; in their potential complexity.<p><i>In between the advances in &quot;holographic&quot; displays (not quite as sci-fi as we would want, but they are progressing), commercial space flight, cybernetic prosthetics, CRISPR and this... we are living in the future. It&#x27;s amazing.</i><p>I think your list illustrates how there&#x27;s a wide variation among technologies in the time from demonstration to implementation. I watched radio controlled boats go around lakes in 1970s. Hobby drones are just now becoming useful, forty years later. Jet packs have been around for a long time but you still can&#x27;t use them without serious safety precautions and they still aren&#x27;t a way people would commute.')
