If your social circle already includes your family because you live one town over, feel free to have family thanksgiving with that limited social circle (so don&#x27;t invite your grandparents from hours away, unless you call all afford to isolate for 1-2 weeks in advance!).<p>If you live in California and your family is in New Hampshire, please don&#x27;t hop on a plane, risking infection, and potentially spread COVID from your social circle in California to your family&#x27;s in New Hampshire.<p>Unfortunately, the combination of humans being bad at following instructions, folks being tired of COVID, and the high levels of stress this year are probably going to result in a lot of folks doing exactly this kind of stupid thing. I really wish we could close the airports for the week of Thanksgiving (refunding all flights that week) to give people a push towards responsibility, because they likely won&#x27;t do it themselves.')
