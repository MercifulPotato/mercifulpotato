Item(by='g_p', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611622437, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25905050, text='In the UK where Huawei is on a phase-out, Open RAN is a bet by operators to ensure that they have more than 2 vendor options. They are required right now to use 2 vendors, so they are not solely reliant on any one company for their equipment.<p>Most operators used 2 radio vendors, in order to keep things competitive when buying more. All have exposure to Huawei to \nsome extent in their networks.<p>If there are only 2 permitted credible radio vendors, then pricing on the &quot;new&quot; second vendor is hardly going to be competitive - where else will you go? You can&#x27;t go with one vendor, and if you did, their pricing would be ramping up as well, as they know you only have one other choice.<p>Open RAN presents an interesting insurance policy for operators, and Vodafone UK has even announced it will build a couple of thousand sites using less prominent vendors&#x27; equipment. This will get them better pricing going forwards from their existing vendors (as there&#x27;s an onboarded alternative supplier), as well as give them a new option they might wind up preferring.<p>Right now though, with the proprietary nature of X2 (in the real world - the standards suggest it&#x27;s not proprietary, but it absolutely is proprietary), you can&#x27;t deploy interoperable radios, and that keeps your vendor choice limited. If operators can run a procurement and buy a box from one of five companies, that feels a lot better for their shareholders.')
