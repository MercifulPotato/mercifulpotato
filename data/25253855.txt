Expectation management will go a long way.<p>Maybe a search box with <i>&quot;what topic would you like to play around with?&quot;</i>, with some optional checkboxes to refine the search query (for example, maybe I want to work in the browser and limit my results to TypeScript and ClojureScript. That would also help a bit with getting the &quot;toolbox&quot; aspect across.<p>Another idea is to have example projects made with thing (the portfolio part) that also clearly demonstrate which of the libraries were used.')
