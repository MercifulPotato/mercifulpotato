Let&#x27;s face it- you will almost always have access to the internet. The only thing that should matter is that the assigned student can solve the problem _in some manner._ This may include the internet, notes, or really anything.<p>The real problem is people paying others to take exams, or simply copying answers from others. I work as an independent tutor, and I get contacted far too much by people looking to have me take their exams for them.')
