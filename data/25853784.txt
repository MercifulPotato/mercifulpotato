These are still the most common kind, given that Republicans tend to value low-density communities while Democrats tend to value denser, more walkable places.<p>That premise is not only a vulgar generalization but it&#x27;s not even true generally. Blue states and especially deep Blue counties are the worse when it comes to income and social inequality. If you need to convince yourself, look at a map of counties by party with color gradient and compare it with a heat map of any metric of income equality.<p>And anyone who lived in big urban centers, nearly all blue, will tell you that they&#x27;re the worse when it comes give permission to build new housing and businesses. The &quot;conservative white flight&quot; is a Boomer meme at this point.')
