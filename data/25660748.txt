I took this for sarcasm:<p>&gt; Which innovation of Facebook are you describing? Instagram, WhatsApp, or the stories?<p>Why did I take that for sarcasm? Because it is apparent to me that Instagram, WhatsApp and stories are <i>not</i> innovative. So I thought the main point of the poster I was replying to was to take a dig at Facebook. I didn&#x27;t realize that we were in agreement about the importance of data structures and algorithms, but then I also didn&#x27;t realize that we were still on that topic: my intention was purely to refute the [what I believed to be the implied] notion that nothing innovative was happening at Facebook.')
