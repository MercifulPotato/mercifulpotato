But I vastly prefer audio only meetings and don&#x27;t understand why so many people use video. Not only can you look at something sensible instead of a face (no offense), but you can also do other stuff when it gets boring.<p>Sales prefers video of course and it depends on the topic. Certain topic and meetings with external people is often better with video support, but I don&#x27;t need to see my colleagues faces and I wouldn&#x27;t expect anyone to put on pants when there is no need.')
