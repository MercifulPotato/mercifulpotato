What was the reason?<p>As for the game, I&#x27;m personally having fun with the main and side quests. Unfortunately, that&#x27;s really all there is to the game and it feels like an Outerworlds-like game. If the cost of this game was 50% cheaper, I would definitely not be complaining. Still, it&#x27;s sad to see that vehicles are all the same (except the ones you own yourself) and losing assets when looking away is always immersion breaking.')
