Understand the problem and the solution. Figure out the best tools to use for it. Learn just what I need for version 1 if necessary.<p>2. Implement version 1. It works. It&#x27;s ugly. But it&#x27;s efficient. It&#x27;s my MVP and I can get by with it if other duties call.<p>3. Observe what&#x27;s truly missing. Add to knowledge base and improve the solution. Refine. Test. Refine. Deploy.<p>4. Document everything.<p>I used to be the kind of guy who read whole books to implement something because I had FOMO. Now I focus my energy on what I need to solve the problem. During downtime, I might expand my overall knowledge because it&#x27;s necessary or I&#x27;m curious.<p>Am I a 10x dev? I don&#x27;t think so. But I like where I am at and always want to improve.')
