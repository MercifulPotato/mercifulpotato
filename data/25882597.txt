You need to do your own relocations and remember enough information to do them. You can&#x27;t count on any particular virtual address being available on a modern system, not if you want to take advantage of ASLR.<p>The trouble is that we have to mark relocated pages dirty because the kernel isn&#x27;t smart enough to understand that it can demand fault and relocate on its own.
