And to those who suffer long term consequences that will affect them all of their life.<p>It&#x27;s incredible that after nearly 1 year of constant information bombardment you are still too ignorant to understand that even 15% problematic cases will overwhelm the system and cause issues that you are completely incapable of understanding. Yes, 80% of infected will be just fine but the other 15-20% are what brings our healthcare system to its knees. Just be happy you were in the 80% and shut up.<p>You probably even think of yourself as a smart person (you are not), why else would you come to THIS forum and post this breathtaking bullshit?')
