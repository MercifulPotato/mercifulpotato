Item(by='dhagz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607092915, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25300652, text='I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s wrong to question it, but people have taken that questioning and lack of answering to be a failing of Tolkien and LOTR when in reality that&#x27;s just not the scope of the book. It&#x27;s a mythical battle of good and evil, not a true-to-life description of a society that happens to have magic. Both LOTR and ASOIAF try to say something about humanity by holding up a funhouse mirror, just one produces an &quot;ugly&quot; and &quot;gritty&quot; distortion and the other produces a &quot;stylized&quot; and &quot;ideal&quot; distortion.')
