I think all you would have to do is find an unused pin on the uC and then wire that pin to the foot pedal and recompile the firmware.<p>But the only real advantage to the ErgoDox over the Kinesis in my opinion is that it runs QMK: the key-wells are more ergonomic and the thumb cluster is better positioned because of the slight vertical height difference. And if you get a Stapelberg converter[1] PCB made, it doesn&#x27;t look that bad to add.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;michael.stapelberg.ch&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2013-03-21-kinesis_custom_controller&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;michael.stapelberg.ch&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2013-03-21-kinesis_custo...</a>')
