I&#x27;ve solved loose structures of metastable peptides in NMR (by hand-- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubs.acs.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1021&#x2F;bi800828u" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubs.acs.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1021&#x2F;bi800828u</a>, those assignments were painstakingly conducted by yours truly with assistance from Jane Dyson).  I&#x27;ve done thousands of crystal drops with insulin to try to cocrystalize it (and failed; the x-ray structure I got did not have the cocrystal partner).  I provided the critical insight for the prep enabled EM structure solved by the postdoc at the bench next to me:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;nature04339" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;nature04339</a> . I&#x27;m pretty familiar with many aspects of the world of structural biology, but more importantly it&#x27;s never been my primary - I&#x27;ve always been a consumer of the results first, a practitioner of it second.<p>It is my judgement that if you presented these results in 2003 anyone would have said &quot;the protein folding problem has been solved&quot;.  Nobody then expected &quot;the solution to protein folding&quot; to solve every single protein, and it&#x27;s silly to now.  If you&#x27;re complaining about the 33% error rate, you don&#x27;t know enough about ML to realize that that gap is going to get closed, and rapidly.<p>My argument is that it is &quot;good enough for the uses that are in the domain of protein folding&quot;.  There are a lot of things that are adjacent to protein folding (enzyme pocket analysis .e.g), but they never have been considered to protein folding per se.')
