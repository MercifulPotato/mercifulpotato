It’s honestly offensive.<p>Its funny how people whom share my active lifestyle often have a similar problem, and lament how fragile phones are.<p>Most of my phones have been broken between my hip&#x2F;thigh and a blunt object. Most recently when I slipped and fell on some moss while backpacking. But other incidences including (literally) running into wheelbarrow in the dark, getting knocked out of my hand by a cyclist, a metal water bottle in a vehicle flying and smashing my phone into my hip.<p>I don’t go out of my way to hurt myself, and am actually a careful, graceful person. I’ve never broken a camera in over 50k shutter pulls.')
