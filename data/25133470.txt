I&#x27;m not so sure it&#x27;s an inherent human trait.<p>The traditional school system, at least in the US, is almost entirely focused on training obedience and completion of relatively short-term tasks. Homework, tests, maybe the odd paper that&#x27;s &quot;due in 3 weeks&quot; but really can be done in a mad dash the night before.<p>Until someone tries to go for a PhD, they may never have needed to plan and execute a large-scale, long-running, poorly-defined task on their own before. School didn&#x27;t train for that. And they&#x27;re expected to undo 20+ years of that step-by-step spoon-fed approach, throw that all out the window... and learn a new way of working, mostly on their own, and tackle this huge project. No wonder the failure rate is so high.')
