My 17-years old BMW has 0 big touchscreens, for everything there is a manual knob&#x2F;button. I&#x27;ve found out I don&#x27;t need more. I tweak most of stuff I need like AC and radio while driving without losing contact with the road even for a split of second.<p>I know from my experience that I took my sight off the road, there could be an atomic blast in front of me and I would hardly notice it. Somebody slamming brakes in front of me might be peripherally noticed but without context could cause a stupid and dangerous reaction.<p>When Tesla started basically putting tablets instead of knobs some folks cheered. I couldn&#x27;t be more sad for this trend. Clearly worse direction for those like me.')
