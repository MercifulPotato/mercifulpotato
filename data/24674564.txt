As I&#x27;ve aged, I&#x27;ve realized it&#x27;s necessary for me to have medication for me to be productive for an extended period of time.<p>I encourage you to embrace the chemical imbalance as the reason. The medications do work and withdrawing from them isn&#x27;t bad either (if you decide to take a pill holiday or extended non-use).<p>Finally, it&#x27;s not about &#x27;normal&#x27; focus. It&#x27;s about you. If you&#x27;re content with your productivity and behavior, then nothing is needed to change in your life. If you want to maximize your potential, then please consider medication. It doesn&#x27;t go away (CBT never worked for me). Embrace your choice. Whatever you decide, is normal, it&#x27;s your normal. That&#x27;s perfectly acceptable.')
