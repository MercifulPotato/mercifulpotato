Two things to note here<p>1) Facebook don&#x27;t have enough GPUs to do this properly at scale.<p>2) For that kind of thing to work it needs either a GPS prior, or much more robust SLAM. the oculus isft doesn&#x27;t have enough CPU&#x2F;GPU to make robust multi-room maps (with big occlusions that is)<p>&gt; This is why FB is so adamant about using FB profiles, even banning users if they make a guest account:<p>Its far more mundane than that. Its all about branding. The &quot;brand&quot; is all about &quot;One facebook&quot; or someshit so they want everyone to be interoperable. Thats why messenger and instgram are now able to communicate. I assume whatsapp will be added to that as well.<p>You&#x27;re assumption is that facebook are a coherent force for evil. They really aren&#x27;t that well organised. They are a collection of highly paid, naive tech people. Surrounded by some people with experience.')
