I&#x27;ve been through the same thing as every one else this year, plus my sister took her on life in March and my startup that was flying in February, has been hammered by the pandemic.<p>I felt like I was about to slide back into depression in May. I needed something that I could accomplish that was completely within my control. I decided to start lifting weights. It has changed my life. I lift for one hour, four days a week. I thought it would be good for my mental health, but I didn&#x27;t realize how quickly my muscles would grow.<p>I&#x27;ve never been muscular - I sit at a desk all day and code. In just a few weeks I could see significant changes in my body. Six months in and I look and feel like a completely different person. I love looking at myself in the mirror. (Sorry for oversharing a bit.)<p>Lifting is much easier than intense cardio for me, and it is helping me keep my head above water. I highly recommend it for anyone that might be having a hard time.')
