I was also on quitting smoking. Got a reference for blood test and smoking cessation (Zyban). I don&#x27;t remember if smoking cessation was insured, but the rest all was. Going to your GP is free (via mandatory insurance) in The Netherlands. I got my vitamin D and B12 checked among other things.')
