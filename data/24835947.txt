This is even happening in rural locations through organizations like B4RN. I wish it would move faster, but I&#x27;m glad that we have some competition - Corbynband would likely have nuked other providers, and I can only imagine the kind of filtering that would get applied to it. Hopefully good ISPs like Andrews &amp; Arnold can stick around.')
