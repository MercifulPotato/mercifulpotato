But so is almost every other consumer choice: only if you stick to FOSS and open document formats, and are technical enough to convert your own documents once your apps are no longer supported, you may consider yourself free. Otherwise, lock-in is a given.<p>The lock-in isn&#x27;t full, either: pictures, email, videos, bookmarks, etc. can be exported to other devices.<p>Second: if you buy Apple, you don&#x27;t give up the right to protest them. Since the company depends on its customers, pressure can be effective. This is in contrast with free products, where customer pressure can turn counter-productive.')
