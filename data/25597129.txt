Your proposed attack is thwarted by ACME challenges.<p>You could redirect the user to a HTTP site, but 1. that can be defeated by adding the domain to hsts preload list 2. This isn&#x27;t replacing content of HTTPS site, but replacing HTTPS site with a HTTP one.<p>To actually pull your attack off, you&#x27;d need to add your own root certificate to the client device (which means you either tricked the super into doing it and could&#x27;ve as well tricked them into letting you take control of their device anyway, or actually had control of their device - in both cases MITM is pointless at that point), or trick a CA into issuing you a certificate for a domain you don&#x27;t own&#x2F;steal a CA&#x27;s private keys - both of which are things that can easily kill a CA (see DigiNotar, which stopped existing same month the security breach was reported), and therefore obviously aren&#x27;t easy to pull off.')
