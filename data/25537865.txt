If you really want to compromise the whole internal net, it&#x27;s going to take longer than a few hours to work your way into other systems.  Generally you either need your target to access the system you want, or you have to spread to other machines to find a machine with the access you need.<p>The <i>most</i> effective attacks are the ones that get in, and have weeks to spread through the whole internal network.  Take the Target breach in 2013 - They were in the system undetected for 20 days, nearly 3 weeks.<p>As soon as the company knows they have a problem, any decent security team is going to check every system on record.')
