I.e. it makes little to no difference and people are just happy to pocket the extra money.<p>&gt; <i>The main effect of the subsidy is to move people to greener alternatives, rather than finding another car.</i><p>An ebike&#x2F;escooter is quite different from a car so I have my doubt that people will change their purchasing decisions base on a small-ish cash bonus: If I need a car I will still buy a car but if I was already thinking of buying an ebike&#x2F;escooter than obviously I like the windfall as a bonus. Or maybe I&#x27;ll buy an ebike with the subsidy cash in addition to buying a new car...')
