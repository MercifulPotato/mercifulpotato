As other users pointed out, it has become a norm for software&#x2F;webdev houses to convert what is mostly static content into weird, flashy, bloated SPAs that load a ridiculous about of resources for little content. I see it in my peers too, and I saw it even when I was attending college. Frankly, I think it&#x27;s immature to pretend this is not a problem as some seem to suggest.')
