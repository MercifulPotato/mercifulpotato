Item(by='el_nahual', descendants=None, kids=[25050508], score=None, time=1605030998, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25046157, text='I&#x27;m 33 years old and assume I have a case of &quot;long haul covid.&quot; Physical symptoms are a chronic shortness of breath &amp; exhaustion. I get winded just talking on zoom. Pre covid I could run 3 miles no sweat.<p>On the mental side I&#x27;ve also noticed effect: mostly depression, and it is totally correlated with the physical symptoms. On days where the shortness of breath is acute so is the depression.<p>But here&#x27;s the interesting thing: I&#x27;m not worried about the depression <i>at all</i>. In my late teens&#x2F;early twenties I suffered from extreme depression. Thanks to {reasons} and {intervention}, I managed to overcome it by my late twenties, but it was a solid lost decade for me.<p>I certainly wish I hadn&#x27;t had that experience, but the silver lining is that I feel like I have <i>practice</i> with it. I hadn&#x27;t felt depressed in years, but when I felt it on account of covid I was able to observe it and say &quot;huh. I guess being sick made me depressed,&quot; which is vastly different than just <i>being</i> depressed without the ability to observe it.<p>This has resulted in the realization that one can practice and train to deal with some mental health issues, and I feel like it&#x27;s a skillset that I have now mastered. I didn&#x27;t expect to have to use it again but here we are.<p>As a young father, I hope to somehow pass this skillset on to my children without them having to go through the same experiences I did, and I wish that it were better woven into the fabric of our society. All societies teach some soft skills simply as part of their mores, taboos and worldviews and ours (western, american&#x2F;americanized) IMHO fails utterly in this regard.')
