All interactions with the universe (all i&#x2F;o, anything with time) involve global state. So what makes DB&#x27;s a smart pattern but global variables usually bad?<p>It gets hairy whenever you have &quot;behind your back&quot; mutation within a single scope. Because db calls are costly, people usually batch the transaction and pass the result to mostly pure functions. If you were to do something silly like wrap a Redis get&#x2F;set in a Mapping, it&#x27;d feel an awful lot like a global dict.<p>This is why things like transactions, event sourcing, and the reactor pattern exist. You batch all i&#x2F;o to the global state so you a) deal with immutable structures everywhere else b) have ACID c) have traceability.')
