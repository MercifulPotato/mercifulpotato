We don&#x27;t always get it right, and the combination&#x2F;middle ground isn&#x27;t necessarily better than either of the alternatives, but I do feel like we have some general insight and sympathy to both the European and the American philosophies.<p>I&#x27;ve also lived as an ex-pat in Europe for 4 years working closely with both Europeans and AMericans.<p>In this regard, I think the American approach is superior.<p>1) Europeans are overly sensitive about &quot;micro-friendliness&quot;. I&#x27;ve heard people complain that the cashier at the grocery store asks &quot;How are you doing?&quot;. &quot;They don&#x27;t really care, why do they ask!&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve had to explain that no, they don&#x27;t care, but that moment of friendliness is still a pleasant one, and over the course of the day, all those moments add up to a generally positive contribution to one&#x27;s existence.<p>Americans do take faux-friendliness over the top (especially if it&#x27;s only reserved for the local in-group, see: southern &quot;hospitality&quot;), but I think the Europeans need to lighten up a bit.<p>2) While I don&#x27;t need my waitresses to be so friendly to the point that they seem like they&#x27;re flirting with you, the European waitstaff at restaurants are far from neutral, and are actively disinterested in your hospitality experience. This doesn&#x27;t apply to fancy high-end restaurants, of course. But just a general casual lunch or dinner you&#x27;re just not going to get the same quality of service as you do in North America.<p>While I abhor tipping, I can&#x27;t help but think that it does create some positive incentives in staff here.')
