There are a ton of advantages over living in SF:<p>- Houses are probably 1&#x2F;3 the cost of houses in SF (or the bay area in general).<p>- I can get to SF with a 50 minute flight and I live 15 minutes from an airport. This was a huge plus when I convinced my last job to hire me as the first remote engineer.<p>- I am in the same timezone as SF.<p>- The cost of living adjustments to my salary have been either zero or very small (like 5% less salary than an engineer in SF). Totally worth it in my opinion.<p>We have talked about moving to a cheaper CoL state entirely, but my whole family is in this city and it is definitely cheap enough. My wife is also a teacher, and teacher salaries in CA are much higher than in lower CoL states.')
