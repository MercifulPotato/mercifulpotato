Maybe for an Aussie or someone from rural USA it is not so special, but driving to the nearest town took a day. Our car had an extra large water and fuel tank (making the backseats somewhat uncomfortable for us kids). Over a 1000km of nothingness (that&#x27;s from Antwerp to Kopenhagen). Just dry shrubs, an accidental hut, A lonely baobab-tree, one tiny fuel-station, and sand. Dusty, red, dry sand (it gets everywhere).<p>I think Botswana has another &quot;diamond&quot; here: cheap, unpopulated, unusable land. With highly predictable, and heavy sunshine, makes for a perfect solar deliverer.<p>Now, if only we could transport it as easy as oil or gas, and it could probably deliver large percentage of Africa&#x27;s energy needs in coming decades. Because as far as I know, Botswana is still one of the least populated countries in the world (per kmÂ²). So it&#x27;s not as if the local economy uses giant amounts of energy on itself.')
