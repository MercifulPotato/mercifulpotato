Item(by='daveidol', descendants=None, kids=[25798285, 25798614, 25798191], score=None, time=1610751201, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25796097, text='Like others have said - I think the documentation glosses over how the &quot;rerender&quot; function totally and drastically changes this from a &quot;React alternative&quot; to &quot;backbone with JSX&quot;.<p>The point of React is not the JSX, but rather the unidirectional data flow and automatic re-renders due to prop changes -- essentially modelling your application as a &quot;state machine&quot; and eschewing the need for a &quot;view model&quot; or manual synchronization of DOM state to application state.<p>With the &quot;rerender&quot; function I fear any nontrivial application will devolve back into the tangled web of event listeners we left behind when moving to React.<p>Personally - I think a library like this is only useful for a very narrow audience: people with an affinity for JSX that are only building webpages (not web &quot;apps&quot;) with some basic progressive enhancement features that can be kept track of pretty easily.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to be overly negative here - I just suggest that you alter the documentation to be more clear about the differences&#x2F;limitations when compared to react. The existing docs&#x2F;example is almost (unintentionally, I&#x27;m sure) misleading in my opinion.')
