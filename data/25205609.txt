Instead, imagine the flings the rocket at a 45 degree angle so when it peaks in altitude it&#x27;s already going quite fast. As other commentators in this thread point out, it&#x27;s really an alternative for the primary stage rocket booster part, which doesn&#x27;t just shoot a rocket straight up vertically.')
