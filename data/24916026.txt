Reminds me of when iOS first came out and people were still experimenting the platform, there were some really awesome mobile games that&#x27;s truly made for the iOS devices, like Cut the Rope, Fruit Ninja, I can tell they&#x27;re making apps <i>for</i> the platform, instead of porting generic apps <i>to</i> the platform. As a game developer I&#x27;m constantly struggling with the thought of whether trying to go full cross-platform or focus on a single platform. Philosophically, aesthetically and technically focusing on one platform is a far superior choice, but it&#x27;s so tempting to write one piece of software and able to deliver to all users..<p>Also poolside.fm is a recent one i noticed that has native clients on web, iOS and macOS that strongly demonstrated the power of being native.')
