With just a few simple steps you can have all the answers at your finger tips.<p>My interview language of choice is JavaScript. So I went to GitHub searched for leetcode filtered by JavaScript and compiled the top 8 repos into one master list of solutions. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AlexJuarez&#x2F;solutions<p>The next steps are to compile implementations in JavaScript of all the algorithms and data structures that one might need to know. I already had written one https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;AlexJuarez&#x2F;learn-js&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;data-structures.<p>The last step is to feed all this information into your programmatic ai app of choice mines, kite.app, and from there magic.<p>This isn’t about ethic this is about acknowledging there is a better way to write code and solve problems. I’m not advocating for cheating quite the opposite I’m saying leverage all of your advantages.')
