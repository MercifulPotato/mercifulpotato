I&#x27;ve never seen a more expensive online store than Amazon. All the small online shops I&#x27;ve visited offer lower prices for identical products. They also generally have a better selection within their niche so you don&#x27;t end up overpaying for products that are way more capable than you need. It&#x27;s also much easier to find products on those small online shops thanks to aggregators like geizhals.de<p>Meanwhile searching products on Amazon is still a shitshow and it&#x27;s generally not possible to disable third party listings.')
