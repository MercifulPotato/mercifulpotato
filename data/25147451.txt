The software quality has been on a slow but sure slide for well over a decade at this point.  The quality of Catalina is not good.  Recently I&#x27;ve been using it more and have regular system crashes.  There are serious bugs in the kernel.  Big Sur looks like another step down in polish and quality.  &quot;More iOS&quot; is simply bad strategy for a desktop operating system.  I want a tool for professional work, not a locked down and dumbed down entertainment appliance.<p>10-15 years back, paying the premium for an Apple system got you a premium product.  And back then, the premium was not excessive for the gain in hardware build quality and the software.  Today, that is no longer the case.  The value proposition is just not there.  You&#x27;re paying very inflated amounts of money for mediocre performance, nice looking but sorely limited hardware, and bad quality software.')
