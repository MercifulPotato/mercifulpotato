Everything should be programmable, interoperable. Simple APIs, introspection, etc. Have systems emerge out of simple interactions built by users. Have more users depend on that.<p>Instead, we get silos, to better capture value. Users are consumers, and need only ingest what we feed them, to better keep them in check.<p>I&#x27;m not blaming anyone specifically here. Even OOP, and living cells tend to work the cell: keep your riches inside a membrane, and control every external interaction on your terms if you want to have it your way. Only... to some extent, as there is an equilibrium. Bacteria have plasmids. We at least have HTTP, for now (but it&#x27;s not enough anymore due to captchas, js, etc).')
