At least on bandcamp I can search for genre&#x2F;city, but for say, electronic music, you have to sift through stuff that is literally disgusting to find the  gems. It&#x27;s when they mix things that aren&#x27;t meant to be mixed, they create that kind of dread. Good for bandcamp being profitable though, that&#x27;s very good news. I&#x27;m probably just not their target market.')
