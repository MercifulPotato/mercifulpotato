It generally means 99.97% efficiency for 0.3 micron sized particles at some particular airflow.<p>0.3 micron was chosen because as noted by another commenter below, high efficiency filters typically filter better at smaller sizes than this.<p>A more stringent certification is EN1822, which first tests which particle size penetrates the filter the most, and then rates the efficiency based on that particle size.<p>With respect to viruses, a minimum of EN1822 H14 is required for use in European biological safety cabinets. An H14 filter is 99.995% efficient as it&#x27;s most penetrating particle size (MPPS).<p>That said, it&#x27;s important to realize the difference between using a filter to pass air into&#x2F;out of a clean environment (e.g positive&#x2F;negative pressure clean room) versus just using an air purifier in a room. In the latter case, the machine is only going to filter the air going through it, and will take a significant amount of time to turn over the air in the room, during which time it&#x27;s just blowing things around.')
