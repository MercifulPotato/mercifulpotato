What is difficult is <i>harnessing</i> that free will to the evolutionary success of the organism.<p>The large brain is necessary as a harness, to control the intelligence, and enslave it to evolutionarily beneficial ends. Probably not just hardwired instincts, but also learns - probably, similar to animal intelligence.<p>Like a giant finite state machine, that prevents a turing machine from running certain programs that never halt. Of course, it can&#x27;t catch <i>all</i> such programs, and a turing machine can transcend any such bound, but lowering the probability of running one is good enough.<p>Note that turing equivalence, the highest possible computational power, emerges from even the slightest complexity (apart from the infinite tape part).<p>Thus &quot;intelligence&quot; has appeared in countless individual animals: mammals, birds, spiders, perhaps plants too and bacteria (and is still so appearing), but it doesn&#x27;t confer a survival advantage, so disappears. Many such creatures just sit there discerning patterns instead of surviving. Others do survive but by instinct, so the intelligence makes no difference.<p>The difficulty is putting freewill in the driver&#x27;s seat.')
