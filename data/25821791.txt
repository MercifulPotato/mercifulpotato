The conspiracy theory stuff drives eyeballs. The big issue is that there is barely such thing as news anymore. It is all Infotainment and the only thing that matters is ads. They have been incentivized to outrage and click-bait. Good quality news is expensive to make but people want it for free. I really don&#x27;t know how to fix this conundrum.<p>There are two ways to help this status quo in my mind. Get red of the ability to repost&#x2F;retweet&#x2F;etc. People are lazy and won&#x27;t make their own post but a click of the button is trivial and spreads nonsense. Also, we need to start a VAT on ad revenue. If we want other models, like NPR style or Patreon style, then we need to made ads less profitable.')
