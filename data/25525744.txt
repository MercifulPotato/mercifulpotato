Itâ€™s a complicated and roundabout way of doing things. It would be better just to have an svg for 64px and above and a set hand drawn png images for the smaller icons. No fancy new image format, maybe just a decent naming convention or zip file per image set. Should only be 64px.svg 32px.png 24px.png and 16px.png. You may even be able to skip the 24px version.')
