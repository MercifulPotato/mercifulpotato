Item(by='firedating', descendants=None, kids=[25995081], score=None, time=1612215085, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25992782, text='I develop <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firedating.me" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firedating.me</a> - my hobby project and a place for FIRE (Financial Independence &#x2F; Retire Early) enthusiasts to find friends and a partner. My goal is to help FIRE people build meaningful connections and decrease the amount of loneliness in the community.<p>I don&#x27;t make any money, instead I&#x27;ve spent around $130 and 400 hours so far. It is actually a lot of fun to learn web development and encounter various unexpected challenges everyday. There are also rewarding aspects - 9 couples, who met through the site, have reached out to me and were grateful. This feeling of changing people&#x27;s lives in this way is amazing! I have no clue where this brings me, but I enjoy it so much. I try to spend at least 1.5 hours a day in 2021. In 2020 I had a goal to spend at a least 1 hour a day on my side projects and that&#x27;s how firedating was born ;)')
