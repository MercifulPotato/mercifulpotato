If scams can thrive so well in our system (to the point of becoming worth hundreds of billions of dollars), then how do we know that the biggest corporations are not scams too? How do we know they&#x27;re not all empty shells? Their earnings (P&#x2F;E ratios) are very low... And on top of that, I would question the source and legitimacy of these modest earnings.<p>What kind of system allows scams of this scale to thrive for over a decade? What kind of system supports bailouts of big corporations every few years? Corruption of the media? Corruption of politics?\nI don&#x27;t think any of these fit the description of a &#x27;working system&#x27;.<p><i></i>EDIT<i></i> And what kind of system supports downvoting (thus trying to censor) such a logical comment as this one?')
