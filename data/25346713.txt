Otherwise you can happy use the LGPL License<p>Nope, you can make a commercial closed-source application that links against LGPL-licensed library. Also, the source code model has nothing to do with &quot;making money&quot;. For example, Qt is certainly &quot;making money&quot; with their source code, but did you know that the WebView component in Qt is actually COPIED from Apple&#x27;s Safari WebKit source code? Yes! So they are STEALING Apple LGPL source code and making money with it! And what more, Apple Safari certainly runs on iPhones and Apple if someone is certainly making some big $$$!<p>You seem to have misunderstood what changed. No, Qt did not change the licensing terms to charge for &quot;making money&quot; with Qt. They just made more of their previously free support functions exclusive to paying licensees.')
