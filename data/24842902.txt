When it works better than Firefox, that&#x27;s because it really works better, not because it has a weird nonstandard quirk that everyone designed for because it is the dominant browser. Chrome&#x2F;Blink has some quirks but it is nothing compared to IE6.<p>The problem with Chrome&#x2F;Blink is different: is is essentially a way for Google to push whatever standard they want. Emphasis on &quot;standard&quot;. Microsoft wanted to control the web on the client side. They made IE, and therefore Windows a near-requirement to access the web, the whole embrace, extend and extinguish thing. What Google want is the opposite, they want every machine to use Google services, and the meaning of Chrome is &quot;here is how a web browser should be, please copy me&quot;.<p>Unlike Microsoft with IE, Google wants Firefox to implement every feature Chrome supports, and for that reason, these new features are much less quirky. The problem is: what Google wants Firefox to implement may not be in the user best interest.')
