As Saint Jobs taught us &quot;Real artists ship.&quot;<p>We needed nuclear. And everything else. Two decades ago.<p>Now must do anything and everything to get to zero carbon as fast as possible. Not tomorrow. Not a decade from now. Today. Now.<p>If we went all in for nukes, ignoring all the financial and technical and policy downsides, what&#x27;s the soonest it&#x27;d go live? A decade?<p>Too late.<p>So while we build out wind, solar, storage... And while we rebuild our grid... We should also triple down on nukes. Dump money into every feasible and semifeasible and farfetched variation. And hope that in a decade some of those bets pay off. (I especially wish traveling wave reactors can work.)<p>Meanwhile, per disagree and then commit, get with the program. All this narcissism of small differences makes the concern trolls part of the problem. If nukes are your thing, knock yourself out. And praise all the complimentary efforts. Because we need all of it, as soon as possible.<p>Source: Saul Griffith')
