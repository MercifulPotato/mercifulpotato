Item(by='watwatinthewat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609519954, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25601256, text='I work at a government r&amp;d&#x2F;systems engineering center, and it&#x27;s the same case here. The engineers who went through college with Matlab use that as their default (i.e., when the project doesn&#x27;t call for something else from the start), while newer engineers don&#x27;t. As that generation ages out, it&#x27;ll be more and more sidelined. It&#x27;s their inertia keeping it around at all.<p>Proprietary features don&#x27;t matter here like there. We get MathWorks employees here at least a couple times a year hawking their latest (paid) libraries, but at this point they&#x27;re always something 5+ years too late, something that already exists in preferred languages--often for free.<p>Since our clients never deploy Matlab, it doesn&#x27;t matter if their libraries are fractionally faster in any case besides mockup&#x2F;experimentation in R&amp;D, and for that I&#x27;ve never met anyone who chooses it for speed there. Plus in this day where even laptops are fast and cloud instances spun up in a few seconds, there&#x27;s no point. It&#x27;s also nicer for the dev to complain about not having enough ram to get a better machine than take the time to learn a new language for a specific use case. Likewise the project manager will prefer the quicker solution, buying.<p>The one item close to a &quot;tie&quot; with Python here is probably migration. Matlab always and Python most of the time get rewritten into something else, Java in my department.')
