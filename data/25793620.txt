Then I remembered, HEY, I already HAVE an adapter. Chained my apple-multi-port-adapter to my apple usb-to-ethernet adapter. Wait, why are things worse than WiFi? Oh, right, USB type A, probably USB2.0 or whatever. Limited to 93Mbps.<p>Go to apple store online, order Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter. I&#x27;ve made the mistake of buying a USB-C dock instead of a Thunderbolt dock, won&#x27;t make that mistake again!<p>It arrives, it&#x27;s Thunderbolt 2 so it can&#x27;t plug into my machine.<p>Order another one, this time USB-C.')
