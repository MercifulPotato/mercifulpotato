Fire Upon The Deep probably wouldn&#x27;t generally be considered at all Hard because it has Faster-than-Light travel, which is one of the things you generally would rule out of Hard SF because of how conservation rules in Physics work, if you can do FtL then you can do time travel (because space and time being the same kind of thing), and then what&#x27;s your story?<p>&quot;The Martian&quot; a novel subsequently made into a movie is pretty realistic, turns out the setup (a storm on Mars separates Mark from the rest of the crew) is the least realistic part of that entire story.<p>If that&#x27;s a bit too realistic, some of Liu Cixin&#x27;s shorts are pretty wild while remaining down to earth about what&#x27;s practical. &quot;The Wandering Earth&quot; for example.<p>Greg Egan is very Hard, but you may find you think Greg&#x27;s technically possible stuff seems harder to believe than faster-than-light travel which isn&#x27;t possible at all. The Clockwork Rocket couldn&#x27;t happen here, but it&#x27;s set in a universe with a different dimensional symmetry, the Amalgam stuff is set in this universe, but with a society far more advanced than ours.<p>But then if it turns out &quot;realistic&quot;&#x2F; &quot;believable&quot; counts like Star Wars style laser blasters and stuff then I dunno, lots of things, maybe you&#x27;d like Ann Leckie&#x27;s Imperial Radch stuff, (or indeed Iain M Banks&#x27; Culture novels) which aren&#x27;t Hard at all.')
