You can:<p>* Not specifically require Black employees to relocate to different cities while giving non-Black employees the opportunity to work out out whatever the nearest office is.<p>* Treat Black employees respectfully in meetings.<p>* Not allow people who manage Black employees to mock them for being drug dealers and for carrying weapons.<p>* Not allow recruiting team members to discuss the merits of different races and their likelihood of success as candidates in hiring team meetings.<p>This all seems pretty basic?<p>Incidentally: I don&#x27;t know what the &quot;movement&quot; you&#x27;re referring to is. I&#x27;ve been in this industry since the 1990s, and these seem like rules that would have been equally germane in 1995.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to zing you with that, but am noticing a persistent subtext on this thread that attempts to equate Black people not wanting to be discriminated against with some larger basket of &quot;far-left politics&quot;.
