It was <i>all</i> boundary.<p>A bit more realistically, here&#x27;s an automobile cruise control that uses the same button for &quot;reduce set speed&quot; and &quot;set the speed&quot;.  (Don&#x27;t blame me, I&#x27;ve had more than one car with that exact setup).<p><pre><code>  void buttonXEvent() {\n    if (cruiseControlEnabled) {\n      if (cruiseSpeedSet) {\n        cruiseSpeed--;\n      } else {\n         cruiseSpeed = currentSpeed;\n         cruiseSpeedSet = true;\n      }\n      writeSpeedToEngineComputer(currentCruiseSpeed);\n    }  &#x2F;&#x2F; else do nothing\n  }\n</code></pre>\nHow would you write this in your approach?')
