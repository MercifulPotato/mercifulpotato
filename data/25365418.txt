Sometimes I would hear about &quot;draconian&quot; Chinese censorship. It seemed obviously bad by western standards. For example, they would prohibit industrial action in case it threatens some vital industry or prohibit protests in case it threatens the power of the government which could lead to unrest and violence. Or they prosecuted someone for spreading a rumor after Fukushima happened that iodized salt protects against cancer which led to supermarkets getting sold out of it. Or they would suppress anti-government talk like what Falun Gong and the Uyghurs were doing. In the case of the Uyghur, they did actually commit some terrorists acts because of the anti-government things they were telling each other. All that seemed like bad totalitarian censorship. But now American leftist believe similar censorship is OK for essentially the same reasons. &quot;social harmony&quot; was never seen as a valid reason for censorship by westerners before, but since Trump, they changed their mind.<p>You example of accusations of child abuse as a way to insult somebody is actually fine as long as the society can recognize unfounded accusations from actual reality. This is still acceptable for many other insults, like &quot;you&#x27;re stupid&quot;, but somehow, people seem to have elevated sexual abuse accusations to the status of truth. I&#x27;d say the antidote to that is to allow more open unfounded accusations so we&#x27;re all immunized against their effects. We do have the justice system to address real allegations.')
