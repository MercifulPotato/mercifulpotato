I also absolutely understand that you would cringe at my comments.  Whatever, I may say though, is no reflection on you.<p>If you were to meet me in person I don&#x27;t think you would cringe if we were to talk.  But on a forum, you only have a short amount of time to make an impression, catch people&#x27;s attention, and try to get them to consider what I think is truth.  People are so indoctrinated, they can barely recognise it.<p>Here, on HN, there are many people who love science - it is their religion.  They don&#x27;t think its a religion, but it is - they believe in it, they don&#x27;t know it.  They don&#x27;t even know what knowing is.  The accept the pronouncements from the priest-scientists, as if they were gospel.  A cursory review of some science study is all it takes.  But the point of science is that it should be verifiable, not based on belief.  No one is verifying anything, and when studies are peer reviewed 70% cannot be replicated.  70%!!<p>In fact, I love science done properly too, but that is nowhere to be found.  I hold to application of the scientific method personally.  In all areas of my life.<p>If I have any ambitions in my interactions on HN, it is that I wish for others to engage their rational thinking, not just when tackling a gnarly coding issue, but also in other parts of their lives.  I wish that people would think more individually, rather than just going along with the herd, what they have been taught, etc.<p>Questions people should be asking include:  Why is it so medicine so expensive?  Has the &#x27;health&#x27; system been captured?  When was it captured?  Why don&#x27;t we know what the right food for humans is?  Why were we taught the food pyramid?  Is food medicine?  Is pregnancy an issue that requires medical intervention?  Etc.  If you really start to find answers to those questions, the reality of this existence takes on an entirely different perspective.<p>I appreciate that you are looking into this stuff for yourself.  I appreciate that you are sharing your understanding and anecdotal results.  I&#x27;m glad that you clarified that it is not n=1 but n=2 or 3.  Given what I understand about science, I genuinely value the anecdotal points you raise highly.  I have gained much more useful information anecdotally than from &#x27;science&#x27;.<p>Finally, I would say, that along with fasting, I understand that the Gerson method is excellent more providing you with nutrition and along your body the space to repair itself.  And in repairing itself, I understand there will be a healing crisis, where the build up of toxins etc may be expelled and that that can mean that one feels worse than ever.  But that this is an essential step on the path to wellness.<p>All the best.')
