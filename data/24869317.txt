They are the fewest openings, with the most applicants. And tech companies basically all use the same leetcode white boarding interviews that aren&#x27;t representative of actually working. My unsolicited advice would be: Continue working on improving, apply to jobs where-ever you can, try to get experience somewhere (work with a professor, make your own startup, go on fiverr, anything).')
