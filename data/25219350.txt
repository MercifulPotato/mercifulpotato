Item(by='supermatt', descendants=None, kids=[25219652], score=None, time=1606393457, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25218050, text='Im hoping that the &quot;new form factor&quot; rumours for next years MacBook range, is in fact a macPad - the equivalent of a large format iPad with magic keyboard, etc - but running macOS.<p>It would actually make the new ability to run iOS apps even more practical. Literally open an iOS&#x2F;iPad app and it behaves exactly as an iPad would. iPads already have keyboards and trackpads, MacBooks have ability to run iOS apps - its not a great leap to see this as the next step.<p>Id even be happy with a single TB port. Thats all Im using on my 8GB MBP M1 anyway - connecting to a dock for some extra storage, network, power delivery and connecting to 3 4k monitors while in clamshell (and SD card reader, and 4 USB3 ports left over, and daisy chaining...). I really don&#x27;t get port-anxiety when one gives you all this...<p>As for making macOS itself touch capable - god no. Keep those behaviours restricted to the views of the &quot;iPad&quot; apps. If you aren&#x27;t plugged into a keyboard or a dock, or if you enter &quot;iPad mode&quot; (maybe via a hardware switch - like the old silent-mode one), then it could behave just like a regular iPad. Theres none of the windows nonsense if you don&#x27;t make the &quot;desktop&quot; aspects touch capable.')
