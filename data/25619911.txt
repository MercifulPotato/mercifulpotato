I did an estimate:<p>1x Windmill, 3.6MW for 500 m3 concrete [0, 1]<p>1x Hinkley Point C base, nameplate 3.2GW for 18,000 m3 [2]<p>I don&#x27;t know how much Hinkley Point overall might use, because a lot might go into the shell, so say the overall build is an order of magnitude more than the base. That is 180k m3 of concrete or about 360 windmill foundations in Hinkley with some rather unfavourable assumptions. So a 3.2 GW nuclear reactor might match up to ~1.3 GW of Windfarm.<p>Depending on how much goes into the base vs the shell it is probably somewhere between 3x to an order of magnitude favouring nuclear. Not considering relative lifetime, although I expect a nuclear concrete pour has better long-term prospects (how would they replace the windmill without re-pouring the base?).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wagner.com.au&#x2F;main&#x2F;our-projects&#x2F;sapphire-wind-farm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wagner.com.au&#x2F;main&#x2F;our-projects&#x2F;sapphire-wind-fa...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sapphirewindfarm.com.au&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sapphirewindfarm.com.au&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hinkley_Point_C_nuclear_power_station" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hinkley_Point_C_nuclear_power_...</a>')
