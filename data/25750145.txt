You wouldn&#x27;t think twice about it, you&#x27;d likely think - why would CNN have to comply? It&#x27;s not a perfect analogy, but that&#x27;s the best way I&#x27;ve been able to think of it.\nIn the end, it&#x27;s lose-lose for non fascists. While we&#x27;re all debating whether there was overreach and or if it should be mitigated, actual fascists are regrouping and planning their next assault.')
