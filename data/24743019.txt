Have you ever been denied access to your bathroom?  For me, such things are unthinkable.<p>&gt; trans people die or pop out of existence when you refer to them by the wrong pronoun?<p>Well, their existence as a trans person does, when you reject their own identity and replace it with one you have chosen instead.  So: yes, you’re telling the person that you’re talking to that they don’t exist, that someone else, with a different name and gender exists instead.<p>&gt; even there I think that the problem was that the state presumed to have a say in the definition of marriage to begin with<p>That’s an odd solution—gay people want to get married also?  Well then: nobody can.  Making everybody miserable instead of happy is one way to put everybody on the same footing, but not one I don’t think many people would have been happy with.  Definitely I’m glad they didn’t go with that.')
