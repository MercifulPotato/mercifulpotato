We have very strong evidence alcohol and tobacco is super bad for you, especially if you use it constantly. We have what is basically conjecture, rat studies, and correlation that doesnt paticularly control for confounding factors for marijuana [despite a concerted political effort to make it scary]. That doesn&#x27;t make it &quot;safe&quot; but its just as wrong if not more so to say its comparable to things which we are very sure are unsafe.')
