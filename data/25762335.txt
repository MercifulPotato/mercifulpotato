When I worked in the office, I would sometimes bring work home, lugging back my work laptop, or using VPN from my home PC. I didn&#x27;t need to do it ever night, and I stopped after an hour or so.<p>I liked the suggestion of the woman who puts her work laptop in her desk drawer and shuts it at the end of the work day. That imposes some discipline to STOP working for the day. Because diminished productivity the next day is always the problem if I work for 10 or 12 hours at my desk at home.')
