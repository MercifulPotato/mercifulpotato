As far as I can tell, there are a number of clinical trials I should watch to see if those drugs work in humans? But nothing actually confirmed yet? I sure hope they do pan out, but given how many treatments in general medical science cross the mice&#x2F;primate-to-human barrier, I&#x27;m not feeling optimistic.<p>Note that in the article itself, the first comment and its replies get into this a bit, and the author does advise taking certain drugs right now. Maybe I&#x27;ll try to convince my doctor to prescribe metformin...')
