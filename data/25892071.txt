We could have had blue passports without Brexit.<p>2. Many of these unfavourable conditions on UK firms and UK citizens are imposed by the UK government itself.<p>It&#x27;s not a simple case of the larger trading partner giving the smaller one unfavourable terms.  In this case, the smaller partner chose to impose hardships on its <i>own</i> firms and people, while the larger partner was willing to offer more benefits so long as they were mutual.<p>For example, those UK musicians who can&#x27;t tour the EU any more.  That&#x27;s a UK decision.  The EU was willing to allow that touring as long as EU musicians could tour in the UK on similar terms.  But the UK declined.  That&#x27;s why there are petitions about it, because if the UK changed position on that, the EU would probably accept.')
