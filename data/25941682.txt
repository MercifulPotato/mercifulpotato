Whatver organizational model meets your project&#x27;s needs best, you have the flexibility to apply it. And people often do! A lot of the projects on sr.ht, given this flexibility, haven&#x27;t recreated the same model as GitHub shoehorns you into.<p>It goes beyond bug trackers, too. One other detail is that different projects can <i>share</i> resources with one another. I use one mailing list to slurp up all patches for my smaller side projects into one place, for example.')
