Item(by='chrisfinazzo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611696663, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25919915, text='&gt; When we were kids, this sounded like the end of the world: a virus that attacks the immune system itself. It was so terrifying to hear about such a horrible disease that had no cure, and was so insidious that we couldn&#x27;t even create a vaccine to stop it.<p>I was born in &#x27;86. Even into the 90&#x27;s this line of thinking hadn&#x27;t changed all that much. The attitude around most diseases and the like that had a &#x27;social&#x27; component was best described as &quot;shock and shame&quot; - e.g, you&#x27;re screwed long-term and society blamed you.<p>&gt; In a few decades we as a species have found a way not only to completely eradicate it to undetectable levels (it still hides in cells to protect itself) but now we are at a monthly injection.<p>I was going to ask how this works until you answered the question for me (if it&#x27;s undetectable, why isn&#x27;t this considered cured?) Last I heard research is still trying to figure this out. At the same time, I can remember hepatitis C having a similar wrap in the 90&#x27;s - &#x27;you have it, and probably always will&#x27; - Mavyret&#x2F;Epclusa changed that. It still blows my mind that the problem is pretty much solved at this point.<p>Hail Science.')
