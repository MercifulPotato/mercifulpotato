But if you keep reading, you realize that it&#x27;s calling for Ring to block the owners from streaming to law enforcement <i>with their own PC</i>. From the end of the article:<p>&gt; &quot;[Amazon and Ring] are not involved in any way with any of the companies or the city in connection with the pilot program. The companies, the police and the city that were discussed in the article do not have access to Ringâ€™s systems or the Neighbors App. Ring customers have control and ownership of their devices and videos, and can choose to allow access as they wish.&quot;<p>Seems like a weird take to me. Is it legal to have a camera on your house pointing at the street? And is it legal for you to live-stream it? Those are rights you&#x27;ll need to trample on to do something about this Ring&#x2F;police thing.')
