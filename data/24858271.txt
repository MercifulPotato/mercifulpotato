I&#x27;m Polish, so we don&#x27;t have as cheap electronics as US does, but still. I tried to find a laptop for my Brazilian friend and the prices were often double the prices of here too. Not only that, but they were the older models, e.g. a laptop here with SSD and GTX 1650 would have HDD and GTX 1050 there for twice the price.')
