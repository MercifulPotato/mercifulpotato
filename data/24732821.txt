Almost everyone uses Google&#x27;s Play Store, but you can install an app manually like you do on your phone or even use a 3rd party store. If you don&#x27;t like Chrome, you can install Firefox. If Google bans VPNs in China (like Apple did), users can sideload the app.<p>On iOS, for devs, it&#x27;s either the App Store and Apple rules or you&#x27;re out of the platform. For users, it&#x27;s what Apple allows... and many of their rules aren&#x27;t there to protect users.')
