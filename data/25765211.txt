I&#x27;m not even sure there was a single free driver for those.<p>That likely means those devices are going to be stuck on an outdated kernel, unless Imagination steps in and provides ongoing binary support for newer kernels for their GPUs like x86 GPU manufacturers do. However, this being RISC-V with 2 existing devices total, I don&#x27;t count on it.<p>So close, yet so far.')
