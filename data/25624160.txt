Item(by='AnIdiotOnTheNet', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609701024, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25623127, text='If you go into a conlang discussion and complain about people inventing languages when there&#x27;s already natural languages, I guarantee you will get downvoted and pretty much for the same reason.<p>Let&#x27;s look at some of your criticisms:<p><pre><code>  &gt; @call(.{ .modifier = .never_inline }, collectNoInline, .{gc});\n</code></pre>\n&gt; I&#x27;m sorry, but that&#x27;s total nonsense. Shows that not enough good faith went into Zig design. Even in C, that could be syntactically annotated as:<p><pre><code>  &gt; &#x2F;*pragma:noinline*&#x2F;\n  &gt; collectNoInline(gc);\n</code></pre>\nIn which you say that a built-in function call with optional flags and settings is total nonsense, while hijacking comment syntax to change compiler behavior is better. You can make an argument for that, but the way you describe it as &quot;total nonsense&quot; and not in good faith is definitely hostile.<p>Let&#x27;s look at some more examples:<p>&gt; Jumping thru hoops is what Zig seems to choose with its unorthodox, different-just-to-be-different syntax.<p>&gt; Zig appears to have strong NIH mentality in regard to the syntax. Trying to replace C, but go out of their way trying to invent syntax just to be different from it and most other things too.<p>Zig&#x27;s syntax isn&#x27;t that unorthodox except compared to languages that look even more like C than it does, and it definitely isn&#x27;t different just to be different. By claiming such, when there are thousands of posts in discussions about syntax, is plain insulting. Can you provide even a single post that suggests <i>anyone</i> has <i>ever</i> suggested syntax be a certain way just to be different?')
