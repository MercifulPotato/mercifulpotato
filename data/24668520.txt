Perhaps by asking a question or two, but if it&#x27;s something like &quot;we&#x27;re planning to start a major new project soon and we want the new head (i.e. you) to be there at the start&quot;, that seems likely to have come up early in the discussion of &quot;what would I be working on&quot;.<p>Also, the larger the company, and the less specialized the role, the higher is the likelihood that &quot;if you&#x27;re above their competency threshold, then there&#x27;s some team somewhere that needs more people even if they hire someone else for this role&quot;.')
