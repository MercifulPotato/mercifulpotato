Neither the UK nor the US are dystopian or anywhere close to it. You can call Trump and Brexit bad results, but <i>the people</i> voted for that. It was their choice. Saying that we need limits on speech so that people wouldn&#x27;t vote for them sounds dystopian instead.<p>On top of that, I&#x27;d argue that while the US and the UK aren&#x27;t doing great as a result of those choices people made, you can&#x27;t really know that they were disastrous choices. For one, the US and UK haven&#x27;t gotten themselves into another war, which sounds like a major upside to me.')
