Can that really not be considered an endorsement of twitter&#x27;s content with respect to AWS&#x27; ToS? It&#x27;s not like twitter just signed up for an AWS account like the rest of us do. There was a bidding and negotiation process. Sales teams on both sides worked on that contract. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s so unreasonable to take the existence of that contract as evidence that AWS reviewed twitter&#x27;s content and deemed it acceptable content.<p>Why does this matter? Legally, I don&#x27;t think it does. I don&#x27;t see any good reason why AWS shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to selectively enforce their ToS.<p>But Parler sought to compete directly with twitter. At the time of account termination, they were growing at a rate of hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of users <i>per day</i>, and in a way where it&#x27;s not hard to imagine it being zero-sum (twitter users terminating their accounts and going to parler).<p>I don&#x27;t think the case would succeed, but I do think that parler can make an interesting case about AWS picking a winner and damaging a loser.')
