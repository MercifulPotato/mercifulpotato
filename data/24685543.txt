I am sure there is a lot of room for improvement and that would go a long way! But it also seems to me that with the language as it is now, the compiler simply doesn&#x27;t have enough information to provide good error messages. E.g. there is no way to express the idea that something needs to be iterable to the compiler. Or that you expect an argument to be a function of a certain type. I&#x27;d love to be wrong on this though. :)')
