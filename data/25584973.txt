The US government is responsible for this hideous law. I&#x27;m not anti-vax by any stretch, but there have been many, many cases of the current vaccine and millions of other vaccine issues besides and there is nothing the average person can do. The US government indemnified the pharm companies. I&#x27;m so sick of the little man taking the crappy end of the stick. It would be great to see someone like AOC take on big pharma. If anyone can it, she can. She seems like the type who would relish this task. Hopefully the incoming POTUS will offer her a position where she can take some of these evils to task. I&#x27;m not getting my hopes up.')
