It&#x27;s a GPL release.\n2. None of the rewards are happening in some far-future date. It&#x27;s all in October (of which there is 15 days left).<p>Essentially, the proposition is that we the community <i>pay</i> and they will relicense it to GPL. If we pay <i>more</i> then they licence to BSD.<p>Using Kickstarter to pay for essentially finished goods isn&#x27;t really the point of the system, and won&#x27;t really work without a marketing campaign. Now, if grassroots were behind this, then a paid marketing campaign wouldn&#x27;t be necessary... but the actual customers of ScriterJS, are commercial companies already paying for a licence and won&#x27;t benefit from a GPL release.<p>Elsewhere in this thread, people talk about the goodwill the companies will gain if they pay for this project to be open sourced. However open source goodwill is only generated by popular projects, who <i>market</i> their sponsors. The lack of marketing around the kickstarter, would make companies think that their sponsorship won&#x27;t receive much PR as well.<p>Lastly, one must ask why the company behind ScriterJS doesn&#x27;t simply open source it themselves for goodwill and let a community grow organically to support it (via donations or code)? While no one can guarantee on-going support indefinitely, the way this projects release is being positioned makes me think its going to be an abandoned code-dump.<p>All said, it looks like a commercial company wants to dump their product. If they can get enough money, they&#x27;ll open source it. If not, they&#x27;ll just let long-tail revenue trickle in for the next few years to get the same sum of money.')
