And they don’t advertise any upload bandwidth.  And the download bandwidth they advertise are temporary burst speeds they get from degrading others’ speeds.<p>Cable companies have an incentive to continue allocating their bandwidth for cable tv channels, and offering the bare minimum (see lack of upload) to internet subscribers since there’s usually no competition.  And I’m not an engineer or anything, so while I can’t say for sure if coaxial cable is inferior to fiber optic, the fact that every single fiber connection I’ve used is far snappier and higher bandwidth than coaxial cable leads me to believe it is true, at least for all practical matters.')
