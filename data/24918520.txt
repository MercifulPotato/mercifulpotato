It&#x27;s an actual term with a specific meaning.<p>It means specifically misrepresenting a cultural practice in order to make another culture look inferior. E.g. if you take something that isn&#x27;t actually anything like what the Egyptians ate and tell everyone how terrible it is, then that would be cultural appropriation. Making bread the way the Egyptians made it would not be cultural appropriation, nor would selling it.')
