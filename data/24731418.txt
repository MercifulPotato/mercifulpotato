This.<p>Thinking is hard and it requires training and conditioning to do. I&#x27;m not talking about what to think, but rather how to think.<p>It&#x27;s an incredible convenience to delegate thinking, like the difference between spending 3 hours debugging some code versus having the answer readily available on StackOverflow.<p>Conversely, that convenience comes with a cost of a stunted intellect, where an individual can become so dependent StackOverflow that they are incapable of doing something new or difficult if it hasn&#x27;t already been done.<p>Neither is necessarily better or worse, there are good arguments for the &quot;hard way&quot; and the &quot;easy way&quot;.
