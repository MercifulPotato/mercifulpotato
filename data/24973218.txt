They had received over $10M in venture capital several years ago, and had been running their own servers at some point because I found some of them in their warehouse.<p>At some point they had switched to AWS, and then at a later point switched to GC. When I encountered them they had shut down due to lack of funding.<p>Their servers were running in zombie mode racking up over $6k per month in charges. Data export would have cost over $10k. They were also renting warehouse and office space.<p>They had very few assets, and not enough income to cover expenses.<p>If their server costs had been reasonable, they might have survived, but they couldn&#x27;t bring those costs down.')
