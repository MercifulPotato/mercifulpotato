Speed limit for the area&#x2F;road I am in.<p>My 2018 Honda Accord uses the camera to read speed limit signs and displays them in both the heads up display and in the middle of the gauge cluster.<p>Then I use Google Maps with CarPlay to offset some of that other information. It will alert if an alternate route becomes faster, or a wreck is ahead. I&#x27;ve also found it&#x27;s been pretty good to know about road closures as well.')
