As with many people with decorated history, though, he had some blind spots. One of these was that he was thoroughly enamoured with his own skill at training an air force:<p>&gt; <i>Q: Of all the pilots you&#x27;ve flown iwth, which do you respect the most and why?A:  In 1971-73, I flew with the Pakistan Air Force in the war with India. They were the best in the world because they had the most experience - over 75 hours&#x2F;month.</i><p>In 1971, the PAF was decisively routed after attempting a pre-emptive strike, leaving their navy (and soon they were gone too) and their ground forces with no air cover. The outcome was that Pakistan was split in two and lost half her territory despite the US dispatching the <i>USS Enterprise</i> (with Task Force 74) and the UK dispatching the <i>HMS Eagle</i> in support.')
