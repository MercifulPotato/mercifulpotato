Not only do you have less resources to learn and grow, you have a massive handicap to find good work as most work is outside of the country.<p>Only bet is to leave the country but even there you have a very low probability as you basically can&#x27;t have a trial period for your job as most companies don&#x27;t want to risk having their accounts blocked.<p>Most of us here know how degrading and infuriating the tech recruiting processes can be and now add to it the horrors of working from Iran.<p>Wars are not supposed to have civilian casualties but this one has a generation of civilians being starved of information and experience critical for them to grow.')
