Eventually you just have to sit down with them and lay down the ground rules on what is and isn&#x27;t acceptable.<p>Once they get over the initial stage of complaining they eventually convert and can&#x27;t understand why they ever did it wrong in the first place... just like junior software engineers.<p>The snowflake part where they feel they are somehow different and entitled to use poor processes and force poor tools and ecosystems on everyone else though really does irk me.\nYes your field is quickly expanding, yes your salary is probably over-inflated vs your competence and experience but that doesn&#x27;t make you special.')
