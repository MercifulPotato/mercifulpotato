Most of my coworkers complain about feeling isolated and looking forward to returning to the office, and I don&#x27;t feel like I can tell them that I much prefer the current situation.<p>With WFH, I now have enough flexibility to work whenever I want to, which allows me to indulge my night owl instincts without it affecting my work, and also allows me to nap whenever I need during the day.<p>I am already a major homebody, so staying home almost every day fits me very well. I don&#x27;t have a great need to meet people face-to-face, so the fact that most meetings are voice only works very well for me as well. Social interactions at work always stresses me out a bit, as I feel like I have to put on a performance whenever it happens.<p>I am not looking forward to when COVID-19 is under control and the office opens, as my employer has made it clear that we are all expected to return to the office once it is safe. Not only do I have to put on a performance all day long, I lose the commute time and flexibility of work hours.')
