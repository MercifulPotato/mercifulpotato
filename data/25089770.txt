I agree that if possible it would be good to remove avenues for bias to sneak in (such as by implementing blind auditions). Although without knowledge that bias exists, it might be hard to find the motivation to implement those changes. And sometimes even with motivation it might be hard to implement technical changes like that.<p>I agree we should hire the best people. I agree compensating for bias is not as good as eliminating bias. My hope is that in cases where technical changes can&#x27;t be done, self-reflection might allow people to reduce their own bias.')
