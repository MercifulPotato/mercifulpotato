When the RFID antennas would need a reboot I had to go to the deep freeze storage (-40 Celsius), walk in with a ladder, climb the ladder, switch off and then on (IT crowd style), wait to see the green light bleeping, and then climb down and leave as fast as I could.\nThe whole thing would take 40-50 seconds (I was counting EVERY time). I couldn&#x27;t wear gloves, because ladder&#x2F;switch. I was wearing all other gear though. Touching anything (aluminum ladders get cold very fast at -40)(so are walls, switches, everything).\nI did this process a couple of times wearing just jeans and tshirt. In that &quot;less than a minute&quot; my clothes would freeze solid, the wool was hardning and it felt like wearing a plank. Same with jeans.<p>In other cold related story, I was in a &quot;cold country&quot;, out in the open, -25 Celsius, my phone rang, my gloves didn&#x27;t have the electro-thingie so I couldn&#x27;t &quot;slide to answer&quot; so I too my glove off, answered, talked for 60 seconds. Then I went to a warm pub, and after 10mins I could bend my fingers again.<p>Yes cold can .... you up badly in seconds.')
