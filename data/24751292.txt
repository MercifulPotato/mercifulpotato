It’s actually about environmental issues. It uses words like growth, efficiency, and competition, markets, economic incentives, etc. It’s a serious plan for addressing climate change using modern tools of governance. (The “no person left behind” point isn’t an amorphous reference to social justice, but is referring specifically to those affected by decarbonization, like coal workers.)<p>The GND, by contrast, spends tremendous amounts of ink addressing unions, guaranteed jobs, guaranteed housing, racial justice, gender equity, income inequality, indigenous people, the disabled, migrants, historical oppression, etc. It’s a wishlist, not a serious framework for addressing climate change.')
