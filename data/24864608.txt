My problem is that they keep making the wrong choices.<p>This is your opinion. The world does not revolve around you. Do you honestly expect in a relationship that your spouse always revolves around your terms - and only your terms - and will not have terms of their own? Is it not fair Apple has their own terms? They don&#x27;t want to be abused by their customers anymore than you do from them.<p>Apple has always made it obvious who they&#x27;re customer is. That is someone that doesn&#x27;t know anything about computers and wants email and stuff to work without problems as time goes on - so Apple to makes sure they hold the rights to update and secure things to ensure that product works for these customers.<p>Again, you are not the customer apple is trying to cater to. Steve Jobs himself never wanted to sell &quot;computers which only nerds could use&quot;. He wanted to sell &quot;an appliance which anyone&#x27;s grandmother could use&quot;. Super customizability that you want was never their product! Don&#x27;t buy it and then complain they&#x27;re being a jerk when they stated what their terms were...')
