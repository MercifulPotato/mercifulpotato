Basically, Bulgaria is not willing to recognize the Macedonian language, with their vice-prime-minister recently saying it&#x27;s the &quot;Esperanto language on the Balkans&quot;. They&#x27;re also veto  Macedonia&#x27;s EU membership negotiations. It&#x27;s an ongoing, heated discussion which has (unfortunately) caused hatred between the countries (North Macedonia and Bulgaria have been mostly friendly between each other in the past).')
