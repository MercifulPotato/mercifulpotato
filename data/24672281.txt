What if that 30% means that since they have a larger company they wind up with the same margins as Spotify or even worse? What if Apple Music making money subsidized other free software that Apple releases like Numbers and Pages?<p>30% is the reward they get for making great business decisions, and as far as competition goes I don’t really think Apple is that serious. Apple Music is an evolution of iTunes, which has been an Apple product for 20 years.<p>If Spotify wasn’t profitable it wouldn’t exist. Apple’s platform makes that business possible on mobile. If Spotify’s investors weren’t content with making the money they are making now, Spotify can fold up. There is no reason that they have to make a “fair” profit or the same amount of money as Apple Music. None.<p>When you look at the App Store ecosystem it is incredibly healthy and competitive. There are numerous music apps, all making a ton of money. I have no sympathy here.')
