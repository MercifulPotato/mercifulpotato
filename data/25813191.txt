At the moment the vast majority of negative feedback on HN has been &quot;it sucked&quot; without giving a hint of what actually went wrong.<p>Your two modes of suggested contact (HN, GitHub) ensure only a certain type of user will contact (both require tech skills and a login). If there really are UX issues, you might want to encourage different types of users to give feedback (and if the fear is that the feedback won&#x27;t be detailed&#x2F;useful, maybe a guided form can help).')
