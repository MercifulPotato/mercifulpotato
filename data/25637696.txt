They are hulking behemoths that require the constant effort of lots of skilled programmers to keep working and up-to-date with the rapidly moving ecosystem around them. X11 cannot keep up with new hardware. The web cannot keep up with its maintenance load. They&#x27;re well beyond the point of redemption.<p>In fact, they&#x27;re both classic examples of the opposite approach to what my article argues for: they <i>did not</i> start saying &quot;no&quot; to ideas. They never constrained their scope to focus on stability and longevity. A website which works today could easily be broken tomorrow, which has only become true in recent memory. These are excellent examples of the consequences of not holding true to the ethos I describe.')
