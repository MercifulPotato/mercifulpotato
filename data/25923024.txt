If two pieces of code are driven by separate requirements, eg, the price of two items is typically based on very different business situations, unless the two items are flavors of the same beverage perhaps, then the fact they share a price is an accident of the current state of the business, not dictated by a common requirement that they both be $1.50.<p>If both have to calculate sales tax because of the same statute, then don&#x27;t implement the calculation twice. If a new statute changes that situation, for instance due to a sugar tax, split the code when the new requirement comes in.')
