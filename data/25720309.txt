Nearly every cloud vendor product above the infrastructure layer is a version of something that exists already in the world. When you outsource management of that to your cloud vendor you might lose 50% of the need to operationally manage that product but about 50% of it is irreducible. You still need internal competence in understanding that infrastructure and one way or another you&#x27;re going to develop it over time. But if its your cloud vendor&#x27;s proprietary stack then you are investing all your internal learning into non-transferrable skills instead of ones that can be generalised.')
