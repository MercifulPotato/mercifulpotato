Reading all of the papers on my condition gave me another effective option that not only 1) avoided the procedure, but also 2) if I had gotten the procedure, it&#x27;s the kind of procedure that would have to be repeated every few years when the symptoms reoccurred. Turned out that a far cheaper, less arduous treatment could hold off symptoms indefinitely. I&#x27;m grateful to Elbakyan every day, and am also long past when I would have probably had a second or third occurance.')
