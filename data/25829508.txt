This is still only in certain places (I notice you mention tourist destinations--yes, that&#x27;s the kind of place I would expect this to be done), not &quot;everywhere&quot;, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t mean that you or I as sober drivers can relax and believe that we are not still at risk from other drivers possibly being drunk. But I agree it does go beyond only enforcing the laws when someone has already made a mistake (unless you count &quot;driving into a visible DUI checkpoint when you know you&#x27;re drunk&quot; as a mistake).')
