I think you are wrong about installer on their platform being up for grabs being &quot;much better for society&quot; because I don&#x27;t think you are considering all of the second and third order consequences.<p>Consider this passes and then the Facebook app (or, probably even worse, Amazon) immediately becomes an app store. At that point what&#x27;s to stop them from loading and running literally <i>any</i> arbitrary code on the phone&#x27;s of everyone who updates the facebook app? Same goes for an &quot;utility class&quot; app where consumers have limited choice of competitors. Sure, technically inclined people might figure it out and try to raise a stink, but I guess I don&#x27;t feel like the public understanding of this is good enough for this not to end badly?  Remember the &quot;Facebook Research&quot; VPN[1]? And as a society we would be trading this massive surveillance liability for... the opportunity for a handful of developers to make a killing creating a competing store? an upper middle class group to make more money? Apple to make less money?<p>Sorry, but we live in a world of Titans, and me, the little  guy, can&#x27;t really stand up to them. At least for the moment I can stand behind Apple.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;29&#x2F;facebook-project-atlas&#x2F;?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9kdWNrZHVja2dvLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMzGx97y7CItwtgWy83PZgIn7u1GTKV7JHxpeWAxvXTFgJRj6XRg3nRQ2ZG3X4MeatGSTanojvin4Dxoeqicub7tddfDEoh3m7sOWsCQI4hGBqj0ZCkUxzeLaBM08l3GBPRqlRze5SVP1ik_0t5xzKfOn_zYVyeXL8kZ9vfQ8ARq" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;29&#x2F;facebook-project-atlas&#x2F;?gu...</a>')
