Shipping graphics libraries with it wasn’t, but you can’t blame them for writing their own. What should they have picked? X Windows is from June 1984.<p>Quickdraw 3D, one could argue, should have been based on OpenGL, I don’t think it was clear that would be a winner on the desktop in 1995. Also, they started with usability in mind, supporting easy copy-paste of models working, something OpenGL doesn’t aim for (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;OpenGL%2B%2B" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;OpenGL%2B%2B</a> did, but it started after QuickDraw 3D (and, like it, died))<p>AppleTalk, similarly, started with usability in mind, leading to the use of thinner cabling (at the time, ethernet cables had a diameter of almost 1 cm <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;10BASE5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;10BASE5</a>, required terminators, etc), easier configuration (plug in the cable, and you’re good) and also predates the realization that TCP&#x2F;IP is the winner, networking wise.<p>I don’t think anybody could have picked the')
