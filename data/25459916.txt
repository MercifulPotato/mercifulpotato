Even nations where one would actually expect some serious pushback (such as Scandinavian countries) can&#x27;t be bothered with much more than half-arsed measures.<p>I am 42. My &quot;kids these days&quot;... complaint is that &quot;kids these days are horribly fat&quot;. Compared to the 1990s, yeah, fitness of the young generation has gone down significantly.<p>It is not their fault, but their parents&#x27; and schools&#x27;, but the consequences are the same; a lifetime spent in frustrating struggle with weight gain and chronic diseases.')
