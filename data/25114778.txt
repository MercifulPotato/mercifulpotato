I&#x27;m actually very keen to learn much more about the covid cases around you.<p>What symptoms did they display? What was the timeline of their symptoms, or how did their illness develop&#x2F;proceed? How soon after initial infection, did person-to-person infection begin? When were the infections&#x2F;illnesses occurring (Feb&#x2F;Mar&#x2F;Apr? Or more recently?) What are the symptoms that stood out to you&#x2F;them the most? What made them think that it was covid vs another upper respiratory disease? Did they get tested, what tests were used, and how accurate were those tests? What were the treatments, and treatment modalities that were recommended to them by public health officials or private physicians? Do they have post-illness physical records you&#x27;re willing to share?<p>I, too, (and I&#x27;m sure we all do) have quite a bit of other anecdata I could share - in my workplace, a number of people and their families have been infected. There&#x27;s a wide variance of experiences - from very mild, to multiple deaths. I chose not to include that information because I couldn&#x27;t verify their disease progression, or symptom development, or treatment regime. I can provide that actual in-depth information on my experience, based on counsel from my physician and medical health professionals.<p>Ultimately, the most important questions: how do you create policy for a population, when their experiences are so different? Is this really the best we and our governments can do?')
