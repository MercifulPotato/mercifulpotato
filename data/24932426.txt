Even if colonize space, it is not going to happen in any significant scale the next 100 years.<p>So, maybe we are doomed because people in power will always want more power and that creates a downwards spiral for non-growing societies. Maybe that is the &quot;great filter&quot; that await for us.<p>I believe that societies will accommodate for the new situation. Not only Americans, but humans, always do the right thing after trying everything else.')
