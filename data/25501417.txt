The idea of &quot;freedom of speech&quot; was formed during a period of time when there were natural barriers to speech such that bat shit crazy qanon conspiracy theories and other such nonsense couldn&#x27;t propagate widely. Nobody ever intended &quot;freedom of speech&quot; to equal a right to use a frictionless machine to propagate lies to billions.<p>Prior to the internet you could for the most part visually distinguish between the crazy and the legitimate - the crazy was in crayon on cardboard scraps, full of misspellings. The higher quality crazy was type written on a misaligned sheet of paper, thick with whiteout, still full of misspellings. The legit was professionally edited and published. Not 100% of the time, but a good fraction of the time.<p>Now we have spell checkers and grammar checkers and blog services like medium that make everything look really really good. That visual heuristic is gone. We need a way to invert our current equilibrium of &quot;it is easy to get bad information out, and hard to get good information out&quot; at least back to how it was: &quot;it is hard to get good information out, but it is even harder to get really bad information out.&quot; That isn&#x27;t censorship.<p>As for democracy in the US, as a US citizen I can tell you it is on the ropes, mostly due to social media, but it is better off today than it was four years ago just because people are at least starting to think about how to get social media under control.<p>Every freedom my parents, grandparents, and great grandparents had I have, and more. I&#x27;m hard pressed to identify a single one that is under attack.')
