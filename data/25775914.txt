Many members are describing receiving death threats from other members of congress. Some are yelling (without masks) at the capitol police because they&#x27;re being screened at metal detectors and unable to carry their guns into the Congressional halls&#x2F;chambers. It might help to read that a few times...it&#x27;s as if one of your coworkers had circulated a literal &quot;kill list&quot; with your name on it and been stopped attempting to bring guns to work. This is not acceptable behavior and egregiously illegal.')
