He was correct on his history, whether that is history you&#x27;d like to remember or not.  His transistor budget argument is very plausible, but without playing out an alternative history we can&#x27;t know, and by we I mean you.  At the time he wrote it he was correct on the power &#x27;virus,&#x27; and I can&#x27;t think of any good reason why he or anyone else owes Intel the benefit of the doubt that some future device would improve anything.<p>The AVX512 fanboi contingent will forever seethe about what Linus wrote.  Meanwhile Apple and AMD are eating Intel&#x27;s lunch with no 512 bit SIMD instruction units at all.  Linus had it right and and he is looking more correct every day.')
