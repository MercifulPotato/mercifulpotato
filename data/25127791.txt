The documentation was written when the project was in the design phase and the implementation differs in several ways, large and small. I want to document it for myself and those coming after me, and am missing a tool that will help me generate diagrams quickly for a high-level picture.\nI am familiar with Doxygen and Graphviz and will be using those. \nThe code is heavy on C++ templates, so bonus points if it &quot;gets&quot; templating.')
