That is to say: Crunchyroll may have copyrihgt-infringed upon anime, but they added value.<p>Most of the content on Crunchyroll was fansubbed by various IRC and torrent groups and used without permissions of the original copyright holders or of the fansub groups and without credit to the fansubbers.  So, actually, no, they didn&#x27;t need a team of translators, and there&#x27;s a lot of anime fans who refuse to do business with Crunchyroll because of their betrayal of the fansub community.')
