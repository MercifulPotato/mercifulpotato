It&#x27;s important for me. I don&#x27;t want to adapt everytime a designer thinks he has a good idea.<p>- Simplicity: it just works and is well configured out of the box<p>- Efficiency: not the lightest Desktop Manager in the market but it is light enough so it won&#x27;t eat resources for nothing<p>- Right level of complexity: there is enough to configure it to adapt it to your needs but not too much to make it a mess. Take the xfce console for example: you can rename tabs, move them and search text in them. Last time I check these features were not available in Gnome Terminal. But at the same time I don&#x27;t want much more than that.<p>Coherency is really important for me: Xfce has been there when Gnome &#x2F; Unity &#x2F; Gnome 3 &#x2F; Mate &#x2F; Cinnamon were confusing me by offering all the same but not really the same.<p>Edit: I wrote &quot;consistency&quot; instead of &quot;coherency&quot; but I guess the right term is coherency in this context.')
