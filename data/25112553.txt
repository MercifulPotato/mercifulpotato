Chess.com&#x27;s computer plays a bit more human-like, at least up to 1100, which is the computer level I&#x27;m currently playing against, but still not like a real human.<p>I would compare it as:\nlichess - best move, best move, best move, completely random move that does absolutely nothing\nchess.com - best move, good move, best move, blunder that seems patronizing given previous moves<p>I&#x27;ve only played a handful of games against real people online, but those games weren&#x27;t anything like either lichess or chess.com&#x27;s computer players.')
