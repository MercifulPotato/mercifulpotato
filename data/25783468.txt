Burritos at the local truck that I&#x27;m partial to are around $9, which seems par for the course around here.  I literally don&#x27;t know where it&#x27;s even possible to pay $15 for a burrito in SF, even at the fancier brick and mortar restaurants.  I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s one somewhere, but I&#x27;m also sure that the size weighted burrito cost in SF isn&#x27;t anywhere near 2.5x that of SD.  I&#x27;d be pretty surprised if it was even 1.5x.<p>Not an expert on the SD burrito scene, but looking at a random survey (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sandiego.eater.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;8&#x2F;8&#x2F;17660256&#x2F;california-burritos-best-mexican-food-san-diego" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sandiego.eater.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;8&#x2F;8&#x2F;17660256&#x2F;california-burr...</a> ) suggests that most of them are in the $6-8 range, for a smaller burrito than the SF Mission ones that are my point of comparison.  (Amusingly, that article actually does include a $15 burrito.)')
