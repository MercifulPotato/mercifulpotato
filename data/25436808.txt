Besides, real-estate investors attempt to keep their costs (interest, depreciation, etc) all <i>very</i> close to their revenue, not the other way around. Less revenue is simply less of a chance to deduct expenses (not to mention less money for them).<p>The only way I think it makes sense is if they&#x27;re <i>sure</i> they&#x27;re going to be able to rent it for more if they hold out in a way that would make up for the short term loss.')
