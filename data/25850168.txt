Use an iPhone, iPad, and Mac? They&#x27;ll switch (somewhat intelligently) between devices. I&#x27;m listening to music on my computer, get a call on my phone and answer it (which I could technically also answer on the computer), it&#x27;ll pause the music and switch the headphones to the phone to use with the call. When the call ends, I manually resume the music on the computer and the headphones switch back. Listening to an audiobook on my phone, and I switch to the iPad for a video it pauses the audiobook and switches the connection to the iPad. When I start up the audiobook it does the same in reverse.<p>The quality seems to be on par with many other wireless headphones I&#x27;ve used over the years, but I&#x27;m no audiophile.<p>Using other headphones, though, aren&#x27;t that big of a hassle. But you do have to manually switch which device they&#x27;re connected to (a two or three step process depending on device).')
