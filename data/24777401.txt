Unfortunately your last example (3rd party web services easily discovering when I need an oil change, or what days I&#x27;ve been driving aggressively) is the kind of hypothetical I would want laws actively preventing.<p>Arguably, it&#x27;s not this law&#x27;s job to introduce such a protection! But best I can tell, no other law covers it in MA. It is perfectly legal for 3rd parties to sell this and other data without my explicit consent or even an opportunity to opt out (I think only CA has such an opt-out [0]).<p>Granted, manufacturers already have and can sell this data with no recourse. But at least manufacturers have national brands which could be hurt by selling or leaking massive amounts of data about their customers. Perhaps some brands could even make privacy a selling point. It seems like this law erodes that thin shell of protection.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;leginfo.legislature.ca.gov&#x2F;faces&#x2F;billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB375" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;leginfo.legislature.ca.gov&#x2F;faces&#x2F;billNavClient.xhtml?...</a>')
