But that is not really the case, they just wanted people to pay up.<p>If you care about ECC, you pay for Xeon. Majority of consumers don&#x27;t run critical applications on their devices, so they are happy with a cheap device that may crash once in a while.<p>AMD is only changing the game because they are trying to undercut Intel. They have been putting pro features into all of their CPUs including over-clocking, extra PCIE lanes and ECC.<p>Honestly, what is the point of bullet-proof hardware when the software reliability (at least on consumer devices) has gone down to two nines.')
