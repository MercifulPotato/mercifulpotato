An uncommon side effect of Montelukast is vivid nightmares and sleep paralysis. Itâ€™s a relativity common asthma control medication, but was recently moved to a not-recommended status for younger people because of this side effect. My personal experience was pretty intense nightmares 1-2 times a week if I took it before bed. Taking early in the day stopped this side effect.')
