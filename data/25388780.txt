You can get some hands-on using the Hercules emulator, but it&#x27;s running old versions of the OSes due to licensing.  That can give you the basics, tho, because Mainframe OSes tend to be pretty stable over time.<p>Beyond that, IBM has a ton of educational resources you could leverage.  At one time they had a program where you could get an account on a mainframe, but I don&#x27;t know if they do that any more.<p>Udemy has some mainframe&#x2F;Cobol tracks.

These days, you could probably find one that does it on-line.')
