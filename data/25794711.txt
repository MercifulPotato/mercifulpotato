It hasn&#x27;t stopped things like TikTok, Instagram, etc... The modern world is installing apps. It&#x27;s not a meaningful barrier.<p>What you&#x27;re describing with organic evolution into programming is a cool property of things like Excel, yes. But you don&#x27;t get that by just bundling an IDE into a browser, either. You still have that barrier of the user needs to decide they want to program. Which they don&#x27;t want to do when they&#x27;re just browsing reddit or whatever, that&#x27;s not a natural evolution path like the Excel one.')
