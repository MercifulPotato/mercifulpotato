We just raised a $50 Series C from Sequoia (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.sourcegraph.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;series-c-with-sequoia&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.sourcegraph.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;series-c-with-sequoia&#x2F;</a>) so we accelerate our mission to enable everyone to code.<p>Universal Code Search helps developers find and discover code by providing the ability to quickly search across all code using regular expressions and advanced filters. Sourcegraph code intelligence helps developers navigate and understand code by providing hover tooltips, go-to-definition, and find-references, when viewing code on Sourcegraph or on a code host (via our browser extension). Sourcegraph campaigns enable developers to fix and evolve code at scale by automating search-and-replace and running arbitrary tools across massive codebases.<p>We are a completely transparent company and you can learn more about how we operate by reading our handbook: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.sourcegraph.com&#x2F;handbook" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.sourcegraph.com&#x2F;handbook</a>.
