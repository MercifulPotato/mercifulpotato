She is arguing against &quot;superstition and tradition&quot; in areas where they have failed to solve problems that science <i>has</i> solved.<p>Nor is she advocating for compassion without reason. Compassion is not there to make you feel bad; it&#x27;s there to motivate you to <i>use your reason to fix a problem</i>. For example, the author&#x27;s compassion for the mother whose stove set fire to her apartment motivates her to advocate for stoves with smoke sensors and automatic shut-off valves. If all you do with your compassion is feel bad, you&#x27;ve missed the point.')
