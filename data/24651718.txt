IANAL, so I don&#x27;t know what the term for this would be, but it <i>does</i> seem like you&#x27;d get in trouble -- fraud?<p>I assume you&#x27;d somehow slip eventually and get caught, and likely be sued by both companies, with an incredible headache for both companies&#x27; sets of lawyers as they try to figure out what to do with the code you committed, and if they can even use it anymore at all.')
