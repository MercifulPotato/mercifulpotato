Item(by='jVinc', descendants=None, kids=[25932805, 25932847], score=None, time=1611704624, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25922160, text='Front running is simplistically placing your own orders in front of your customers orders based on the knowledge that the customers orders will be executed.<p>Buying at better than requested rates and reselling to a customer based on a request from that customer to buy at a specific point is not front-running the customers order, it&#x27;s literally just carrying out the customers order, but pocketing the difference between what you can find buy the asset at and what the customer decided to pay.<p>Think of this, you pay someone a fixed amount to buy you a PS5. When he gets to the shop there is a sale, so he pays less than he expected and less than you expected, but he&#x27;s fulfilling your order at the agreed price so he pockets the difference. That&#x27;s not front-running. He is making money fulfilling your order, but it&#x27;s not front-running.<p>Now second scenario imagine you again pay a fixed amount for him to get you a PS5. He comes back saying &quot;sorry, but they didn&#x27;t have any left ... but I just happen to have bought 4 myself before I could fulfill your order, I&#x27;m willing to sell you one at an elevated price&quot;. \nThat&#x27;s front-running. He executed his own order, in front of the one he was carrying out for you, with the knowledge that he would be able to make money because of your order.<p>Note that the illegal part is not &quot;making money by buying and selling something&quot;. It&#x27;s perfectly legal for someone to buy the last PS5 and resell it at a higher price to make money. The illegal part carrying out such an order based on the inside knowledge of your pending order and front-running your order with their own.<p>Naturally this is rather fuzzy explanation, take it with a grain of salt.')
