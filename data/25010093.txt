When that occurs, advocate for - tell friends, vote, donate, etc. - the policy that you think is best for the city, even if it&#x27;s worse for you.<p>Residential zoning is a ready example because split positions come up all the time. I can&#x27;t count the number of times I&#x27;ve heard &quot;I agree that the city needs more housing and that the current zoning doesn&#x27;t make sense, but I like it the way it is.&quot;<p>While nobody&#x27;s going to fault you for putting yourself first, if you want to help improve the city, put it before yourself.<p>(Of course, often someone believes that a given policy is best for the city and it&#x27;s also their personal preference. In those cases, my comment doesn&#x27;t apply.)')
