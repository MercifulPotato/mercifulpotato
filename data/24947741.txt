This a something not new, that has been exploited more than once in science fiction, precisely because the diversity between humans is not enough (many would argue that there are not human races) or simply not enough to be a scenario for picturing vastly different realities, or a playground for a different role playing.<p>I won&#x27;t reply to unfortunate comments about plants but allow me to tell you that not only vegans agree on many of the the things that have been said regarding the domination of a species above others.\nAnd yes, even among vegans there are debates about wellbeing&#x2F;misfortunes of animals cause by other animals. \nAs many other topics concerning ethics, it&#x27;s open and, although science has helped much to set a path, much there is still to discuss.\nBy discuss, however, I mean tolerant and well-intentioned exchange of thought, not cheap attempts of mocking perspectives you don&#x27;t share.')
