They know who watches, how quickly, where, when, which series are abandoned by viewers, which episodes are abandoned by viewers, how series X performed with people who binged series Y.<p>I imagine they aren&#x27;t just saying that series X didn&#x27;t have a big enough audience, they are figuring based on their machine learning models, series X could not build a large enough audience to justify the production costs.<p>That the art suffers for the bottom line, while tragic,  is nothing new.')
