But still, comparing this idea to McCarthyism is sneaking toward Godwin&#x27;s Law territory.<p>There&#x27;s a pretty big gulf between a relatively abstract set of political and economic opinions, and an ideology that views some groups of people as sub-human and inherently criminal, and specifically seeks to disenfranchise them.
