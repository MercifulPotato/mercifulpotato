Fortunately, or unfortunately, I have greatly slowed down my woodworking operation. The table saw mainly serves as a horizontal surface. But in addition to what you mention, I&#x27;ve always followed some extra rules: First, I don&#x27;t design things that need dangerous saw cuts in the first place. Second, my fingers stay away from the blade because I don&#x27;t cut anything that small. This produces more scrap. Third, I plan and visualize the entire cut before I turn on the saw, and if it&#x27;s not going according to plan, I just shut it down.')
