You don&#x27;t lie to supposedly keep masks from being hoarded.  Considering that&#x27;s <i>exactly</i> what happened, I fail to see how it could have turned out much worse.<p>Just take a look at Fauci as an individual.  He&#x27;s never said masks don&#x27;t work.  He <i>did</i> say &quot;there&#x27;s no reason to be walking around with a mask,&quot; back in March, but, back in March, that was likely true.  And, it&#x27;s not like he hasn&#x27;t reversed himself when new data comes in.  That&#x27;s precisely <i>why</i> he still has credibility: because what he says is always in line with the best available data.')
