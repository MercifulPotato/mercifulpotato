Hardly the Swiss would think of it as a Swiss company. It‘s quite easy to set up a company in Switzerland. Few questions are asked. Swiss intelligence knew from 1993 that it is owned by the CIA and BND and did not rely on their machine. It was suspected for a long time that they are not safe. In addition, there are indications that the Military knew already in the 70‘s it is owned by the CIA through employees working there. The policy seemed to be observing, rather than investigating, so they wouldn‘t have to stop it.\nBut true, the Swiss should have blocked the whole operation.')
