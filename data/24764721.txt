But if you want styling information directly in the HTML, you can still do it with the &quot;style&quot;-attribute, using marginally more syntax. e.g. &lt;div style=&quot;display:table&quot;&gt; or &lt;div style=&quot;display:flex; flex-direction:row&quot;&gt; instead of table &lt;table&gt; where html table semantics are not appropriate.<p>I do find flexbox a much nicer model than tables, but I guess that comes down to taste. A flex is basically like a table with either a single column or a single row, and a bit more fine-grained control.')
