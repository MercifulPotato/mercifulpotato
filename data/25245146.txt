They get gobsmacked by their own writer&#x27;s voice and then their personality morphs to some monster. History has pivotal personalities that seem to fit this pattern of moderately intelligent authors being gobsmacked by the power of editorship, which causes them to elevate their personality into Uberman Insanity.')
