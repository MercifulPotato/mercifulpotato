The mitigation is to get rid of servers (and even ISPs), as per <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;02&#x2F;introducing-p-2-p-matrix&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;02&#x2F;introducing-p-2-p-matrix&#x2F;</a><p>&quot;Censorship&quot;, meaning: &quot;your server admin subscribed to a blocklist of child abuse content published by someone like iwf.org.uk&quot; would stand out to users by the server publishing the names of the blocklists that their server admin has deployed.  I&#x27;d call this server-side filtering or something instead, given the filters are visible.  If the server admin withholds info about their filters, then you&#x27;re back in the traditional sense of censorship from the prior paragraph.')
