Compared to HTML 4, there are only very minor additions like somewhat arbitrary sectioning elements. What has changed, though, around stagnant HTML, is an enormous amount of CSS and JS, making it impossible for a layman to create a basic site that doesn&#x27;t suck. As such, &quot;modern&quot; HTML has totally failed its intended purpose as an easy means for self-publishing, and a browser cartel has inflicted webapps onto us instead. This despite HTML, being based on SGML, had all the mechanisms for rational vocabulary evolution.')
