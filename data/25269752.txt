Being on win10, kernel32 links to api-console-... and I haven&#x27;t been able to find it on my system.  A few online downloads had it but, they don&#x27;t export `GetStdHandle` and `WriteFile`.  I thought maybe there was dynamic export generation going on because they did have those names as strings.<p>Edit: Also I believe ntdll doesn&#x27;t export `GetStdHandle` anymore.')
