Centralized authority, many content creators had their entire channels deleted without any recourse. This is a problem because laws are archaic and Youtube has to comply. If it was decentralized somehow then it won&#x27;t depend on whims and progress of individual governments. Youtube as a company has taken position that they are not going to be the one fight this fight, and they simply comply and over comply to and DMCA request. So what if youtuber gets deleted, there are plenty to replace them.<p>Perhaps this should also be seen as monopoly, who is a competitor to Youtube? nobody! May be had there been one, Youtube would have been more eager to please content creators and lobby to change laws. Despite exclusively benefiting from most internet user generated content, Youtube has decided to not fight a battle with lobbyists of other industries. They are in position and backing, but they are choosing a path that is focused on short term benefits and keeps ad publishers happy.')
