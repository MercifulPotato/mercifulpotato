I don&#x27;t see any reason why we can&#x27;t build an ad-hoc, citizen operated telecommunications infrastructure in the form of cheap mesh networks and distributed storage.<p>I would love to see a local-first&#x2F;backbone-last paradigm for internet usage. Screw all this walled garden app and corporate media pipeline. I just want to socialize and meet new people in the digital realm.<p>Having said that, I&#x27;ve been working on a hardware project I&#x27;ve been calling Walkie Texties. Basically a prototype of what a geolocal-first non-internet network might look like, sitting on top of 915MHz using LoRa.<p>I&#x27;m still learning hardware stuff and circuitpython has been a real godsend. Got a couple of these bad boys and plan to attach a LoRa capable Feather to the back.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adafruit.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;4818" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adafruit.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;4818</a><p>This is basically a ready-made geolocal-first chatroom platform. A Walkie Textie, you might say.<p>The range of LoRa is 1-2 miles in dense city and _over 200 miles_ line of sight with a pretty minimal antenna.<p>That&#x27;s pretty cool...')
