Body awareness, I realized is only possible if you have been athletic all your life, for most people that awareness is just not there. \nYoga is great - it stresses strength, flexibility and balance. And the complex movements bring attention to those &quot;weak&quot; muscles. I do it once a week with weight training and it has improved my flexibility and kept me injury free.')
