I&#x27;m not sure Ford even understands what friendship is.  His only attempts to frame it are through quotes of contrarian literati, which leads nowhere, especially without insights into the state of their lives when they spoke.  Without that, the references are largely purposeless and merely provocative.<p>Methinks Ford would have done better to define his personal notion of friendship by contrasting it to a model that most of us would recognize.  Thereafter it would make more sense to observe that, like many other authors, his need for companionship may be twisted or absent.  To explain this he could point to the origins of his state of mind — perhaps his profession, certainly his upbringing — the latter of which is the subject of his book, apparently.<p>But as it stands, this article doesn&#x27;t stand alone very well, and certainly doesn&#x27;t propose friendship to be victim to the general perversity of life during Covid, which is the thesis I inferred from its title.')
