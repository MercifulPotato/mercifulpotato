Item(by='throwawaygh', descendants=None, kids=[25909879], score=None, time=1611613509, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25905542, text='<i>&gt; It is technologically impossible to see votes being counted in real-time or to flip them</i><p>Dominion machines aren&#x27;t on the internet. Dominion doesn&#x27;t have centralized access to all of their machines.<p>Could they eg send out an army of technicians to every voting location and use some insane side-channel attack to physically read and flip bits from across the street? Sure. But by that logic it&#x27;s also &quot;not impossible&quot; for you or I to launch the US nuclear arsenal.<p>I think saying that &quot;it is technologically possible to see votes being counted in real-time or to flip them&quot; is &quot;technically correct&quot; but obviously not actually correct in any reasonable sense.')
