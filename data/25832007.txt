Everyone has a TV, so everyone pays the license fee. Wouldn&#x27;t it be simpler to just use a part of the taxes already collected to go to BBC.<p>My problem with this type of license fee collection is that it bring forward a number of costs associated with it that could be removed if it went directly from taxes and that today everyone has TV so it doesn&#x27;t really &quot;tax the rich&quot; that it probably was intended to do in the early days.')
