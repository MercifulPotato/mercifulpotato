Clement wasn&#x27;t feigning disinterest, his interest was in not granting an annulment. And Henry was able to appoint Cranmer, he was able to dictate his domestic situation freely, he had no real influence beyond the spiritual (which is why Henry left). I am not sure what you mean by &quot;world politics&quot;...that isn&#x27;t a term that makes sense in this context.<p>Also, the situation with Cummings isn&#x27;t remotely odd. What confuses people is recent history. Blair&#x2F;Brown was the archetype of why you don&#x27;t want a powerful Chancellor: Brown briefed against Blair and the govt constantly, his advisers used to attack other ministers, it was insane. Osborne&#x27;s relationship with Cameron was a function of seeing Brown attempt to destroy Blair.<p>But that isn&#x27;t always the case when there are issues with other Ministers or the Civil Service (both of which were true when Johnson took power). Thatcher is the prime example: almost everyone in the Tory party hated her, her 1981 Budget was made by Alan Walters not Howe, Lawson resigned when she opposed ERM (again, due to advice from Walters). Equally, in foreign policy she ignored her Ministers and, more importantly, the Foreign Office (who gave uniquely terrible, bizarre advice in this period...even by FO standards).<p>Our system is built with this tension in mind. Cameron had a strong policy unit. Blair didn&#x27;t have one but he relied on a small circle of Ministers so it wasn&#x27;t necessary. It is very normal, and quite necessary, for a Prime Minster to be hostage to no-one. The Prime Minister is always responsible to Parliament, that hasn&#x27;t changed. But the growth of the media, growth in complexity of policy, and growth in suspicion of the Civil Service (particularly after the 70s) has led to this requirement.<p>And btw, I don&#x27;t think most people in the public understand how ludicrous the situation with Javid was (it generally wasn&#x27;t reported because the person in question was liked by the media because they leaked). Javid&#x27;s advisers were actively briefing against the govt daily. When Javid was sacked, his advisers were out there literally the day after briefing against the govt. It wasn&#x27;t close. It wasn&#x27;t even remotely close. It is a very good thing that SPADs get taken down a peg because the massive proliferation in their number since the early 90s has meant some attempting to adopt a remit that vastly exceeds their purpose.')
