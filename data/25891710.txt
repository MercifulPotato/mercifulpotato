Got 60+ registrations, which was a fairly good response.<p>Then I launched the actual product on the first weekend of 2021 &amp; posted it on multiple places- subreddits, IndieHacker &amp; HackerNews.Even though the response was not as good as the pre-launch, but I got 2 people buying it in the first week(one just simply bought it &amp; for the second, I had to exchange few emails to convert)<p>After one week, I launched on ProductHunt &amp; it was a flop! My product remained the last product of the day from midnight(I guess maybe it&#x27;s their ranking algo which induces some negative snowball effect).<p>Right now I just keep on posting on random-new platforms for side-hustles &amp; sending a few cold-emails to users from PH &amp; IH - which I got from my dataset :) along with those who registered early- trying to pitch them my product.But the site visitors rate remains infinitesimal &amp; I haven&#x27;t made a single sale afterward.<p>Please share your wisdom &amp; tell me what am I doing wrong here? I still believe that my idea is useful to the makers community &amp; don&#x27;t want to give up on it.')
