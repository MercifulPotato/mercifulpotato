I personally think one of the major downsides to learning Rust is how quickly the language is moving.<p>I first started looking into Rust in ~2015, but it seems most hobby projects from that time won&#x27;t even compile today.<p>It feels like there are non-breaking changes to the language almost weekly. I still cannot figure out if I should be using nightly rust, stable rust, or switching back and forth depending on the project.<p>Overall I think Rust is doing a lot of great things, but I&#x27;m not sure it is handling the &quot;mess of features&quot; aspect of programming languages particularly well.')
