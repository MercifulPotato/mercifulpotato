I wish companies would stop buying this snake oil, because when the platforms <i>do</i> get old, the companies will take their time migrating off them. The platform will be sold to some tiny support shop in Bumfuck, Nowhere, who will gladly send representatives to HQ to renegotiate the support contract. So despite it being a pain in the ass to literally everyone who touches it, it somehow stays in the company because millions or even billions&#x27; worth of business goes through it, and replicating the exact logic in $SENSIBLE_LANGUAGE is not an expense the VP or CTO will approve because &quot;what we have works fine&quot;. So supporting it, integrating with it, and coding around it falls to the schlubs on the dev teams. Schlubs... like me.')
