Item(by='tluyben2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609483202, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25600147, text='I am not a big btc fan, I made some money with it and I like the concept somewhat for the purpose it is meant for.<p>But this btc is used for drugs, human trafficking etc is getting somewhat weird: sure it is, but normal money is far more. So you do not use that either? That is in fact regulated and more expensive and still human traffickers use it all the time. So I do not see the point: in the end btc is easier to follow than a suitcase of dollars coming from Medellin where it was taken from children in the sex trade. So not sure what you mean there besides parotting this point. Private groups and govs have advanced systems for doxxing \nBtc accounts: they were a bit late to start but now that mining is basically impossible, it is far easier to follow than dollar bills.<p>Also WU cash point to point money is quite well known for being off the taxes radar in most countries (for some reason): the remittance to the homeland of (illegally) earned money via WU and evade taxes back home is probably it&#x27;s biggest usecase which is why they can use these depressingly bad rates.')
