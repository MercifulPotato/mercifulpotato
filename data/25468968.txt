Much cheaper to carry that than some of the GPS&#x2F;beacon devices sold to hikers. Image detection is already a common ML tool for Earth observation analysis so building in something that looks for that marker in a known area of forest sounds possible.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.westmarine.com&#x2F;WestAdvisor&#x2F;Selecting-a-Radar-Reflector" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.westmarine.com&#x2F;WestAdvisor&#x2F;Selecting-a-Radar-Ref...</a>')
