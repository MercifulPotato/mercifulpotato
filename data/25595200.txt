But college is a broad term; you can study electrical engineering or gender studies and get a master&#x27;s degree either way, yet these are very different fields and require very different skills.  Relatively more girls pick gender studies over electrical engineering.<p>It&#x27;s possible that boys outperform girls in every single field, but averaged over all fields, it appears the other way around (Simpson&#x27;s Paradox).  I wonder if there is any data that shows girls&#x27; superior performance broken down by field.')
