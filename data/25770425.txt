If I cannot live in a country where a politician, of any background, cannot call on their supporters to protest, I will do like my parents did and emigrate.<p>I cannot believe this is going on in America. This  is exactly why my parents left their country to come here. They thought people were free to talk and believe here, independent of the actions of others in their group. This is insanity at every level. I cannot believe I&#x27;m seeing Americans go along with it, and there&#x27;s only one politician in the opposition party (Tulsi Gabbard) with any gumption to downright criticize it.<p>&gt; IMO he should&#x27;ve been banned from Twitter on the spot after he retweeted a video of a gut shouting white power at a bunch of black people<p>Oh my goodness, this is such a farce. I remember that video, and you have to have super hearing to even decipher that. Without the transcript, I wouldn&#x27;t even have heard it. He also took it down once people brought it up.<p>In conclusion, I am stunned. Throughout his entire term and his entire 2016 campaign, he has not once called for violence, and yet I hear continuously how evil he is. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris calls for an uprising, Maxine waters to confront people wherever they go and not leave them in peace, Pelosi denies there is any rioting at all and refuses to condemn it, etc, and I am to believe that Donald Trump told people to vandalize the US capitol. Unlike all the politicians I mentioned above, the moment Trump heard about the violent breakins, he immediately told people to go home. That puts him on a wholly different moral playing field than Harris and Biden who took many days or weeks to even acknowledge the violence over the summer. I cannot believe this. I thought political speech was allowed in America.')
