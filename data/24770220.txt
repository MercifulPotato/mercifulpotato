Instead of plugging in a lightning cable, I can now stick a hockey puck to the back of my phone?<p>The “safe” in MagSafe came from its “yankability” without sending your device flying. But if my phone is laying on top of a hockey puck...it’s gonna go flying if I trip on the cable.<p>Why couldn’t we fill in the lightning port and use flush surface contacts, like the MagSafe of yesteryear?<p>I’m also not sure why my case needs to magnetize to my device, getting rid of the lip around the screen that made it less cringe to lay my phone face down.<p>Am I missing something? I really don’t understand this feature.<p>EDIT: did I see an AirPower reboot in there or am I dreaming?')
