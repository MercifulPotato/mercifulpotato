It&#x27;s quite possible for a human to live in the wilderness alongside the aforementioned wolves (I saw a pack in the distance as late as yesterday). As you say, this sub-thread isn&#x27;t about that, though. :)<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, large parts of the remote and sparsely populated areas are being slowly de-populated anyway. Things like coal mines and other obsolete resource extraction sites are shutting down, and most people move on over time. And then there&#x27;s morons like me and my family, who moved out because we want to. There&#x27;s more people like that, but it&#x27;s not really enough to worry about.<p>Long story short: If someone is staying behind when businesses, stores and schools close, and the ageing infrastructure crumbles, well, then you&#x27;re not going to convince that person to move anyway.')
