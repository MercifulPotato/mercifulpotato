A crowd that might be described as having similar flaws to PG.<p>Maybe it would have been more accurate for me to say &quot;culturally relevant&quot;. He is increasingly seen by younger people, even engineering types, as out of touch and tone deaf. And too many of his recent essays feel like they are a reaction to that. So much patting himself on the back about how the crowds are wrong and he as such an independent thinker has got it right - and so little vulnerability. My gut tells me that he is trying a little too hard to convince himself and others.<p>He&#x27;d be a far better essayist if he were more like Johnny Cash at the end of his life and less like Liam Gallagher.')
