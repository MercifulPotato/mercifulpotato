Well, it tells you that there&#x27;s <i>probably</i> some causative connection between smoking and cancer, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t give you a &quot;safe&quot; threshold beneath which you can smoke without risk.<p>Also, shouldn&#x27;t you be more concerned about oral cancers and cardiovascular disease? I understand most people don&#x27;t inhale cigar smoke into their lungs like they do cigarette smoke, so you would certainly expect the lung cancer risk increases to be relatively lower.')
