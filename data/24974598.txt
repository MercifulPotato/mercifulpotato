Have moved FB, Linkedin and Github account emails to my own domain so far. So much else to move (a very long tail), but I&#x27;m feeling pretty good already.<p>Btw: Most of these large social sites allow registering multiple emails for a user. That seems sane to use if your attack model primarily is Google attacking you by cancelling you. Keep one gmail email, and add one with your own domain. That&#x27;s also a backup in case you mess up somehow with domain.')
