Because whooboy, lemme tell ya... Speaking as a parent, I can honestly say there is nobody more judgemental than other parents. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve heard parents criticize other people&#x27;s parenting.<p>Parenting is a thankless job is fraught with insecurity and doubt, and every parent thinks they are not doing good enough, and constantly comparing themselves to other parents. Seeing a parent who shows weakness, who is not doing a good job, is a vindication for parents. &quot;Hey, look, I&#x27;m not as bad as HIM&#x2F;HER&quot;. You don&#x27;t want other parents to think that about you, so you make sure you never EVER allow parents to see you make a mistake because you know the first thing that will happen is they will go home and talk about it with their parent&#x2F;parent&#x2F;friend&#x2F;whoever.<p>Parenting is just like any other job. You can be an employee, but if people think you&#x27;re a screw up don&#x27;t expect to be invited to any social functions. Except in this case it&#x27;s not just you who is getting excluded... It&#x27;s your child and the rest of your family.')
