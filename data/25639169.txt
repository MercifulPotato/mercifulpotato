LinkedIn uses the company as a higher level grouping, then the years&#x2F;months spent in a certain position.<p>For me to use this regularly I would have some reason to check in; and I guess either building up “company profiles” where I could see people who work in a certain company or indeed an interesting way to find companies and open positions would be great.<p>I love the “features” section and the focus on adding people you’ve worked closely with.<p>As you are - it seems - involved in Quip too, I’m cheeky enough to add some feedback in that product: fix notifications (!) - managing and keeping track of them is close to impossible, make it easier to actually discuss higher level on a particular document (not per line, and the comments in the sidebar disappears quickly) and lastly please add support for collapsing certain sections of a document :-)')
