There is a great cultural disconnect. We typically don’t feel those works were <i>ours</i> in the first place. So we don’t see a great benefit in suddenly having free access to them.<p>This will change. I believe our current <i>cultural continuity</i> reaches all the way back to the end of the Second World War, and that this continuity is a stretching window not a sliding window.<p>When works from 1945+ start to enter the public domain I think the public at large will recognize these as part of their own cultural continuity and start to appreciate the value of the public domain.')
