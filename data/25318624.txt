I&#x27;ve been coding in C and C++ for more than 25 years and never encountered intmax_t or any problems related to it.<p>15 years and ditto.  I&#x27;ve only used it and seen it used for printf with %j, because that sucks less than the C99 PRIxBLAH conversions.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s better to accept that C (and C++) are only portable in theory,<p>I don&#x27;t agree with that at all, though.')
