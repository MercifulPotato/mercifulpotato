Vaccinating people is not new and the technology to assist in making that process smooth is also not new. What&#x27;s new is the restrictions upon which the vaccine can be stored at certain temps and the scale at which they can produce the vaccines. Neither of which are really logistical problems, at least not in the areas they&#x27;re currently falling short on.
