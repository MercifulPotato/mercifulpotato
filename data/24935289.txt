U.S. court jurisdiction doesn&#x27;t require that the violator be in the U.S., only that they violate the IP rights of U.S. persons. They can simply have a trial in absentia, and without a defendant present, that usually means an automatic judgement in their favor.<p>And while some foreign countries may not be willing to enforce those judgements, their financial institutions can be if they want to do business with the U.S. or U.S. customers.<p><i>It is like the trick the police use - carrying a knife for utility (cutting food, cutting wire, etc) is often not illegal, carrying a knife as a weapon often is, so police will often try to trick people into saying they have a knife for defense so they can treat it as a weapon instead of a tool.</i><p>I&#x27;m a former public defender and I&#x27;ve never heard of police using that trick outside of suspects arrested for other crimes.')
