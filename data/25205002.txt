Why would you even use this algorithm for 5 values?<p>I don&#x27;t know if you realize but these kinds of comments are incredibly frustrating to respond to. It&#x27;s like you didn&#x27;t even try to understand the comment before replying. I was <i>not</i> saying &quot;it&#x27;s terrible because it easily fails on 5 elements&quot;. I was saying &quot;it&#x27;s terrible because it easily fails, and <i>to illustrate</i>, here&#x27;s an <i>example</i> with 5 elements that will help you understand the problem I&#x27;m talking about&quot;. Does that make sense? Surely it&#x27;s not rocket science to see that the number 5 wasn&#x27;t special here? Surely you can see how, say, if your list starts at 2E9 and goes up to 3E9, the <i>exact same problem</i> would occur for the billion-element list, and hence that my gripe was probably not about 5-element lists?')
