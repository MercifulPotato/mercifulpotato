Then stimulus-survival cheques will go to many that desperately need it. Then everyone will get vaccinated for COVID and things can begin to open up again. Yang is running for NYC Mayor - though not officially announced - he&#x27;s registered to run + there&#x27;s a video of him doing a Mayoral run announcement video. Yang, then if it makes sense, will run again in 2024 - &quot;instead of that single $2,000 stimulus cheque - how much would it have helped if you got $1,000 every month?&quot; Etc.<p>&quot;Imagination is everything. It is the preview of life&#x27;s coming attractions.&quot; - Yup, though how much is perpetuated purposefully by Democrats vs. the narratives that mainstream media (or whoever else has influence on what they say) is unknown - but it happens. It&#x27;s why social media is good because it allows people like Andrew Yang to have a voice - someone very articulate, very understanding of the problems, and has figured out the solutions which he&#x27;s able to clearly explain. We need many more Andrew Yangs.')
