All the bashing at kubernetes and serverless functions. I’m not sure what the point of the author was other than the complexity aspect.<p>K8s and containers solve some very painful problems. I’ve seen two multi month migrations to k8s and cloud-y systems from hard metal servers.<p>Hard metal is nice but it’s hard to guarantee that state between replicas is the same and there is no version discrepancy.<p>Everyone that moves to cloud is because they want a good balance between compute and storage. They don’t want to deal with figuring out how many servers to rent. Let it scale up and down as needed. When you care about 99.99% reliability you want redundancy and multiple replicas load balanced. You want prod to run what you staged and tested. You want isolation guarantees. You want ephemeral systems that can be recreated from scratch and destroyed easily.<p>If you’re just a couple of devs and you don’t care about multiple 9s of reliability and everything fits on a single server then yeah the cloud is not worth it. K8s is not worth it. Know thy tools and the problems they solve.')
