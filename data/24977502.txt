You can call .Net code from F#, just like you can call Java from Clojure or Python&#x2F;Rust&#x2F;C from OCaml.<p>It just would be foreign and unidiomatic (hello, null pointers, methods, OOP).<p>And you can call C&#x2F;Python&#x2F;Rust from OCaml, we made quite a lot of wrappers for Gstreamer and some Rust libs in OCaml and it was quite painless.<p>So it&#x27;s a bit of simplification, you can call foreign code in OCaml, it&#x27;s not that much harder than F# considering there are higher level FFIs for C, Rust and Python available. Author could just use these as well.')
