My school did actually have Acorn&#x2F;BBC Micro computers but I was too young to really take advantage of them. The only reason they had them was I went to the worst school in one of the most deprived areas of the UK. The school had already acquired its first PC by then and after I left I never saw anything but PCs in other schools.<p>Our family computer was a PC and I remember my dad installing a modem and a CD burner and probably other things (I later upgraded the memory from 32MiB to 64MiB and the hard disk to 20GB). It was so exciting. But I just thought that was how computers were. I didn&#x27;t realise that this was just how the PC is. I got a smartphone, but I got it as a phone, not a computer. I got a netbook, but even that can be tinkered with within reason given its form factor. But I never stopped using my PC.<p>It makes me quite sad to think that this might go away. Microsoft already tried to cripple the PC with UEFI. I feel like the whole PC market is mainly propped up by gamers right now. I don&#x27;t game but I&#x27;m thankful that I can still take advantage of the hardware. Imagine how boring it would all be with disposable appliances and wireless networks. I&#x27;ll have to move with the times. It&#x27;s my job. But I&#x27;ll have to find a new hobby.')
