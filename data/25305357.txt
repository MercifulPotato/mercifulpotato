I think something which is often forgotten in programming discourse is that the single most important thing which code can do is create real-world value.  A lot of times we get caught up in coding the &quot;right way&quot; because we as programmers look at code all day, but the truth is nobody else is going to see the code once it&#x27;s shipped, and it doesn&#x27;t matter one bit to the user if it&#x27;s beautifully designed code or a mountain of kludges as long as it performs the same.<p>Sure good coding practices are important, but I actually think that an expedient solution now is often better than a perfect solution a week from now, and how well-factored particular piece of code is should be a function of how many times it should be touched rather than an absolute standard.')
