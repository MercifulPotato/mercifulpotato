Programmers are the users of APIs. So build them for users, to support them in their work; don&#x27;t build them  programmers who need to hack around the API to get things done.<p>&gt; while users don&#x27;t have to know about it.<p>There is no difference between programmers and users. Everyone is a user, it&#x27;s just a matter of perspective. If you creat an API you are the programmer, if you use an API you are the user. In both cases you have different knowledge, understanding and goals.')
