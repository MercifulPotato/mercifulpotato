If you use something like Jo Engine then it&#x27;s not too difficult to get up and running. If you want to roll your own and still have something that performs it gets messy. Stuff like dealing with bus contention between the SH2s, the VDP access timing&#x2F;slot system, that funky little DSP. You can see why it took so long to get decent libraries for it. It&#x27;s still fun to see how far you can push the hardware.')
