When I see an ad for a Swiffer WetJet, I&#x27;m not immediately compelled to go out and buy it against my will. I only buy it if it actually meets a need that I have. Ad-tech tries to guess who actually might be most likely to have that kind of a need and target advertising accordingly (eg it would be probably dumb to show a Peloton ad to a handicapped person, etc).<p>&gt; gathering large amounts of data about individual users to tailor ads to them doesn&#x27;t increase the effectiveness of those ads?<p>Is just a lot of words for &quot;being able to find people that might agree with some ideas and showing them media that expresses those ideas&quot;. In a world with free expression, it&#x27;s hard to see what the problem with that is.<p>From where I sit, there appears to be opposition to the fact that there exists people who have the appetite for certain &quot;bad&quot; ideas, and the only way to blunt those peoples&#x27; democratic power is to curb the ability for them to be exposed to those viewpoints.')
