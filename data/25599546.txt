It depends on how many photos we are talking about, and how large they are.<p>In the arena of backups, we talk about the rule of three — you should have at least three backup copies of everything you care about.<p>Of those backup copies, at least one should be stored remotely, in case there is a local problem like a fire that wipes out all your local copies.<p>Having more than one local backup copy is good, because if you mess up your local copy during the process of performing the backup or the restore, then you’ve got another local copy that you can use to fix that problem. Having that extra local backup copy means you don’t have to wait to download the backup you stored remotely, before you can begin the process of fixing your local problem.<p>And you should assume that everything stored in the cloud is ephemeral, unless you are paying money to keep it long-term. And even if you are paying money to keep it long term, the company could always have a hiccup and lose all your data, or decide to shut down the service, or go bankrupt, etc....<p>Note that you also have to verify all these backups you’re keeping. Because at any stage, there could be silent corruption of the data, and you would never find out without regular data verification processes.<p>And finally, all the backups in the world are completely and totally useless, if you can’t actually restore from them. So, you need to regularly test all your backups.')
