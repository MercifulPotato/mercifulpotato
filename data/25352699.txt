Item(by='Rochus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607468286, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25352088, text='&gt; <i>The vast majority of musicians earn less than Â£200 a year from music streaming platforms</i><p>This is no surprise and also corresponds to what you can expect if you&#x27;re a member of a copyright collecting society as a &quot;normal&quot; (i.e. not super famous) musician.<p>I have had this discussion again and again with my musician friends who still think they can live as musicians from copyrights. Just have a look at an annual report like e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.suisa.ch&#x2F;de&#x2F;suisa&#x2F;publikationen&#x2F;geschaeftsbericht.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.suisa.ch&#x2F;de&#x2F;suisa&#x2F;publikationen&#x2F;geschaeftsberich...</a>. I did a detailed analysis some years ago and found that the probability for a decent living from copyright income is &lt; 0.1%; in comparison the probability of being seriously injured in a traffic accident in Switzerland is &gt; 0.2%. The personnel expenses of the collecting society are roughly equal to the amount paid to the composers and musicians. For the given number of full-time positions, this results in an average annual salary of over 100,000 Swiss francs. A musician therefore earns considerably more when working as a clerk for the collecting society than when working as a musician. What an irony. It is not without reason that most of the musicians I know work as music teachers in permanent positions.')
