If a modern cell phone integrated those SMT packages, it&#x27;d be the size of a brick, and the PCB itself is vanilla 2-layer Tg130 FR4...couldn&#x27;t even be bothered with a controlled impedance layout, let alone length-match bus traces. Recently, bunnie talked about one &quot;relatively modern&quot; PCB design element---microvias---and explains why you just don&#x27;t see them much in OSHW designs[1]...an excellent read if you get the chance. JLC is a well known PCB fab house because their low-volume prices are dirt cheap, not because their process is modern.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bunniestudios.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?p=6011" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bunniestudios.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?p=6011</a>')
