Enough to cover a year of expenses and a bit more. I stopped spending money on almost everything.<p>Yeah, that sucks. I&#x27;m sorry you had a bad experience.<p>I think one thing for the community to take away is you need to be in a good position financially before you can start a startup - unless you can get funding. Especially for indiehackers who don&#x27;t usually take outside investment, $12k in savings is not enough. It is not normal to have to stop going out at all or to be pinching pennies. Not everyone can afford to start a startup. For some reason, this concept is almost never talked about in the startup community, but it&#x27;s really important.')
