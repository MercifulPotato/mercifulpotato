Which is easily achievable for me with less than a week of work. All extra money I earn above basic needs, I invest.<p>My current client sometimes has work for me 40 hours a week, sometimes only 40 hours a months. As such, I have plenty of time to dedicate to my own hobbies.<p>But this is only achievable because I left The Netherlands and decided to work remotely. And I do understand these kinds of choices are not possible for everyone (some people would find it very hard to live in another country, far away from family and friends, for example).<p>In our field and by making suitable choices it should be possible to have plenty of time for your own hobbies and projects.')
