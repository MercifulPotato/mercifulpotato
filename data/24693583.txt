Item(by='pessimizer', descendants=None, kids=[24695396], score=None, time=1601943441, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24691400, text='&gt; Many youtube videos you can look at on this, but the biggest issue that comes up is how Africans in Africa share little of the fervent anti-colonial attitude prominent in the American Black community here.<p>You have to blame a lot if not most of this on a lot of wholesale slaughter during colonialism of the elements who resisted it, and a lot of the elevation of particular ethnic groups into elite classes to serve as local middlemen for foreign business concerns (mostly extractive industries.) The elites of those countries are the people we see on youtube. Their families did pretty well under colonialism, and they think of the people who complain about it (in their home countries probably other ethnic groups, or non-Christians, or Sunnis) as Luddite terrorists who need to be killed.<p>Africa was a heavy source of anti-colonial radicalism during the cold war, and those sentiments still exist. Those are just not the elements we elevate. They, like black Americans, are usually the subject being discussed, not the people who get to be part of the conversation.<p>This isn&#x27;t unique to Africa.')
