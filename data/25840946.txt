If you started the car without the (non-heating) cigarette lighter pushed in, then the car would run fine for 30 seconds, and then the fuel gauge would go to zero and ten seconds later the car would die.<p>I loved the idea, until the system became flakey and I found myself time and again frantically pumping the cigarette lighter, hoping to get it to behave.
