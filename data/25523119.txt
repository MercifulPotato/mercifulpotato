Even if expectations don&#x27;t match, how often do you actually undercut the recruiter&#x27;s expectations? I would think most people would have a reasonable ballpark idea of what the recruiter has in mind - so just overshoot and then get negotiated down from there. The suggested tactic only really makes sense to me if you frequently expect to be undercutting what the recruiter&#x27;s got in mind, and even then by a lot.<p>To my layman understanding, the larger the difference between expectations, the lower the value in this tactic of not revealing your expectations.')
