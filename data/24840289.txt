Deep Learning is still new enough that there is lots of low hanging fruit to explore including empirical approaches and applying existing theoretical tools to try and explain DNNs. The community is slowly moving towards developing new tools specifically for deep learning properly analyze these networks and prove stuff (bounds, convergence etc) about them.')
