The problem is that it&#x27;s just such good business to keep people in poor health. Consider all the products that can be sold to them:<p>- addictive junk food to exacerbate the cycle<p>- type 2 diabetes medication<p>- plus-size clothing<p>- plus-size identity media<p>- weight loss programs and medications<p>Now, I&#x27;m not saying that all of this is done intentionally. But what I am saying is that strong incentives exist to keep selling these products and keep demand for them high, unless society as a whole agrees that it&#x27;s wrong to do so, (as it eventually did with tobacco) at least without warning.')
