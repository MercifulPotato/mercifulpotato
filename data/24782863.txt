That’s not to say: Don’t give your web servers running in docker certificates, but that you shouldn’t distribute certificates with your docker images. The Private Key&#x2F;Certificate pair should be added at runtime. How it gets there is specific to your management framework.<p>To give a specific example, on Kubernetes you store your Private Key and Certificate as a secret (there’s a special “type” of secret for this, but K8s doesn’t actually treat it any differently). You then mount that certificate as a volume (in &#x2F;var&#x2F;run&#x2F;secrets&#x2F;tls, or wherever you define it), and it shows up as a normal file, accessible to whichever user your container runs as.')
