If you require auto manufacturers to be responsible for auto deaths and they decide to get out of business, then what? Trains? But won&#x27;t the train manufacturers be held responsible for train-related deaths? Then you have the same problem, just with trains rather than autos. At that point, you either keep whittling things down until some mode of transportation is cheap and safe enough (but potentially very sub-optimal along other vectors) or everyone walks and goods don&#x27;t get anywhere, which has its own cost in lives.<p>&gt; A portion of them would not have happened without car ads and popular culture that makes driving fast and irresponsibly look cool.<p>I&#x27;d argue that this is both a tiny proportion of deaths and a tiny influence. Despite this advertisement and culture, the vast majority of people are responsible&#x2F;reasonable (if unskilled and&#x2F;or ignorant) drivers.<p>I think governments could reduce the number of deaths far more greatly by having more stringent licensing guidelines (including regular re-testing), safer roads, saner zoning policies, better public transit options, etc. than by silencing any speech that suggests a correlation between speed and fun.<p>&gt; I think we can do better.<p>Certainly. However, I&#x27;m not convinced removing agency from individuals and ascribing fault to entities with no direct (and at best marginal indirect) control over specific or aggregated situations will get us there.')
