The two-word term packs a double whammy that inspires pushback. 1) The word white creates discomfort among those who are not used to being defined or described by their race. And 2) the word privilege, especially for poor and rural white people, sounds like a word that doesn’t belong to them—like a word that suggests they have never struggled.<p>This defensiveness derails the conversation, which means, unfortunately, that defining white privilege must often begin with defining what it’s not. Otherwise, only the choir listens; the people you actually want to reach check out. White privilege is not the suggestion that white people have never struggled. Many white people do not enjoy the privileges that come with relative affluence, such as food security. Many do not experience the privileges that come with access, such as nearby hospitals.<p>And white privilege is not the assumption that everything a white person has accomplished is unearned; most white people who have reached a high level of success worked extremely hard to get there. Instead, white privilege should be viewed as a built-in advantage, separate from one’s level of income or effort.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tolerance.org&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;fall-2018&#x2F;what-is-white-privilege-really" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tolerance.org&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;fall-2018&#x2F;what-is-white-p...</a><p>Or in short, as Kimmel once said: &quot;White privilege doesn&#x27;t mean your life hasn&#x27;t been hard. It just means the color of your skin isn&#x27;t one of the things that makes it harder.&quot;')
