On the hardware side there was the Dreamcast memory card (the VMU) that was in itself a simple console, there were the maraccas for Samba De Amigo, the microphone for the truly bizarre talking fish Seaman, the modem for the pioneering multiplayer dungeon adventure Phantasy Star Online. All of this was of the future - it hardly worked (Seaman was definitely not educated in British accents and Samba De Amigo&#x27;s maraccas were bloody temperamental) but it always felt like a glimpse into a world of gaming to come - just like the Sega Saturn 3d controller heralded all analogue controllers to come.  Of course Sega shared this culture of experimentation with Nintendo, though in my mind they took even greater risks. Sony was always a conservative player, mimicked, for the large part, by Microsoft. It is to gaming&#x27;s severe detriment that Sega had to give up on consoles. I would have loved to see what they would be putting out today.<p>Edit: I forgot the fishing rod for Sea Bass!!')
