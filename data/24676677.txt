It doesn&#x27;t grant rights to people, it acknowleges that people have those rights whether the constitution exists or not, and then proceeds to grant rights to the government<p>The preamble is who authored the constitution<p>Article 1 is all about how congress works<p>Article 2 about the president<p>Aritcle 3 about the courts<p>Article 4 about the states<p>Article 5 about the constitution<p>Article 6 about which laws are important<p>The Bill of rights further limits the power of government<p>Nothing specifically is about the people. The clause you state limits the powers of the state to take rights away from people.<p>The Constitution does not grant rights to people - because people (all people, globally) have all the rights by default. It does grant rights to government to do certain things, and it specifically limits the power of government to take away rights from people.')
