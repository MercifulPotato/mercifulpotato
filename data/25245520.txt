That&#x27;s a ridiculous take and is smearing a very well researched channel.<p>2) Youtube didn&#x27;t just stop promoting this piece. They are hiding it. You can&#x27;t find it even if you search for it.<p>3) He&#x27;s not just trying to &quot;create a buzz&quot;, department of homeland security paid him a visit now his videos are disappearing - if you think that&#x27;s not worrisome, well damn!<p>4) Implying that if you create an axiom that has not been &quot;state approved&quot; then you deserve to get delisted?<p>Insanely dystopian because you more or less don&#x27;t seem to care and justify state intervention in private well researched but pretty bland political historical takes.<p>His views are not that radical.
