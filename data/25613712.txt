Item(by='hvdijk', descendants=None, kids=[25613756, 25613753, 25614208], score=None, time=1609603884, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25613640, text='True, but if MS hadn&#x27;t presented WSL2 as a variant of WSL, any issues fixed in WSL2 wouldn&#x27;t count as fixed in the WSL issue tracker. I would prefer it if their issue tracker marked these, more honestly in my opinion, as &quot;This issue is will not be fixed in WSL, you can migrate to HVL instead&quot; (using HVL as a hypothetical name for WSL2) with a separate HVL issue tracker.')
