We&#x27;re already starting to manufacture and distribute vaccines; ramping up new testing &amp; tracing infrastructure is likely to have very little impact now[0], and would not be worth committing any public resources to. This <i>might</i> be helpful for countries that are going to be on the end of the vaccination list, but even for developing nations this will be much more expensive than vaccines (at least one company has promised to sell to poor nations at cost, which IIRC is $3-4 per shot).<p>0 - Test &amp; trace is both more valuable early in the pandemic because you can save more lives, but also because these techniques have an upper limit on how many cases the system can handle. Once sizeable chunks of the population have the disease, no test &amp; trace system cat possibly keep up. If we&#x27;d had this months ago, we possibly could have stopped this pandemic in its tracks.')
