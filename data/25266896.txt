Miners will\nonly mine when the instantaneous expected reward\nexceeds the instantaneous cost<p>This makes no sense, rational actors generally consider discounted future cash flows, not just instantaneous reward.  Perhaps the quality of the paper is explained by the researchers following this strategy and only working on 15th and 30th of every month (when their salaries are remitted to their bank account representing an instantaneous reward).')
