I&#x27;m not a hollywood person, but recognized the last name immediacy. He is responsible for producing The Little Mermaid, Beauty &amp; The Beast, Aladin, and Lion King. Basically the best Disney masterpieces ever, and the only other company to fight Pixar on the big screen. Quibi has always been a terrible idea. I hope he find great success in his next endeavor, maybe a classic USA hand drawn animation studio !!!')
