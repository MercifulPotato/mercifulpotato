We weren&#x27;t talking about the 1st Amendment, but let&#x27;s go where you lead: speech likely to incite imminent lawless action is illegal. Courts decide if that applies. Someday you might say &quot;Politician Y should be hung by his thumbs&quot;. Politician Y and friends try to convince a judge that you thereby incite imminent lawless action. Of course, you were just feeling passionate, and no one reasonable would believe that you meant it. Thankfully, due to strong 1A protections, the case would not proceed.<p>But if you wrote that on a site hosted on AWS, there is nothing in principle from Amazon taking the platform down. Politician Y calls his buddy Jeff Bezos, and fwoomp! Gone. This should be concerning.')
