So I think the habit of writing those comments is more important than making sure that every single one has no repetition. I&#x27;m working in a codebase now that has a frustrating lack of documentation of important details.<p>A data field called &quot;imageURL&quot; that&#x27;s a string -- is that a remote or local URL? Where did it come from&#x2F;how much can I trust that it&#x27;s well-formed? (And why isn&#x27;t it already an actual `ParsedURL` type?) Another datatype has three fields &quot;name&quot;, &quot;username&quot;, and &quot;id&quot;, all strings, with no explanation of their purpose or differences.<p>This means that I either have to track down the teammate that wrote the code and ask them every single time I run into something like this. Or I have to execute the whole program and reverse engineer the answer. Both are colossal wastes of time compared to a few &quot;useless&quot; or &quot;repetitive&quot; comments.')
