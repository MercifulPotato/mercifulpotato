It&#x27;s useful for some kinds of static sites that might have a radically different template or data source&#x2F;model for multiple pages that fit the same URL pattern.<p>Gatsby&#x27;s use of GraphQL, which can be a pain especially as you scale larger, is nice how it lets you query just the fields you need, so your dehydrated data remains pretty minimal. It&#x27;s something that I&#x27;ve struggle with when building a site with NextJS - I would have to set up and create my own GraphQL server.<p>Gatsby is a weird one because it has these &quot;advanced&quot; features that really benefit larger sites (or sites with larger ambitions), but Gatsby really can&#x27;t handle large sites or data.')
