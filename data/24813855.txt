What should be the role, if any, of governments in censorship? The US supposedly has a rule of &quot;none&quot;. But there are exceptions. Some kinds of porno. Threats against individuals. Incitement to riot. All of which can be over-used to chill speech.<p>2. What should be the role of private companies? This is tied in with the role of monopolies. If there were 50 Facebook or Twitter like services, none with more than 20% market share, this would not be a problem. Maybe this is an antitrust problem.<p>3. Should anonymous speech be as protected as thoroughly as non-anonymous speech? The US has a tradition of protecting anonymous speech. This is partly because the Federalist Papers, and &quot;Common Sense&quot;, were published under pseudonyms. Much of the problems with &quot;fake news&quot;, from whatever direction, come from concealed sources. Spam, in all media, comes from anonymous sources. Of course, if you publish under your own name, you may face harassment and reprisals.<p>Those are questions worth thinking about.')
