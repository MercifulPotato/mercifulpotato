I have a lot of international friends and international texting is prohibitively expensive. Even if they would need a special app just to communicate with me, it would still be <i>miles</i> better than having no option at all. Same goes for VoIP calls, I don&#x27;t care that it doesn&#x27;t have WhatsApp&#x2F;Telegram&#x2F;Discord but I <i>do</i> care that there&#x27;s no option to contact people from other countries without selling my kidney to afford it all.')
