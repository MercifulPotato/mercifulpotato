Our national leaders in the US since Google was created have been fabulously pro-business, to the extent that they have never updated our laws governing privacy for the computer age (IE, limiting what businesses can do with data) and they&#x27;ve gutted consumer protections along the way.<p>Since the US government is so thoroughly corrupted by money, once a corporation is large enough they can effectively write their own laws.   Google and others have done this, so there&#x27;s no law stating that they must give consumers rights in a dispute, must provide their data, or even must be fair.<p>Government + money = corruption.')
