Anyone can publish anything quickly and share across aggregators instantaneously.  The distribution of that data from the major platforms is completely opaque, unlike newspapers or tv which had known distribution and self-evident editorial decisions that apply to the entire audience all at once.  In the new world, there can be infinite content and infinite eye balls all seeing different slices of it.  It&#x27;s all done by algorithm and no one except data-savvy internal staff have any idea how many people are seeing what and when.<p>I agree this can all be explained without much technical depth, but two problems with congress: first is that they are out of touch and still think in terms of the disappearing era of broadcast network news having massive monolithic reach and corresponding journalistic standards and ethics conferred by their unassailable moat of limited media options.  Second, you can&#x27;t legislate this if you can&#x27;t reason about the second order effects due to the economics of how tech companies are run (ie. editorial in any old-school sense of the word simply does not fit any social media companies unit economics) as well as the information economy (ie. people prefer watching things that confirm their biases, and there are unlimited media options with many young people having no idea what a television schedule is).')
