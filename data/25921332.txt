Here in Australia, a lot of academics don&#x27;t â€“ you start out as a &quot;Lecturer&quot;, then get promoted to &quot;Senior Lecturer&quot;, then &quot;Associate Professor&quot;, then finally &quot;Professor&quot;, and calling a lecturer &quot;professor&quot; is not done. And you certainly wouldn&#x27;t use the word &quot;professor&quot; when addressing a PhD student.')
