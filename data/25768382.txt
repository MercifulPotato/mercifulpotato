So it is sort of malevolent.  Look up Richard Miller&#x27;s &quot;Drug Warriors and Their Prey&quot;.<p>And &quot;moral panics&quot; like those Anslinger leveraged to exert control on non-whites etc (and journalists who drove the fad of &#x27;huffing&#x27; into overdrive back in the 50s) are another important factor. Again, I am old enough to remember the BS around MDMA and GHB (GHB is actually really useful, if you&#x27;re responsible with it) and how all of that was founded on actions that have been shown to be less than integral by people with little integrity.<p>I did not read TFA, but I can guess its contents. Now that psychedelics and etc are being medicalized, journalists (who largely like to think of themselves of those who shape society) are writing lemming-like articles about the wonders and benefits of psychedelics. You know what? Those wonders and benefits were apparent &#x2F; present 30 years ago. Why has it taken so long to break the silence? It&#x27;s fricking science! But it was deemed &#x27;dangerous&#x27; so ...<p>Because societies ...  are easily lead around by the nose by those in positions of power or influence (aka presidents and journalists) who have their own agendas. Everything over the past 4 years has made it clear how so many people are so easily influenced (aka social media and presidential Twitter accounts) by &quot;common sense&quot;. And at this point, it is just &quot;common sense&quot; to have a WoSD.  I am certainly not arguing that heroin should be mindlessly legalized, but the problem absolutely needs to be dealt with in a different way and the existing processes are self-reinforcing because they do serve certain interests of the social systems or processes in place and those in positions of power (and who benefit from them).<p>I am vaguely remember now research into why corporations behave as they do despite the people in charge understanding the larger detrimental effects of the actions they undertake for the benefit of or at the behest of the corporation.  I think it&#x27;s analogous, but I haven&#x27;t thought this through.<p>So the idea that &quot;the general public&quot; actually understands at a deep or even good level the issues, ramifications, or even the larger social forces at work is naive.  You&#x27;re on HN, so I assume you are smarter than the average person, but seriously, the average person has an IQ less than 120. The older I get, the more I realize how so many people are driven primarily by their emotions and unresolved psychological issues.<p>I guess I am ranting because my sister just asked how she can deprogram my brother-in-law from believing all the QAnon bullshite.  QAnon, the drug war, the 9&#x2F;11 lunatics, the Nazi Blood Libel, these are all facets of something having to do with flaws in human psychology and societies.')
