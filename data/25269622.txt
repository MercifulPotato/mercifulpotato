Item(by='bunnie', descendants=None, kids=[25270174, 25270437], score=None, time=1606855369, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25269060, text='I actually wanted to broaden the bandwidth of the planar inverted F antenna patch bit; it was too peaky and narrow. I experimented with about four or five variants of the logo until I found one that had the desired effect. So it is true, the peak gain is reduced by this, but the gain in bandwidth meant I had better average gain over the entire 2.4G band.<p>Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t definitively explain why it was better beyond some theoretical platitudes -- in the end, it was literally a process of just making educated guesses and measuring stuff until I found something that worked.<p>I&#x27;ve tried modelling software in the past, but the results don&#x27;t match well with measurement, and the paid licenses for modelling software are by far more expensive than the cost of copper tape and a good knife, and then running a few prototypes (and the free stuff I could find wasn&#x27;t even close to meeting the task). Not to mention the time -- the sims take a long time to run, and building accurate models is also quite time consuming.<p>Sort of a dissatisfying reality, but that&#x27;s how the sausage got made.')
