Actually our first channel we&#x27;re trying is wholesaling to coffee shops.<p>We are really treating it a bit more like a startup in the sense that we have opinions, are testing them, but will iterate and are open to changing course based on the feedback we receive from the market.<p>There are a few reasons why the initial thesis is to stay away from Door Dash&#x2F;Grubhub.<p>(A) cost - since we&#x27;re not at scale, our unit costs are... not great. With the Door Dash cut, we&#x27;ll almost certainly be in negative unit cost territory.<p>(B) Door Dash &#x2F; GrubHub are an <i>on demand</i> business. A customer goes online, picks an option, then we fulfill it within X minutes. Subscription and wholesale allow us to BATCH our output (and therefore labor and facility inputs). This makes cost management way easier for us up front.<p>So right now, we can get off the ground just hiring people 2 days a week, but that wouldn&#x27;t work with the normal Door Dash model.<p>Once we have our basic costs covered by the predictable orders, it&#x27;ll be a lot easier for us to add on demand options \nand it won&#x27;t add incremental labor costs.<p>Tock To Go is probably an early option for us though due to allowing low costs and future pickup ordering (Hi Nick Kokonas, I love you!)')
