Whatever I post shows zero points as soon as it is posted.<p>Hacker News tends to be pretty good about people not just downvoting posts because they disagree with them. However, that goes out the window when the discussion gets political.<p>I&#x27;d be really interested in seeing the numbers for upvotes and downvotes on political topics vs other topics.
