Acts like a document based database but still allows the power of relational SQL matching.<p>- From git diffs, automatically produce expressions that specify how the entity types have evolved over time, and then have the ability to apply those entity type diffs to a production server &amp; database.<p>- Automatically maps natural language onto the schema allowing NLU queries like &quot;orders today in Canada&quot; to be turned into a semantic representation that the database can natively understand and execute, with control to override default NLU mappings if the default mapping isn&#x27;t working right.<p>- Automatically generates web UIs for viewing and editing entities.<p>- Supports dynamic applicability to be defined so that whether a property is applicable, and which values are valid, can be defined as a dynamic function of other property values.<p>- Supports inferred properties to be defined in either an inference rule approach, or a functional approach.')
