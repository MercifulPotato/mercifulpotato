Item(by='webmaven', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602282083, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24723152, text='<i>&gt; Companies aren&#x27;t democracies.</i><p>I think that&#x27;s too strong a statement in support of the current default, which is the largely feudal corporation.<p>First, company structures are pretty clearly being pushed in a more democratic direction, and have been for quite a while. Silicon Valley is the poster child for flatter organizational structures, &quot;good ideas can come from anywhere&quot;, increased freedom of movement for workers between companies, as well as sharing the financial gains more broadly (at least, that is the ideal that SV represents to the outside world).<p>You look at a typical SV corporation and see a rigid hierarchy. Most of the rest of the world sees an insanely freewheeling mess that can&#x27;t possibly work.<p>There are also today already companies that are explicitly structured as democracies (in some cases a bit more like constitutional monarchies, and in other cases more like minarchist collectives). Not all of these experiments are successful, nor should we expect them to be.<p>But I certainly <i>don&#x27;t</i> expect this overall trend to reverse, stop, or even slow down. If anything, I expect it to accelerate, as existing companies continue to try to pick out and graft on the parts and tools that seem to be working for other organizations. Even when these grafting attempts are unsuccessful (which is often), they just draw attention to the orgs that <i>are</i> succeeding (inspiring attempts at analysis of what is different), which leads to more such experiments.')
