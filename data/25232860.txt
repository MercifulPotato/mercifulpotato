Item(by='seba_dos1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606513676, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25229291, text='I give a shit and it&#x27;s my weakness. I usually don&#x27;t take days off until I really need them (and even then it usually takes others to actually force me to take them). I try to only work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, having a healthy balance of work and non-work etc., but I often fail and it then more often than not devolves into periods of ultra-focus and periods where it&#x27;s hard for me to even do the simplest tasks - even though I really want to. I give a shit, so I need to take care of myself because when I&#x27;m unable to work, I feel really bad about it. Because I give a shit, you know - I currently work on stuff that I used to do in my spare time for years out of passion.<p>I went through way too many voluntary crunches (both for work and personal stuff, like game jams) to not see how they deteriorate my health. And occasionally I&#x27;m still putting myself into more, it&#x27;s somewhat addicting. I need to finally get myself tested for ADHD.<p>In this light, I&#x27;m not sure if my answers to the posed questions would satisfy the recruiter looking for someone who &quot;gives a shit&quot;. I used to think it was worth it, I&#x27;m not so sure anymore.<p>I completely understand the need for people who &quot;give a shit&quot;. I don&#x27;t really understand people who are able to work without &quot;giving a shit&quot;. I can&#x27;t. But remember that if you&#x27;re looking for people who &quot;give a shit&quot;, it&#x27;s now your responsibility to not abuse them for it. They will often put their work over their health. You shouldn&#x27;t let them, otherwise your company is not worth giving a shit for.')
