My point is that this can quickly lead to legal problems, when such a captcha restricts your access to something you <i>do</i> have a legal right to.<p>Say I buy a new phone and it stops working after 3 weeks. I want to contact the seller, but they only have a web contact form and I fail to get past the captcha.<p>This is already getting very close to being a huge legal problem, and the only reason why it&#x27;s probably not that bad is that technically that website is supposed to give at least a contact address so I <i>could</i> just send them a letter which, while hugely inconvenient, is legally still a good enough way for me to contact them.<p>I&#x27;m sure if you spend a while longer you could find a few cases where the problem is even worse (also considering more than just one legal system).<p>So what I should have said: Using this technology to block users from the wrong endpoints could end up being illegal.<p>For context: I&#x27;m talking German laws here.')
