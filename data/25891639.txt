Thus replacing Py 2 became a huge problem.<p>Until recently it was easier to set up for Python dev on Windows because you could download a clean Python and not worry about broken Pythons on your path.<p>Microsoft wrecked it all last year by including a system Python and they&#x27;ll probably play games to keep it in front of your Python on the path.so you will be typing pip3.7, pip3.8, pip-3.6-pypy, etc. for the rest of your life.')
