I think intelligence is a thing, I think tests can probably reflect it at least a bit, and I think the fact that wealth is not really correlated with it means that there are probably a lot of dummies making capital allocation decisions.<p>&gt;  immigrant-founded or run companies like Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Tesla<p>I&#x27;m talking about ownership and capital allocation, so the management of any particular firm is somewhat irrelevant. The immigrant founders of Google, for instance, only hold 14% stake in Alphabet. Much of the ownership is by these &quot;favored failsons&quot; as you put it, even if they aren&#x27;t the managers. That&#x27;s not even getting into the fact that the vast-majority of America&#x27;s economy is not these popular-to-talk-about tech companies or that Google&#x27;s have to run-the-gambit of getting green-lighted by &quot;failsons&quot; just to have a chance of being funded.<p>We could have a whole separate conversation about the effectiveness of China&#x27;s bureaucracy, but all I&#x27;ll say is that - even if they have the same problems, ours have had more time to solidify, and China&#x27;s wealth Gini coefficient is smaller than ours, so the problems would be less magnified.')
