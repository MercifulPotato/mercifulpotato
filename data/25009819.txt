So we&#x27;re setting it up that if you buy a THING in say US&#x2F;Canada, you can only buy supplies from a reseller in US&#x2F;Canada and not a cheaper one in Africa.<p>Why am I doing this? My wife lost her job due to COVID, and I&#x27;m the sole income earner right now. Once things recover I&#x27;ll switch jobs.')
