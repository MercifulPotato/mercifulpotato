Item(by='seph-reed', descendants=None, kids=[24945303], score=None, time=1604072042, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24943087, text='&gt; Are you saying that people shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to boycott things they don&#x27;t like?<p>No, people should be allowed to do as they please (assuming they aren&#x27;t abusing the earth or other living beings), and boycotts are a useful tool for change.<p>But it&#x27;s becoming the first tool people reach for, and that&#x27;s not healthy.  Kind of how force is sometimes necessary, but should be avoided as much as possible.  Someone who jumps to force immediately is a scary person to empower.<p>Also, there is a noteworthy difference between boycotting something you don&#x27;t like and boycotting whichever power is capable of cancelling the thing you don&#x27;t like.  It&#x27;s definitely necessary at times, but it&#x27;s not a great means to an end.<p>My mother read me this book as a child (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Butter_Battle_Book" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Butter_Battle_Book</a>) and the fact that overt force will be met with greater overt force until someone hits a limit (and nobody really wins) has stuck and has been very consistently reinforced in my life.  I see cancel culture as pretty obvious show of force and no matter how much people might inflate its victories and minimize its short-comings, I see it netting out to roughly zero.  It really just enables worse behavior on both sides.')
