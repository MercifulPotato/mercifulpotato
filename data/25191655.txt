Denying someone the right to use the best self-defense tools available is an infringement of that right.<p>&gt; too young to exercise this &quot;right&quot;<p>Lots of rights are restricted before you reach the age of majority. I&#x27;m fine with saying that when you&#x27;re old enough to vote (or join the armed forces, or drive a car, or whatever) then that&#x27;s when you&#x27;re allowed to carry a gun.<p>&gt; conditions where it can be infringed (e.g.: a psychopath in jail)<p>Sure, lots of rights are denied to people in jail. I&#x27;m fine with restricting this right similarly, and to people who have been judged (with due process protections) to be insane.<p>&gt; are there spaces where it can be infringed (e.g.: can a daycare forbid it)<p>Although I think such prohibitions are generally a bad idea, I&#x27;m fine with people having the ability to enforce them on their own private property. &quot;Your rights end at my doorstep,&quot; etc.')
