Sorry for preaching, but I just can&#x27;t resist. I think Agda is an excellent programming language, and it&#x27;s a joy to write anything in. Its learning curve is steep at the beginning but once you gain experience how to write coinfinite programs, it&#x27;s such a joy.<p>I think its module system is a huge bonus. It makes code a lot easier to organize and reason. It forces toplevel module X to be defined in X.agda so there is no argument what the module should be named or where it should be found.')
