It’s well managed with Humira, a similar biological treatment which is thankfully free in the UK. However I’m still in pain most of the time and it occasionally flares up. Those days I feel incredibly tired and awful all over. Find it hard that I don’t know on any day whether I’m going to be okay or not.<p>Not sure if it’s the same with any other types of arthritis but the thing I’ve found that makes the biggest difference is exercise, especially on those days when I’m feeling terrible. Used to go to the gym pretty much every day, but post COVID it’s hard to do a similar amount of activity at home.<p>Hope you both continue to manage your conditions, it’s not always easy.')
