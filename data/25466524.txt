For many reasons I doubt it (even though they managed to turn a buggy Witcher 3 into one of my favorite games ever), but I do hope so.<p>I&#x27;d easily pay 30-40 bucks for this game if they fixed the performance issues and bugs, made the open world even slightly better, fixed the non-existent AI, and tweaked a bunch of the gameplay.<p>If they also managed to make driving fun and the choices more meaningful, I could imagine paying full price even. From what I&#x27;ve heard the story is okay, but that it has too much &#x27;illusion of choice&#x27;.')
