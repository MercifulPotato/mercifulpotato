The owner of my takeover tried to add the domain to their panel and they couldn&#x27;t. This adds a whole new level of customer service to their backlog which should essentially be mitigated by an automation of sorts via a txt record or cname confirmation. Seems to me that they are more interested in not fixing it but happy to waste hours of their agents trying to fix such takover problems.')
