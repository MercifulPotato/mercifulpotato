Also, it seems strange to me that there is so little mention of the role prosecutors play in police misconduct.  Mayors and city councils too, who are generally responsible for nominating police chiefs (opposed to sheriffs, who are elected.)  Cynically, I think a lot of prosecutors and local politicians are glad the public is so hyper-focused on the crooked cops that they forget to address the elected officials who enable those cops.')
