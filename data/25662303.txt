If you don&#x27;t like China&#x27;s demand then you can refer to it however you want; but they also have the freedom to dislike those who do that.<p><pre><code>    &quot;they operate concentration camps;&quot;\n</code></pre>\nIn my unpopular opinion: I would call them brainwashing camps, or re-education camps if there is no need to appeal to Western audiences. I don&#x27;t think I have seen evidences that people have been systematically terminated in those camps, which I believe is a key characteristic for concentration camps.<p><pre><code>    &quot;the Chinese language has no word for *mutuality*&quot;\n</code></pre>\nDid you mean what you said seriously&#x2F;literally? Or is it a phishing question to see which commenter speaks Chinese? ;)<p><pre><code>    &quot;China benefits from free speech&quot;\n</code></pre>\nI would argue that they didn&#x27;t benefit much from &quot;free speech&quot;, otherwise China would probably be mentioned in a more positive light nowadays. IMHO, China&#x27;s state machinery is pretty good at internal censorship and propaganda due to their long authoritarian history, but their methods for manipulating&#x2F;spinning narratives is rather unsophisticated compared to societies with more democratic traditions.<p><pre><code>    &quot;Winnie the Pooh is extremely thin-skinned and can have games like Devotion removed from Steam and GOG even after the reference is removed from the secret area in the game;&quot;\n    &quot;there are many instances where businesses with Chinese shareholders were pressured not to publish anything mildly critical of China.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nCapitalism has no backbone, I guess?<p><pre><code>    &quot;BBC team visiting China investigating covid19 faced obstacles reminiscent of The Truman Show;&quot;\n</code></pre>\nYour neighbour doesn&#x27;t like you, and he thinks you are guilty of theft. You told him you have not done that and turned down his demand to enter your home to investigate. Your neighbour informed the police, and they come to your door with a warrant; this time you have to let them in.  Is BBC the world police? If so then I guess China is at fault here.<p><pre><code>    &quot;WHO scientists investigating covid19 recently not permitted into China;&quot;\n</code></pre>\nI think WHO is much better qualified than BBC for investigating this, so not a great move from China. They should let them investigate.<p><pre><code>    &quot;China doesn&#x27;t even formally frown at corruption;&quot;\n</code></pre>\nI can see you don&#x27;t know China at all. China does formally frown at corruption. The problem is China informally doesn&#x27;t frown at corruption.')
