The hit-rate on &quot;things I like that it shows me&quot; is incredibly high, higher than I would have believed possible without heavy tuning on my part. I did &quot;nothing&quot; but like the videos I enjoyed, swipe to the next video on videos I didn&#x27;t like, and occasionally follow a creator if I&#x27;ve seen 3+ videos of their on my FYP that I like.')
