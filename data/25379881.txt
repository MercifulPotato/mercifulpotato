Mind you working on a boring CRUD app may very well surface hard problems, but it&#x27;s difficult to see how one could be said to excel at their craft without doing hard and difficult work to prove it.<p>It&#x27;s very easy to tell yourself that you&#x27;re a great developer because you do some arcane thing that nobody else understands in an arcane language, but it&#x27;s very easy to mistake esoteric behaviour for skill. Hard, real-world problems are a reality check. You either can tackle them or you don&#x27;t, and if you can&#x27;t do it in a fancy language it&#x27;s no good to anyone.')
