Plenty of brokers are still allowing trades. I can buy and sell on Vanguard in my brokerage account right now. If there&#x27;s an issue with my trade I can call them, they show their phone number on the confirmation page.<p>They have some warnings amounting to &quot;this thing is crazy, we&#x27;ll do our best&quot;, but they haven&#x27;t stopped me from trading. Other brokers are the same.<p>I think Robinhood cost themselves their business today. Anytime someone says &quot;what broker should I use&quot; the first answer is going to be &quot;not Robinhood, they screwed everyone over&quot; regardless of how true that statement is. I think the industry is about to come under fire too. Heads are going to roll on this one. Action across the board is widely supported by both sides of government. If it is even close to as bad as it looks, Wall Street firms just cost themselves much more than their short positions.')
