It&#x27;s oddly familiar.<p><i>&gt; Partner guarding seems like a lot of pointless energy expended based on insecurity</i><p>And there it is. Counterpoint: No, it&#x27;s not; you&#x27;re just, as you said yourself, different. For the vast majority of people it is neither pointless nor is it born out of insecurity.<p>The odd thing is that you start by acknowledging yourself as different, just to turn around and present these opinions as statements. It&#x27;s not the first time I&#x27;ve seen it either with people explaining why they buy into polyamory.<p><i>&gt; Plus, it&#x27;s better to let people move freely and self-select voluntarily, rather than give them ultimatums or threatening &quot;if you ever&quot; speeches.</i><p>Wasn&#x27;t aware that the only two choices were &quot;not caring at all&quot; and &quot;giving ultimatums&quot;.<p>Speaking of &quot;moving freely&quot; and &quot;not partner guarding&quot;:<p><i>&gt; Not in my face if it&#x27;s with a dude</i><p>... Right.<p><i>&gt; with a consideration for Mff or Mfff poly where f are pan&#x2F;bi. I think Mfff tetrad of ever-reconfiguring pairs is more stable because there&#x27;s no third-wheel issue.</i><p>So the conclusion is that... You &quot;discovered&quot; polygyny. That&#x27;s also familiar; reddit for instance is full of guys supposedly in that kind of arrangement, and many more others clearly wishing they were.<p>It&#x27;s not new, many societies have tried it; most of those weren&#x27;t big on women&#x27;s rights, though. And a lot of it stemmed from, shall we say, &quot;partner guarding&quot;... against other males.<p>Then again, quite a few of the discussions I&#x27;ve had with self-declared polyamorous people were themselves women and I am not only strictly monogamous, but I&#x27;m also gay, so what do I know.')
