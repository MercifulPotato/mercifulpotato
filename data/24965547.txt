The data shows about 27% of Indian households<p>Good, so these figures are not even close to the 50% figure for urban Rajasthan. Why do you think the figures differ so drastically? Also, clever of the &quot;researchers&quot; to inflate figures using &quot;households&quot;. Absolutely zero among my hundreds of colleagues have demonstrated casteist attitudes, so let&#x27;s ask about their grandparents. That&#x27;s how you get &quot;households&quot;.<p>&gt; You are looking for anecdotal data when I am presenting you with actual survey data.<p>Correct. Because sociological &quot;studies&quot; are rife with methodological failures. They drive an agenda worse than any autorickshaw driver drives his auto. This is the field that gave us &quot;one in five women on college campuses are raped&quot; and &quot;India is the least safe country in the world for women&quot;. All obvious bullshit, but here we are.<p>&gt; from your own situation (as well as mine)<p>This is the interesting part. We don&#x27;t know each other.

It goes to show how believable you, yourself, would consider such stories would be.<p>There is an interesting parallel between believing BS of the holy men in the past (the priests, the prophets) and believing the BS of today&#x27;s holy men (the academics). Some fields are taking active steps to addressing the replication crisis. Sociology is not one of them.')
