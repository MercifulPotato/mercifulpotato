Aaron was not an original co-founder, and when his company merged into Reddit (with a &quot;co-founder&quot; title as per agreement) every indication is that that arrangement didn&#x27;t work out for anyone.  So I don&#x27;t blame Reddit for not including Aaron in the company history, as it wasn&#x27;t his idea, he didn&#x27;t start it nor grow it, and his presence apparently never &quot;clicked&quot; with the others.')
