I don&#x27;t think I could eat certain organs without puking just from the thought&#x2F;looks. You couldn&#x27;t get me to eat heart for example. I&#x27;ve tried to but couldn&#x27;t get over it (chicken hearts actually). And even liver, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d eat.<p>German Liver Sausage? That is one of the most delicious things on earth!<p>How&#x27;s this for a &quot;recipe&quot;: Beef trim (50%), beef liver (20%), beef heart (15%), and beef kidney (15%).<p>Take a nice piece of rye bread (best is a real sourdough rye bread), spread the Leberwurst very thick, top off with a cornichon and&#x2F;or pickled mini onion. Heavenly.')
