Item(by='segfaultbuserr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611327548, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25870631, text='Also, an interesting oddity about relays and switches: many have a minimum current rating because some arcing is actually <i>required</i>, it burns off the oxidation layers on their contacts. This is called &quot;wet switching&quot;, if you use a wet-switching relay to toggle a control voltage with negligible current flowing on the line, you can drive the relay to death prematurely due to oxidation. The solution is to use a control current instead of a control voltage, but it has higher power consumption (on the bright side, better noise immunity). There are also specialized &quot;dry-switching&quot; relays for this application (but using them to switch live circuits causes the opposite problem - arcing will damage them).')
