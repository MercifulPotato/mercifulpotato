Anecdotally, there is a <i>big</i> jump between having two kids and having more than two. I&#x27;ve had a lot of conversations with friends on their third pregnancy about having to upgrade to a bigger car because with the size of car seats, you can&#x27;t fit three of them in one row of a typical sedan. And I&#x27;ve likewise had conversations with parents who decided (like my wife and I did) to stop at two, and many of the reasons are fundamentally about logistics and resources. Transportation is a real component of that.<p>If you take a step back, it does make sense. The difference between zero kids and one is a <i>major</i> qualititative lifestyle change. It&#x27;s the transition from parent to non-parent. It means not easily going out at night, schooling, etc. Everything changes.<p>The transition from one to two kids is a qualitative change <i>for the kid</i> because it means going from no siblings to siblings. That transitively makes it somewhat of a qualitative change for parents. It means the kids always have a playmate and someone their age on vacations. But for parents, it&#x27;s mostly a change in degree. More work, more cost, more time parenting, but the overall lifestyle is basically unchanged.<p>The transition from two to three is really just quantitative. 33% more space in the house for sleeping, 33% more food costs, 33% more car space for transportation, etc. So the decision about when to stop is mostly just &quot;how <i>much</i> of this experience do you want?&quot; The transportation overhead here in the US where you do a <i>lot</i> of driving is a pretty big piece of that.')
