We think of luck as &quot;a good opportunity you can take advantage of&quot; - if you become someone who can take advantage of more opportunities, you become luckier.<p>Some of the strategies that helped me (none of them are intentional):<p>- Never passing up an opportunity to learn - whether new skill or new degree or new industry or a new personal challenge. As Steve Jobs said, sometimes you don&#x27;t learn until later how the dots connect to what you eventually do.<p>- Diversifying my experience. EG: 13~ years ago I was a &quot;senior software developer.&quot; Since then, I had been a &quot;development manager&quot;, a &quot;product manager&quot; and also for a time a &quot;senior software developer&quot; again. When I lost my job a few months ago, I was able to look at opportunities along all 3 of these job tracks, whereas if I had stayed in the single track, I&#x27;d have 1&#x2F;3 the options.<p>- Ditto to industries. Until now, everything I did was in finance, so I intentionally found a role outside of finance, because I could always go back to it if I need to, but now I am proving to myself (and to my resume) that I can cross industries and work anywhere. That again increases. your surface area.<p>- Have a diverse network, for example find a way to connect with young talented people where you are (first job, university) because they will disperse throughout the world and may do cool things and you may want to do those things with them, or they can just help you. It has been amazing how much people that I had barely connected with when we worked together were willing to help when I needed a referral&#x2F;advice&#x2F;whatever.<p>- I&#x27;ll call this one out separately: help people. Make time to mentor people, help them get jobs, put in a good word, whatever. Not everyone will &quot;pay you back&quot; but it doesn&#x27;t matter, the reputation of &quot;xyzelement&#x27;s a good guy, he&#x27;s generally helpful&quot; means the world, especially as you become more senior.<p>- Be the dumbest guy in the room. You grow more when being surrounded by those who can challenge you uncomfortably. Pick the right room. Comfort = death.<p>- Troubleshoot your mind. Most of us are held back by stupid hangups. For example, most developers I know could be overall way more successful if they got over shyness&#x2F;fear of public speaking. Figure out why you fear whatever you fear, and work to get over it. Imagine you didn&#x27;t go for your dream job because it has some minute attribute that you pointlessly fear.<p>- Check your language. If you find that &quot;they&quot; are responsible for what&#x27;s happening to you, you have given away all your power. Figure out how &quot;you&quot; are responsible for where you and and what opportunities &quot;you&quot; have, and then own it and act.')
