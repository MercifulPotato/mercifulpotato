In rent alone I pay $10.5k&#x2F;year (with what most people here extremely cheap rent). When I still was in school living off school loans, our frugal weekly groceries (almost no meat, very rare, mostly fresh produce in discount markets) came out around $80 a week, so about $4-5k&#x2F;year. We&#x27;re already at $15k. This leaves $5k for literally everything else. I&#x27;d wager no kids, no car payments, no cell phone outside maybe prepaid, basically nothing in utilities, buying used clothing, no appliances that broke, no internet above basic, next to nothing in terms of entertainment expenses, etc. Quick mental math keeping the strict minimum from what I pay right now and I&#x27;m already over $20k. This is weirdly cheap.<p>And honestly, if the numbers are right, good on him for having the discipline to do it, but this sounds like a rather awful three years.')
