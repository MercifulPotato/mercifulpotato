I just looked at the app and they support contacts-only limits for everything (voice, presence, profile photo, forwarded messages) _except_ for regular messages.<p>You can&#x27;t reject images from non-contacts either. It&#x27;s either images from everyone or nobody.<p>Does your chats list get filled up with these unsolicited messages from randos?<p>It seems like they should at the very least offer a mechanism to accept a contact request before any messages can be sent.<p>It&#x27;s also an interesting example in the vastly different experience that different demographics can have in an app - say, women, or minorities often the recipients of abuse - and how blind an app maker can be to that experience if it&#x27;s not intentionally studied.')
