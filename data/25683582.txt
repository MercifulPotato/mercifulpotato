While there are no official global figures for ethnicity, we can make some simple inferences based on continental distribution [1]:<p>North America + Europe combined (17.19%) is barely as much as Africa (17.2%), and this is ignoring the fact that a good part of the North American population is non-white. There is nothing &quot;inherent&quot; about there being less non-white patients. The issue is inbalanced access to health care and screening programmes, but that is not inherent.<p>This is without even mentioning that Asia accounts for almost 60% of the global population.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Demographics_of_the_world#2020_population_distribution" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Demographics_of_the_world#2020...</a>')
