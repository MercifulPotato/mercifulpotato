Let&#x27;s say one brake light is out. Now what happens if that person doesnt notice and the other one goes out? You could be looking at injury or death under the right circumstances. Then of course if you&#x27;re saying that the offender is dangerous enough to attack a police officer,then surely they also pose a threat to the public. Getting those threats off the street is more of the A scenario perspective, but nobody said anything about fishing (there has to be reasonable suspicion).<p>There&#x27;s always a chance that a person (including a cop) becomes violent.
