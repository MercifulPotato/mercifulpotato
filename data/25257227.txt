We share a spare bedroom, already equipped with comfortable tanker desks and large monitors, and as such had already superior workstations than those back at our corporate offices.<p>We do have timing collisions for stand up, retros, et cetera but in general it&#x27;s less than 5% of the time so we just try to be quiet when the other is doing a demo.<p>For work-home balance, I would say the balance is largely lost, but that as an overall, the experience is still improved. I find it is much easier to work earlier, and later, hours, but to take larger spans of downtime during what was previously our core hours. So I might find myself writing code at 10pm, but because that tends to happen only when it is a good fit, it&#x27;s still an improvement.<p>But 9 or 10 months is not enough time to really know that it&#x27;s going to last long-term. If I allow the work-home imbalance to solidify, what longer term effects will I come to regret?')
