There is a problem if they have open access to everyone&#x27;s data.<p>&gt; But it&#x27;s impossible to intercept communications encrypted end-to-end, or encrypted at rest, considering the strength of the algorithms freely available today.<p>What about to people talking to each other in private. That could be considered as &quot;problematic&quot; as end to end encryption. Should their phones be recording them so the government can snoop later? And for encryption at rest, what if someone has a safe that self destructs is someone unauthorized tries to open it? Should that be illegal?')
