Patents&#x27; purposes from the viewpoint of the <i>inventor</i> is to secure the 20-year monopoly on the invention (or to secure a plausible threat). Nobody would file a patent for the sole purpose of disclosure. If you really want to disclose something, there are a million easier, better, and cheaper ways to do it.<p>&gt;So why would the Navy file a patent on something? It is plausible that their goal in doing so was to disclose its existence.<p>If they wanted disclosure, they could just post it on their website and issue a press release. Or publish a book. Or a journal article. Or add it to their podcast. They already do all these things. Why not for this?')
