They like that Trump doesn&#x27;t kowtow to the media and they like his judge picks, his foreign policy, and executive orders. The media would zing Romney with little zingers and he would get all hang dog and apologize, but Trump punched back instead and his voter base loved that they finally had a candidate that would stand up to the media.<p>Trump also tried very hard to make good on his campaign promises.\nCan you imagine opening an embassy in Jerusalem under Hillary? I can&#x27;t, and my conservative relatives love that he did that and that he stands up to China and acknowledged Taiwan&#x27;s president. They also love that he fights back against identity politics (removing requirement for forced diversity trainings, etc). In short, from their perspective he goes to bat on a lot of their grievances.<p>So yeah, his Twitter is a dumpster fire, but half his voter base doesn&#x27;t even see it because they don&#x27;t use twitter.')
