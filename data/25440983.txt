If a part isn&#x27;t available regularly and in reasonable quantities on Digi-Key, it doesn&#x27;t go into the product. Your margins will be lower than ideal, but you can usually build in batches of ~1000 this way without getting totally sunk.<p>Of course, if you&#x27;re even moderately successful, you&#x27;ll eventually find Chinese clones selling for half price, so you&#x27;d better have some other competitive advantage if you plan on taking this route.')
