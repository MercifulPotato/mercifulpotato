This accounts for network effects. That&#x27;s hundreds of deaths per day.<p>31, ethics scoring rubric: diversity concerns net the essential worker approach two additional points over the elderly approach, not one as you claimed.<p>33, overall rubric: the elderly approach was favored until ethics was considered, where, driven by diversity concerns, the essential worker approach was granted 3 overall points as opposed to 1 for the elderly approach.<p>And the craziest thing is, at no point in the rubric is &quot;fewer people will die&quot; considered a pro on the part of the elderly-first approach.<p>Preventing deaths has been the goal from the very beginning. This abrupt switch from &quot;we have to save as many lives as possible&quot; to &quot;who cares about total deaths?&quot; is exactly the kind of &quot;progressive&quot; political advocacy that you denied existed at the very beginning of this thread.<p>For the record, I&#x27;m on the side of &quot;save as many lives as possible&quot; and have been since the very beginning.')
