As far as I&#x27;m concerned, the most rational position is to expect user privacy as a primary feature of any services&#x2F;products we use, particularly if they don&#x27;t need to be relaying any data in the first place.<p>I mean, perhaps if Facebook made a pair of headphones would you accept that it&#x27;s not quite tinfoil hat stuff to be interested in user privacy?
