Item(by='taxicab', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604732994, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25013606, text='No.  This baseless insistance that the most closely watched election in living history has had fraud at a scale never seen in the US that occurred in front of hundreds of bipartisan observers is literally a conspiracy theory.<p>All of the newly minted statistics experts on the internet wildly missaplying methods to support their foregone conclusions are exactly the same as Johny C. Theorist getting an internet education in materials science so that he can understand for himself that jet fuel doesn&#x27;t melt steel beams.  Trump&#x27;s polling numbers also don&#x27;t follow Benford&#x27;s law in some cases.  That&#x27;s because there is no direct causation between legitimate elections and a Benford&#x27;s law style distribution.<p>The fixation on wildly cherry picked data and missaplied statistics is the conspiracy theory.  There are already court cases with the best experts in the land looking at the counts.  Guess what?  They are starting to be laughed out of court because they have no evidence to support their claims.<p>There is no liberal conspiracy to steal an election.  Trump made the same claim in 2016.  He made it during the repblican primaries about his opponents (that they cheated him).  He said the system was rigged when he settled the fraud lawsuite for trump university.  Hell... he even said he was being cheated when his tv show wasn&#x27;t awarded an Emmy.  This is just what he does and instead of spreading lies he needs to accept that he lost (probably... we&#x27;ll see soon) and stop dividing the country.')
