The source for the story was the cloned contents of the hard drive, not the computer itself.<p>Regarding point 6: The defense used by the Biden campaign was <i>very</i> specific, to wit: <i>we have reviewed Joe Biden&#x27;s official schedules from the time and no meeting, as alleged by the New York Post, ever took place.</i>*<p>If I were going to hold a covert meeting with foreign nationals that falls afoul of anti-corruption laws, I wouldn&#x27;t be putting it on my official schedule either. This is not a defense to the accusation made.<p>I still want to see the raw emails. PDF screenshots aren&#x27;t trustworthy, but the DKIM-signed messages with headers would confirm authenticity. Another thing that lends credence to the legitimacy of the hard drive are the photos taken from it - these too are in the NYPO article.')
