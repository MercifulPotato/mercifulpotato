I also find that I certainly feel more secure holding with a case with rubberized edges. Using it in one hand is sort of important to me. In normal times I often have a phone in one hand and food&#x2F;beverage in another at events. The Plus sizes have always felt a bit too large to me.<p>I would have upgraded this year normally. With travel mostly shut down for a while though, I may end waiting another year. I don&#x27;t need an upgrade for mostly using around the house.')
