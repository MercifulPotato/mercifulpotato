Literacy was rare and symbolism was literally much more common than text. Imagine how expensive books must be in a society where each book(often in Latin!) must be copied by hand. Who could afford books? How do you express meaning if most people can&#x27;t read? Historic or mythical events were often shown like a comic book without text, be it on Trajan&#x27;s column or in any reasonably old European church. Signboards (before shops, taverns etc) were giant pictures too. Pictures have the added benefit they&#x27;re understood by traveling foreigners and merchants. Hard borders are a modern invention.')
