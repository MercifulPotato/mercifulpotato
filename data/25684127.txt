Today the equivalent is alternative clients to Facebook not being allowed on iOS and the App Store.<p>Look at YC startups like motion being built on top of the web. They are building on top of the network effects of gmail&#x2F;google&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;slack etc. We aren&#x27;t allowed any of that on mobile. Had they been allowed more access to the mobile OS&#x27;s, they could be a very successful company. We haven&#x27;t even touched the tip of cross OS productivity integrations.')
