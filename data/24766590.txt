I deliberately wanted to pick a more sensible comment to post under.<p>&quot;For the most part, I do not think we should discuss the limits of engineering, that is what&#x27;s practical or not, because we&#x27;re nobody to say what is practical to a type II or type III civilization.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s two aspects to engineering we can talk about; fundamental limits, and whether we can attain those fundamental limits.<p>If you look up the concept of computronium, you&#x27;ll find a discussion of the fundamental limits of data storage in our universe, for instance. Proposing an alien civilization that exceeds those is stepping into fantasy. We can sensibly discuss what just isn&#x27;t possible.<p>On the other hand, given that the &quot;fundamental limit&quot; is &quot;the number of bits you can encode on the event horizon of a black hole&quot;, it&#x27;s at least plausible to consider that no possible engineering project could ever create such a storage device. It&#x27;s hard to talk about the &quot;what <i>is</i> possible&quot; side.')
