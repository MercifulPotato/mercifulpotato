China also censors what people can read only on their internet. But its still &quot;actual censorship&quot; even if you can just go to another place.<p>This is exactly the kind of useless arguing about definition. It doesn&#x27;t matter if the word is used wrong, if it is used for a lack of a better one. You can disagree with that but unless you come up with a better one you aint contributing anything. You just deflect the discussion away form the actual topic&#x2F;problem. Its about the (negative) effect the [insert &quot;your better word for consensual censorship form a private company that has no obligation to reason their action&quot; here] has on the people of this planet. It looks to me like you dont see a problem so you question the word used to express it instead.')
