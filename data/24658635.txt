And so, if people see this enough, they will build up a natural and understandable annoyance and resistance to future commits from such people.<p>Try applying this logic to literally anything else in life (say crime statistics) and you will wade into racist territory in short order. I don&#x27;t see why <i>we</i> get to be the honorable exception.<p>That all being said, I kind of agree that complaining about it is futile. I think that smart and practical Indian dudes should account for this kind of racism during their career. Hence my advice (which I follow myself) to them to stick to writing proprietary software and improve their skills in that arena. Or play the open source game on extra hard mode, it&#x27;s their choice really.')
