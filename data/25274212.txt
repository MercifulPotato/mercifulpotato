(5 in the morning)<p>I do it when I have time for it and if I have time for it in the evening I have fun solving it. Last year I did a few once since i remembered these far to late but came till 10 ? challenge and forgott about it again till yesterday, and now try to follow up each day if i have time and want to and dont feel pressured by it it is for fun and maybe learning something new!
