This year saw even more loosening of the control structure because of knee-jerk reactions to perceived pandemic limitations (warranted or not, I don&#x27;t care). I also don&#x27;t care what your politics are or which team you root for, but from a systems perspective there are very obvious control deficiencies in how elections are carried out in this country.<p>Claims of fraud would be far, far, far easier to dismiss if a better control structure was in place. Maybe a national certification (a la NIST) that would be optional for states to adopt, but would at least would provide a framework for transparent state and local alignment (or misalignment) with best practice.')
