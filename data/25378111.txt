It&#x27;s really respect worthy.<p>I&#x27;m not Christian.  I&#x27;m not religious. I&#x27;m not Republican.  I&#x27;m not disliking trans people.  I&#x27;m not afraid of any such issues.   All wrong.  Yet you were happy to assume all that?<p>What I don&#x27;t like is people who take on for themselves the cloak of righteous moral positioning on behalf of others, and force others to conform to their thinking because they believe they&#x27;re right.   Or worse, believe they&#x27;re better.<p>&quot;They&quot; is not singular.  You know the person is a man.   You want to neuter everyone&#x27;s speech to fit your worldview for the benefit of a 1%.<p>Strong opinions do not equal anger.   And not everything in the world should be solved by just &quot;can&#x27;t we all get along and let people do what they feel is good&quot;.   Opinions and attitudes such as you&#x27;re showing are deserving of objection and being opinionated in the opposite direction.')
