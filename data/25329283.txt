The fees are really just ordinary income plain and simple (which they get regardless of how the fund does), and while carried interest is technically a return on invested capital, it&#x27;s entirely OPM and seems like a dodge that lets the manager participate in the upside of the fund with no actual skin in the game, so what&#x27;s the point of taxing it at a preferential rate?')
