I worked with their developer products (and for Borland directly on Delphi&#x2F;Kylix&#x2F;C++Builder, eventually) until the mid-2000s. I&#x27;ve never seen the match of Borland&#x27;s docs, before or since, particularly as integrated with the IDE&#x27;s coding features.<p>There are a number of programming languages and APIs with excellent documentation, but theirs were above and beyond.')
