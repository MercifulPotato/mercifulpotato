Eve is now given two obfuscated programs O1 and O2. They were produced by applying iO to A and B, but Eve knows neither A, B nor how O1 and O2 map to O(A) and O(B).<p>If it were possible for Eve to somehow obtain your password from, say (without loss of generality), O1 in any way, then Eve could deduce that O1 <i>must</i> be O(A). It could not be O(B) because neither O nor B contain information about your password.<p>Since we assert that indistinguishable obfuscation makes it impossible to draw this kind of conclusion, it must be impossible to obtain your password from O(A) <i>if</i> B exists.')
