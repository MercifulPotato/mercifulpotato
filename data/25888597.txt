He said something like; when trying to learn new mathematical ideas&#x2F;concepts always start with a book 80% of which is already known and 20% is what is new. That way you bolster your confidence with the refresher and have to struggle with only a few concepts at a time. Your motivation and energy can be used optimally. If you think about it, this makes eminent sense. This is the reason i really dislike the &quot;bro&#x2F;competitive&quot; time-based approach to learning and am a great fan of each person learning at their own pace and only competing with their past selves.')
