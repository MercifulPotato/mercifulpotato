I think that&#x27;s what gp meant in implying that inheritance is not optional.<p>This is correct but not what GP wrote. What GP wrote is:<p>&gt; Unlike in Java, which offers practically nothing else [than inheritance] to organize a program,<p>To point out why GP is wrong:<p>- In Java you can organize files by packages<p>- by purpose (different folders for test vs production code),<p>- you can use composition to combine classes (in fact this is the recommended way these days)<p>- etc<p>I normally don&#x27;t care about language wars but I think it is OK to point out when someone writes something that is <i>clearly</i> wrong.')
