I agree it doesn&#x27;t come after the consumers of illegally streamed content but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to say it only targets for-profit platforms. And it&#x27;s <i>certainly</i> much broader than targeting &quot;criminal organizations&quot; as the linked (not HN) headline wrongly suggests. Someone uploading protected content in exchange for reddit gold could easily fall within this definition of criminal conduct. People who &quot;trade&quot; files with one another might fall within it, too. I think the linked press release is intentionally downplaying the scope.<p>[1] &quot;The Protecting Lawful Streaming Act would apply only to commercial, for-profit streaming piracy services. The law will not sweep in normal practices by online service providers, good faith business disputes, noncommercial activities, or in any way impact individuals who access pirated streams or unwittingly stream unauthorized copies of copyrighted works. Individuals who might use pirate streaming services will not be affected.&quot;<p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tillis.senate.gov&#x2F;services&#x2F;files&#x2F;A30B0C08-FB97-4F90-BB60-43283EB7AF35" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tillis.senate.gov&#x2F;services&#x2F;files&#x2F;A30B0C08-FB97-4...</a>')
