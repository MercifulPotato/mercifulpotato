Generosity is good in the software world because the rules of the game benefits everybody the most when everybody are generous. I believe it&#x27;s similar to prisoners dilemma but with even bigger benefits when we are all generous.<p>However, it&#x27;s also a tit-for-tat game. When others start to be greedy it makes some sense to be greedy yourself. Thus short circuiting the game and making the playground worse for everyone. Until we realize that generous is better again.<p>So tying back to your comment. Yes, open source contributors doesn&#x27;t expect something back but they can only hope that others at least pay it forward.')
