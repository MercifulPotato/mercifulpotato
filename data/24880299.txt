As evidence for the &quot;dislike&quot; of purely political topics, there was at least one political detox period where political topics were discouraged altogether. (Edit: that&#x27;s why there are more people flagging&#x2F;downvoting the post, it&#x27;s not just censorship)<p>I&#x27;m not arguing for or against political topics here, both have their merits. If the above sounds otherwise then it&#x27;s because english is not my native tongue and choosing words is not my specialty.')
