They eventually phased this app out though I believe under the guise of incompatibility with an Android update, and later renamed it &quot;ZZZSCRABBLE Free.&quot; I have never felt so burned- this was clearly a &quot;Heads you win, Tails I lose&quot; situation. For online play, maybe I understand since there are costs involved in running the service, but why can&#x27;t I just play the computer?<p>I think this may have happened again because I see another version that I had installed called &quot;zzSUNSET SCRABBLE.&quot; Its maddening, I can still play the Scrabble game that I have on CD ROM from 1997 in a VM, but can&#x27;t play Scrabble in an ad-free environment on my phone in 2020.')
