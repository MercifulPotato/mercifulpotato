The explanation, even with all those graphics, is poor. The idea is that one wheel can go <i>slower</i> than the speed it would go if the axle was rigid, but it can&#x27;t go <i>faster</i>.<p>With that design (which seems to be a Torsen Type A), the faster wheel does all the work of propelling the vehicle on turns, but the wheels lock together if one starts to slip. So it&#x27;s for off-road vehicles, like the military HUMMV.  (But not the civilian Hummer H1. That used a Dana differential more suited to on-road driving at higher speeds.)')
