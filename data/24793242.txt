Autopilot disengages whenever there is something it cannot handle. How is that meaningful?<p>You could say it is &quot;one example&quot; if this was a human driver running over a pedestrian. If one AI car has a bug all models with same AI have it. There is 0.5M Model 3 and counting.<p>I just used one example as a point and it is much less important than issue of 3rd party verification. You don&#x27;t know if manufacturer fixes the bug, when it is done and you never know if it regresses.')
