Item(by='Thorrez', descendants=None, kids=[25179406], score=None, time=1606033735, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25175599, text='&gt; Apropos of nothing: if anyone is a yuppie FAANG employee living in rent control apartments, you ARE part of the problem.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if I would consider my self a yuppie, but on the chance I am considered a yuppie, how do you suggest I stop being part of the problem? I moved into my apartment 3 years ago, and a year after I moved in the city passed regulations making it rent controlled. Should I move somewhere else and specifically try to avoid rent controlled apartments? I chose this apartment because at the time it was one of the cheapest.')
