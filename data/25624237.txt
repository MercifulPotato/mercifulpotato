The &quot;fraudsters&quot; here have done a service to society: Uber wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the free, organic growth they were getting and wanted to be more greedy and pay 100M to litter the web with ads; the fraudsters took the 100M and cleaned up their littering by &quot;consuming&quot; these ads with fraudulent clicks while giving Uber the outcome they wanted, albeit one they would&#x27;ve gotten anyway had they not been greedy.')
