Its entire purpose, as expalained in a CGP Grey video, was creating a situation where no one state has to move first by making the agreement only take effect once a certain number of electoral votes are accounted for.<p>The problem is that this agreement is expressly unconstitutional by way of article 1 section 10: <i>No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, [...] enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State</i><p>While states are allowed to divvy up their EVs within their own borders however they choose, this kind of interstate agreement to do so in a certain way is illegal, and bipartisan congressional support to circumvent the electoral college seems unlikely.')
