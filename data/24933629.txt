Each node is just Postgres with TimescaleDB, and acts as a separate Postgres server with it&#x27;s own replication (if any) - at least at present.<p>So your &quot;fact&quot; regular tables are created on the server you configure as the access node and then you can join with distributed hypertables in your queries.<p>If one wanted the same fact tables on multiple access nodes you could either use postgres partitioning or duplicate them somehow yourself.<p>I like the flexibility here in cluster configuration. It&#x27;s good to have options when scaling a system.')
