As in the question, if you know exactly what needed to be designed (in concept), how long would it take you to have a fab turning out units?<p>Is it the work to figure out how to lay down the component blocks on the die and all the circuit routing?  Is it figuring out how to assemble the power-efficient components from the Arm library?  Does that take years?  Is it the instruction set?  Is it the planning for manufacturing capacity?<p>I&#x27;m just curious to know what the actual work and division of labor &#x2F; time is to &quot;make a chip&quot;.<p>I would love to know for example:<p>-- Initial design, 10 people, 1 year<p>-- Prototype runs, 5 people, 6 months<p>-- Final design, 5 people, 1 year<p>-- etc etc.<p>-- Acquiring fab capacity &#x2F; manufacturing hardware, 10 people, 1 year<p>-- etc etc.<p>But sounds like there&#x27;s no way Intel or others can just &quot;leapfrog&quot; even if they knew what needed to be done and could abandon their prior choices.')
