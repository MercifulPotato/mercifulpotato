My preferred paradigm is also roughly “idiomatic go or rust.” But the OP isn’t arguing for idiomatic-go-or-rust, as far as I can tell they’re arguing against ever using methods or virtual dispatch (which are core features of both of those languages)! My claim is that the OP’s diagnosis of the problem—“virtual dispatch causes your code to be confusing, get rid of it”—is incorrect.')
