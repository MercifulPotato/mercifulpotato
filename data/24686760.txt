We are talking about static website hosting. Stuff that only changes once per deployment. If your static site cache expires after less than one minute then the static site hosting provider is just bad at his job and can&#x27;t even get very basic settings right.<p>Low expiry only makes sense when you are caching dynamic content like hackernews or reddit. You want caching because reddit is a high traffic site but you also don&#x27;t want to delay content updates too much because your expiration time is too long.')
