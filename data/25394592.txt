You can only use one, maybe two apps at a time, but they are still windows - just tiled, not floating, and always accessed from a list, not a stack.  Icons are obviously still a thing, but I think we hit the nail on the head with those as uniquely shaped pictograms are easier to parse quickly than descriptive text.  Menus are often minimal, but they still exist to the extent of &quot;ordered list of things to interact with&quot;, and the only thing I think that can really be argued we&#x27;ve got rid of is pointers - but from where I see it, I just think we&#x27;ve added nine more pointers.')
