I&#x27;d say it was the fastest I could ever edit text. It really can be insanely fast for <i>editing</i> text but ultimately, I don&#x27;t <i>like</i> vim. I don&#x27;t spend that much time literally <i>editing</i> text, like a copy editor. I spend much more time typing and thinking, and very little editing.<p>I can touch type both QWERTY and Dvorak. I usually type Dvorak, and the longer I type QWERTY, the more I get this mental fatigue of continually overriding what my fingers wanted to do. Using vim gives me a tinge of that feeling, that I wouldn&#x27;t recognize as a hint of that feeling if I didn&#x27;t know how the bigger version of the feeling feels after a day of typing QWERTY. It has something to do with the impedance mismatch of hitting keys in the wrong mode&#x2F;forgetting what mode you&#x27;re in (humans are terrible at moded interfaces) and throwing around a minilanguage for text editing in my head besides the actual task I need to do.<p>Saving 2 or 3 minutes of text editing a day isn&#x27;t worth the aggravation.<p>I would say you can feel like you have a godlike sense of power over the text, like you&#x27;re playing Age of Empires. Some people probably like that, and equate it with productivity and time-savings. It&#x27;s optimizing for the wrong thing.')
