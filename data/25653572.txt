They&#x27;re not Goody Two-Shoes type good. Morally, they care about getting the big questions right, but not about observing proprieties. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d use the word naughty rather than evil. They delight in breaking rules, but not rules that matter.</i>&quot;<p>Is there any doubt that YCombinator would be investing in TicketMaster if it were a startup?  Is there any moral distance between the scofflaw insouciance of AirBNB and TicketMaster?  TicketMaster just eliminated a threat to its quasi-monopoly through criminality and were rewarded because the criminal penalty was utterly inconsequential compared with the commercial advantage obtained.  They have &quot;won&quot; in the &quot;marketplace&quot;, as that criminality-advantaging &quot;marketplace&quot; was constructed.<p>The unjust demolition of TicketMaster&#x27;s competitors, and the resulting systemic economic inefficiency, is underpinned by rhetoric like yours.')
