But I do remember the conversation - the editor was asked what he did to relax away from his duties at the magazine, what did he do to unwind?  He replied that he watched the BBC series &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; and &quot;Smiley&#x27;s People&quot;, over and over again because he thought they were absolute perfection, something that could never be improved with change.  I tend to agree, thank you John le Carre&#x27; for bringing these stories and characters to life.  Thank you Sir Alec Guiness for being - and I mean being - George Smiley.')
