Item(by='fsflover', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603266179, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24842542, text='&gt; It uses its own flavor of Linux, meaning support options are extremely limited.<p>The difference between PureOS and Debian is practically non-existent.<p>&gt; System76&#x27;s website is itself half-broken, with 500 errors<p>OK, it proves that the company is about to die. We of course never see those errors on big websites &#x2F;s<p>&gt;If tomorrow a million Apple users said &quot;Enough! LittleSnitch is the straw that breaks the camel&#x27;s back!&quot; and decided they wanted to shop for a desktop linux system, the market couldn&#x27;t handle it.<p>Although it is true, the good news is that such thing just cannot happen. This is not how the market changes. The change is always smooth enough that the companies can adjust. And I am sure Purism and System76 are able to given reasonable time.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m saying that it is not a mass-market option right now for users frustrated with Windows&#x2F;OS X.<p>Many (most?) frustrated users on MacOS are those who can use the options I listed. If they understand the problems like the one in the title, they definitely can order a laptop online. Probably also true with Windows. Such changes typically start with geeks anyway (AFAIK geeks switched to MacOS first).<p>&gt; You cannot point to niche operations and claim it to be a viable mass-market option.<p>I did not claim that. I suggest that those complaining about users restrictions should go to Linux. Typical users do not complain about such things.<p>&gt; I didn&#x27;t say you can&#x27;t buy Linux pre-installed, I said you can&#x27;t go into a big-box store like Best Buy to do so, and that there&#x27;s no significant consumer support infrastructure.<p>Now you have a point and I actually do not really understand, why I cannot just enter a big shop and ask for a Linux laptop. I actually tried to ask tens of times and they always say there are no. Sounds like a conspiracy by the big labels to me.')
