People can short more in aggregate than exists the same way the money multiplier exists for banks.  But there are bank runs and it&#x27;s built on trust, so that&#x27;s risky too and we make people hold on to a certain amount to cover what they lend.<p>I guess I&#x27;d just prefer they use call options to cover the shorts instead of borrowing.  No leverage or multiplier effect there.  Gets too high, just execute the call.  Am I also missing something there?')
