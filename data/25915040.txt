Item(by='dustinmoris', descendants=None, kids=[25915161, 25915285], score=None, time=1611664020, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25914960, text='&gt; Other companies can&#x27;t undercut Mastercard&#x27;s fees because the consumer(the person making the decision of payment type here) doesn&#x27;t know or care what the fee is.<p>You got the consumer part wrong. The consumer is the merchant, which can decide if they allow Mastercard cards or not. Same as many merchants don&#x27;t accept Amex. It&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t like to pay the Amex fee. Same as many merchants don&#x27;t accept Apple Pay or Android Pay or why some merchants only allow card payments for purchases of a minimum amount.<p>Merchants are the consumers and they decide what cards they will accept. Based on what cards they will accept consumers will be picky about which cards they want to have. For those exact reasons I have a VISA credit card as well as an AMEX because I sometimes can&#x27;t use my AMEX, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t even have a VISA CC.')
