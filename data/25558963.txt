Cost per kwh is all that matters.<p>That&#x27;s like pointing to AM radio being around longer saying it produced more hours of audio and then trying to use that as a basis for it being of superior quality. It&#x27;s just older.<p>The bicycle argument is also a total misunderstanding of the vast technical superiority of things like modern solar.<p>The aptera and light-year one automobiles for instance, both due next year, will feature solar panels, that in sunny climates, will charge a vehicle more miles than an average daily commute.<p>This means that in typical use, the owner will never need to plug in or otherwise fuel up the vehicle, at all.<p>For a WFHer like myself it means I effectively will always hop in with a &quot;full tank&quot;. I&#x27;m excited and you should be too.<p>These are the 1.0 version of the cars. Wait until the 5th or 10th year.<p>In 2030, a 1,500 or 2,000 mile range vehicle that fueled itself merely by sitting outside is what I&#x27;ll be driving. You can continue going to the gas station and paying $10-20&#x2F;gallon if you wish. Have fun.<p>There&#x27;s significant revolutions in energy coming in the 2020s. Such as partially transparent photovoltaics that transition window UV exposure with the sunlight so you get a pleasant adaptive window coating that also powers your home.<p>We&#x27;re on the road to effectively unmetered energy. We are doimg much better than coal now. Let&#x27;s keep moving')
