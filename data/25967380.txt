In programming, we are expected to understand concepts, not memorize documentation of a library. Of course, if you are too specialized working with few libraries&#x2F;frameworks, you will naturally end up knowing its methods by heart. But that doesn&#x27;t mean searching things up online is a bad practice. In fact, I believe it is more useful to keep updating yourself from the web on better ways to write some piece of code than what you have memorized from a year back old doc.<p>Also, eventually, what matters is how you connect the bits and pieces you take from online and integrate them into your software. How you design and shape your software so that&#x27;s its scalable, optimized and reliable is in your hand and that&#x27;s what matters the most!')
