In fashion and cosmetics there are tons of men. Though in early-childhood education it may be very female at the instructor level, it most certainly is not for companies that develop products and services in that industry.<p>So not to discount the sentiment, rather to say &#x27;it&#x27;s hard&#x27;.')
