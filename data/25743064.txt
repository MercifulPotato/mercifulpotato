For clarity, avoid any calls to violence. How many places would not deplatform you, suspend you, or at least downvote you into oblivion?<p>Not many. Anonymous boards are some of such places.<p>Even if you think that some people are patently <i>wrong</i> on the Internet, dangerously and irredeemably wrong, it&#x27;s more useful to be aware that such people exist, than to hide this fact from yourself in order to have a quieter sleep.<p>Freedom is, by definition, also freedom for those you disagree with, despise, even hate. If either side <i>forces</i> their (doubtlessly, virtuous and well-founded) views on the other (doubtlessly, misinformed and stubborn), I have a hard time calling it freedom. It&#x27;s a standard ideological oppression.')
