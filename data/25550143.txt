Mistakes don&#x27;t feel like &quot;Ah, interesting, I&#x27;ve learnt not to do that&quot;, instead it&#x27;s &quot;Of course I should have done this instead, it&#x27;s obvious, I must be an idiot to not have done this&quot; - even though in the moment you were getting a dozen other things right, and just didn&#x27;t have the mental capacity to stretch to this additional thing.<p>So any skill growth in the game happens slowly  by your mind learning to make many of the optimal decisions subconsciously, thus making things slowly more manageable. But that&#x27;s not an easily visible, tangible change. And it still leaves you with twenty things you could be doing better, that are &quot;obvious&quot; in retrospect.')
