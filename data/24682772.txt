However, even with good policy decisions we would have to see them through while grappling with the extremely different demographics and other widely varying conditions.  One of my education professors at Rice felt strongly that the USA needed a &quot;Marshall Plan&quot; for educational funding across the nation.  I&#x27;ve always thought this sounded like a dream come true, but even I have to admit that one thing that makes wrestling with educational reform in the USA so different from most places is that Americans have historically been highly opposed to centralized control of how children are educated and favor more local decision-making and funding.  It seems very messy compared to the streamlined top-down approaches in many other countries.  So somehow one would have to win Americans over to accepting more centralized control and funding of schools, or get them to somehow ensure that schools in under-funded districts get the resources they need to enjoy whatever we all decide is the baseline for an excellent education.  It seems like it would be much easier to go with the first option since we have over a thousand school districts in the country, but millions and millions of people feel that would be an overreach by the government.  I&#x27;m all for learning from other places, but when those other places don&#x27;t have to overcome the same problem it&#x27;s hard to figure out how to replicate the things they are doing right.')
