So I only ever watch his streams live for a while and then I catch the remainder on VOD.<p>He also has a YouTube page with archive of past streams beyond the retention of Twitch.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UC17ewSS9f2EnkCyMztCdoKA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UC17ewSS9f2EnkCyMztCdoKA</a><p>Honestly the knowledge he shares is so interesting that I selfishly did not want other people to even know about it. But realistically speaking I am not going to have time to make real use of the knowledge myself anytime soon.<p>He puts out quality content and he deserves all the attention he can get. And also, even though competition to find security bugs and earn bounties might become too hard that I myself or you ever get to find one and claim some money, the products that we all use will be more secure the more people in the world that work on finding these bugs and reporting them.')
