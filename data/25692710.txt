I think American&#x27;s fetishize &quot;free speech&quot; which leads to a &quot;hyper group a&quot; that argues since censorship is scary (which it is) we&#x27;d rather face any other conceivable consequence rather than wrestle with the hard questions of what is appropriate vs. inappropriate public speech. I believe we&#x27;re seeing examples of where the pendulum has swung too far, in the US, towards &quot;say what you want&quot; and we need to bump it back a bit. If it swings too far the other way I&#x27;ll quickly switch my thoughts on the matter.<p>Also, there&#x27;s another dimension which I think gets immediately thrown on the floor when these discussions come up. Very rarely are people calling for controls on what can be said at any time. Instead, it&#x27;s controls on what can be said to large amounts of people. Group b folks, such as myself, are not saying that we&#x27;re concerned about dinner conversations. We&#x27;re concerned about speech that is being amplified in a way where there&#x27;s a civic responsibility to ensure that the harmful messages are not being amplified.')
