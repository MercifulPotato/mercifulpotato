The company had enough capital to stay in business, but never went anywhere, and my shares were washed out in subsequent funding rounds.<p>The second had 40 hour weeks and I worked there for six years. A fair-to-middling exit to Broadcom.<p>The third one had 40 hour weeks and I worked there for 3 years. A great exit to Google.')
