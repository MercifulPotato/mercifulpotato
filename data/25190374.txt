You can&#x27;t just call something a royalty, it specifically means a payment in consideration for an IP license (meaning the right to use another&#x27;s IP). For a work-for-hire agreement, the author never owns the IP license; as a commissioned work the copyright <i>always</i> belongs to the employer, so there is never a royalty.  (On a more technical note, legally the consideration received from the <i>sale</i> of an entire IP right is not a royalty either, since it&#x27;s not for a license but for the outright sale of the IP right.)<p>Thus, a sales-bonus for a WFH product isn&#x27;t a royalty. Moreover, the original WFH payments would not be royalties either.')
