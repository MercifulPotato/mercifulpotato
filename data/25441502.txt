So `something@yourdomain.com` will always be yours no matter if you self host or use 3rd party. I currently use Fastmail and i&#x27;ve been very happy with them. If they fail or turn evil, I&#x27;ll switch to something else maintaining the same address. Emails themselves should be downloaded&#x2F;backed-up regularly, kind of like important documents you&#x27;d have on your disk.')
