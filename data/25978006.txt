Item(by='csomar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612092315, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25972509, text='&gt; Credit Suisse defines “wealth” as the value of a household’s financial assets plus real assets (principally housing), minus their debts.<p>This definition excludes a whole category of people: Those whose wealth is 0 (or even negative) but they are rich or at least living like rich people. If you own $10m in assets and have $10m in debt, your wealth is 0 but I&#x27;m pretty sure you are not poor. What&#x27;s the percentage of such people in society? This should make inequality even worse.<p>Then you have a category of people who are not rich on paper but they have access to privileges (ie: government bureaucrats). As bad as inequality on these stats is, I think it&#x27;s severely under-reported.')
