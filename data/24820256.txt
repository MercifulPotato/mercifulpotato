It still places such usage, and group-formation, at the mercy of a feudal federation of sysop-lords, &quot;my land my rules&quot;.<p>The creation of lists&#x2F;communities-of-commonality that can transcend any one server&#x2F;delivery-path choice seems the purest option, with the most headroom for generative expansions. It should be most possible in identity-based, server-oblivious systems, like Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB).')
