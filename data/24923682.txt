It was unanimous that Code Review on Gerrit was way better:<p>1. You start reviewing the commit message, that is the first touch point with a change everyone has\n2. Navigation is done from file to file\n3. On Gerrit there isn&#x27;t two people commenting the same thing, because:\n3.a. Messages from different people on the same line change are displayed together, not as different threads.\n3.b. The review of a previous version is displayed with the next version, so you can continue the same discussion<p>I understand that GitHub&#x2F;GitLab interface is more friendly, but their code-review really stands in the way of producing good software by not favoring good commit messages and long discussions.')
