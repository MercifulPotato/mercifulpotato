Is it possible to sign and notarize an app for macOS without paying $99&#x2F;year? I am writing an open source program and want to make it easy for people to install but I don’t think I can justify the cost for something probably no one will see. It’s pretty niche.<p>I’ve called Apple about it and I’ve searched the web, but I haven’t got a definitive enough answer to satisfy my uncertainty (although I strongly suspect it is the case).
