And more literate. And more college educated. However, they are not more educated on the topics related to the context of this discussion, like how to filter what&#x27;s seen on social media, or how the government actually works, or economic systems, or most of the things political discussions are made from. Those topics aren&#x27;t taught effectively in school anymore, at least not in the areas correlated with alt-right extremism.')
