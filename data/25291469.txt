Item(by='donor20', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607016094, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25290696, text='Can I ask a quick question - do you have familiarity with corporate treasury type activity at businesses and SAAS businesses?<p>The volume of businesses that will be interested in this is going to be high. Your accounting platform would LOVE to be able to add banking features. Your expense management platform would LOVE to have direct integrated debit cards and cash management for you (and their customers will love it). Your education institutions would love to have their stored value &#x2F; payment flows made more efficient (huge numbers of changing students with onsite and offsite dining, stipends, reimbursements etc etc with lots of lost cards and more).<p>In most cases, business do a POOR job of KYC when onboarding payment recipients.<p>My guess is stripes default flow to onboard hairstylists and dog walkers will be stronger, and repeat bad actors will be more easily identified by them then whatever your existing corporate treasury process is (usually upload an ACH file with some very minimum checks based on a webapp onboarding).Stripes model for KYC &#x2F; onboarding will be API driven almost certainly, that&#x27;s going to be part of the value add without question. Emailing PDF&#x27;s back and forth is not scalable for onboarding with KYC frankly (and not always that secure).<p>In more specialized cases, the person building on top of the treasury function, if required by their business &#x2F; license etc, would need to do additional bookkeeping &#x2F; KYC as necessary. That&#x27;s how it always is. For example, many states require a money transmitter license. Transferwise could do the recordkeeping and validation around transfers at whatever additional level needed to be able to offer their product in those states, which may include things like finding out source of funds. So if you are operating a money transfer business, yes, you either may not be allowed on stripe, or you may get asked what is going on.<p>The other thing is, for many transfers &quot;on platform&quot; its going to be VERY clear what is going on. Stripe will have metadata access on the API side it looks like. They can review what is happening for reasonableness. And they already play in a pretty large space, I would be surprised if a lot of use cases exceeded their capacity and am sure MANY use cases would be within capacity.')
