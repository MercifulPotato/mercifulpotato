I haven&#x27;t heard of any bots brute forcing over IPv6 yet, which will be much harder due to the size of the address space but those two aside...<p>A bot is unlikely to reconfigure the host&#x27;s network stack to grab or rotate additional IPv6 addresses. That type of behaviour would be very easy to detect by endpoint protection systems and shut down.<p>When scanning, scraping, and&#x2F;or brute forcing service passwords they&#x27;re likely to remain using the same IPv6 address either permanently or on a daily rotation, most likely this will be mostly impacted by OS defaults on privacy addresses as I don&#x27;t actually expect many normal users to know and&#x2F;or care about them.<p>So if you&#x27;re attacked on IPv6, you&#x27;ll likely be equally protected by fail2ban as you are on IPv4.')
