Meritocracy turns into plutocracy as merit becomes more or less a proxy for wealth.<p>Breaking that trend would involve actions that go beyond meritocracy, and arguably are un-meritocratic: instead of just rewarding by merit, it’s about helping more people have that merit regardless of their or their parents’ wealth.')
