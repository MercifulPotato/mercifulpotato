If the election really was stolen (it wasn&#x27;t), then violence on a grand scale would be more than justified (it&#x27;s not), so pushing a false claim to that effect when you have as much power to make it stick is one of the most directly violent acts that can be committed.<p>&quot;This election was stolen&quot; is way more dangerous than &quot;Fire!&quot; in a crowded theater because if the bullshit sticks then you actually end up with war.')
