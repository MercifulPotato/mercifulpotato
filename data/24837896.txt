But more about how corporations can control the free flow of information.<p>But that&#x27;s really the same thing. If Google bans or interferes with Fediverse apps because they compete with YouTube, that&#x27;s anti-competitive behavior. If they don&#x27;t and those apps gain share with people whose content keeps getting censored on YouTube, they&#x27;re not very effectively controlling the free flow of information.<p>Censorship by an incumbent is a market opportunity for a competitor, so a corporation can only really sustain it through anti-competitive actions against the challenger(s).')
