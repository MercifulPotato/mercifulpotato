I understand if you&#x27;re used to the slack UI (as most users of Hackers News are), it seems like a step backwards, but that&#x27;s only because you&#x27;re looking for a 1:1 replacement for slack.<p>Having taking the route of going from Slack to Teams, where Teams is better at, IMHO, is the following:<p>- Within channels, all conversations are, by default, organized into threads. This gives you to the feeling that there are lots of chat boxes, but once we spend a few days with it, our team started noticing that our conversations have become more structured. However starting a new &quot;thread&quot; off the main channel discussion in slack takes significant conscious effort and its very easy for multiple conversations to get interleaved and become a mess.\n- Integrated video&#x2F;audio calls, along with call built-in note taking, makes for a very seamless jump from text to voice&#x2F;video. With Slack, we needed to maintain separate Zoom account, as it&#x27;s built-in voice&#x2F;video chat was pretty bad.\n- If your IT has already sold its soul to Microsoft Enterprise infra, Teams just fits in really really well, with its Active Directory&#x2F;Azure AD&#x2F;O365 integrations. It&#x27;s no wonder that Teams is doing well in the Enterprise space. We still use GSuite for our emails, but given how less our team emails these days, if I were given an option to start from scratch, I&#x27;d probably choose to host our email on O365 outlook (even though I feel Gmail&#x27;s UI is  superior).<p>Of course, nothing is without its problems - you&#x27;re dealing with Microsoft products, so except to hassle around a little bit with licensing, bad markdown abilities and a few other quirks. I&#x27;ve seen complaints of the client being really slow at times, but my team hasn&#x27;t seen this issue in the recent past, since we switched in, except once or twice, where a restart of the client solves it.<p>One part of our team (~12 people) used Hangouts Chat for a few months, which has been around for more than a few years, and every six months. It sucks. They just released a new update to how their buttons looked every 6 months. I don&#x27;t know why Google even bothers putting up this product.<p>The criticism for Teams is disproportionate in Hacker News, I don&#x27;t understand why. I encourage you to try it out for a few days with a select group of people and make up your own mind.')
