Easy for a desktop user to set up, absolutely trash for literally every best practice, but nobody&#x27;s made anything better [for free] yet.<p>If you are trying to deploy WordPress today with DevOps best practices (version control&#x2F;12 factor app&#x2F;etc): set it up with Bedrock (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;roots.io&#x2F;bedrock&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;roots.io&#x2F;bedrock&#x2F;</a>), manage dependencies with Composer, and use environment variables for the runtime configuration. Then use Phinx (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phinx.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phinx.org&#x2F;</a>) to do database migrations. A custom db migration script will be needed to change database settings based on the environment you&#x27;re deploying to.<p>Containerization is pretty annoying, because apparently <i>php-fpm</i> will not serve non-PHP content (without creating security concerns). So you need a web server to serve all the static content that comes with Wordpress&#x2F;Plugins&#x2F;etc, and <i>php-fpm</i> to serve the PHP. This means you have to either 1) duplicate the static content between two different containers, 2) duplicate the static content into some other storage medium (S3?) and serve it using some web server, or 3) create a frankenstein&#x27;s monster container of both <i>php-fpm</i> and a web server, and pick your poison on how to make that suck as little as possible.<p>I have opted for #3 as operationally it&#x27;s the simplest. You build one container with all the dependencies, static content, and sql migrations, and deployments therefore become just a single container with a single port (http&#x2F;https) and passing in the env vars. I&#x27;ll probably upload it somewhere if somebody wants it. It&#x27;s a docker-compose configuration, plus the Frankentainer, and some scripts, and it all fits into a Bedrock install. I haven&#x27;t hooked migrations up to it yet, but once that&#x27;s done, it will actually not suck very much to maintain a WordPress install.')
