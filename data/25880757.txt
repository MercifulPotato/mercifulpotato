Who is making remote HTTP calls for calculating e.g. math equations or unit conversions? A stateless REST API is completely useless; just do everything locally.<p>For everything else, there will be state to manage, and it&#x27;s not easy to shove a new version on top of an old version (hence why every API provider agrees to just offer two or more separate versions of the API server rather than having one unified API).')
