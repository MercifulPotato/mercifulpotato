You are not supposed to be attacked by the police during protests, government officials owe some basic comment to you etc. Basically rights that allow you to do journalist&#x27;s job legally and relatively safely. Foreign media probably don&#x27;t enjoy the same privileges.<p>Also, when your freedom is being taken from you, finding loopholes doesn&#x27;t really work in middle&#x2F;long term. The regime has all the possibilities to close them one by one.')
