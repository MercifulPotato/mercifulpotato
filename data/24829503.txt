Every CA can issue certificates for all domains, with some exceptions where the browser knows which CA should be issuing the certificate. Google chrome has a hardcoded list of high value targets, IIRC. All of that is ignored when you have a local CA trust root, though, like many enterprises do (for their  TLS intercepting proxies)<p>And for those CAs, even the safeguards as certificate transparency are moot. As a consultant, I never accept to install one of those CA certs in my trust store. Iâ€™d rather go and use a VM or a dedicated machine.')
