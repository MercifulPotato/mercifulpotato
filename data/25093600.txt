It basically says, &quot;Don&#x27;t use OAuth because if you&#x27;re locked out of your account on the OAuth provider, you won&#x27;t be able to sign in.&quot; I don&#x27;t disagree with that.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to expect every website I sign up for to be able to safely store passwords. OAuth is a convenient and much safer way to allow users to authenticate to your website or service. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to dismiss every service that doesn&#x27;t provide this option.')
