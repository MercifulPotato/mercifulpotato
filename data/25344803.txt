That doesn&#x27;t mean they will be successful. Most of the people with enough money to do this are alert for scams (though they might decide it is 80% chance of scam and decide to risk it anyway), so they will be looking to see if they will get the vaccine in the end, and if they don&#x27;t think you will deliver they won&#x27;t go. \nI would expect anyone who gets a &quot;black market&quot; vaccine gets one of the not approved (yet) vaccines. That supply is sitting around and probably not tracked as much.  Break into a warehouse (often with insider help, possibly at high levels such that most people in the company help you because your alibi checks out), get a supply, then send it to your black market buddies.\nPfizer has a legal market now and will do everything to ship to that market. Moderna is close enough that they won&#x27;t risk it. The Oxford vaccine has a lot of companies who can make it and an uncertain future (60% effective when there is a 95%?) so it is the most likely candidate, for this. Russia also is making a vaccine that they might be willing to sell like this. China might as well, but I find it unlikely as they have other markets. Of course this whole paragraph is pure speculation: anything is possible.')
