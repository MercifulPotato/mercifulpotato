I&#x27;m sure you wouldn&#x27;t mind having a gun shoved in your face because you had headphones on, or because you&#x27;re out getting groceries and you left your kid alone, right?<p>Fun fact, in many states pointing a gun at someone is considered lethal force, because it&#x27;s <i>very</i> easy to kill someone once you&#x27;ve done that. But apparently not answering your door makes it okay for cops to be a few pounds of trigger force from killing you, try not to sneeze!<p>And that&#x27;s before we begin going down the &quot;cops lie about the circumstances of arrests all of the damn time&quot; road.<p>&gt; I think it&#x27;s reasonable for LE to assume<p>No, it is not. They are serving a warrant for a non-violent crime to someone with no criminal past. It is not reasonable to assume that violence was a likely outcome. They&#x27;re also serving a warrant to someone who has politically inconvenienced the governor, the fact that she got a gun pointed at her should worry the hell out of you, not the fact that she didn&#x27;t open her door.<p>Furthermore, we&#x27;ve built up our police state one &quot;it&#x27;s reasonable to assume that&quot; at a time. In fact we should go the other way and demand that cops <i>show</i> that they needed to apply the force they did, not answering your door is not punishable by having a gun shoved in your face. Citizens have rights, you know.<p>&gt; a display of non-compliance like that.<p>&quot;Comply, citizen&quot; is something they say in dystopian fiction, it&#x27;s not something you&#x27;re supposed to actually express on your own.')
