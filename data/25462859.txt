Like, I can&#x27;t process sugars like most people do and I&#x27;m more prone to gaining weight.<p>That said, my view of food is 100% different now. I do feel enlightened. I don&#x27;t blame my parents. I think the state needs to get more involved with regulation. I have a ton of respect for Michelle Obama&#x27;s push to make school lunches healthy.')
