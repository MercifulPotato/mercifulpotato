Seeing the bouncing ball demo running was cool, but dragging the Workbench screen down to show the ability to multitask was awesome at that time. Using Deluxe Paint to render animations and record them on VHS using a cheap genlock was fun.<p>It&#x27;s that intersection of accessible magic that makes me nostalgic. My most recent experience of that feeling was playing Breath of the Wild on a Switch hooked up to a TV a couple years ago. The opening scenes where you look out over the Great Plateau for the first time really took me back to thinking anything is possible.')
