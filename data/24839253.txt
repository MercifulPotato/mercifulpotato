Gigabit only? You can get at least 60-100 Mbps in most towns, as long as you aren&#x27;t out of town. Probably gigabit if you&#x27;re willing to pay a lot. Spectrum is the main option in the big towns. Looks like you can get gigabit from them in the big towns for $110&#x2F;month for the first 12 months. Not sure what it would go to after that.<p>If you live out of town, or in a really small town, you&#x27;re gonna have tougher luck')
