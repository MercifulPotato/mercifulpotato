It&#x27;s been 7 years since he got the degree so a lot of doors have already closed for postdoc opportunities. Professors will find reasons to not hire him such as being out of the game for too long and thus he&#x27;s not caught up in the literature or whatever. He could try to go in as a data scientist. It is true though that usually that job goes to students because they&#x27;re cheap and capable, they just take longer. So yeah it&#x27;s kind of hard to compete against cheap, passionate labor that students provide.')
