You have to admit that the election was unlike any other on recent memory.\nThe losing side, given this unorthodox election, wanted some validation of results, as well as to legally challenge the way they were done (PA&#x27;s changes).\nThe response was one of derision and essentially shutting out the right from discourse. No effort was made a conciliation. This had the predictable effect of galvanizing people that there was indeed fraud.\nIf you think that these people had no reason to be angry, you aren&#x27;t paying attention. If you can understand the frustrations and lead up to the BLM movement, but don&#x27;t even want to pay lip service to this, you are either a horrible person or stupid. Take your pick: evil, ignorant, or both?')
