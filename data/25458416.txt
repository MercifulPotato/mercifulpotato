Item(by='greggyb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608228995, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25444017, text='&gt; rofi [2]: This is a dmenu replacement with a nicer interface that lets you combine lists of commands in a single search window. I have it configured so I can search through my open windows by title or run any program from the same interface.<p>Note, this is totally doable in dmenu. I have a script that combines output from wmctrl and dmenu_path. This is bound to M-space for me.<p>If you have a script or binary that outputs a list of newline-separated strings, you can easily combine these, and dmenu will happily return the selected thing.<p>Here&#x27;s what that looks like:<p><pre><code>    present-options () {\n        windows      # Function to list open windows\n        dmenu_path   # dmenu script listing binaries\n    }</code></pre>')
