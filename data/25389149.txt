ARM chips naturally do all of that too, with the memory model simply giving them way more freedom to reorder things.<p>One couldnâ€™t do X86 version of M1, mostly because there is no way of making an instruction decoder that wide for it.<p>And the performance penalty of M1 when working in TSO mode strongly implies that yes the weaker memory model indeed plays a major role. Not the biggest, but definitely not insignificant. Tens of percents here and tens of percents there combined become a ridiculous perf boost.')
