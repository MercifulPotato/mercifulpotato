They may do some cross camera calibration. So one camera is used to help the other camera. So if you replace the whole set and that data was stored on the flash storage, then it’s probably totally wrong now. 2 or 3 cameras have the wrong calibration.<p>If Apple does the service they probably have an operation to download the cal data and transfer it. Or for a new module they have cal data that they store into the phone. I totally agree with the right to repair but it’s possible in this case it’s a bit more complicated.<p>Another thing another commenter mentioned that if the images store some magic bits that water mark your image which could be matched to your phone that’d be super crappy and Apple should say that otherwise it would damage their image they are trying to push as caring about privacy..')
