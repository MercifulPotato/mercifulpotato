I don&#x27;t think the categories have to be discrete just to satisfy the functor laws; even ignoring that, what would the morphisms be in principle? I don&#x27;t think there is an obvious choice, at least.<p>I think in OCaml, &quot;functor&quot; basically just means &quot;like a function but for modules&quot;. They might technically be categorical functors, but it seems quite different to the meaning in Haskell where they are plainly categorical functors (modulo Hask technically not being a category).')
