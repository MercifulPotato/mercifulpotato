A SaaS product taking that long to get to $10K ARR is not exciting from an ambition perspective - maybe from a side-project POV, though, it would be.<p>While the traditional VC yardsticks* are both way too reductionist AND now well out-dated, they at least provide a rough sense of how good of an opportunity you have.<p>* I&#x27;ve heard these are the perquisites for VC SaaS funding rounds (note this is probably 5 years out of date, and they are likely much higher now): $10k MRR for Seed, $100k MRR for Series A, $500K - $1M MRR for Series B.<p>That all said, I like how Jason Lemkin talks about this. Basically, &quot;I don&#x27;t care how long it took you to get to $1M ARR - could be 10 years. But I need to see a clear path to getting to $100M ARR in 5 years from when you hit $1M&quot;.
