Well, the crashes are bad, but they surely will fix it. I don&#x27;t know what these people expected on 7 year old consoles. My previous PC is exactly 7 year old (it was beefy back in 2013) but I wasn&#x27;t even thinking to play the game on it. It is just barely meeting the minimum requirements.')
