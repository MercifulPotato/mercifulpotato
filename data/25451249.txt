I guess you could say it &quot;doesn&#x27;t have mouse support&quot; in that you don&#x27;t interact with the window manager itself using a mouse.  It certainly doesn&#x27;t get in the way of you using the mouse with hosted applications, though.<p>My favorite thing about it is the way it handles key bindings, where you populate any number of keymaps and one of the possible commands is `readkey`, which will read the next keypress and look it up in the specified keymap.  This makes it easy to build a tree of commands, grouped conceptually, without getting in the way.')
