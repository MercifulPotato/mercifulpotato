They take more time and lose packages more often.<p>DHL still has express shipping from China. I wonder if this is directly related to the shift in production. Everything comes from China&#x2F;Asia these days, there&#x27;s nothing I can&#x27;t get there, there&#x27;s no reason to buy from the US anymore.')
