There&#x27;s no technical reason it can&#x27;t be done much faster.  ATM transactions are atomic within 60 seconds.  Credit cards are faster than that writing to their ledgers.  And yes, while behind the scenes those transactions don&#x27;t settle until next day via bank or credit card processor, there&#x27;s no technical reason that they can&#x27;t be done in near real-time.<p>In the US the reason we still have T+2 is that it benefits the financial institutions to do so at the expense of the individual.  One of the many reasons I have zero empathy for the industry.')
