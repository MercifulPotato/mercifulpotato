I guess there are some synergies to having Teams and Word integrated, but they don&#x27;t seem very large. It seems if you want to do chat, you <i>must</i> also do all productivity software to compete, which is a real shame.<p>The ideal world (to me) is that Microsoft is forced to charge some price for Teams being turned on in a 365 subscription, which means that some companies can justify paying for 365 + Slack, not that Slack is acquired and bundled in with Quip. Honestly I think Salesforce will lose that battle; Microsoft&#x27;s Word&#x2F;Excel monopoly is unbreakable. I wish that didn&#x27;t mean that they could weaponize that into destroying Slack, instead of competing with them in a regular way.<p>That&#x27;s an idealist&#x27;s take, though, it seems impossible to write reasonable rules that produce that kind of outcome without harming innovation.')
