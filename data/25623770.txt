That is, you&#x27;re saying &quot;I need a place to put an arbitrary thing.&quot; But you don&#x27;t! A &amp;dyn T doesn&#x27;t own T, just like a &amp;T doesn&#x27;t own T. Trait objects are a (pointer to data, pointer to vtable), (may be in the reverse order we don&#x27;t guarantee layout) and so that pointer can point to anywhere, heap or stack.<p>Interestingly enough, this <i>was</i> special in Rust 1.0 to Rust 1.5. In 1.5, it finally became non-special. It&#x27;s interesting because I totally get what you&#x27;re saying, but at the same time, this is an example of Rust being orthogonal, not special cased.<p>(It is really hard to address the string thing without an example, to be honest.)')
