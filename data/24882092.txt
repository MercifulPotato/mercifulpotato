But it does mean something.<p>In the phrase, &quot;perception&quot; refers to superficial perceptions such as what a person looks like via their photo, and how they are imagined to be, the perceiver filling in a lot of gaps to fit their ideas; &quot;reality&quot; refers to perceptions from experiences with the person, such as you might get from actually hanging out together, talking, arguing, living together, getting to know each other.')
