Maybe it is because the local governors have a better idea of what are the real challenges of their regions than some bureaucrat sitting in Berlin?<p>- Bavaria takes too much money from the federal government: maybe that would be an argument to have less federal taxes and more to the state-level. <i>Remove</i> power from the central entity, and there will be less of an incentive&#x2F;risk of abuse?<p>- EU: you say <i>probably</i> to something that every Euro-skeptic has been saying for decades already. People outside of the Germany&#x2F;France&#x2F;Italy circle are getting more and more tired of losing autonomy over their lives, business and even who they get to have as neighbors to someone in Brussels, who has more to gain by listening to lobbyists than their voters.<p>&gt; there is at least the chance that the central governance actually represents all of the population.<p>No. Not at the scales that we talking about and not at this globalized world that we have. In today&#x27;s world, all that central governance does is foment polarization in order to run divide-and-conquer of the people. Maybe (if you are lucky) you get some alternance of power so that no single group gets to be in control and some equilibrium gets to be established.')
