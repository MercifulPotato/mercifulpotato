Keynes says deficit spending should occur when a bubble (business cycle) bursts, in order to force full employment when mass unemployment would happen.<p>But in the USA in the last 50 years, politicians deficit spend every year. They deficit spend in all stages of bubbles.  They deficit spend when there is already full employment. &quot;Politician macroeconomics&quot; is far more deficit spending than Keynes.<p>This includes Republicans. They just do it with tax cuts and increased defense spending to create deficit spending.')
