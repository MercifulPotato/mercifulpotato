This again is sort of serve mentality, where of course you want to get a bug fix in as quick as possible in case it is a security issue.  A desktop user, maybe you don&#x27;t.<p>&gt;After all, even nowadays application authors could provide static packages, but many don&#x27;t do it.<p>Right, and really what I would like is for application authors to just static link more, more often, on linux. Or at the least ship their programs with installers that apply the needed deps if they are not already there! That the OS itself is statically linked doesn&#x27;t really matter, but perhaps it would inspire an ecosystem that does this.<p>&gt; I like Arch Linux best at the moment<p>Probably suggest arch linux to someone complaining about having to track down dependencies does not make sense, since such a person is more interested in the OS <i>just working</i> rather than making the OS a bit of a hobby that that they want to customize.<p>Which, is why I mostly use windows.')
