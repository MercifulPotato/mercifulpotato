There&#x27;s nothing they offer that will keep you productively occupied for a hours-long charge cycle.<p>A 30-minute or hour charge cycle, in contrast, is long enough to perform errands-- I could see a large number of supermarkets, strip malls, big-box shops, and restaurants interested in offering 1-hour charging stations.  You can offer cross-promotions (spend $100 in store and your charge is free) and you have captive customers who are likely to wander the aisles a bit longer&#x2F;order an extra coffee or dessert if they know they need to wait another 10 minutes for their charge to complete.
