Like how Germany&#x27;s first immigrants after WW2 were low skilled Turkish workers and only recently Germany became more attractive for high-skilled immigrants because the US effectively shut down its visa program for the majority of people.<p>I&#x27;m not saying Germany is perfect but just whipping out some numbers without context doesn&#x27;t cut it.<p>Also, it&#x27;s pretty bold for Americans to lecture other countries on racism while their police is gunning down people simply for the color of their skin and is separating children of refugees from their parents to put them in cages. Meanwhile Germany is providing healthcare and shelter for all refugees but apparently doesn&#x27;t currently promote a few dozen high-skilled workers that very likely could&#x27;ve made it anywhere to be CEO.')
