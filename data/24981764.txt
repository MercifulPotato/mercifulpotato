There was a time when it was &quot;written in Go&quot; that was on the bingo card. I remember this being an original hype point for docker, for instance.<p>I do agree that I&#x27;d rather see the technology choice not highlighted so much, though. But it really is a proxy for some things that matter to me: if it is in Rust, I expect it to be a single binary I can easily install and which starts up quickly and performs well (as opposed to, say, javascript, python, ruby, or java programs), but is likely to suffer very few security problems (as opposed to, say, a C or C++ program), and has a decent shot at growing an active community, which I may be able to contribute to. A lot of these things apply to other technologies (like the aforementioned Go) as well, but it I do feel like I get some information by knowing the technology.<p>Maybe the better approach would be to enumerate benefits rather than saying what the technology is, even if the benefits flow from the technology choice.')
