My favourite &quot;feature&quot; of theirs is how when someone is presenting, it&#x27;s impossible to view the presentation as just another stream - no they have to make it dominate everything, meaning it&#x27;s so hard to see the other team members.<p>And it can be extremely hard to see who&#x27;s talking when viewing a lot of cameras at the same time.
