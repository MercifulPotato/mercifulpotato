Usually it&#x27;s because a feature can have much more value at a very specific date.<p>The first one was a feature for one of the minor verticals of the company product. Basically, something that would be nice to have and would be done eventually, but not a priority. However, the big annual trade show for that vertical was coming up, and the company could have a slot for a conference&#x2F;demonstrate a feature. Marketing&#x2F;sales were pretty convinced the aforementioned feature could be a big hit at the show, and provide lots of exposure. So we were asked whether it was possible to have it ready by then. If we could, then it would have a lot of value and would be priority 1, otherwise back to the backlog because it would be much harder to advertise it outside of the show.<p>Second example was caused by the reduction in VAT in Germany last year. Having internationalisation&#x2F;German translation all of the sudden became pretty valuable because that would help push even more products in Germany.')
