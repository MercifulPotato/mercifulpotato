Build a tonne of hype around something, get a vast number of people who don&#x27;t really know what they&#x27;re doing to put in their money, and then the big investors get out, tanking the price for everyone else.<p>In all the talk of conspiracy around this I&#x27;m surprised nobody is discussing the possibility that larger investors are likely manipulating&#x2F;hyping the WSB community. The WSB community is acting untouchable but I get the feeling in the end they&#x27;ll be the ones losing their money.')
