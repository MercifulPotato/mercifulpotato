No. Why not? Obviously that&#x27;s discriminatory right? Of course not.<p>At least in San Francisco there <i>is</i> a movement to remove options like honors classes, and it stems from the same basic, ill-conceived premises.<p>And regarding your list of reasons for poor performance, at least in San Francisco none of them really apply. They don&#x27;t apply because they&#x27;ve each been systematically addressed, and addressed quite well, yet the huge performance gap remains. At the end of the day, the most significant factors by a huge margin involve home environment, particularly parental involvement and expectations, and you can&#x27;t address those very well with school policies. And while clearly a major issue there is economic, it&#x27;s not just economics. I remember visiting Singapore and seeing young, elementary school-age children from families in public housing hanging out in groups at McDonald&#x27;s doing homework at 8PM. No parental supervision at all, and doubtless some of their parents--both of them--were working 12+ hour days, anyhow.<p>American kids of any ethnicity, rich or poor, aren&#x27;t going to do that, but it goes to show that there&#x27;s also a significant cultural component as well. And simply mixing socioeconomic classes in school won&#x27;t fix that because in American culture the middle- and upper-classes <i>hide</i> their educational norms. They hide them because studying isn&#x27;t cool. So all poor kids see are the results, not the process. As someone who grew up without those norms it was very confusing to me. I never understood why kids who never seemed to study got such great grades, but as an adult I know why--it&#x27;s because they were more-or-less studying secretly. (Some of them were trading notes secretly, and even cheating secretly, but it&#x27;s the same basic point--it&#x27;s an invisible system that poor kids can&#x27;t adopt by osmosis and modeling, which is the basic premise behind these movements.)')
