So a somewhat rough analysis would be: sample a range of &quot;average&quot; tweets on both platform and somehow aggregate an average &quot;hate&quot; value.<p>What I&#x27;m getting at is, I understand Parler is generally a right-leaning platform, and therefore the types of &quot;hate&quot; will be right-leaning. Twitter is a generally left-leaning platform, so I would expect their type of hate to be generally left-leaning. So I think a tweet about storming the capitol isn&#x27;t good evidence that Twitter is better. Because, for exmaple, perhaps a violent Antifa tweet would be left alone on Twitter but moderated in Parler. Perhaps some ML bot can quantity sentiment of tweets.')
