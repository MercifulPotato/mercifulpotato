That &#x27;s&#x27; separates worlds.<p>As a young lad (on a tight budget) I stayed in youth hostels in Europe and USA as well.  Those (at that time) not only were equipped with shared bathrooms, but also commonly with bunk beds in dormitories (separated by gender -- yeah, such were the times) and usually expected you to take on chores.  I enjoyed my stay as it allowed me to go to places I couldn&#x27;t otherwise afford and meet like-minded young travelers, but it would be impossible to mistake those places for hotels.')
