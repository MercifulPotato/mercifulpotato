When you learn a real skill, like really learn it from a master, part of what you are doing is learning to trust an authority outside of yourself. Good technique in so many disciplines feels weird, awkward, wrong, and un-fun when you first try it. But the discipline decides on right, not us. The instrument, or the golf ball, or whatever <i>real physical thing</i> that you have to work with determines correct technique, and we have to learn how to make that feel natural through years of effort. I believe this is a huge part of the benefit of deliberate practise: you learn that &quot;oh this feels good&quot; or &quot;this seems to work for me, and what I think matters most&quot; is not good enough. And in this day and age of so much &quot;me me how I feel me&quot; and instant gratification, learning that humility is a really valuable skill. Music will teach you that the path to effortless mastery is full of twists and turns, and is often uncomfortable. We only get there when we decide it&#x27;s ok to be uncomfortable.')
