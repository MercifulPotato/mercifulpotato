Because I couldn&#x27;t in several minutes of googling.<p>&gt; Presumably the world can much more quickly (due to vegetation) remove CO2 compared to those other chemicals<p>If that were true, climatologists wouldn&#x27;t be so concerned about the problem, they&#x27;d just be telling us to plant some more trees.')
