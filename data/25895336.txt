It&#x27;s not.  That&#x27;s not directly measurable, certainly not across generations.  It&#x27;s only barely become measurable in the past five or six years.<p>How would you go about getting this information in the 1970&#x27;s?  Self-reported data would be the best you can do.  Getting actual measurements of that information is something which (I suspect) is not available at a large scale beyond a few years of data.  Whether it is (even now) linked to measurements of testosterone at a large scale is doubtful.<p>I doubt that there is high-quality data on actual physical activity at a large scale at all, let alone linked to measurements of hormone levels from any of the 1990&#x27;s, 1980&#x27;s, 1970&#x27;s, ... etc.  It will only get much much harder going back.<p>So &quot;controlling for&quot; physical activity is a non-trivial task in the very best case.')
