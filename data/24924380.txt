But Wayland could have never been a direct replacement for X. The problem with X is not that it&#x27;s old or poor quality. Even if that were so, that is fixable. The problem with X is that its fundamental design principles are not suited to a desktop made after the early 1990s.<p>The reason X is much more entrenched than being a display protocol very much has to do with every X running system having a standardized X server any system process can talk to. That client server principle was fundamentally flawed and Wayland fixes that,\nbut that <i>very same</i> client server principle allowed this X ecosystem to thrive. Any &quot;X replacement&quot; that did away with X11&#x27;s core design problems would therefore run into not being able to replace the ecosystem in the same way.<p>If there would have been a coordinated effort to replace X, we would have needed a much broader initiative pop in 2010. An initiative where Wayland is one component, something like PipeWire another, and some Freedesktop IPC standards for e.g. accessing the clipboard and other features provided out of the box by X11, and reference utilities implementing those standards.<p>But coordinated efforts like that are not really how the free software community works! So Wayland just evolved out on its own. It started as a small effort by developers frustrated with X11 the display server protocol. The community then proceeded to take the line &quot;Wayland is a replacement for X.org&quot; and then ran with it, creating confusion everywhere, and stifling progress to replace X11 in the process.<p>Systemd is quite unique in the free software world because it&#x27;s a tremendously coordinated effort and has taken on a broad scope. And just look at the sheer amount of vitriol that ended up getting just for those aspects of the project. It&#x27;s just not how the community likes to operate, or at least a vocal minority does not like this.')
