Whatever was going on clearly left a scar.<p>I will say there&#x27;s no such thing as a programmer who can&#x27;t learn Haskell and be productive in it. It&#x27;s not fundamentally more difficult than any other language. It&#x27;s just that you have to learn to program more or less from scratch again.
