The answer is a lot, because every web page  you visit can install one without your permission. They seem like small javascript applets, and I&#x27;m not sure under what conditions they are allowed to run. I am afraid they could be allowed to run even when you are not visiting the page, and since I have no interest in PWAs or notifications I just disabled service workers entirely. You can do that in about:config.')
