If I&#x27;m a car wash and I buy another car wash across the street, arguably our services overlap 100%.  But maybe the acquired carwash was $4 more expensive and served a more luxury clientele.  Is that a competitor or not a competitor or both?<p>How can you also ever prove that a company being acquired was truly a competitor?  What percentage overlap on products and services would be necessary to deem that company a competitor?<p>My bet is that there is a lack of science here and surplus of qualitative judgment.  Educate me please... :)')
