Item(by='bnralt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605295126, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25085443, text='&gt; There are significant military applications to our space program.<p>It&#x27;s interesting looking at the military and space, since the military seems to be more objective focused than NASA. Early on (1960&#x27;s), the military was planning on a manned station (MOL), but ended up going with automated satellites in the end because they made more sense. Likewise the Space Force believes it might eventually send up astronauts, but doesn&#x27;t think that will happen for decades. They&#x27;re interested in sending people up when it&#x27;s useful to do so, not just sending them up for the sake of sending them up.')
