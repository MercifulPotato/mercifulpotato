If you replace every part of a bike, even one at a time over years, it is no longer the same bike.  So it all depends on what GP means by &quot;replacing some parts&quot;.  Is it entirely new computer in a 20 year old case?  Or is it a 20 year old computer with a couple sticks of RAM thrown in?<p>Regardless, I have a hard time believing a 20 year old computer is &quot;working like a champ&quot;.  I&#x27;ve found the most people who say their &lt;insert really old phone or computer&gt; works perfectly have just gotten used to the slowness.  Once they upgrade and try to go back for a day, they realize how wrong they were.  Like how a 4k monitor looks &quot;pretty good&quot; to someone that uses a 1080p monitor everyday, but a 1080p monitor looks like &quot;absolute unusable garbage&quot; to someone who uses a 4k monitor everyday.')
