They might be used by some implementations under some flows, but they&#x27;re not core to the spec.<p>Typically the user agent will redirect to a Google&#x2F;etc login page where it&#x27;ll have access to first-party cookies.  Then will redirect back to the site which requested authentication, passing state in the query params.  It&#x27;s only when you get into using stuff like Okta as a delegated authentication service do you run into trouble with 3rd party cookies.<p>Edit: As an example, I just logged into Stackoverflow using Google as the authenticator, with umatrix blocking 3rd-party cookies.  Worked without a hitch.')
