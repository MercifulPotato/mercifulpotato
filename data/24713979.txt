I&#x27;m not sure. If you don&#x27;t care about that, go for the $20 lodge cast iron pan, which will also last a lifetime.<p>But I agree with sibling comments, you don&#x27;t need to buy quality for the stuff you rarely use. And&#x2F;or, you may be able to not buy it at all. A high quality set of basic knives (chef+paring+serrated) and the acquired skill to use them can replace many kitchen gizmos.')
