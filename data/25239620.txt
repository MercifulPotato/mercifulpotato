It would actually be a short computer program that calculates pi, and instead of the first 40 digits you could ask for, say, a megabyte of data, or take the limit as the amount of data grows.<p>Transmitting a program to compute pi would be shorter than the data needed by any compression algorithm that isn&#x27;t somehow based on knowing the trick.<p>The same trick could be used for any mathematically interesting number. The point is that incompressible random sequences exist that are not like that. You can&#x27;t do better than transmitting the sequence itself.')
