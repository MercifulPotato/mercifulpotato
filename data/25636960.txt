That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m objecting to. Yes - you can make a transfer of bitcoin&#x2F; it&#x27;s very hard for the state to stop or reverse that transfer. But is that what we mean when we say &quot;without censorship&quot;, really? We&#x27;re getting into the joke territory here, this sounds very much like &quot;USSR had freedom of speech, what it didn&#x27;t have was freedom after speech&quot;.<p>[+] BTC is not money, but I&#x27;m going to let that slide for this part of the argument.')
