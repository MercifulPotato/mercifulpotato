You repeat the title, saying google banned a third party app for bitchute, but adding words with a negative connotation. (while openly advocating for censorship and jailing people you disagree with)<p>2. I note that this is hypocritical and heavy handed of google (they used to host the same videos), as well as a rapid shift in the zeitgeist.<p>3. You start talking about whether bitchute can profit, which seems completely irrelevant (the OP is about a third party app).<p>Seems pretty clear-cut to me. Oh, and I don&#x27;t make videos, let alone &quot;hate-speech&quot; videos. I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t slander me, but you&#x27;re doing a great job showing that the ones advocating for such censorship in the modern US are the villains.')
