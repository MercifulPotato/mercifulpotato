The president&#x27;s own party is unwilling to take action against him, and the opposition party is not yet empowered to do so.<p>You may also have noticed that the social media companies had previously taken little or no action against the president until this happened.<p>You may, not unreasonably, assume that the two events are connected.<p>This isn&#x27;t censorship of unpopular views, it&#x27;s an immune response against malicious lies.')
