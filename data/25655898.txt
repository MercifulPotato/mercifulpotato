Item(by='himinlomax', descendants=None, kids=[25656410], score=None, time=1609923517, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25655340, text='&gt; Star Citizen&#x27;s kickstarter originally promised to release in 2014&#x2F;15<p>It&#x27;s playable right now, has been for a long time. The fact that it&#x27;s not been deemed &quot;finished&quot; is rather irrelevant. You can compare it to a similarly-themed game such as Elite: Dangerous, which has been released and updated through paid extensions. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be that much more to do in that game, from what I can gather. (I bought it, but haven&#x27;t gotten around to playing it much yet.)<p>Or put another way, with a typical funding method SC could have released their game a few years back as it was as &quot;gold&quot;, and it would have been a decent game -- certainly no worse than No Man&#x27;s Sky at launch.<p>Comparing SC to the average scam Kickstarter that doesn&#x27;t deliver anything and lies to the backers is simply wrong. It&#x27;s an ambitious project and their release date goals were way too optimistic -- but it&#x27;s hard to get mad at them for that when you have any experience with software development.')
