He makes the offhand comment that they should be condemned, but doesn&#x27;t shut them down when he knows he has their ear.<p>It&#x27;s the same with the Proud Boys comment at the debate. He tells them to stand by and stand down, then the next day says he doesn&#x27;t know who they are. We all know he&#x27;s lying - and most of all the Proud Boys, who see the wink and the nod behind the denial, which is just to get the lugenpresse off his back.')
