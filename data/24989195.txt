It assumes wind locations are fairly randomized and I don&#x27;t think that is entirely true. Meaning you can build more in area &quot;x&quot;, but if it isn&#x27;t blowing a quarter mile away, it probably isn&#x27;t blowing near you either. Think of this more as a conceptual argument. Now oversupply would help if it&#x27;s just blowing a little bit I suppose.')
