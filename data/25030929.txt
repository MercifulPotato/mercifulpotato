Is corruption of thousands of precincts even needed in a tight race?<p>&gt; It would be impossible for fraud to happen on any regular basis and not coming to light.<p>How would one know such a thing?<p>Is it possible on an irregular basis?<p>Is it impossible that it does get noticed, but no serious followup?<p>Have there been no examples of whistleblowers who were not listened to in the history of the USA, election related or not?<p>&gt; So the incidence of 0.00002% (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;policy-and-politics&#x2F;2017&#x2F;4&#x2F;26&#x2F;15424270&#x2F;v" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;policy-and-politics&#x2F;2017&#x2F;4&#x2F;26&#x2F;15424270&#x2F;v</a>...) is somewhat informative.<p>How might we know that that impressive looking number is accurate?  Does vox have an omniscient on staff?<p>I wonder if when the discussion is about a <i>non-politicized topic</i> (like standard, run of the mill security), might there be a difference in mindset when people are formulating their opinions.  If the system in question was for anything other than voting, I suspect IT folks would be a little less accepting of evidence-lite assurances that a distributed, largely manually implemented (by non-experts) system of this scale and frequency of usage is 100% up to snuff.  It seems <i>rather unlikely</i> that an inconsistent, somewhat cobbled together and non-expertly manned system of this scope is <i>absolutely perfect</i>.  And yet, this seems to be not only the overwhelming narrative, but the fact passed down from the media - the same one that spent the last 4 years assuring us that Russia had hacked the prior election.')
