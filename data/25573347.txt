I try hard to vote according to the hn guidelines e.g. “Be kind. Don&#x27;t be snarky. Have curious conversation; don&#x27;t cross-examine. Please don&#x27;t fulminate. Please don&#x27;t sneer, including at the rest of the community. Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive.”. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a><p>Personally, I silently downvote because good community members will self-reflect upon their comment (for even a single downvote), and I believe the process of questioning one’s writing is good; while bad community members are often not worth responding to (edit: I sometimes engage as i am an idealist and I think someone can be influenced for the better, however I really don’t feel I have much luck against the tide!)<p>I don’t think I am infallible, and usually others will upvote if a mistake is made. That said, I am usually careful to only downvote for what I think are very good reasons. I sometimes upvote something downvoted incorrectly IMHO. I have showdead switched on, but I can’t say I have felt the urgent need to vouch for anything yet.<p>IMHO this thread contains a lot of noise and thoughtless blather, which is a shame, because the topic is really important.<p>Edit: the hn guidelines say “Please don&#x27;t comment about the voting on comments. It never does any good, and it makes boring reading.” True. But sometimes I think it is worthwhile, and it is obviously polite to answer an honest question like yours which is so far down-thread in a low signal environment that I think that my transgression is otherwise harmless.')
