I never wrote that phrase you quoted in your comment. Are you trying to lie? :)<p>Better read my words one more time:<p>“People see dreams not every time they sleep, not every night, sometimes we can have multiple nights without dreams. By this moronic theory our “visual cortex” should be modified to “blind mode” just in the first night of sleep without dreams.”<p>Clearly “your reading comprehension wasn&#x27;t up to par to tackle it in one pass” ;)')
