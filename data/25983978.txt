Absent that knowledge, they would have built “scalable” systems that still had bottlenecks they could not yet see and also would have adopted extraneous technology that ultimately would be thrown out as the product discarded the parts that ended up not being critical to the value proposition uncovered. And of course, this whole process would have burned time, energy, and cash, not to mention shifted the nature of hires and the composition of the team itself, such that in sum it may have been a sufficient opportunity cost to jeopardize the whole business.')
