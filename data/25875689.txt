The range for CRP, for instance, is relatively broad. What’s serious is when you’re exceeding the reference high.<p>In these cases (like maxed out SED rate) chronic inflammation is a thing and more than “feeling bad”. It does lasting damage so the quicker you can respond to it the better, and IME that kind of inflammation sneaks up on a person and often goes undiagnosed until other downstream problems start to present themselves.<p>There’s a bit of fashion to talking about “cytokine storms” and inflammation that is partly healthy to be aware of (and interesting to the seriously curious) but also a lot of faddish health nuttery lately. Be careful of the snake oil salesmen out there, folks.<p>Diets, supplements, exercise equipment, OTC meds, are as often nets to harvest disposable income more than they are serious approaches to managing disease.<p>For people suffering autoimmune disorders, much can be done with simple balanced diets and regular low stress body weight exercising. The key is avoiding things like excessive drinking, high mental stress levels, sleep dep. All the good advice for Puritan living that really applies to all of us, just that they have far, far lower tolerances for deviation. Response to NSAIDs may indicate what you’re fighting but if you’re there you’ve already failed upstream from where you are now. Chronic NSAID use isn’t all that great either but is often an unavoidable supplement for those trying to hold a normal career these days. This kind of internal feedback loop is more cost effective and probably more accurate for behavior correction than looking at daily blood work.')
