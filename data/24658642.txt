We could model cells, up to the memristive portion, entirely with basic circuit components (albeit in very complicated arrangements). We were missing that part of our bits boxes. Now we aren&#x27;t, well, sorta. It&#x27;ll be a while before we get these in our hands.<p>Also, these things are a bit bigger than just modern hardware. It&#x27;s as if you just added a new primary color to Bob Ross; everything changes. We&#x27;re going to need to redesign computers from the electrical-engineering-ground up.<p>Well maybe, it&#x27;ll be a few years (hopefully not decades)')
