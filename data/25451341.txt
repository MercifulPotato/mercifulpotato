One can send people to jail for financial crimes, like monopolies, and still have capitalism.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s the people who were supposed to regulate these companies to stop them from getting to this point<p>Well that would be the politicians (and their weakening of regulation). Which is kind of out of the scope of &quot;ideally X&quot;, because any such change would by necessity require changing politicians.<p>Also they <i>are</i>, in a (poor) way, being regulated by this suit. Being caught for a crime and regulation are sorta two different things though. Sort of like health care, regulation is preventative, often healthier and cheaper in the long run. Prosecution is emergency care, an expensive last resort.<p>&gt; The world has missed out on 10 years of potential competition and innovation because of that.<p>Or, you know, the actions google took to exploit the capitalist system. If anything this is just a demonstration of the need for more socialist economic solutions.')
