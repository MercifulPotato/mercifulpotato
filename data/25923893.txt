Safe to say that the increased draw on the included battery and higher memory usage weren&#x27;t a concern here, but they are both significant.  Developer productivity is through the roof though.<p>I&#x27;d say the biggest pain points for me (unless I&#x27;m missing something&#x2F;they&#x27;ve added more stuff recently) were created by the lack of support for what feel like production standards in software development.  For example, the logging library is a toy, and unit testing is non-existent unless you isolate all your CircuitPython-specific code and run tests on your dev machine using CPython.')
