Item(by='danShumway', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609411535, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25591418, text=':) If you want to complain to Apple that they need to step up their game and actually support modern web APIs on Safari, I&#x27;m all for that, I&#x27;ll be complaining right alongside you. I can even throw other APIs onto the pile, Safari is the only modern browser that doesn&#x27;t support device vibration.<p>To be fair to the original thread, Apple has always tried to protray that it&#x27;s doing something brave or prescient by dropping technologies or introducing proprietary standards, and it&#x27;s pretty clear that they were not actually interested in the Open web when they dropped Flash. I do think Flash was dropped in a clumsy way, and I would try to separate Apple&#x27;s clear push to try and monopolize the mobile games market and kill web games from the actual push for the Open web as an application platform.<p>I think Apple has made it pretty clear on iOS that they don&#x27;t care about the web as an application platform.<p>----<p>&gt; In the broader scheme of things I think the next couple of years are going to be really interesting for web games in general.<p>I... hope so. What bothers me about the long-term future is that I&#x27;m now seeing less investment on the web side of things on APIs that I think are going to be essential to pushing web games forward in new ways. Even simple stuff like web audio, good controller layout support (also, controller rumble support please), better timing for fixed game intervals. I think the web could easily replace <i>Flash</i>, but there are definitely more APIs I want in general for games.<p>My worry is that it takes so long for the tooling in those areas to catch up that the actual APIs start to lag behind because there&#x27;s not enough pressure on browser manufacturers to care about them. We already kind of saw this with Chrome breaking audio on tons of web games because they just didn&#x27;t think to test them.<p>Best of luck to anything you&#x27;re working on, I&#x27;m rooting for you.')
