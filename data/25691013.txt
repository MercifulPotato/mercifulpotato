Or that you can see the revision history of a paper? Because both of those are supported by e.g. arXiv and not by Sci-Hub.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I appreciate Sci-Hub. But if it was legal to operate, do you think it would be exactly the same as it is now, and that it would have no popular competitors&#x2F;alternatives?')
