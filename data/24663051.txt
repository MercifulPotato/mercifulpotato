I think it is something like 50%+ of web traffic in the U.S. is bot traffic), they are suggesting that scraping through a logged-in account is somehow different.<p>If the user of the account consents to have the plugin installed on their computer and is made aware that the plugin will scrap this data, you could argue that there is nothing wrong here.<p>However, people post on Facebook under the idea that the information they share will only be viewable by their friend group (or as dictated by their privacy settings).<p>That&#x27;s where this gets interesting... does the friend group of the person with the plugin have any rights to privacy that dictate what the person with the plugin can do with their data?<p>If I take a picture of a newsfeed, for example, that has information my friends have posted, and share that somehow - am I violating their privacy <i>legally</i>?<p>If not, how is this different?<p>Will be interesting to follow this one.')
