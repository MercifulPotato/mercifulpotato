We are new so lots of room for us to improve our messaging and positioning.<p>Since you asked about particular use cases:\nUse Case 1: You just did a presentation about the benefit of Google Cloud run to the server chapter. You heard some praise after the call but you want to request feedback.<p>You use inkrement to &#x2F;request feedback from server chapter slack channel about the presentation, what did you do well, what were some areas you could have done better.<p>You instantly get feedback from colleagues that will help you in your next presentation<p>Use case 2: You have an intern. He has been working with a bunch of teams. Since he is not Ft, he doesn&#x27;t get an official review, so you use inkrement &#x2F;request-feedback to ask feedback on his behalf from people he has worked with to understand his strengths and areas of growth. Before finishing his internship term, you share the feedback so that he can grow.<p>You are right, feedback is much more effective when its requested, and we hope that people on slack will have an easier time asking for feedback on their work so they can continuously improve.')
