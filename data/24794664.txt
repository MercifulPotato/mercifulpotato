I have a small business that spends 2k&#x2F;y on Adwords, and support is an absolute joke. I have a significant stake in another that spends 50k&#x2F;y, and support is the same - terrible. And it&#x27;s even a challenge to get the bad support - you&#x27;ve got to hunt and jump through hoops to get to communicate with an actual human.<p>I&#x27;ve heard support is much better for GCP - but for me, the whole Google <i>brand</i> is tarnished, and because of my experiences with Adwords, I always choose Azure and&#x2F;or AWS over GCP.')
