Historically inner city ethnic neighborhoods were where immigrants first landed, but now they move straight to the suburbs. And they do so for the same reason white people in the 60s and 70s did so: immigrants have larger families and want space and good schools at a good price. The narrative that suburbs are obsolete because (mostly white) baby boomers and their children have less of a need for them overlooks the suburbs&#x27; desirability to non-whites and immigrants climbing the ladder.')
