You could absolutely pop in to visit me.<p>But you could also grab enough of your friends to obtain a decisive numerical advantage – let&#x27;s say, you and twenty of your closest friends, that probably gets close to what we saw yesterday. Be sure one or two of them are visibly armed.<p>Once you have your buddies, you can go break through the glass door leading to the receptionist&#x27;s desk.
