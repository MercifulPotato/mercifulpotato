There should be a club for those who play by the rules - and those who don&#x27;t shouldn&#x27;t get invited. Practically speaking, currently the rest of the world is too dependent on the US and China to be able to effectively sanction them, and I also hope this will change in the future, because sanctions sure are justified. I wish no suffering upon the Russian people, but they are the only ones that can legitimately (i.e. without invasions) replace their government with one that will play by the rules of international law. The rest of the world has no right to change their government, but we do have a choice of whether we will trade with them or not. So yes, basically any government that acts like a terrorist organization should have the same sanctions heaped on them. And finally, the Magnitsky Act shows that we can actually effectively target those in power in Russia without unduly targeting the economy of the Russian people - so I concede that pursuing that line first would be in order for humanitarian reasons.<p>We&#x27;re already doing these things with North Korea and Iran. I don&#x27;t see any compelling argument why the actions of the Russian government shouldn&#x27;t land them in the same boat.')
