They&#x27;re not too well developed here to be honest.  I&#x27;m probably wrong about some of this and need to research more.<p>The &quot;new thing after Unix&quot; is already here and has been here for some time.  It&#x27;s called Hurd.  It depends on a microkernel who&#x27;s only job is to pass messages from different components, but microkernels don&#x27;t work well (at least not better than monolithic kernels) on x86 due to context switching overhead.<p>x86&#x27;s maintain their architecture due to software compatibility.  That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re really stuck on.  A lot of improvements have been bolted on to x86, like cache, all the instruction stream acrobatics, SIMD, VMs, long mode, etc. but it&#x27;s still &quot;heavy&quot; ; things are done to make it look fundamentally the same to existing programs.<p>When CPUs start becoming cheap little tiny things set in a superfast fabric to talk and cooperate with potentially thousands of other cores (like GPUs) as fast as they can chew local instructions, and all the stuff with I&#x2F;O is worked out, we&#x27;re ready to take the next step.  You can see a little bit of the future with things like the Cell BE, but it needs to be much higher scale to change what OS is dominant.')
