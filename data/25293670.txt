They made something akin to Rosetta 2 (x86 to arm translation) but only supported x86, not amd64.  Apparently they are working on 64bit support, but releasing something half done doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence.  Even the 32bit support was reportedly not very good&#x2F;fast, compared to Rosetta 2, anyways.  If Microsoft steps up their game then I can see Windows on arm starting to take off, even if Qualcomms chips trail Apple&#x27;s M1 in performance.')
