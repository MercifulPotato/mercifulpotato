No, you can not have more than four hex digits in a single quad; 00000001:2::3 is a syntax error.  It supports “normal” stuff like ::, ::1, 2001:db8::1, and even non-normal stuff like “2001-0db8-1234-5678 0000-0000-0000-0005” (to be compatible with the really basic IPv6 parser I put in MaraDNS’s recursive resolver nearly two years ago), but does not support any of the IPv6 corner cases in the linked article.<p>The IPv6 test cases in the automated test for the parser are at: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;samboy&#x2F;MaraDNS&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;deadwood-github&#x2F;tools&#x2F;coLunacyDNS&#x2F;sqa&#x2F;sqa_ip6Parse&#x2F;Input" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;samboy&#x2F;MaraDNS&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;deadwood-githu...</a> (The final three lines are supposed to return errors)')
