See the chart on that page, it has been as high as 8 years in the past.<p>Because of day traders and HFT, it&#x27;s hard to say how long your average investor holds a stock, but it&#x27;s fair to say that some hold it for a long time and others &quot;speculate&quot; most of the time. The speculators probably have a greater impact on the movement of a stock, but over time it must move in line with the performance of the company.<p>The price of a stock is thought to be a &quot;risk adjusted present value&quot; of the underlying company. Even if you could be 100% sure a company would make X dollars per year in perpetuity, the price would not be infinite. Instead each year of earnings is &quot;discounted&quot; by risk, inflation rate, the cost of borrowing money, the value of competing investments, and other factors.<p>If it was assumed by investors that Zoom would make lots of money for the next 5 years, and then make very little money, and this news meant they would only make lots of money for the next 3 years, then that will have an impact of 2 years worth of discounted earnings immediately.<p>(of course it&#x27;s not like Zoom pays or is planning to pay a dividends but there&#x27;s still an underlying value, for instance they could be purchased by a larger company that does pay dividends.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-health-coronavirus-short-termism-anal&#x2F;buy-sell-repeat-no-room-for-hold-in-whipsawing-markets-idUSKBN24Z0XZ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-health-coronavirus-short-...</a>')
