They have really good documentation, which makes it a lot more concrete. I didn&#x27;t get zksnarks at all but that cleared it up for me.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zokrates.github.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zokrates.github.io&#x2F;</a><p>The basic idea is that you have functions with both public and private parameters. You can do two things:<p>1) Pass in all parameters, get back the output and a proof that the output is correct.<p>2) Pass in just the proof, the output, and the public parameters, and get verification that the function ran correctly; i.e. that the public parameters and some private parameters you don&#x27;t know generated that output.<p>So on chain, you can skip storing all the private parameters, as long as you store the proof, and have a contract verify the proof before storing the public data.')
