I think I know how it happened, since it happens to me all the time: The brain does a lot of its work in parallel, and in mine, at least, there seems to be a separate part of the brain responsible for doubling letters as I type. And this being somewhat asynchronous, it occasionally doubles the wrong letter. (I don&#x27;t know if the analysis is accurate, but the phenomenon is quite real.)')
