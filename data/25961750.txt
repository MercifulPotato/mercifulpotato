How does the EU expect to use UK production to shore up a shortfall of 49 million doses that they require in February&#x2F;March?<p>The doses that exist in the UK only exist because of a manufacturing ramp up done under their own contract during the period of time that the EU was still negotiating a lower price. How does it make sense that a separate contract with AstraZeneca allows them to then get the doses produced for the UK re-allocated to another contract?<p>The Commission is only entitled to those doses that AZ have, after best reasonable efforts, produced for them under their contract. This attempt to grab doses only in existence because of another prior contract is a disgrace.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;committees.parliament.uk&#x2F;oralevidence&#x2F;1505&#x2F;html&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;committees.parliament.uk&#x2F;oralevidence&#x2F;1505&#x2F;html&#x2F;</a>')
