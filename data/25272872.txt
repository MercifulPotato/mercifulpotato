What one you generally prefer for quick and dirty hacks? Which one do you prefer for writing applications that will be used and maintained over a long period of time?<p>I know both Python, Common Lisp and Scheme but I find myself reaching out for Python every time I have to write a quick and dirty hack. I believe this is due to more familiarity with Python which makes me more comfortable with Python. I am eager to know what others&#x27; experiences are. Maybe it will convince me to go all in and use Lisp all the time. :-)')
