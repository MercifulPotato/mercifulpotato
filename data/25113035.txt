But I don&#x27;t like his tone.<p>The whole writeup is a tantrum on why you should stick to &quot;well known&quot; facts. Which sounds to me too much like asserting the truth of things without questioning them. Yes, there are a lot of fools out there whith a spookrijder complex that are a detriment to science. And I would assume a well-known professor would rightly get tired of their emails.<p>He only shortly adresses at the end that radical ideas are precisely what is needed for progress in science.<p>I do not think this dismissive mentality does the situation any good. If someone comes with a radical but stupid idea, you need to first recognize the merit in the idea, and then show why it is wrong. Bashing someone with &quot;you cannot create free energy&quot; will only encourage him to waste his time trying to prove you wrong.<p>I suspect a lot of these spookrijders are curious and fairly smart people, but who&#x27;s ideas where offhandedly dismissed by a teacher one too many times.')
