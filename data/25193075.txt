Normally, when you upgrade a shared library, all consumers of it get fixed for free.<p>With nix every package is siloed into its own separate dependency graph and so you can have many versions of a shared library coexisting on the system but each version may be used only by one consumer. That means upgrading one will not affect all the others.<p>So then the only way to get consumers of a shared library to upgrade is to upgrade the consumers as well. Well then why not switch to static linking and be done with it? It would be much simpler that way.')
