It&#x27;s an inherent risk with any backup system that deduplicates at at a block level, encrypted or not -- if the same block appears in many files, then it&#x27;s stored only once (which is good in terms of space efficiency), but if that block is corrupted, then all the files sharing that block will be affected. Incidentally, this is not just an issue with backup systems; almost any compressed data format will also have similar risks. It&#x27;s a tradeoff of the safety in redundancy for space efficiency.')
