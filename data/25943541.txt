There are people, sometimes rather well off people, who are nevertheless in economic situations that preclude marriage.  For instance, some people have elderly or disabled family members which they must take care of.  There is huge gap, the entire middle class, between &quot;poverty&quot; and not having enough money to hire 24&#x2F;7 care.  Others have good well-paid jobs, but jobs that mean they are located in places with male&#x2F;female ratio that makes finding a partner next to impossible (China&#x27;s &quot;bachelor&quot; villages).  Still others are limited by cultural norms that do not accept marriage of persons without traditional full-time employment regardless of wealth (India, Japan).  Just look at the difficulties surrounding Japan&#x27;s princess.  The real issue there isn&#x27;t that her husband is poor, he really isn&#x27;t, but that he doesn&#x27;t have a traditional fulltime job.')
