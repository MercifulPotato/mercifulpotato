If they can define what is &quot;fact&quot; for you, the rest goes much easier - after all, if somebody resists accepting &quot;facts&quot;, it is ok to force them to do what &quot;factually&quot; needs to be done, it&#x27;s only for their own good - it&#x27;s literally like saving somebody from jumping off a bridge. So if you put a couple of bruises on him or break an arm or a leg, it&#x27;s still a good deed - after all, he was going to jump off a bridge, so he&#x27;s better off alive, even with broken leg. As soon as you&#x27;ve given yourself an exclusive license to facts, violence against and subjugation of whoever disagrees with you happens very easily and very naturally.')
