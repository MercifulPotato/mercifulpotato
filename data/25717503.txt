You can see every request in its entirety and if you see a request that you can&#x27;t read, that&#x27;s already enough reason to not use it. As for delaying it, it would have to store it somewhere like localStorage, which is just as easily inspectable.<p>If you&#x27;re worried about that, loading it in a private window and switching to offline mode, then closing it after you&#x27;re done makes any exfiltration impossible.')
