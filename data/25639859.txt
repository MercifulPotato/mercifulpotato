I like that the zoning is more realistic and the finances seem to make more sense (e.g. when you hit $0 cash you start borrowing automatically, rather than having to explicitly take out a loan, and also you have to pay emminent domain when you destroy someone&#x27;s building). Also the regional scale is neat.')
