Which totally mirrors the experience of going to the bookstore, picking a book paying for it and... that&#x27;s it, you can do whatever you want with it.\nI&#x27;m sure someone will point out that I agreed to these terms but the last time I checked a &quot;store&quot; doesn&#x27;t lend things, it sells them, so it&#x27;s easy to claim I have been misled.')
