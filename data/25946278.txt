It’s mandatory in EU at least that there’s an uninterrupted physical connection between the steering wheel down to the wheels and the fact that it turns more than 360 degrees means the gearing is fixed -and- linear.<p>What changes though is the power of the electric assist, which decreases as speed goes up, making it harder to turn the wheel, giving eased maneuvering and increased precision + hard to yank at high speed.<p>This doesn’t preclude that steering might be driven automatically, but the wheel will then turn by itself.<p>Which is also why it should be round (or almost so, some have a small flat area at the bottom) as it acts as a guard for any unexpected rotation.')
