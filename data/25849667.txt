These days, you rarely see posts about programming tools, unless it is one of the big ones like React, Qt, or TypeScript. I used to stumble upon so many great tools on HN, but that has become a rare experience these days.<p>Is there still somewhere on the web, perhaps on Reddit or another platform, where you can find such posts and discussions?')
