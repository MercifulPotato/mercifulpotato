A random walk that gets there qualifies: a succession of steps.<p>Your first sentence (quoted above) is right.<p>But IMO, the two sentences quoted above, together, are not right. Because, even if not optimal, successive approximation means getting closer at each step, which is unlikely or impossible with a random walk.')
