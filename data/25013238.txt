Service was frequent and cheap and I never faced a cancellation that wasn&#x27;t due to snow. Though it may be because the New York - Chicago routes are heavily used.<p>I would rank it around the same as budget airlines like Spirit. Maybe better because there were rarely infants traveling IME.<p>Still no public transport beats a train for me, even Amtrak. You can&#x27;t beat the space and comfort.')
