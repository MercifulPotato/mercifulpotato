Item(by='KMag', descendants=None, kids=[25981988], score=None, time=1612121513, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25980654, text='Nobody is really a fan of the SEC breaking trades, but many view it as a necessary evil to promote stability of the system in the face of fallible humans and potentially buggy systems.<p>Shortening settlement reduces the time window where the SEC can reliably intervene.  Take the example I gave earlier[0] of a pension fund manager fat-fingering an order with a hypothetical 1-minute settlement window.  With one-minute settlement, by the time anyone realizes the pension fund has made a 10 million USD mistake, that money may be spread across a charity, a new baseball stadium, and thousands of stock trades indirectly via an ETF arbitrageur indirectly via an options market maker&#x27;s delta hedging.  It&#x27;s a fictional tale, but it&#x27;s not far fetched in a world of rapid settlement.<p>Hopefully some day we have much more reliable automated systems and humans further from the loop, but until then, slow settlement increases the window to take corrective action.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25953459" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25953459</a>')
