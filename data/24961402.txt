So, you would have to compare implementations.<p>AFAIK, in practice, many C++ compilers support alloca for compatibility with gcc (or more specifically, its C library)<p>Also, is alloca part of any C standard? I can’t find evidence for that easily. Also, if so, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stack-based_memory_allocation#System_interface" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stack-based_memory_allocation#...</a> needs updating. It currently says<p><i>“The function was present on Unix systems as early as 32&#x2F;V (1978), but is not part of Standard C or any POSIX standard.”</i><p>I also don’t see how it could be part of the standard, as that, AFAIK, doesn’t even specify the existence of a call stack (a compiler is free to allocate call frames on the heap, for example)')
