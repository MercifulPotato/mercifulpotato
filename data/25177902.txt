The article fails to mention the fact that tipping actually creates an environment where <i>more</i> prejudice (not less) can be exposed. If you aren&#x27;t a stereotypical &quot;good-looking&quot; female server, you will statistically earn far fewer tips. The same goes for people working in the kitchen (as the article mentions).<p>If your servers (or anyone working in the restaurant) demand higher wages, pay them the fair wage and charge what it costs to operate at that level. The expectation of a tip feels similar to the hidden fees charged by wireless carriers so they can advertise a much lower rate.')
