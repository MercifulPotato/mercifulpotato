If you don&#x27;t actually care about what you produce, fine, go with open loop steppers. If you want to control a device that produces accurate work products that do not need extensive rework (or to be tossed) then use something with a feedback mechanism.<p>I&#x27;m fine with you advocating for steppers for non-contact or drawing work (laser cutters, engraving and so on). But if you care about your tools, you don&#x27;t want to wait for hours for what should be a small job then add the bit of money for a servo or a hybrid solution, on the total cost of the machine it won&#x27;t make a lot of difference and the machine will be so much more reliable and faster that you&#x27;ll end up using it much more frequently.<p>Right tool for the job and all that, bench top CNC with small servos is a very powerful tool in the hobbyists arsenal, and if you scrounge ebay you&#x27;ll find they can be quite affordable. Note that anything that cuts has a stand-time, and if you move slower or make many passes because you can&#x27;t really cut then you will end up spending a fortune in tooling which at some point will easily outweigh the price of the feedback mechanism, which automatically compensates for increased load and toolbit wear.')
