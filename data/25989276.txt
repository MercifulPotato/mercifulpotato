I&#x27;ve never once received a facts-based answer (for obvious reasons).<p>Iraq was about Russia, not oil. The same thing Syria and Libya are about. Trying to limit or strip Russian influence out of the Middle East. It&#x27;s two major powers going at eachother via proxy, the same thing that has been going on all around the world between the US and Russia since WW2. Vietnam also wasn&#x27;t about oil. Afghanistan also wasn&#x27;t about oil.<p>The US lost over a trillion dollars in Iraq trying to keep the two major factions from killing eachother. There is no amount of oil that could ever come out of Iraq for the US that will make up for that.')
