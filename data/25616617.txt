Almost everything in it is better than a multi-billion-dollar company&#x27;s monopolistic OS shell somehow, from the taskbar customization to the features (disable compositing, deep customization of effects and behavior, have windows remember size&#x2F;position, etc.) to the file manager, Dolphin, which has split views, tabs, had a dark theme a dozen years ago, more file metadata to show optionally like date modified and size, thumbnails for even text files, terminal integration, and more (although technically that&#x27;s an independent package available on any DE). The exceptions are how &quot;smoothly&quot; windows glide around the screen when dragged and that the Windows taskbar looks slightly better.')
