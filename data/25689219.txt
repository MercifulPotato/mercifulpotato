We excuse Trump’s mob, as they are the ones America left behind or who didn’t have access to higher education. No, they’re just stupid — even the ones with “Senator” before their name.<p>At some point, I hope people will recognize that this attitude is not the solution. Especially when it&#x27;s believed that all of the stupid are on one side of the political divide.')
