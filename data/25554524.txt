Item(by='bayindirh', descendants=None, kids=[25556202], score=None, time=1609105479, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25554066, text='&gt; TBW is almost never a concern for <i>desktop</i> users.<p>You&#x27;re right however, most of the people who&#x27;ll use this kind of setup is not ordinary desktop users.<p>My desktop has 4 disks (2 SSDs and 2 HDDs). My write rate for &quot;Home&quot; SSD is 3TB&#x2F;yr. To keep the value low, I&#x27;ve moved VMs, big downloads and other stuff to one of the HDDs. System is on another SSD and it&#x27;s cumulative write was about 3TB in 8 years but, I moved logs and high-write portions to another HDD to keep that value low.<p>3-4TB &#x2F; year on the other hand is pretty in line with a Windows 10 installation&#x27;s behavior when used by a normal desktop user, as intended.<p>&gt;You will never download enough Docker images for personal use to burn out your 860 Evo before you would have replaced it anyway.<p>Considering other stuff I do, I could easily double or triple the amount of writes in my Home SSD, but VMs and other stuff already can sit on the RAM once running so there&#x27;s no speed problem.<p>While write amplification is not a big concern anymore, building software and other small file operations can accumulate fast, so I still can&#x27;t trust a SSD blindly.<p>On the replacing of drives, while a dd or rsync is pretty straightforward for a seasoned Linux user, I don&#x27;t prefer to change hardware just for the sake of it, or abuse it because it&#x27;s cheap and can be replaced on a whim. At the end of the day, I&#x27;d rather use my system efficiently rather than recklessly both in terms of resources and endurance, because being able to rely on your system is underrated imho.<p>Because of my Job, we torture systems up to and beyond their design limits and a little optimization can go a long way in these scenarios. I like to apply that knowledge to my systems to extend their useful life.')
