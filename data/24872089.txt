It would also rightfully suppress the influence of the regions in this country that wish it was still the 1830s, but give them a path to return to influence that&#x27;s contingent on uniting their polities.<p>We&#x27;d see states competing to make voting more accessible in a nonpartisan manner, because every state wants to have more representation in the electoral college and the congress, regardless of which party is in power.<p>This would force parties to <i>actually represent</i> their neighbors, whom they can safely ignore and suppress today.<p>With this change as an example, I think the Electoral College could actually be leveraged to steer our system in more inclusive direction. I&#x27;d love to simulate this version of history.')
