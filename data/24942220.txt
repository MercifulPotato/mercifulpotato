A huge number of software engineers have been burned by being treated as Google statistics. That works great for ads or search, but Google has a reputation as someone you would never, ever, ever, ever build a sustainable business around.<p>There is a critical mass of people who simply won&#x27;t use Google in a business-critical setting, and it&#x27;s growing quickly. Now, that adds any GSuite office which relied on Google for working printers. Is that a lot? Probably not. Multiply that times each time this has happened before, and times the never of businesses wacked out-of-business by Google&#x27;s automated algorithms, and at this point, I think it&#x27;s quickly reaching the point where most teams have a Google horror story or two.<p>It&#x27;s fine for purely transactional businesses (ones with zero startup&#x2F;shutdown costs -- for example, one can arbitrage adwords and referral fees).<p>My guess is that at some point, Google will realize this, either from data or otherwise, and sunset GCE and related services, probably with very short notice, leaving many businesses hanging.<p>Short of giving a 10-year guarantee of keeping services running at specific cost and service levels, with real liability (not externalizing costs to customers again), I don&#x27;t see how Google could address this.')
