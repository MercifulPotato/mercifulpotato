As I was paying I told him that it was a lot of money for three dozen tamales<p>I mean, 50c&#x2F;tamal isn&#x27;t bad. Growing up in SoCal, homemade tamales bought on the street were 30c-$1&#x2F;ea (sometimes less, in bulk). And that was without a tamale extruder. Honestly, I don&#x27;t even see the point of this machine. People that could afford this won&#x27;t enjoy the profit margins of making tamales and people who make tamales can already do it plenty fast for much cheaper:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=e7EYf5h8HFc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=e7EYf5h8HFc</a>')
