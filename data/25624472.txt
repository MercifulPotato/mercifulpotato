While it probably won&#x27;t support error correction <i>monitoring</i>, LPDDR5 has built in error correction that silently corrects single bit flips. That alone should be a huge reliability improvement.<p>LPDDR5 will enable some much needed level of error correction in a metric ton of other future SoC designs too. I look forward to the future Raspberry Pi with built in error correction capabilities.')
