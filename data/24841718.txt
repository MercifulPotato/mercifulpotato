For a &quot;ready&quot; example see the call of cthulu d20 edition&#x2F;remake.<p>But in a pick-up game with strangers, and with the current &quot;mainstream&quot; d&amp;d - you probably have to be lucky to enter a campaignwwhere you develop a character as rich as Elminister or the Lord of Waterdeep.<p>For systems that encourage story-telling - I&#x27;d look to Cypher as mentioned by others - and of course white wolf&#x27;s Storyteller system. It can be used for almost anything - but Hunter and Mage are probably most beginner friendly for players. Beware that mage can be quite mind bending.<p>A wiki from our current mage campaign:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;radio-noir.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Radio_Noir_Wiki" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;radio-noir.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Radio_Noir_Wiki</a><p>Old blog from a previous storyteller&#x2F;mage inspired original setting:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thebookofworlds.blogspot.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;world-of-argos.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thebookofworlds.blogspot.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;world-of-argos.html</a>')
