I use it everywhere and it is pretty fantastic.<p>Despite Debian being phenomenal in many ways, it doesn&#x27;t offer up a head for the chopping block to replace yours if things go wrong in a corporate application.  Good luck getting IT folks to deploy anything that doesn&#x27;t offer them an out.<p>Using CentOS knowing that it is downstream from RedHat but that RedHat would step up and fix things in a semi-timely manner was good enough for many enterprises....at least until IBM got involved.<p>Ubuntu is also a weird choice generally speaking because Ubuntu just uses Debian&#x27;s testing repo as a base and really only significantly varies in the kernels that they roll for various products&#x2F;services.[cloud,live patching,etc.] They used to maintain their own desktop[Unity] and service management[upstart] and a bunch more variances from Debian...but that ain&#x27;t really the case today.')
