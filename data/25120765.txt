In reality, I was seeing the end result of competent management teams who effectively filtered out negative employees in the hiring process or quickly dealt with anyone who became problematic after being hired.<p>Being a negative value engineer isn’t just about writing bad code or being incompetent. Those things are trivially obvious in any technical interview. The reality is that negative value usually comes from behavioral issues. Engineers who are constantly sowing discord against the company or management can bring down entire teams. Engineers who create conflict and destroy morale are toxic for productivity and will drive away your best team members. Engineers who can’t ever ship anything on time because they can’t manage their own time or they have pathological perfectionist tendencies will sink your schedules. Ironically, negative value can often come from those with great technical chops who are unfortunately mired in personal issues.<p>Managers can compensate to some degree with intense attention and guidance for those individuals, but at what cost? Obviously managers should make an attempt to correct behavioral problems that are dragging the team down, but at some point you need to do the inevitable and replace the problematic employee with someone who can perform without the behavioral issues.<p>It’s not just a question of whether or not someone can write good code. It’s a question of whether or not the team and company are best served by keeping a troubled employee as opposed to reallocating that finite headcount to a new candidate.')
