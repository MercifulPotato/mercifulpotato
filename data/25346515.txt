My gut reaction was that this was a bean-counter move. Thinking more about it the key issues I see with this move are:<p>- CENTOS fills a need, that many users have and superficially it looks like Red Hat (IBM) is now abandoning addressing it. On the other hand Red Hat does offer RHEL for free (gratis) [0] and that should fill the needs of CENTOS users (right?). However it would have been much better if that option was mentioned in the announcement.<p>- I thought Fedora was upstream of RHEL. However after thinking more about it I realised that RHEL has a significant delta over Fedora. I &#x27;m guessing CENTOS stream will be partway between Fedora and RHEL. It makes sense from Red Hats open development approach to have the delta between Fedora and RHEL happen in the open. Done right that should strengthen  RHEL.<p>- Why the rush to drop support for CENTOS 8? I m sure some people are using it in production and they are unlikely to to want to move to this new CENTOS stream. It&#x27;s a new OS distribution with a philosophy different to the one that was right for them!<p>Overall I &#x27;d prefer if the new thing was called RHEL stream and provided for free (gratis) as CENTOS stream is. Also making more explicit the RHEL availability for free instead of having competing brands would be good. Now that there are competing vendors (Amazon Linux, Oracle Linux) trying to entice users it&#x27;d be better to strengthen RHEL brand rather than dilute it with multiple offerings. Unless RedHat&#x2F;IBM plans to pull the plug on option [0].<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.redhat.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2016&#x2F;03&#x2F;31&#x2F;no-cost-rhel-developer-subscription-now-available&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.redhat.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2016&#x2F;03&#x2F;31&#x2F;no-cost-rhel-d...</a>')
