Even though technically ”rolling” as well, it is <i>much</i> faster than a typical electronic shutter due to the way a CMOS sensor must be read out. Phone cameras have no physical shutters and use e-shutter all the time, but your D7000 only resorts to it when shooting video.<p>As a rule of thumb, it takes several milliseconds for a mechanical shutter to traverse the sensor plane, but it takes several <i>tens</i> of milliseconds for an e-shutter to readout the sensor. Shutter speed does not affect this; even at 1&#x2F;4000s or 1&#x2F;8000s or whatever the time difference between the top and the bottom of a photo remains the same.')
