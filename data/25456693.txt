The minute that team ceases to be viewed as independent and credible, their value to Google is vastly diminished.<p>What Google wants to say to the world is &quot;hey, you should totally trust us, we have the best ethical AI people in the field looking over our shoulder!&quot; But now Google can&#x27;t say that, because the world knows that their experts <i>aren&#x27;t</i> completely free to exercise judgement or state their opinions. That may only be true to a limited extent, but the damage to Google is larger: mostly because we don&#x27;t know how limited it is.<p>Insofar as your employer feels free to add marketing fluff to your presentations, that&#x27;s because your value to the company is not predicated on your being an independent voice who provides a check on management.')
