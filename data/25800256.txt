Or rather, it&#x27;s &#x27;always political between states&#x27; but the legitimacy of the facts give it credibility.<p>China&#x27;s initial dismissal and coverup of the spread of the virus, and their subsequent misinformation and lack of transparency, and finally, their attempts to stop an investigation into COVID origins are <i>really seriously bad things</i>.<p>To boot - they&#x27;ve made a political appointment to the head of the WHO and have been trying to obtain leverage within that organization of years.<p>It&#x27;s actually reasonable that the US demands expulsion of China from the WHO on those grounds, until China plays be the rules. They can&#x27;t claim &#x27;it&#x27;s an internal problem&#x27; as they always do here. Much like with currency and other things, if they want to be a part of these organizations they have to follow the rules.')
