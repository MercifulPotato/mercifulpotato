Genuinely curious. I promise I&#x27;m not ignoring evidence, I literally haven&#x27;t seen it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;04&#x2F;05&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;election-voting-machine-hacking-russians.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;04&#x2F;05&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;election-voting-m...</a><p>&gt; Edit: and in the other direction, any input on why the non-machine hand count which just completed in Georgia affirmed the results from the original count? Doesn&#x27;t that pretty much eliminate the whole conspiracy theory?<p>There are documents on the web, which appear to be sworn affidavits from people who claim to have been election observers that contain allegations that there were many improprieties including boxes of ballots with no chain of custody. To me if you can affect the initial count then I don&#x27;t see why its hard to believe that you can affect the recount, especially if it was affected by adding ballots.<p>To me the real issue is that there&#x27;s no real way to verify the outcome of an election because the process is so big. I&#x27;m not convinced it was &quot;stolen&quot; because I don&#x27;t know who &quot;really&quot; won and its just odd that the burden of proof for establishing that interference is possible is so high when you can just examine the process and tell that if someone adds a bunch of ballots to the room where the ballots are kept, there&#x27;s not a way to undo that or determine what was done. How can people be so credulous in such an opaque process?')
