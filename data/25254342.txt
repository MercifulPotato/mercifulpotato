I&#x27;ve got a lot plans for those areas, but the main roadblock is personal bandwidth. This has primarily been a spare time project for the past 4-5 years...<p>There&#x27;re ~100 examples for thi.ng&#x2F;umbrella alone, all commented, all linked from the readme&#x27;s of each package used. Additionally, I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time this year adding more readmes, docstrings (again with examples), create diagrams etc. I completely get your comments&#x2F;position, but I&#x27;m also really wondering if <i>any</i> of this work is just wasted effort if no one actually reads&#x2F;looks at that stuff... and that then makes it even harder for me to prioritize.<p>FWIW I will also start streaming again in December, focusing on smaller projects&#x2F;examples than previously. Maybe that format will work better for newcomers.<p>Obviously, there&#x27;s no desire from my end to be overly cryptic about what you can do with these projects, but whereas P5, OF etc <i>at their core</i> all have a fairly narrow scope (DSLs for OpenGL API and some data wrangling sugar) and only gain their incredible flexibility through various addons and sheer community size, thi.ng simply has <i>no core</i> and <i>that</i> is the hardest thing to &quot;sell&quot; to people, even though IMHO it&#x27;s also one of it&#x27;s most unique aspects...<p>thi.ng is an ecosystem (as others have put it), not following the standard main pillar&#x2F;silo + plugin architectures...')
