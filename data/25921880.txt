We just have to use simpler tools.<p>People don&#x27;t add these features for the fun of it; they&#x27;re present because they solve a specific use case.<p>I use doas as well; it&#x27;s a neat little program that covers many of the <i>common</i> use cases, but it doesn&#x27;t cover <i>all</i> of them. Usually you should use the simplest tool that solves your problem, but sometimes your problem is complex and thus your tool will be complex.<p>That is not to say that sudo can&#x27;t perhaps be simpler; the first version was released in 1985 and there are probably things that can be improved, but sudo really isn&#x27;t written by idiots who just add features because they have nothing better to do.')
