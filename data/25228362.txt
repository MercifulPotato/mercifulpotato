I said that it would take me days or weeks of remembering&#x2F;relearning to have any hope of solving it cleverly -- but the search space for the answers was only factorial(10) possibilities, so I could write a program to brute force it.<p>I did. 30 minutes of code writing (of which about 20 was spent making sure I didn&#x27;t miss something) and then less than 3 seconds of computing time later, I had the answer for him. Nothing clever at all -- just trying all the possibilities and seeing if that set fit.')
