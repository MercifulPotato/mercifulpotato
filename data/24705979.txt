And while the allure of having your dishes pressure washed in 1-3 min cycles sounds cool its actually a much bigger PITA than you can imagine as the maintenance costs on those things is pretty high. In my experience most kitchens don&#x27;t actually own them, they rent them with a maintenance and supply cost attached to them, which get very costly.<p>We had to double the capacity of ours in my last kitchen, the problems was that this double sized machine had lots of downtime as the sensors were not reading the cycles correctly, it would randomly shutdown or just freeze, which would create pauses in the middle of service, and this was an old part of town (150 years old?) with tons of other restaurants so the plumbing was less than ideal which created an issue with backups and sudden floods of waste water coming from the machine into the kitchen.<p>So unless you&#x27;re regularly hosting banquets in your home and have issues with limited pans, cutlery and flatware I can&#x27;t see this making any sense and is incredible overkill. The company might love you for the low costs they&#x27;ll incur, though.<p>I will say this: after having spent time working in kitchens I really hate doing dishes at home now by hand. But that could be easily solved with just having a domestic sized dishwasher machine and increase my flatware and utensils. Even a high pressure sprayer attachment to a deep sink would make a much bigger improvement and likely save on water as You could just compartmentalize the process.')
