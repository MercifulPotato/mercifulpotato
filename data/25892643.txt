The M1 MBP display is simply too small to have the inspector and the browser comfortably on screen simultaneously, and its not possible to flick between virtual desktops (or application windows) without losing the context (some targeting stuff is hover-based, for example). Plus its annoying tweaking a css style, flicking back and forth all the time instead of seeing your change reflected as you change it.')
