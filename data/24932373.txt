I know people who live in Victorville and commute over Cajon Pass to Riverside.  One hour each way isn&#x27;t an unthinkable commute in Southern California, and it lets them afford a fairly nice place compared to what they could get in Riverside.  I suspect they&#x27;re not that unusual.<p>In fact I thought of &quot;land banking&quot; there myself a decade or two ago, because I could see that the commute over Cajon would become thinkable.')
