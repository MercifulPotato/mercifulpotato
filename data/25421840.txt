There are still engineer tradeoffs being made against reliability. Lightweight (fuel efficient) oils are being used, gas tank emissions capture (a system of rubber hoses and solenoids which fail easily), EGR systems, etc all are a detriment to reliability even if they have other positive uses.  Today&#x27;s cars could be far more reliable if that was a bigger design goal.')
