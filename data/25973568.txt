I dont see an obvious reaon why other cities would follow a different profile, so no I dont think that assumption is correct. The problem is indeed cost, but more the cost of storing the energy created by green renwables to be used when the wind isnt blowing or the sun isnt shining. If anything electricity will become <i>much</i> more expensive and become cheaper not overnight but instead when the weather is great. Indeed this is whats happening in Germany as a result of their energiewende program')
