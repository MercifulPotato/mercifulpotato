Let me tell you a story, some months ago I came across a NGO that is heavily against pornhub (You can see their campaign in many social media sites) They were a little bit over the top so that got me suspicious, so I started to research them a little, being an NGO and all. To summarize, they have been basically running a scam for years! Those people must be racking mid-high six figures a year from donations and when you check their numbers they have not done anything of what they promised (Like helping sexual workers and stuff) 95% of their budget goes to A)A hefty salary for the founder. B) The budget for a &quot;documentary&quot; years in the making. Ironically, those guys have a profitable cottage industry from outrage on the Internet.<p>If you are a sociopath that is a highly motivating example. I thought about tipping a journo, but knowing current media I thought better and just let them be.')
