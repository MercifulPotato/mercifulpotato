That&#x27;s kind of what&#x27;s missing in my opinion, something that does the hard part of UI, integration with native OS controls (eg. open dialogs, etc.), accessibility even with custom UI drawn using 2D primitives, etc. and that would be a great project that would also benefit the author as long as it has Java bindings.')
