You have to pay for housing them, and the opportunity costs of them not being able to contribute to the economy is probably many times bigger.<p>European systems recognize this fact, and try their best to get prisoners out of prison as fast as possible.<p>Prisoners in European systems can get counseling for mental problems, access to education, and the structure in the prisons allow the prisoners to adopt a &#x27;normal&#x27; lifestyle. They are supposed to get up themselves in the morning, go to their education, or labor, and having time off in the evening to do their own thing.<p>Although American media often shows otherwise, most crimes can be explained by circumstance, rather than a particular &#x27;evilness&#x27; of the perpetrator. Nobody wants to be a criminal. European systems help prisoners to live a life free of crime. American prisons make it harder.')
