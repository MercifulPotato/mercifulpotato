The bottleneck on guis is remastering and layout not cycling through the lists of sliders.<p>How often you repaint or have to relayout should depend on only two things. How often is your data changing? And how soon does the user need to see that new data?<p>Even things like moving the mouse or view are just data changes. (In fact, the biggest messes you&#x27;ll get into when writing GUI and render code is when you&#x27;ve failed to incorporate something into your scene or data model and end up handling it with a lot of special case code.)')
