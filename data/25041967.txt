Are there any good sources on this?<p>It&#x27;s not just US that fails with these kind of projects. In Sweden we have seen many expensive government IT infrastructure projects that effectively flush tax money down the drain.

If I knew of a similar company in Sweden I would seriously consider joining it.<p>It could be done so much better.
