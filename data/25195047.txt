This trope that bhuddism&#x2F;Jainism influenced vegetarianism is a concotion by colonial historians. Same for the thirukkural, it is a Hindu text adhering to the Hindu philosophical dharma+artha+kama but the history polluted by colonial historians. Wikipedia is a bad place for authentic hindu information. It is pretty much hijacked by vested interests.')
