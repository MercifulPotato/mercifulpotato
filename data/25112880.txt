If they told her she had the vaccine, she&#x27;d be more likely to go out and take risks. Conversely, if they told her she had placebo, she&#x27;d probably stay in and take less risks. Overall, this would lead to a dramatic reduction in the power to observe an actual protective effect, as vaccinated would be riskier and unvaccinated would behave safer.<p>Hang in there, she is doing a good service, I hope you are both well!')
