Your part about the current attitude that &quot;users can&#x27;t be trusted with this power and need to be protected from themselves at their own expense by some other benevolent entity&quot; is spot on.<p>We should strive to get back to having engineering level access to the general purpose computers we buy. And then continue on to give tinkerers the same engineering access for tools for <i>making</i> things: CNC lathes and mills, etc. Then your &quot;whoever you are ... you can do just about anything&quot; part becomes even more powerful.
