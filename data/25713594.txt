Complying with legislation around data use while trying to build a start-up seems to be people&#x27;s concern.<p>Although in saying this, if you genuinely believe in privacy first, it isn&#x27;t an issue. But relatively few businesses do, and most are still looking for their monetisation route, assuming ongoing eyeballs are deferred future revenue.')
