In some cases, as with Jami, this would be limited to friends you add; in others, as with Scuttlebutt and IPFS, it could be revealed to anyone.<p>Regarding Scuttlebutt (SSB), this isn&#x27;t quite true. While IPFS requires a DHT, SSB&#x27;s primary mode of updating content is via servers such as pubs and rooms, the DHT in SSB is optional and not the most common mode of updating content. In SSB you can and should choose the servers which you&#x27;re connecting to, so in that sense it&#x27;s closer to the federated model.<p>It&#x27;s not entirely fair that the article equates &quot;P2P&quot; to &quot;DHT&quot;, there are many ways you can do P2P connections, a DHT is only used for discovery. IP leakage is a problem in <i>all</i> these models (centralized, P2P, federated, etc): some computer somewhere will see your IP address, and you have to trust them not to do bad stuff with it.<p>For a comprehensive overview of privacy in DHTs and P2P, watch this talk: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nCCkwU4JPcY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nCCkwU4JPcY</a>')
