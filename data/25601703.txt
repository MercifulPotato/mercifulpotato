It&#x27;s interesting to me, since all the things you mention are not part of my experience at all, despite working with Python a lot. Even diffing, as you said, is easy because of the &quot;ignore whitespace&quot; you mention. Anyway, it&#x27;s good for me to get a reminder that I can&#x27;t so easily generalize from myself. :)')
