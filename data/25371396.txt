And they experienced positive economic growth this year. Meanwhile in the USA I think wealthy people were worried that these measures would harm the economy so we let states and counties all decide on their own how to handle things. And the issue of mask wearing became weirdly politicized.<p>And actually I learned recently that in 1988 George HW Bush gave this passionate speech about how the USA needed to fight climate change head on... but by the time republicans got the presidency again the party sided with oil companies on a pro fossil fuel message.<p>Why do we politicize science like this? Or is it inherently political? Is it just that lobbyists influence political parties differently and so issues that have nothing to do with Democrat or Republican end up getting attached to those identities?<p>I don’t really know what the answer is. But I do think if the USA had all taken the science seriously and did not politicize the issue we’d have at least 100,000 more Americans alive today.')
