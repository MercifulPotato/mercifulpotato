I had relied on my &quot;elders&quot; to have that knowledge.<p>Ancestry and the like makes it easy to reconstruct your family tree even if you are starting with almost no knowledge. But there&#x27;s the oral tradition of &quot;your great grandmother&#x27;s first husband died in a hotel from the gas lamp fixtures leaking&quot; that would have been a lot harder to have found.<p>So I did find a sudden interest in genealogy. Or maybe it was a sense of duty or obligation â€” but that quickly did in fact turn into an interest.<p>Perhaps if you never do have children you might also never find an interest in genealogy.<p>I&#x27;ll say this though, I have not fond any interest in finding genealogical connections to famous people. Nor have I had much interest in going back more than 150 years or so. I think the photos uniquely draw me into the lives of the generations captured in them. And perhaps because they are photos, not wills or marriage licenses, etc., I am come to feel either the futility and brevity of life or, at other times, the wonder and often humble dignity of it.')
