It doesn&#x27;t make economic sense.<p>So for the small business it can mean they get away with a homegrown minimal service  at a fraction of the cost, even though the &#x27;quality&#x27; of the produced for general applications might also just be a fraction of integrating the &#x27;off the shelf&#x27; offering.<p>I&#x27;ve seen some startups running in major deficits simply because they went all out on integrating external services the aggregated cost far outstripped the margin their market allowed for.')
