I remember seeing a pro-democracy speech given by some Sinologist at an American University, the audience of which was mainland Chinese people. It was full of Americanisms and cultural elements which I assume would be very offputting and ineffective.<p>As for the Russian operations, the writer in the article briefly touches an aspect which I believe has the essence of why some of their operations work so well: it seems like the employees at the Internet Research Agency are having lots of fun subverting America. A few weeks ago I saw that one of the front organizations that claimed to be from somewhere in the US had an acronym that translated into something like &quot;fuck&quot; in Russian. I can&#x27;t imagine the Chinese bureaucracy would allow such childish pranks to be part of a state influence operation, but paradoxically allowing your employees to mess around like this has a strong effect on the efficacy of your operations.<p>This actually mirrors a lot of what Paul Graham says about procrastination, and Jordan Peterson about play being an essential human activity.
