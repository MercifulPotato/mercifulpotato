There are always a few spam sites like that on the first results page. Another recurring one is gitmemory, which scrapes github issues.<p>Why is Google so bad at blocking spam? For the featured box example I mentioned there was a &#x27;Feedback&#x27; button where I could choose &#x27;This isn&#x27;t useful&#x27; or &#x27;This isn&#x27;t relevant&#x27;. Even so, it states that feedback does not impact search results, which suggests the feedback is regarding the existence of the feature box, not the spammy content. The lack of feedback on regular links (afaik) seems to confirm that.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to &quot;quit google&quot;, using ddg or bing. Those seem better at filtering out spam sites, but they&#x27;re nowhere near google level when searching for very specific code such as error messages.
