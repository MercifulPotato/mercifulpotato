I stand on a position that allowing such calls is an acceptable price for a free speech. I come from Russia, where all restrictions on free speech are made on the pretemse of &#x27;calls to extremism&#x27;, people who are against Putin are jailed, and sentenced, for exactly this. So no, I&#x27;ve seen where this road leads to. If people gather on Parler to storm the Capitol, find them using police measures and prosecute them. It&#x27;s harder than bans, but has much fewer harmful side-effects, like eventual authoritatian state.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25692644" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25692644</a>')
