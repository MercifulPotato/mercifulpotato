My vices tripled and I am still trying to reign them back in. I&#x27;ve had a low key depression since June last year and still trying to shake it.<p>As the parent comment said, they were an introvert, there are lots of people who aren&#x27;t. (me)<p>In my little suburb, it looks like 10 small businesses had to shutdown while all the mega stores were allowed to continue operation.<p>I feel sorry for anyone who had a less than average housemate, stuck in a place with people for that long causes tension regardless if you like the person.<p>I don&#x27;t see any problem with people who broke the rules. The government told us from the start that we were just flattening the curve but then without telling us extended the lock-downs in some attempt for an elimination strategy.<p>I personally don&#x27;t think anyone in the world will ever know or feel what happened here in Melbourne so I expect to be down-voted also.<p>----<p>Just going to add what our stage 4 lockdown looked like which kinda lasted for 2 months at it&#x27;s worst.<p>- 8pm-5am curfew (you have to be at home)<p>- no visitors<p>- 5km radius (this lasted for what felt like 6 months)<p>- you had to wear your mask as soon as you left your house (this went for months, we still have to wear masks in shops (even though we have zero cases))<p>- you could only go to the super market once per day, and you had to go by yourself<p>- you were only allowed outside for exercise for 1 hour (with 1 person)<p>- lots of shops forced you to give your details over and some demanded that you sanitize your hands (these are two things I didn&#x27;t want to do for my own reasons)<p>- no gyms, hospo, group events, activities etc<p>- increase of police powers, fines around $1600<p>-----<p>We also locked a bunch of social housing people in their apartments for two weeks. They didn&#x27;t even have balconies, just small ugly windows. I hope someone eventually gets sued for that decision. -&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.abc.net.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020-08-25&#x2F;coronavirus-melbourne-public-housing-tower-shutdown-inquiry&#x2F;12589372" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.abc.net.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020-08-25&#x2F;coronavirus-melbourne...</a>')
