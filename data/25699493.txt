That does not strictly necessitate them to be pointy on the opposite end, but it at least requires some design that can distribute the force through the ship&#x27;s body with the minimal amount of structural mass. E.g. an axial design that only has to withstand compressive forces, not shear forces.<p>A bigger issue is the lack surface area for cooling. Not even The Expanse gets that one right.')
