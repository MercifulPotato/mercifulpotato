Intel has for the most part been stuck on 6 year old 14nm and it&#x27;s positively ancient compared to TSMC 5nm upon which the M1 is manufactured, it&#x27;s to all intends and purposes two generations ahead. This is big card Apple got to play.<p>Intel have managed to squeeze an incredible amount of performance out of their 14nm (+++...) but it&#x27;s at a cost and that cost was power consumption, they had no other choice with their DOA 10nm (hyperbole for affect :)).')
