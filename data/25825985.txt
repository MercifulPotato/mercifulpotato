Russian people overall have a very positive attitude towards the US and Americans and are able to differentiate people from their government. Even the official Russian propaganda (Channel 1, etc) has a less harsh depiction of America compared to how US media portrays Russia. All the Russia hate in the US right now doesn&#x27;t even make an effort separate the politics from the people, which is really disappointing.')
