I have personally spoken with scores of people who will (for example) express displeasure over Ubisoft&#x27;s culture of sexual abuse, and not blink an eye when it came time to purchase Assassain&#x27;s Creed: Valhalla. Or of Rockstar&#x27;s culture of abusive crunch and equally abusive Twitter presence while buying premium versions of TLOU2.<p>So long as they pump out decent-to-good games, no amount of bad press will impact the number of games (and microtransactions) purchased. And sadly even bad games won&#x27;t dent their reputation <i>that</i> much, especially if followed up by a good game again.<p>Bioware, as an example, is being lauded in the press and by gamers in general again because they announced that they&#x27;re making another Mass Effect game. There&#x27;s very little hesitation before gushing about it, even given ME: Andromeda and Anthem.<p>Even the press releases about The Witcher 4 are filled with praise for a company that just released a turd of a game (though you&#x27;ll still find plenty of people who heap praise upon CP2077 because they have the blessed combination of PC components).')
