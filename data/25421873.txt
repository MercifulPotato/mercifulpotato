There&#x27;s definitely a glass ceiling there.<p>Some companies have come up with a partial solution to this antagonistic need, they invented the &quot;Product Manager&quot; position (or &quot;PM&quot;), which is a kind of not-so-technical engineering position (who does not and cannot really &quot;manage&quot; anything)... and then filled those positions with technically inept MBAs.<p>Unfortunately, an MBA is a degree in nothing of substance (See Mintzberg), so technical acumen cannot come from the MBA per se.')
