Often it sufficed to just type one word out of the entire audio clip or even enter a word which sounded similar [eg. audio clip says &quot;tranced&quot;, I write &quot;transit&quot;].  The most satisfying ones of all where when, after listening to a complete sentence containing either word, I could pass the reCraptcha by simply typing &quot;the&quot; or &quot;an&quot; into the form.<p>One of the things that I find slightly disappointing about Buster is that it types in the entire sentence, when solving the reCraptcha. I hate to think Google are under the impression I&#x27;ve suddenly started trying harder!')
