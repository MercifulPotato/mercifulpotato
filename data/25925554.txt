Basically a compound added to a plate of cells EXACTLY matched the increase in yield, the former student had just multiplied the yield by the same amount of the added compound. I reported it to my advisor but (of course) she swept it under the rug and did nothing.<p>I tried to contact the format student but also nothing. There were a few more similar instances before I became completely disillusioned and left the phd program after 4 years, totally burned out with little to show.<p>To this day I hate that lab and the whole institution. Rotten to the core.')
