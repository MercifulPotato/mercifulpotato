Things such as “Let’s meet next month, same time” wouldn’t make sense anymore.<p>Everybody would have to know what location a meeting is scheduled in. “An hour after sunrise in London” would be the same for everyone, but if you also meetings “two hours after sunrise in Madrid” and “three hours after sunrise in Paris”, how much time there is between them will vary during the year.')
