They don&#x27;t care about the small guy just as much as many don&#x27;t care to at least not violate the terms or spirit of the software they use.<p>It is also worth noting that many of the major artists that benefit the most from Spotify are copyright maximalists, which basically means<p>&quot;I not only want to profit off the work I did in my 20s and not allow others to reuse it to build new things, I also want my children to be able to do so 70 years after I die, thank you very much.&quot;<p>P.S. Am a free software maintainer myself, but we&#x27;re talking about monetary contributions here.')
