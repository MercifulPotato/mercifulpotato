Item(by='enriquto', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610365241, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25727250, text='&gt; You could type &#x2F;tmp&#x2F;a. and it would autocomplete it to &#x2F;tmp&#x2F;a.png\n&gt; \n&gt; It is a good idea, but I type too fast. So I would write &#x2F;tmp&#x2F;a.png and then the autocompletion triggered and replace it with &#x2F;tmp&#x2F;a.pngpng<p>This is so sad.<p>Autocompletion of filenames should work perfectly no matter the conditions.  If &quot;ls&quot; can list tens of thousands of files in a fraction of a second, there&#x27;s no reason that autocomplete has some delay.  I can see why this happens, maybe you have a thousand images in &#x2F;tmp and the file picker is opening them all to compute their thumbnails (which in my opinion is useless, but whatever).  Then it uses quite a few kernel threads and it clogs the system, making the completion to fail.  But it sounds like this problem should was already solved many years ago, and that modern &quot;improvements&quot; of the file picker made it fail.')
