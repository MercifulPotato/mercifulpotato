We did this because the required amount we had to deposit with the clearinghouse was so large—with individual volatile securities accounting for hundreds of millions of dollars in deposit requirements—that we had to take steps to limit buying in those volatile securities to ensure we could comfortably meet our requirements.<p>This doesn&#x27;t add up.  How could the requried amount to deposit with the clearing house <i>exceed</i> the cost of the security being purchased?  If it does not exceed the cost of the security, then why do they need to prevent purchases of stock from cash accounts?')
