Item(by='Kaze404', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605581033, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25117907, text='&gt; As a very expensive consultant I am frequently appalled at how management teams completely ignore their own employees.<p>Tell me about it. On one of my previous jobs I would constantly speak out about what we were doing would cause people to lose hundreds of thousands of USD, and every time I was laughed out of the meeting for &quot;overthinking&quot; things (I guess that&#x27;s what wanting to do things right is called these days). When one of our customers lost US$200k and nobody had any idea why or how or when I knew that company would be the death of me, and coincidentally I was on the same meeting I planned to use to quit my job.<p>If anything it taught me that working in finance is not for me :p')
