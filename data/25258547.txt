Like most methods of measuring anything, we have a pretty good idea of its accuracy under various conditions.<p>Think of it like satellite imagery of a tree: A score of zero would be a single green-ish pixel, while a score of 100 would show each leaf within the range it naturally moves in due to wind etc. (proteins tend to wiggle quite a bit under natural conditions, as well)')
