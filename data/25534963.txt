I havenâ€™t personally been all that bothered by it honestly - it seemed pretty likely that my friend is not sending a new invitation every couple months like clockwork, and presumably I can stop it by clicking once on unsubscribe.  But probably it would be better to be explicit that it is not a new invitation.')
