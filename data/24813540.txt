On the other hand, the real wages of musicians (as in all other professions) have increased greatly since the 19th century.&quot;<p>1. Yes, string quartets still require four people.<p>2. This does not mean the &quot;productivity of classical music has not increased&quot;, because:<p>a. String quartets can now make recordings and also play on radio&#x2F;TV&#x2F;streaming services, in addition to playing live. This means much larger numbers of people can hear a performance. This translates to ad revenue, streaming income, and sales of recordings. And there is also secondary income of various kinds for various supporting industries, including other forms of media.<p>b. String quartets can travel much larger distances than they used to be able to, allowing them to play live music over a much wider area than was possible when the fastest mode of transport was a horse. This hugely increases the possible listener base and potential ticket sales.<p>c. Culturally notable string quartets are likely to play in much larger concert halls than used to be the case, with increased direct ticket income.<p>d. The classical music industry is far more commercialised. There are numerous festivals and concert series which bring in far more money than they did when owning a pet orchestra was an eccentric hobby for aristocrats.<p>e. There are far more people than there used to be in the 19th century, and the worldwide classical music audience is much larger than it used to be.<p>So - this is simply a bad, ignorant example. It&#x27;s not just wrong, it&#x27;s flagrantly, wildly, <i>outrageously</i> misinformed, and is based on an almost total lack of insight into an industry that is worth $146 million a year - of which around $90 million is income from streaming.<p>The other examples are just as ridiculous and trivially incorrect. The productivity of nurses is not defined by the time it takes to change a bandage - ask any ICU nurse - and the productivity of professors is not measured by the time it takes to mark an essay.<p>How is anyone supposed to take this level of argumentation seriously when there is no evidence the authors made a credible professional effort to understand the economics of their own examples?<p>And as an advanced exercise for economists - how much has this poor level of economic insight cost the economy?')
