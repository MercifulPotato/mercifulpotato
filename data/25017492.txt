In principle, they look at the results and call the election once they think it&#x27;s highly unlikely that a particular candidate can lose. Sometimes that call is badly made, like Florida 2000 or, IMO, Fox calling Arizona prematurely. But it&#x27;s misinforming viewers to claim that all candidates still have a chance after some point in time.')
