Is it fair to say that greater hand size confers faster typing ability which allows the <i>greatest ever</i> programmer to program faster? Sure. If two programmers are of equal ability apart from their typing speed, then the faster typist must surely be considered the better programmer. In reality, does that mean you can’t be the greatest programmer of all time if you don’t have a footlong hand span? Absolutely not. That’s silly and serves only to discourage those with small hands from entering the profession.<p>Theoretically, the greatest pianist ever has 88 tentacles protruding from their chin to be able to perfectly hit any key at any time. It’s frankly ridiculous that most non-tentacled individuals even bother trying to be the greatest pianist ever.<p>The fact remains that being the greatest pianist ever comes down to hard work and innovation, not hand size or wrist constitution. Saying that hand size might limit someone only serves to misleadingly discourage newcomers from entering the hobby.')
