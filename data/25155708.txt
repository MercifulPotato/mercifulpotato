But then absolutely no limits to who and how much someone can spend on rigged games of chance with guaranteed negative-expectation. How does that make sense?<p>You&#x27;re right, the &#x27;public&#x27;&#x2F;&#x27;private&#x27; distinction is confusing and outdated. It should just be &#x27;high-reporting&#x27; (certified by accountants&#x2F;lawyers&#x2F;exchanges to meet certain standards) and &#x27;low-reporting&#x27;.<p>Perhaps tax-advantaged retirement accounts shouldn&#x27;t be allowed into &#x27;low-reporting&#x27; situations.<p>But with a person&#x27;s own excess money, they shouldn&#x27;t face a wealth test to invest it anywhere their judgement guides them - if they&#x27;re allowed to gamble, donate, burn, over-leverage, etc that money a thousand other ways to zero as well.')
