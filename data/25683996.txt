Shown by Apple Internal document in court. And later lost ( or settled ).<p>Apple took Qualcomm to court due to 4G&#x2F;5G patents dispute. And made number of claims which were false, possibly inaccurate or lying by omission.<p>I initially sided with Apple, quoting Tim Cook<p><i>“Despite being just one of over a dozen companies who contributed to basic cellular standards, Qualcomm insists on charging Apple at least five times more in payments than all the other cellular patent licensors we have agreements with combined,”</i><p>Fives Times More than others <i>Combined</i>. That is ridiculous. We knew Qualcomm were expensive, but we never had an actual number or up to date figure. This allegation was repeated in all mainstream newspaper and website. There were at least Six other major companies ( Nokia, Samsung, Huawei, ZTE, Ericsson Intel&#x2F;LG ) with broad wireless patent portfolio. That is Qualcomm = 5x where other companies = x&#x2F;6. Or 30x difference if x were divided equally between all companies.<p>This got people furious. And I did too. Despite knowing Qualcomm have the best, this kind of multiple were unheard of.<p>That is until you sit down and start to run some numbers. It doesn&#x27;t make any sense. You can add up the low end, high end estimate of all there other six companies patent licensing cost in their investor notes and rounding to the nearest number and it  would still be an order of magnitude off the figure Apple were trying to paint.<p>Apple argued Qualcomm made double dipping because they were earning profits from Qualcomm Modem itself, and they are still charging for patents. As if the design of the Modem itself doesn&#x27;t cost anything?<p>And numerous other claims.<p>At the end instead of going to PR battle with Apple, Qualcomm has shown immense restrain. I guess they knew they would win. And since then I have tremendous respect for their CEO, Steve Mollenkopf&#x27;s professionalism.<p>The only person who bother to report all the fact from both side was Shara Tibken from Cnet. Who actually sit in <i>every</i> Apple Qualcomm trial ( There were multiple ) and tweet as well as post update. You can read about it here [1] to make up your own mind.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnet.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;apple-and-qualcomm-settle-heres-what-it-means-for-your-next-iphone&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnet.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;apple-and-qualcomm-settle-heres-wh...</a>')
