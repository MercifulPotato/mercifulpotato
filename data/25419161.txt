Recently I realized I could just wear one around my neck even inside my home to stay warmer, which is something I&#x27;d somehow never considered before. It&#x27;s more comfortable than a turtle neck imo.<p>I think a lot of people had this same idea, and you see bandannas being worn around a lot. In public people will just think it&#x27;s your &#x27;backup COVID mask&#x27; if you have a bandanna around your neck, so it doesn&#x27;t look like an oddball style choice.')
