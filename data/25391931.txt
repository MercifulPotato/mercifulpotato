No matter how bad things are because of someone harming you, it can be just as bad because of nobody&#x27;s fault. For example, born with a disability vs acquired on from an assault or unemployed because of discrimination or unemployed because of lack of ability. The outcome is the same and perhaps we should be encouraging all people to make the best of their lives and not suffer from feelings of vengeance and blame.')
