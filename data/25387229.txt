Some of them don&#x27;t want outsiders, with no connection to the culture or the group, coming in and learning it just to prove they can, especially when children of the group haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to learn it because of colonialism and other, often horrible, things.<p>The Hopi are known for this, and actually decided to forego teaching the language at a school because they couldn&#x27;t guarantee Navajo students wouldn&#x27;t sign up for it.<p>So, really, there&#x27;s a lot more involved than it just being an &#x27;endangered language&#x27; that everyone should have the right to learn and that they should want everyone to learn. There&#x27;s a lot of ethnolinguistic and postcolonial issues involved as well.')
