Maybe you should re-read that 400 page EULA you browsed past.<p>When you buy software you are agreeing that you don&#x27;t own that software. You are instead buying a license to <i>use</i> that software.<p>&gt; If the software does something I did not agree to at time of purchase, I&#x27;m going to hold the seller accountable.<p>When you buy software, you fundamentally agree that it is suitable for no particular purpose. Since much of the software you &quot;buy&quot; isn&#x27;t even something you&#x27;ve paid for, the vendor can shut off that hose whenever they want.<p>&gt; If the gardener you&#x27;re paying suddenly went and threw a painting in the trash because he considered it ugly you&#x27;d have a problem with them too.<p>I&#x27;m sure your agreement with your gardener looks quite different from the EULA you agree to when you use software.')
