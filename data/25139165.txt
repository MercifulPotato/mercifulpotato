FAANG companies are investing billions to teach people how to code and brand it as if it&#x27;s some noble humanitarian effort when it&#x27;s really just to further lower wages. When the time of FAANG companies <i>actually</i> offshoring key development teams comes (and it <i>is</i> coming), I have 0 faith the federal government will give a shit to protect US workers. So maybe a union is the best way to stop this.')
