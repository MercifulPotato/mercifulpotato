Beef and pork have relatively high fat content so you&#x27;d be unlikely to develop it from eating them in modern high protein diets, and even on a rabbit-only diet, it&#x27;s supposedly possible to minimize the risk by also consuming the animal&#x27;s organs.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I first heard of protein poisoning from a survivalist, who was talking about extreme scenarios where there&#x27;s very few calories available for consumption at all (e.g. winter survival in tundra)<p>There are certainly other well documented cases of nutritional deficiencies caused by lack of certain foodstuff (e.g. scurvy in ships in the 15th century, due to usage of copper ware, which denaturates vitamin c) so it wouldn&#x27;t be strange to develop other nutritional deficiencies with a highly unbalanced diet.')
