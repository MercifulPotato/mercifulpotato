They&#x27;re well aware of the cons, but the single pro of not being strapped to a desk outweighs all of the disadvantages for many people.<p>I&#x27;m using a MacBook Pro from 2014, after putting in a new battery recently it still works great, and when I&#x27;m at my desk I plug it into a big monitor. Not as upgradeable as a desktop, but even assuming I can&#x27;t sell the laptop when I upgrade it, it cost me less than $500 per year.<p>I&#x27;ve tried using multiple computers in the past (big desktop + MacBook Air, costs about the same in total as a 15&quot; MacBook Pro that is much less powerful than the desktop) but I realized that the convenience of knowing that all of my files are on one computer is more important to me.')
