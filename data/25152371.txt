That&#x27;s at least nominally why accredited, non-profit education is so expensive, because it&#x27;s nominally supposed to be capable of paying decent salaries to intelligent people dedicated to teaching, compared to say amazon or the gym where the incentives are to cost cut and maximize profit.<p>In reality, I suspect the same applies to colleges, but I don&#x27;t think it <i>should</i>, in some ideal world.')
