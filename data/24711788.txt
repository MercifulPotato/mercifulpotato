I read the first section and stopped. There is no new feature here. 5G boasts to bring better bandwidth. But is that really useful? Perhaps you can stream, movies and web meetings, faster. We can do this today, albeit a little slow.<p>The problem I face today, at present, is a fluctuating carrier signal. I get mostly 1-2 signal bars. The data signal changes from H to H+. (Since I have set it to accept only 3G signal).<p>I live in a grey area; the leeward side of a small hill. Beyond that hill is the town&#x27;s primary hospital. Without the vegetation, it might look like I live right in the middle of a (semi-moon) crater. The cell phone towers are on the outer periphery, servicing the hospital sides mainly. There is no scope of a tower coming inside this crater since it is a residential area.<p>So is this going to change when the current towers upgrade to 5G?<p>Legally people here are not allowed to retransmit a mobile carrier signal. There are many spurious products on Amazon India that claim they can boost signal strength. Several Indian youtubers, demonstrate they hacked something up to boost the signal...no science in it...all hogwash.<p>I am waiting for the day there is a solution to this. After that 5G is most welcome...')
