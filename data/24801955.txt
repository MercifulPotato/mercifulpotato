My boss wasn&#x27;t an engineer, he was a project manager, but that didn&#x27;t hinder him.  I think what made him successful was that he cared.  He&#x27;d say over and over, &quot;I&#x27;m not a developer, I need help understanding.&quot;  We would sit in a meeting and walk through problems. He was very calm and patient and acted genuinely interested in what the problem was.  He would ask questions about what he didn&#x27;t understand, and trust us on the things that we would say.  It was a great experience.  When we said we had a problem, he tried to understand and relay that to the necessary people.  When he couldn&#x27;t we&#x27;d accompany him to explain the details.')
