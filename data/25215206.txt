Is that typical?  That seems horrible.<p>The market rate for a captcha solution is 1-3 cents, which is clearly worth it, until you think of the ethics of paying someone slave wages so you can browse the internet slowly, but at least without breaking concentration.<p>Have you considered a more ethical approach, like micropayments that go to charity or something?')
