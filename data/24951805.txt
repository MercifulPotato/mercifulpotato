We see this with pretty much any disease. Even look at Zika virus - the US is concerned about it becoming endemic and focuses resources to combat it when it does pop up, yet we don&#x27;t do anything preventive like restrict travel nor institute mandatory travel quarantines. This used to be a standard practice for international travel to areas with known diseases. We probably need to bring this back. Basically the option is kill tourism in those areas or deal with extension treatment and containment programs - either one would be very costly. So for now, we do like always - we ignore it.')
