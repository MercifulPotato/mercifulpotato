To dabble with Ubuntu on the Windows Laptop in the WSL is surprisingly fast and satisfying. I also need the MS Office Suite constantly, so running purely on Linux is not an option.<p>Now the questions:<p>Would you shift from Win + WSL as a PHP developer back to Mac with the new machines? I find the 16GB RAM maximum a bit worrying!<p>I guess I would need to recompile PHP, Apache and MariaDB for the M1 to get some significant speed improvements instead of running on Rosetta 2?<p>I also like to state, that NOT firing up a virtual machine&#x2F;docker to run Apache&#x2F;MariaDB&#x2F;PHP locally is my preference ;-)<p>Any geek opinions on native MAMP environments beyond the usual Win&lt;&gt;Mac flames?')
