Not the crazy crossfit incarnation, instead classic ladders, intervals of pushups, pullups and some variations.\nAdditionally a plank before bedtime and some hiking (~2000km&#x2F;year) + deep squats to counteract sitting.<p>Most important is to find something you can make into a lasting habit (for years).
