I dont have a rolodex of statements but the theme was encouragement of the protests despite them turning into riots time and time again.  Thats specifically the reason they even went on for an entire summer.  Can look to twitter trends which were never&#x2F;rarely censored.  Flip side is &quot;walkaway&quot; is not even allowed.  Perhaps one example is AOC saying &quot;protests are made to make people uncomfortable&quot;  If T said something like that after Jan 6 what would the reaction have been?  Any sober person sees the double standard.  Dont fight me here I&#x27;m just pointing out why so many people are pissed.')
