These tools will let you navigate and launch shell on your container quickly. Very useful if you have tons of apps running in your node.<p>&gt; Tests taking 3:30 min to run with docker vs 30 secs without. And then of course, you don&#x27;t just run tests once but many times, leading to tens of minutes on a given day where I&#x27;m just twisting my thumbs.<p>In my case, I don&#x27;t use docker in development phase. I test in local environment and only build the images when it&#x27;s ready for deployment.<p>&gt; Having to even spend time learning how to debug Python code inside a locally running docker container.<p>I never had to do this anymore. I just hook sentry or newrelic and they&#x27;ll log exception stack traces that I can use to figure out the issue without live-debugging the app.<p>&gt; Having to deal with disk space issues caused by old docker images on my 500gb hdd.<p>Yes, disk usage is one of the drawback of using docker. It&#x27;s especially suck pruning images on busy servers with spinning rust. On ssd, pruning is not as slow though.')
