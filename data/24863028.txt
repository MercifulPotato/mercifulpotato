The most effective way for us to help deliver what customers want is to listen directly to their voluntary feedback. That helps us more deeply understand our customers through their individual stories and anecdotes, rather than looking at the averages that come from statistics and general surveys.<p>For Amazon Aurora, there are a lot of additional features in development, including offering Graviton2-powered instances. I expect that will deliver price and performance benefits for customers, but it&#x27;s not the only benefit that&#x27;s in the works.')
