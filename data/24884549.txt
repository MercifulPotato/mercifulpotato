OR it could be that it&#x27;s only somewhat uncommon but we don&#x27;t have enough events with sequencing data to confirm.<p>I can agree that 6 months of data says nothing about what immunity would be like after a year or two. But still, it&#x27;s hard to imagine how some tidal wave of reinfection remains currently undetected.<p>But let&#x27;s postulate that reinfection immunity only lasts 6 months. Ironically, that means that lockdowns and isolation will <i>prevent</i> herd immunity. To stop the disease, everyone would need to get infected within that 6 month window.')
