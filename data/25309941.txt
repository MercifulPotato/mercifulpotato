Jeff&#x27;s quoted email states that part of the issue was that Timnit&#x27;s paper &quot;ignored too much relevant research&quot;, without specifically saying whether the unmentioned relevant research was done by Google.<p>But the parent comment to which I responded, and which I quoted, specifically said the problem was to criticize google while working for google, and seemed to approve that this should be judged unacceptable.<p>&gt; I get the impression that she wrote a hit piece on Google and published with Google&#x27;s name. For me, it&#x27;s correct they demand a retraction.<p>The &quot;regardless of who&#x27;s doing the work&quot; part is key, and not all participants in this conversation are on the same page about it.')
