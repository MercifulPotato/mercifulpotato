One of the big challenges in presenting Flash <i>well</i> is &quot;conflation artifacts,&quot; which are the seams that appear when compositing antialiased vector shapes. The old software renderer in Flash had very clever techniques for avoiding these, but browser 2D renderers generally don&#x27;t. (The actual story is a bit more complex, as Skia is careful to avoid conflation artifacts within a shape, but the compositing rules in the HTML5 spec almost seem to require them for compositing multiple shapes). Thus, Shumway and the other Flash emulators had artifacts which detracted from the visual quality.<p>A particularly good paper explaining the problem (and how the NV_path_rendering extension solves it) is &quot;GPU-accelerated Path Rendering&quot;, Kilgard and Bolz, 2012.<p>Does Ruffle solve these? If so, how?')
