But the citizen in the article we&#x27;re all discussing is a journalist, not a gunman. The other famous example of a US citizen targeted for a lethal military strike, Anwar Al-Awlaki, was also in a role that did not personally involve direct engagement in physical violence.<p>Nothing I&#x27;m saying is defending the actions of the citizens in question, only criticizing the propriety of the executive branch unilaterally killing a US citizen without due process outside of situations like your hypothetical where dangerous direct physical violence against American forces is involved. If the government had instead forcibly arrested them and kept them in custody while putting them through the criminal justice system, I&#x27;d have no criticism, assuming they had adequate evidence. I&#x27;d also want them to release the accused in the unlikely event of an acquittal (since government accusations can be wrong), but the regular courts are very good at convicting people who actually do stuff like this and federal prosecutors are very good at their role.')
