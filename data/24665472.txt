But one thing I find sorely lacking &amp; so far irreplaceable is the spontaneous interactions that used to happen. You know, water cooler talk, catching up with a friend you run into, side conversations before a meeting etc.<p>I was toying around with the idea of an app that can help you &quot;bump into&quot; your coworkers again, but only when you&#x27;re on break &amp; want to chat. I was curious if people even had this problem in the first place?')
