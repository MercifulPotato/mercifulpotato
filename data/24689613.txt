Free driver-assist has a &quot;tragedy of the commons&quot; problem, or a moral hazard, where there is no cost to over-using it and courting a collision event, so this overall risk can be reduced by metering its use.<p>Also, yes, the system should be safe enough to text while using it. That&#x27;s what &quot;self driving car&quot; should mean. Another criteria would be that a person should be able to use it with a blood alcohol level higher than is legal today as well, and that it absolves people of an &quot;impaired driving&quot; charge. \nThere is a division between driver assist and full autonomous self driving, but these are features that could be pay per use based on relative actuarial risk.<p>To people who say you can&#x27;t put a price on human life, clearly you do not have auto insurance?')
