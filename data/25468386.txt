The repeated delays were already hinting that the CDPR was in trouble and couldn&#x27;t cope with the workload. When they finally committed to a deadline to release in December, it seemed more out of desperation to appease the impatient public than an indication that they were nearly done with finishing the game.<p>So they released it in, as you said, its buggy alpha state. At least I trust CDPR to do right by its players and see the game to completion.')
