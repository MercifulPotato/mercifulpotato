Item(by='dividedbyzero', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611831279, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25940166, text='&gt; We are in the process of birthing, bootstrapping, giving autonomy to beings who are relative to us in power as we are to insects. We can barely even form a concept of just how much of us they can see, and to what extent they know our thoughts and actions.<p>We are nowhere near that. Just getting AI to perform at the level of an actual insect would be a huge achievement (but then, how would we know we&#x27;re there?), scaling from that will require a whole bunch of big breakthroughs in a whole bunch of fields.<p>But I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll have to worry at all about a hypothetical AI singularity if we don&#x27;t get a much better handle on our impact on the world we are a part of, and quick. Because we&#x27;re in the midst of a mass extinction of geological dimensions, and if our limited understanding of past extinction events is any guide, this will get ugly way beyond any scenario I&#x27;ve seen discussed in the mainstream, and possibly quite abruptly. We&#x27;re not prepared, and we&#x27;re hugely vulnerable.<p>Yet we, as a collective, don&#x27;t seem to &quot;get&quot; this beyond some very abstract recognition that most people brush aside as alarmism or &quot;can&#x27;t do anything about it anyway&quot;. I&#x27;ve talked to a whole bunch of people who, in essence, are kinda happy with all this; mostly warmer weather, less nasty insects, what&#x27;s not to like? To me, that&#x27;s wayyy scary.')
