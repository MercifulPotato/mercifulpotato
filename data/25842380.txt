Then the violence was justified because &quot;they rushed the stage&quot; - which they didn&#x27;t. Now it&#x27;s OK to advocate assault because someone is peacefully protesting?<p>You are outright lying about what I said. I said that the &quot;violence&quot; called for in the article linked wasn&#x27;t any more than kicking disruptors out of a private event with force (something justified in that case), and the exact words I used were *IN ONE CASE* regarding the stage-rushing incident. It&#x27;s up thread for all to see.<p>The fact that you have to lie to make your point means that this conversation is over. I stand by my original point that the original march was legitimate, and that Trump told the crowd to go home. Trump DID NOT tell any of those assembled to storm the capitol, violently or otherwise, and to insist that he did is a further lie.')
