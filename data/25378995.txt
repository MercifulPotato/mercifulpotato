It clearly can&#x27;t be forever, since any non-zero dollar amount * infinity months is infinity dollars, which is going to reduce the budget below zero since any non-infinite number minus infinity is less than zero... thus locking it immediately.<p>Even if we say &quot;you get N months of storage before we delete it&quot; and subtract N * current storage cost&#x2F;month, what happens after you&#x27;re locked out of all actions because you added an extra GB? Storage APIs cost money to use, so you would get locked out of those too (note that if you&#x27;re not, people would set arbitrarily low limits and get storage access for free) and couldn&#x27;t retrieve anything. The only remaining actions are delete (which is free) or raise the quota and do the whole rodeo over again.<p>Abuse is impossible to ignore at public cloud scale, so &quot;free storage forever&quot; (or even, storage at a one time fixed price) as the fallback isn&#x27;t a viable option.<p>Lastly, from an optics perspective, which blog post would you rather see on the front page of HN: &quot;I did something dumb and spent too much money on Cloud&quot; or &quot;Google is holding our data hostage&quot; (or &quot;Google deleted all my data&quot;)?<p>Source: I launched Firebase Storage, which has a GCS bucket that has a hard limit.')
