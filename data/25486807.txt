Look at modern Intel processors and you&#x27;ll see that the decoder takes as much die area as the entire Integer ALU (if you don&#x27;t count caches). Unlike the ALU which powergates unused ports, the decoder almost never turns off.<p>The more 1-to-1 your translations to uops are, the less power and die area you need to spend decoding them. In addition, less complex translations means fewer pipeline stages needed for the same design which also has lots of ramifications.')
