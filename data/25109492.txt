I run 5 linux computers at home for various ends and I got tired of putting a new Ubuntu on them every now and then. At the time I looked at manjaro, other rolling distros couldn&#x27;t even survive an update from the latest installation media to current (sidux). Arch is&#x2F;was a hobby in itself and the opposite of what I was seeking, but it is an excellent foundation. Manjaro has kept these 5 machines for over 5 years through every possible update and it never broke them. Kernel switching is a joy. Driver installing switching is a joy. This is a very tall order.<p>That said I do hope endeavouros or others can fill Manjaro&#x27;s immense boots.')
