It could be the county I&#x27;m in, the county the subject lives in, the county the video was uploaded in (unlikely), or the county where Google hosts the video.<p>- draft the subpoena and get it reviewed by whichever judge&#x2F;magistrate applies.<p>- wait who knows how long for the subpoena response, hopefully it comes back with the real video and important content.<p>- face defense arguments in court that my subpoena was improperly obtained&#x2F;submitted')
