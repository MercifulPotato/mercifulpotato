Item(by='timerol', descendants=None, kids=[24722892, 24722675, 24722698], score=None, time=1602183267, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24721118, text='Does anyone know enough about Stripe&#x27;s product lines to comment on what the following paragraph means?<p>&quot;My view on Stripe’s business prior to joining was “Stripe is basically a B2B SaaS company with extremely reliable capture of upside when users succeed.” I believe that substantially underappreciates the actual business. Large portions of Stripe’s business add another loop on top of the B2B SaaS loop, where Stripe is effectively indexing on its ability to grow the count and success of customers who are themselves structurally equivalent to B2B SaaS companies.&quot;<p>The &quot;reliable capture of upside when users succeed&quot; seems to be referring to the fees charged by Stripe. More revenue for the user means more revenue for Stripe as well. I don&#x27;t know what the &quot;effectively indexing&quot; sentence refers to. Is there a network effect at play here, where being on Stripe encourages a user&#x27;s customers and suppliers to also be on Stripe? Or is there a product offering that somehow creates that effect?<p>And then there&#x27;s another loop mentioned later, which is presumably a product in development, and not something  anyone involved with can comment on. (But I would love to hear about it if you could.)')
