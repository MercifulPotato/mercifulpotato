In other words: no 16&quot; w&#x2F; the M1 is an acknowledgment that configurations with 32gb (and hopefully 64gb) of RAM are not ready, and it would be unreasonable to release the highest end MBP without those options available.<p>Hopefully we&#x27;ll see the 13&quot; and 16&quot; MBPs with M1+ and more RAM next Spring.')
