The app support just isn&#x27;t there yet, and the emulation is not nearly as good as the emulation on macOS. I&#x27;ve been tracking major app and development platform updates [1], and while there is forward momentum, all the pieces aren&#x27;t quite there for many apps to offer ARM versions. Many Windows apps use Windows Presentation Framework, and ARM support isn&#x27;t available yet (currently scheduled for the first half of next year). Apps like 1Password and Affinity Photo are waiting for that update to enable them to offer ARM versions.<p>Hopefully by the end of next year developers will have no excuse not to offer ARM versions.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iswindowsonarmready.netlify.app&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iswindowsonarmready.netlify.app&#x2F;</a>')
