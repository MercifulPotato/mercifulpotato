Prompts are italicized<p><i>&gt; You open your browser to hacker news and find an article at the top of the page with the headline &quot;Raspberry Pi 4 V3DV graphics driver achieves Vulkan 1.0 conformance&quot;. You think to yourself:</i><p>&quot;I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t know this before. This is going to be so much easier now!<p><i>&gt; You immediately go grab your Raspberry Pi and plug it in...</i><p>You turn on your PC and get your Raspberry Pi ready. You power on the device and immediately you have a successful boot no issues from there. You navigate to the folder with the vk.<p><i>&gt; &quot;VK&quot; you remember, was the directory where you were conducting your vulkan 1.0 driver tests, but now that full conformance has been announced you realize:</i><p>&quot;Now I can start working on a vulkan 1.0 conforming game engine!!!&quot; You copy and paste the contents of the folder you made in step 2 into a new folder called &quot;Boom&quot;<p><i>&gt; You&#x27;ve been waiting to work on this for a while... You open a file called vk_1.c and begin typing in the code:</i><p><pre><code>  VK_ DECLARE_STATIC_DNS_FUNCTIONS;\n  VK_DECLARE_FORMAT_SIDES_IN_DEPTH_P3;\n  VK_DECLARE_SERIAL_BITMAP_TYPE;\n  VK_DECLARE_PATCHABLE_BUFFER_PIXELS;\n  VK_DECLARE_PATCHABLE_STENCIL_PIXEL;\n  VK_DECLARE_PATCHABLE_STENCIL_DIMENSIONS;</code></pre>\nVulkan is a very powerful graphics API, but it&#x27;s probably one of the most cryptic, especially since they seem to be fond of using ambiguous names for things. You&#x27;ll have to look up all these obscure APIs you&#x27;re declaring at the beginning of the file.')
