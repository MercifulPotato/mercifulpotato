Item(by='AtroxDev', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610216514, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25700135, text='project: postcard.zone (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;postcard.zone" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;postcard.zone</a>), its a simple way to send a postcard to any address of your liking with fully customizable front and back of the postcard itself.<p>A long time on my todo list to make more out of it. It works as-is but I&#x27;m not happy with the current editor and some other things. Still, it gets some use on occasion which is nice :)')
