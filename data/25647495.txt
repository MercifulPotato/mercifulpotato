Automattic sat too long, let third-parties come in and solve a critical user experience problem, and now theyâ€™re reaping those consequences. When Gutenberg shipped, we had to install Classic Editor on hundreds of websites that were all running third-party builders. Some of those third-party builder sites even broke in the Gutenberg release, and we had to rollback core because of incompatibility.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I actually like building in Gutenberg and have done a few Gutenberg projects (using ACF Blocks [1]). But convincing clients&#x2F;users to migrate from third-party builder that has locked-in content with advanced features like columns, modals, show&#x2F;hide content, responsive show&#x2F;hide controls, animation, effects, and a whole host of other various bells and whistles was just a nonstarter.
