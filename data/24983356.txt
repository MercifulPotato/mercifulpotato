The core type theory assumes that all functions are terminating. You can &#x27;cheat in&#x27; full recursion by providing a non-computational termination proof, but the type checker would still be assuming that its actually terminating.<p>I think if that wasn&#x27;t the case, it&#x27;d need to be restricted (unless you did something really weird like introducing infinite negative universe levels).')
