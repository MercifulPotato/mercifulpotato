Pencil, pen, hole punch, what&#x27;s the difference? It is a mark on a physical piece of paper.<p>I think you&#x27;re trying to work your solution into being correct rather than recognizing that the problem itself is extremely complicated. Given your other comments and our other conversations it is clear that you&#x27;re overly simplifying the subject matter and frankly you are wrong about certain aspects of it (like that all votes are counted the night of rather than &quot;enough&quot;). If you flat out ignore these parts of the problem then you&#x27;re going to get the wrong result. You should also not start with a solution and work towards an explanation, but rather work the other way around. These conversations feel really disingenuous to be honest. They feel more like they are based on how the UK is so much better without any real justification.')
