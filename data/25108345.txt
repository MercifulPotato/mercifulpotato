It couldn&#x27;t do anything that a Nomad couldn&#x27;t. The part that it did well (and that he missed the importance of) was the usability and polish.<p>&gt; Compared to existing satellite ISPs you get dramatically better latency and dramatically faster&#x2F;easier setup (no professional installation required, plug and play in 5 minutes). It&#x27;s also likely to be far cheaper if you actually transfer a decent amount of data, and early tests seem to show better reliability in poor weather as well.<p>All true, but can you see HN caring about any of that if SpaceX wasn&#x27;t involved? The HN userbase is overwhelmingly city folk; I suspect only a tiny proportion of us have ever used satellite internet before.')
