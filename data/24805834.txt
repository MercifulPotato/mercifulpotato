The proper generalization which covers that case is that a function has an ordered list of return types. A function returning nothing has an empty such list: a zero-length list of return types.<p>Under this model, we don&#x27;t require any unit type or bottom type or anything of the sort in connection with functions that don&#x27;t return anything.<p>Note that this is similar to a parameter list: an empty return value list is similar to an empty parameter list, in which there are no parameters and hence no parameter types at all.<p>This model can be applied to single-value return languages like C, if we pretend that functions return multiple values, restricted to the zero or one plurality.')
