Item(by='sdwolfz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603302316, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24849452, text='I&#x27;ve been using Multi Account Containers for a while now (years probably) and they do provide good value but things can still be improved. What I think Firefox lacks right now is good UX around switching profiles. Sure `about:profiles` works, but it&#x27;s hard to access, looks ugly, and prone to miss-clicking.<p>Here is my workflow:<p>- Normal browsing: not logged in, no containers.<p>- YouTube: have an &quot;Entertainment&quot; container for it and use it logged out since Google signs you on all their property, and I don&#x27;t want to mix my entertainment history with my educational history.<p>- Social media: have a &quot;Social&quot; container where I access all the data harvesters.<p>- Logged in: For anything that I need to be signed up, a &quot;Personal&quot; container, so I can check my email in peace.<p>- Work: here&#x27;s the catch, this needs it&#x27;s own profile. Since &quot;YouTube&quot; is set to always open in the &quot;Entertainment&quot; account, and I don&#x27;t want work related videos pop up when relaxing, and vice-versa, I can switch profiles and have everything completely isolated in my &quot;Work&quot; profile. And in case I need to, I can set up more containers in this profile. Also there are different add-ons I need for my own setup compared to work, or the same add-on with different configuration. So just containers won&#x27;t do here.<p>My point is, if Firefox had a profile switcher as easy to use as Chromium had, my life would be way better. Profiles and Containers seem to complement each other. They just need a truckload of polish.<p>Some things that annoy me right now:<p>- There is no dedicated UI for profile CRUD. And an add-on won&#x27;t work for this since it needs to be available and enabled by default across profiles.<p>- &quot;Reopen in container&quot; opens a new tab instead of replacing the current.<p>- Having keybindings for the two above would be extremely useful.<p>- For some reason, Firefox lacks the functionality to change the ordering of stuff (in general, but more specifically profiles and containers). The creation order is all you get.<p>- A quick way to do &quot;clear cookies&#x2F;data in this container only&quot; so I don&#x27;t need to delete&#x2F;recreate the container and mess up my ordering (which I can not change). Also clear data for non container use without clearing data in containers. Basically treating non container use as a &quot;Default&quot; container.<p>- All of the above I wish came by default with Firefox and not from an add-on. My honest opinion is that they are crucial functionality and deserve to be made aesthetically pleasing and available for everyone to use.')
