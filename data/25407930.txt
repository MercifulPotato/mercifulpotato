Programmers who just do whatever they get told like marching ants end up shooting an organization in the foot long term.<p>You have to develop an opinion of the thing you&#x27;re building&#x2F;maintaining and what it should be able to do and not do. You can&#x27;t count on project managers to do that.<p>The trick to doing this effectively is to find out the problem the feature is <i>actually</i> trying to solve and providing a better solution.<p>Usually the request is from end users of software and they have identified the problem (we need to do xyz) and prescribed a solution (put the ability to do xyz in a modal on this page.) But if you can look to what other software has done, do a UX review and find a way to add a feature in that solves their problem in a way that makes sense in the larger context of the software, they won&#x27;t have a problem with it since it solves their problem and the codebase will take less of a hit.<p>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a lot easier to just add the modal without complaint.')
