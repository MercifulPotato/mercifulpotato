I make it a point to disable all cookies (barring the strictly necessary ones), partners and also the &quot;Legitimate Interest&quot; section, where I click &quot;Object all&quot;, and then click &quot;Save and exit&quot;.<p>However, on many websites I don&#x27;t see any option to &quot;reject&quot; or &quot;object&quot; to cookies, partners, vendors and especially legitimate interest. Particularly concerned about Legitimate Interest since the number of vendors there is humongous.A good example of a site where we cannot choose would be the BBC[1]. We get an option only to read their terms and conditions but no option to reject and object.<p>1) Can anyone please guide how to reject to cookies on such sites where they don&#x27;t have a reject option present?<p>Also, in my iOS, in Safari settings, I have chosen &quot;Block all cookies&quot; to yes.<p>2) How far will blocking all cookies safeguard me from unscrupulous cookies? If my blocking all cookies is enabled in safari settings and suppose I visit some malicious site and accept their cookies, would the owners of malicious site be able to do anything sinister or adversarial to my privacy and integrity? Will the be able to breach my security?<p>Ref. â†’\n[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;</a>')
