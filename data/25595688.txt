When you say greek heritage, I assume ancient greece, I don&#x27;t assume ottoman empire. When you say turkish heritage, I think central asian steppes and ottoman empire. Last I checked, the ottoman empire was a turkish empire, not a greek one.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s just the language difference. For example, nobody here would say the native americans and non-native americans have the same heritage. We&#x27;ve been living with natives for hundreds of years, but certainly american heritage stems from britain while native american heritage doesn&#x27;t. You&#x27;d be mocked ( a la Elizabeth Warren ) or canceled if you claimed american native heritage when you are not native american.<p>Seems like a lot of people are upset for no reason. But when politics and identity are involved, that&#x27;s just what happens.')
