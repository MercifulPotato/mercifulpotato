Told another way, a firm in the marketplace for pasta found that a competitor was out of regulation with their product, and they found a person in congress who could press a slow-moving and ineffective agency to do better at doing their job: enforcing said regulations.<p>That&#x27;s exactly what you want your elected representatives to do: listen to their constituents and act accordingly to ensure a fair outcome according to the law. Note that no laws were changed in this to favor one company over another, if anything the previous state was one in which the company in question was profiting from shipping out-of-regulation product, perhaps at decreased cost compared to in-compliance firms.<p>The rule itself can be debated, but in general I find that a law specifying in exact numbers what a product should contain in order to qualify for a label to be a very good law. It&#x27;s exact, it&#x27;s measurable, and it&#x27;s achievable by all. Fair and equal enforcement should make it a good regulation.<p>If you say &quot;well you don&#x27;t need this law, it&#x27;s over-regulation&quot;, that&#x27;s a good argument -- I&#x27;m not sure I have an opinion on that. On one hand, I think Standard of Identification make a lot of sense, but I also know that drawing the lines can be a very delicate art form (what makes a pasta noodle vs. a ramen noodle? What makes champagne vs. sparkling wine? And so on)<p>Edit: Also, I think a lot of this could be dealt with better by an FDA that has a good communication arm. &quot;We found this company to not be compliance with existing law and took it off the shelves&quot; sounds a lot better than having the company get to print saying &quot;Seems like a hold up by the FDA&quot;')
