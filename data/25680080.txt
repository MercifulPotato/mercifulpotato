Item(by='jblake', descendants=2, kids=[25680153], score=2, time=1610068282, title='Managing an S-Corp (after switching from a Sole prop)', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I moved to Nevada (from Cali) in August and opened a Nevada LLC in November. I&#x27;m all set up on Payroll (using Gusto) and believe I have that figured out. I just sent in Form 2553 to the IRS. I have a few questions I&#x27;m hoping someone can help with!<p>1. I capitalized the LLC with $2,100 (mostly to avoid Chase fees) and want pay myself back. Should I account for this as a simple loan and transfer it back? So it&#x27;s not counted as income.<p>2. I filed the LLC in Nov to give myself time to open up all the accounts and stuff and was careful not to do any &quot;business&quot; for the remainder of the year under the new LLC, hoping to avoid filing a return (I will only file my personal return for 2020). Is that correct? In form 2553 I entered the effective date as Jan 1 2021.<p>3. How do I distribute extra earnings outside of Payroll? I can simply transfer the money between my Chase accounts, right... the important thing is how to account for that dividend on both form 1120S and my personal return? I am careful to only pay my payroll through Gusto.<p>I know y&#x27;all will say hire an accountant or whatever, but I&#x27;ve managed pretty well doing this stuff myself. I was CLOSE to doing EFTPS payroll payments myself... but Gusto (so far) is money well spent ($25&#x2F;mo).')
