I remember reading about a boy who had a seed get blown into his eye and it sprouted.<p>When I used to be active on CF lists, someone got the bright idea to inhale some kind of oil using their nebulizer and ended up with pneumonia. You can readily google &quot;oil induced pneumonia&quot; and get articles about <i>lipoid pneumonia</i>. It&#x27;s a well known phenomenon that inhaling fats or oils blocks the lungs and can cause pneumonia.<p>The reason we don&#x27;t like people doing self experimentation is because a lot of people know shockingly little about how their body works and do damn little in the way of due diligence to look stuff up beforehand. I have difficulty imagining that I would inject any kind of fungus into my body for any reason.<p>That&#x27;s just not a good way to extract the active ingredient he was looking to ingest, which can be ingested orally just fine from what I gather.<p>And I don&#x27;t think we would be calling him a hero.
