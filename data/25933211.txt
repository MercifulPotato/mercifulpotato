The mushroom spirit (or whatever you want to call it) lucidly explained how I was wasting my life on those websites. The next day I quit, and its been years now, though I def felt withdrawals for a few weeks being off of twitter. Now it&#x27;s like I was never even there.<p>I feel so bad for all of the young people who can&#x27;t understand, due to peer pressure, just how bad it is for them. And shame on parents for not making more of an effort to ask questions.')
