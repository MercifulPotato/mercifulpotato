Item(by='beagle3', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606992879, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25274417, text='&gt;  As of right now, I end up with discussions spread across email, SMS, phone, and an issue tracking system (Redmine).<p>That&#x27;s likely going to stay that way, because there are people on both ends, not machines. They&#x27;ll write an FB messenger note about &quot;coming with us to lunch?, oh, btw, we found an interesting bug in xyz, you really need to frobnicate the belzebubs&quot;; And then they&#x27;ll send you an SMS while driving (because their in-car system is older), &quot;oh, and the original fix doesn&#x27;t fix the bug&quot;.<p>This is a people problem, not a technical problem. It takes discipline, but at an old job I simply refused to respond to anything that wasn&#x27;t filed in Jitterbug (ultra-low-ceremony issue tracking from the Samba project). And as a result, all was tracked properly.<p>Now that people have phones that take pictures and whatsapp, they take screenshots and send them to me, and I have no better workflow to offer, so I do accept those issues as well.<p>I suspect no piece of infrastructure will be the ultimate thing. What you described above will likely make a difference only if it can only receive SMS, WhatsApp, FB Messenger, and somehow do it without requiring your users to call&#x2F;message&#x2F;email a different address.')
