I discovered this by accident after porting one of my Matlab programs to Python and noticed an immediate 4x speed improvement. I worked with both for many more years afterward and in my experience Python was usually faster with a few exceptions.<p>That said, Matlab had great tech support and the sales rep was always super helpful. They were much nicer to work with than say National Instruments.')
