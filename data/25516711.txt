The only time you were allowed to replace a thing was when it was irredeemably broken.&quot;<p>That just sounds like common sense to me. Why replace a washing machine that still works just fine? For some gimmicky features or a shiny modern industrial design?<p>I fall firmly in the camp of not replacing stuff that works, clothes that still fit and aren&#x27;t worn out, anything that still serves its purpose. Obviously I will repair or modify things to the extent of my skills to keep them going, clothes and computers are what I&#x27;m best at.<p>My TV is a 42&quot; LG LCD that I picked up for $20 ages ago when my company was moving to a new office building. It works perfectly, supports 1080p and the picture quality is good after the usual adjustments I would have to do on a new TV anyway. None of the new TVs I can buy offer any real tangible improvements that make them worth the additional cost.<p>Sure, when this TV eventually breaks, I&#x27;ll probably replace it with one that&#x27;s slightly larger, 50-55&quot; would be ideal for the space I have on the wall. But there&#x27;s no need to rush that upgrade.<p>Consumerism has broken people&#x27;s brains, they&#x27;re stuck in an eternal loop of trying to keep up with the Joneses, never happy with what they already have. It&#x27;s unhealthy and wasteful.')
