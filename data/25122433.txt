I&#x27;m the &quot;git guy&quot; at work and can always fix people&#x27;s problems and never have to resort to delete and reclone. But I don&#x27;t use the CLI. I use magit. Using git is just doing operations on the DAG. Git&#x27;s DAG is the most elegant implementation of a version control system that I&#x27;ve used. But the CLI is awful. It makes no sense. Other Git GUIs make this even worse by adding yet another layer on top of the already bad CLI. What you need is a new porcelain, like magit.')
