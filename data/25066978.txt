It&#x27;s the best solution IMO. You can listen to your whole collection at the quality you want on basically every platform. A fork of pSub is what I use a primary CLI player for it, but the mobile apps are also great. You can cache music locally, so I like to queue up a few albums before I leave the house (not that I do that often nowadays) so I can listen to them while driving without using any precious mobile data.')
