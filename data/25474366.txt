What is naive here, is that you think things are the way there are, for no reason.<p>&gt; Mail is decades old, built upon millions of hours of work crafting software, RFC standards, and works the way it does, including bounces, to ensure stability.<p>Same people argue that email is a hot mess exactly because it&#x27;s decades old and comprised of a patchwork of standards. It&#x27;s not exactly the poster child of how to do this sort of thing well.<p>&gt; For a mail system to respond with 5xx, when it is internally broken, is 100% a configuration issue. Every MTA on the planet, is designed (eg, postfix, sendmail, etc) to respond with a 4xx TEMP fail message if something is borked. A milter gone bad. A library missing. A full disk. A config issue. An issue forking. Memory limits. All of it.<p>Configuration issues can be, and often are, temporary. Also, bugs are a thing.<p>&gt; THAT is where the &quot;good engineering&quot; failed.<p>I agree with this.<p>&gt; What you want to do is make 5xx like 4xx, because you feel there should never be any way for a SMTP server to say &quot;No, really, this email address doesn&#x27;t exist.. don&#x27;t bother trying again&quot;.<p>Of course there&#x27;s a semantic difference between &quot;come back later&quot; and &quot;go away forever&quot;, I&#x27;m just arguing that a client that doesn&#x27;t blindly trust what every connected system tells it is going to more often successfully achieve its goals than one which does.')
