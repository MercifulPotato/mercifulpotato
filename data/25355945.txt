Could possibly try and fix it, however this is not something I want to mess with right now so currently using WSL v2 and Docker on Windows 10 and not having any problems.  It is nice to be able to add 2&#x2F;4&#x2F;8gb of storage and 128gb of ram for dirt cheap, something that is not possible with a mac though.')
