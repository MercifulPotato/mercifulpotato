If this were an occasional thing, sure, accidents happen. But this has become the modus operandi of what once was the paper of record.<p>Between the absolute backpedaling of the 1619 Project, copious amounts of Russian influence narrative, and countless &quot;anonymous sources&quot; that turn out to be nobodies or absent integrity, the NYT is an embarrassment to journalism.<p>They do what you described, though: they build in back doors into their reporting so they can legitimately claim that they weren&#x27;t &quot;wrong&quot; on a purely logical--but functionally bullsh*t--standing.<p>No, I don&#x27;t believe they deserve &quot;praise&quot; for &quot;courage and integrity&quot;, because they&#x27;ve left those--and other markers of high character--in the past as they cry their death throes in the changing media landscape.')
