Item(by='justinlloyd', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603997376, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24929726, text='I went to college in &#x27;88 or &#x27;89 and one of my teachers showed me the 1&#x2F;89 trick, along with a few others, e.g. 1&#x2F;7, and so forth. My teacher claimed to have been shown the various tricks by one of his teachers back in the &#x27;60s.<p>In the same period I &quot;discovered&quot; an error detection technique which is commonly known as Hamming codes. I would never dare to claim I invented them or discovered them.<p>In &#x27;92 and &#x27;93, I was heavily in to the BBS scene, some people had 56K modems, others had 14.4K. With verifiable evidence of written notes and digital artifacts (a BBS door and protocol for AmiBBS and Citadel and a couple of others) , I created a technique whereby multiple peers with low-bandwidth connections could transfer small fragments of a  larger dataset to a peer with a lot of bandwidth.<p>If you were heavily in to the warez scene and&#x2F;or part of Fate, it is probably you made use of this protocol to transfer pirated software between FTP sites. A warehousing server would tell each peer who had what part of a piece of data, and any peer could make requests for any piece of the data from any other peer who happened to have a copy of that data. Today, a very similar protocl is commonly known as BitTorrent.<p>I would not say I &quot;discovered&quot; or &quot;invented&quot; the protocol as my work was based on the various X-, Y- &amp; Z- modem protocols. There was a TCP&#x2F;IP packet to -Modem packet translator so that a BBS talking over that new fangled internet thing could take advantage of  a T1 (1.5Mbps) connection for instance, which really helped with spreading the warez around the various FTP sites by the couriers.<p>I doubt the veracity of the claim by the author to have &quot;discovered it as original&quot; in 1994 before anybody else.')
