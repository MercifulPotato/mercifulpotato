Most companies do not pay dividends... and a stock price going up and being sold by some investor literally has nothing to do with your company.<p>In fact, the stock price is largely irrelevant to your company. It&#x27;s only relevant to those who own the stock.<p>&gt; I would have preferred it if my company would have used less predatory means of getting that money, something like taking a loan or simply saving up part of the profits for any future investments.<p>Issuing stock is basically a loan that they never have to pay back if they do not want to. They can always buy back their stock if they no longer feel it&#x27;s worth while being a public company.<p>FWIW, publicly traded companies have earned far more everyday working people comfortable retirements and more, than any single privately-held company.')
