I’m sure it exists.  It’s just that Twitter is popular.  Regulations that make something like the-Twitter-we-actually-have illegal are a step in the wrong direction.  Twitter was started by human beings with certain values and goals, like making it easier to tell your friends what you are up to, and making money.
