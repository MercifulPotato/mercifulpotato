Unless there is some other path to conversion of the fusion energy to &quot;useful&quot; energy, this heat is the primary mechanism: you drive a heat exchanger, to drive a turbine, to make electricity. This is what we want: excess heat, to drive a turbine.<p>Clearly, <i>this</i> tokomak isn&#x27;t going to make net positive contribution to energy delivery. Some future (30 years?) tokomak is meant to do it.<p>I do get that for an experiment, &quot;extracting&quot; the heat is what its all about.<p>(Happy to be put right by wiser heads, if there is some other path to useful energy out from fusion)')
