Computers are very fragile, and have been my whole career. How many of us here make good money just keeping up with all the patches and fixes and defenses needed to make sure a modern system stays safe?<p>Of course, some deep technological revolution might change that eventually. But in that case we still shouldn&#x27;t rush to shift to a digital-only elections system. Why? Because it doesn&#x27;t just have to work. Voters have to have confidence in the system. And that system isn&#x27;t just technical, it&#x27;s social.<p>Everybody understands paper. Everybody understand marking paper. Everybody understands manually counting marks on paper and adding up numbers. Further, everybody has intuitions on how to protect and defend that process by making sure the right people are present. People do generally accept machine counting of paper ballots, because they don&#x27;t see that as much different, and because they know a manual count can be done if there are problems.<p>However technically clever and perfect some blockchain system is, it just doesn&#x27;t have the simplicity and robustness in the face of attack or failure that  we need. And it especially doesn&#x27;t provide the social validation of what is essentially a social result.')
