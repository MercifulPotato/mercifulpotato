That isn&#x27;t to discount or lessen the difficulties minorities and women have in tech companies; those are substantial and significant. But if someone in a diversity role is slighted, the natural place to jump is a diversity motive; its far more likely that the company just doesn&#x27;t give a shit about anyone.<p>And that&#x27;s true of nearly every company. It was immature for us, as a community, to believe big tech would be any different than any other megacorp. They say they care about diversity, inclusion, and people; they don&#x27;t. They don&#x27;t care about any individual. Companies, as a collective intelligence, care about two things: Money and Self-Preservation (in that order).<p>That being said, I totally support the fight that people like Timnit are fighting; they&#x27;re fighting for the recognition of humanity, through the lens of diversity and inclusion, a critical component of a much larger fight intrinsic to a capitalistic society. That&#x27;s the value of a hire like this; its just the unimaginably unfortunate case that this value hasn&#x27;t been realized at Google, and probably never will.')
