In the US this data is stored for 2-5 years minimum depending on which Telco you use. It is used and sold just like in this article.<p>Tracking is how cell phones and cell basestations work. You cannot have one without the other. The better the clocks in the base stations the better the multilateration accuracy. It&#x27;s already well under &lt;100m.
