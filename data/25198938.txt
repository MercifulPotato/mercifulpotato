My general suggestion if someone wants to buy new is an Audio-Technica LP 120X turntable and a pair of Klipsh R-51M bookshelf speakers. The 120x has most of the features a newbie will want&#x2F;need, and the speakers are fairly low priced while still sounding pretty good (although they&#x27;re not quite as punchy on the bass as I&#x27;d personally like). The setup will probably run around $500, but the turntable won&#x27;t make mincemeat of your records like a cheapo Crosley.<p>Of course, the real answer is to find vintage equipment at a local audio place, but that isn&#x27;t always easy for newbs and is a bit dependent on your local music nerd community.')
