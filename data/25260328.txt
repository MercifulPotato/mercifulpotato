I could see problems, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t &quot;turning into a dump&quot; at that point.<p>Your argument seems to basically be, once the high-salaried tech workers leave, the city will get worse. But as far as I can tell, the <i>presence</i> of the high-salaried tech workers has been making the city worse over the last decade, and if you think it&#x27;s anywhere near &quot;a dump,&quot; I think a lot of people will be glad to get back the SF of years past (such as the SF of a couple of years before I arrived, before the second startup boom, before modern venture capital existed, before Uber and Airbnb, during the recession and the dot-com bust - the SF about which people like me said, I&#x27;d like to move there).')
