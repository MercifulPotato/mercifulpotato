The two fatal flaws Piketty makes are 1) he models a zero-sum world where wealth is fixed, and 2) doesn&#x27;t take into account taxes &amp; transfers.<p>From the IMF research:<p><i>Using a sample of 19 advanced economies\nspanning over 30 years, I find no empirical evidence that dynamics move in the way Piketty\nsuggests. Results are robust to several alternative estimates of r-g.</i><p><i>I find no empirical evidence that the dynamics move in the way Piketty suggests. In fact, for at\nleast 75% of the countries examined, inequality responds negatively to r − g shocks, which is in line\nwith previous single-equation estimates by Acemoglu and Robinson (2015). The results also suggest\nthat changes in the savings rate, which Piketty takes as relatively stable over time, are likely to offset\nmost of the impact of r − g shocks on the capital share of the national income. Thus, it provides\nempirical evidence to the model developed by Krusell and A. Smith (2015), who say Piketty relies\non flawed theory of savings. The conclusions are robust to alternative estimates of r − g and to the\nexclusion or inclusion of tax rates in the calculation of the real return on capital.</i><p>From Auten &amp; Splinter<p><i>Our estimates also differ for the bottom half of the distribution. PSZ estimated that the\nbottom 50 percent share of pre-tax and after-tax shares decreased by about 7.5 and 6.2\npercentage points since 1979. In contrast, we estimate that pre-tax and after-tax income shares decreased by 5.6 and 2.2 percentage points over this period. Our estimates suggest that taxes and transfers offset most of the recent changes in both bottom and top income shares. In contrast with the PSZ estimate that average real pre-tax incomes of the bottom 50 percent remained virtually unchanged, we estimate that they increased by nearly one-third.</i><p><i>For pre-tax&#x2F;after-transfer income (which includes Social Security benefits) and after-tax income, we estimate a real increase for the bottom half of the distribution of nearly two-thirds</i>')
