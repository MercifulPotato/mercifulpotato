Productivity gains could be viewed as way to either (a) reduce the amount of labor required (b) increase the amount of goods &amp; services available, or both. Wages could remain fixed, or increase in such a scenario.<p>This is nothing like the economic system in which we live, however; an economic system that is viewed as a playground in which which some will accumulate vast resources (and thus power) and others will not can never function the way I just described.')
