Apart from the problems with its price, especially for the third world, I also think it&#x27;s important to realize that the main motivation for vaccine skepticism is capitalism and the bad incentives it creates for companies. People understand that it&#x27;s in any of these companies&#x27; best interest to lie about effectiveness and safety of these vaccines, and that they have more than enough money to hide any potential wrong doing for a long time.<p>I am NOT an anti-vaxxer. I take flu shots every year, and I will get this vaccine as well as soon as I am offered the chance (I&#x27;m neither at risk nor working in a crucial industry). But the pharmaceutical industry deserves its reputation to some extent, and it is mostly capitalism&#x27;s fault that we have these huge behemoths that can act with impunity.')
