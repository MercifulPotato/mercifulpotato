Not immediately answering your email so you need to follow up with a phone call? Thanks, you just interrupted my talk with my boss and his boss about our department budget, and your colleague next door could also have solved your urgent problem.<p>More often the reverse complaint is uttered, and because of the power differential I think that direction is far prevalent.<p>But ideally, both sides should learn to see each other as human beings with limited lifetime, limited availability and patience and a life outside of work. As a manager, this is a little easier to accomplish: just scold your subordinates for answering emails off hours and remind them to take their vacations seriously. They&#x27;ll learn quickly to do the same for you. Everybody wins.')
