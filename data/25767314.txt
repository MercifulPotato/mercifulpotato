However as a tiny company, we don&#x27;t have any of the same incentives to make it work like Google does. But it still manages to work because we enjoy the freedom&#x2F;low-stress environment and want to maintain that, so that means doing enough good work to keep the business alive. Being so small also means that whatever we do has a huge impact on the company, both positive and negative. So while the lack of deadlines reduces stress, there&#x27;s still the reward of feeling like your work means something at the end of the day.')
