When I finally caved, after a few episodes I fell hook-line-and-sinker into what is an incredibly well crafted story about the human condition: greed, lust, loyalty, ambition, betrayal...  you name it, it has it all.<p>What it has in common with other amazing writing (e.g. Breaking Bad) is realistic (i.e. human) responses to incredible situations.<p>Edit: ^^ excluding the last season and the horrid finale!!<p>Martin&#x27;s books are exquisitly well written and the early seasons were a credit to them - not so much once they diverted.')
