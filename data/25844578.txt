Twice.<p>It was 4-5 years ago when he was about 2. I had a 15+ character random password (a generated one including symbols etc) so the chances of him being lucky were rather slim. He was just mashing button on the lock screen for less than a minute when boom, I was suddenly signed in. The first time I thought it was a fluke. Then it happened again after a couple of months. After that I took my phone, sat him behind my computer and started to record him playing with the buttons but it never happened again and my hopes of getting a bug bounty from Apple vanished :(')
