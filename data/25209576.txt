I was visiting family and watching the 6pm news and I&#x27;d say US politics dominates Canadian national news.  It&#x27;s not unusual for the first 20 min of a 30 min program to be nothing but US politics.  Plenty of people say &quot;well, what happens in the US is important to Canada&quot;, but what&#x27;s covered is just stupid political bickering.  And it&#x27;s not even coverage from a Canadian perspective, just regurgitation of what&#x27;s covered in the US.<p>Sure, when Trump says something about renegotiating NAFTA, yeah, cover that.  When Trump says something stupid about the Democrats, no, that doesn&#x27;t deserved prime time coverage in Canada.  There are too many important things happening in Canada and the rest of the world for that to be front and center.<p>But I understand why they do it...<i>ratings</i>.  Covering outrageous stories gets ratings.  Generating outrage gets people to tune in tomorrow to see what happens next.')
