No training, no onboarding, not even a cursory tour of the network, what source control they use, literally nothing.<p>The amount of time I wasted learning all of this I&#x27;m sure cost the company more money than having a proper onboarding and training program. I pushed my manager and his manager on the importance of onboarding (we were hiring a lot of new devs at the time) but his retort was &quot;it&#x27;s not in our budget, you just have to learn as you go.&quot; Ironically, having spoken up, every time a new dev joined our team, they were pawned off on me to bring them up to speed on everything they needed to know - all the while handling a full load of project work.<p>Not properly onboarding developers has a huge impact on multiple areas of a business. I was shocked a smaller company knew this, but the larger, entrenched corporation wanted nothing to do with addressing this.')
