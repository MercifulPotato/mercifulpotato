It kept crawling away, sometimes into terrible direction, but more often into an area I&#x27;d like to refer to as &quot;satellite&quot;.<p>&quot;Satellite&quot; would be friends-of-friends or even friends-of-friends-of-friends in social media terms.<p>And this is how it comes to ads: when I bought a magazine, I got a set of ads that only had a rough idea about their audience. Those edges were the ones that allowed ads to broaden my views on the world, and, therefore, ads were useful for me. This, and the financial impossibility of ever getting one - early teen in Hungary -, were the reasons why I loved Sony catalogues in the &#x27;90s.<p>Targeted ads are the polar opposite: they want to change me, force me to buy a certain, specific product, instead of gradually opening my interest to a lot more things in the world.')
