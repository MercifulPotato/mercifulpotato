They can&#x27;t identify the leak on the inside so it doesn&#x27;t sound like a micrometeoroid impact and they suspect a second leak that is so small they need a microscope to verify:<p><i>&gt; &quot;So far, we have found one place and suspect another, where as some kind of leak exists. We must bring a powerful microscope on a cargo spacecraft and use to examine this place. We are not totally certain so far,&quot; Solovyov said.</i><p>IANAMS but that screams microfractures. The Zvezda is made largely of an aluminum magnesium alloy [1] that has a fatigue limit so even small repetitive stress can cause it to eventually fail. I&#x27;m curious whether this is wear and tear from just being in space and getting irradiated or if its repetitive mechanical stresses like a small tidal force as it orbits the earth.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;weebau.com&#x2F;iss&#x2F;zvezda.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;weebau.com&#x2F;iss&#x2F;zvezda.htm</a>')
