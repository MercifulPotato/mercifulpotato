Item(by='rayiner', descendants=None, kids=[25726408], score=None, time=1610352344, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25725274, text='&gt; There shouldn&#x27;t be any problem with these discussions when they&#x27;re posed without hate. Immigration for example should be discussed in terms of cost&#x2F;benefit and immigration of talent, policies, etc.,<p>The idea that immigration is solely about “cost&#x2F;benefit” and “talent, policies, etc.” is an inherently liberal, and indeed quite radically liberal framing of the issue.<p>The International Convention on Civil and Political rights recognizes that distinct “peoples’” have a human right to self determination: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Self-determination" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Self-determination</a>. That is, distinct identifiable groups have a right right to self-governance.<p>That is the basis for national borders as we know them today. But if distinct people have a right to self governance, it follows that nations have a right to control immigration for whatever reason they want, including the characteristics that make them distinct.<p>It’s wholly legitimate for a country not to take immigrants who they think might change the culture of the country, or not fit in, or simply because they don’t want to. It doesn’t have to be justified with some sort of economic analysis. It’s not “hate spewing” when the Japanese refuse to accept immigrants for no reason other than large scale immigration would change Japan’s culture. It’s likewise not “hate spewing” for someone in Boise Idaho to say “I like my society the way it is, and I don’t want people here who have a different history, political tradition, etc., especially when they’ll be voting on the laws that govern me.”<p>My family is from Bangladesh. My parents are fairly Americanized, but they really don’t understand some of the subtler things about American culture, like our anti-elitism and love of guns. In Bangladesh, the elite govern and there is no “glorification of the common man.” It was also disarmed by the British, so there is no gun culture. This results in hilarious arguments between my dad and my wife, whose family populated the Oregon coast on the wagon trails, who still hunt for food and hate the government for taking their homestead to build the pacific coast highway. Immigration inherently changes the culture and people are fully entitled to support it or oppose it, or support slowing it or increasing it on that basis.<p>But liberals usually can’t even see that dimension of the issue because they’ve internalized cultural relativism.')
