Apple&#x27;s native apps are confusing and inconsistent. XCode is perhaps the worst offender. (Is that because it&#x27;s okay to ship sub-par experiences to developers? )<p>My opinion is that Google&#x27;s UX is now best in class -- things like Google Docs that are just nearing perfection that everyone seems to have no trouble with. Youtube would be another example of a highly effective UI.<p>I do think native is quite overrated :)')
