They cannot talk them down from their ledge, there is no intercommunication now.<p>What kept &#x27;regular people&#x27; from hopping on 8ch and stopping Christchurch by talking him down? Fun fact: The whole thing was well known in advance and even observed online by law enforcement.<p>Point is, the argument doesn&#x27;t hold up. Bubble or not, things like these are accessible in every way for almost everyone. The problem is that it&#x27;s not taken seriously. This has nothing to do with isolation. Simply no one cares, that&#x27;s what it is. There is just too much of this on the internet at any time. Are you supposed to go after every hate comment? How would that work? It doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s just too much, even with regularly banning people.')
