You can do both &quot;easy and decentralized&quot;.<p>For example, let&#x27;s say you go to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;skyfeed.hns.siasky.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;skyfeed.hns.siasky.net&#x2F;</a> and you make an account (SkyFeed is a decentralized alternative to Twitter built on Skynet). You make some posts, follow some people, then siasky goes down.<p>So now you go to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;skyfeed.hns.skyportal.xyz&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;skyfeed.hns.skyportal.xyz&#x2F;</a> - skyportal is another Skynet portal run by an independent party. When you log into Skyfeed, all of your previous activity is still visible. Your account and all of its information is hosted on the Sia network, which means siasky is nothing more than an access point, and you don&#x27;t get any penalties as a user for switching access points.')
