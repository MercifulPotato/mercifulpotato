I think it&#x27;s a consequence of having been to larger cities (like in SoCal) for an extended period of time, but having been born and mostly lived in the MidWest sticks.<p>Simply put, for the majority out here, improvement is absolutely futile. They truly, genuinely, simply do not care. At most, if you can get through to them what&#x27;s actually happening, you&#x27;ll be glad to know that they&#x27;ll quite happily want to double down on support of them, just to fuck people who want to &quot;improve&quot; things over.<p>I&#x27;ve personally become utterly cynical towards it. Leaded gasoline and paint, among other things, was just too much of a hell of a drug. It&#x27;s going to take a generation or two and the majority of the current base to die out before improvement can happen. Very shitty reality. Some who haven&#x27;t seen it will find it unfathomable, but I can&#x27;t blame them.<p>I&#x27;m just trying to get the fuck away from all of this as fast as I can, though I&#x27;m failing miserably.<p>Sorry to be so pessimistic.')
