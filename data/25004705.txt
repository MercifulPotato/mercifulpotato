They don&#x27;t all obey the same rules for spaces, capitalization, usage of dashes, etc - they&#x27;re <i>close</i>, but it&#x27;s far from consistent.<p>What we ought to have done at some point, would have been to rebuild the whole suite of commandline utils - to make them all do an ironclad standard, and probably even make them all spit out a totally normalized data format like JSON, man pages included, so that external tools could be built around them way easier without everyone having to write their own parser (or - having to write a generalized parser with tons of &#x27;special-case exemptions&#x27; for all the CLI tools that break the rules).<p>There have been several attempts, but nobody&#x27;s been willing to do the big &quot;rip off the bandaid&quot; and take the pain of breaking legacy scripts.')
