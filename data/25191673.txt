Why on earth should mask-wearing when not necessary be normalized?<p>You&#x27;re right that it&#x27;s political - except that it has actual detrimental consequences to society to normalize doing unnecessary things, especially when your goal is expressly to divide people (as that&#x27;s literally the main thrust of what what &quot;political statements&quot; in the form of virtue signalling accomplish).<p>Rational, well-informed people should wear masks indoors and in busy outdoor areas, and enjoy some fresh air when they can get away from that. Wearing a mask when you don&#x27;t need to to &quot;reinforce&quot; unnecessary behaviour is irrational, and will continue to make anyone who is anti-mask think that you&#x27;re not approaching the situation reasonably.')
