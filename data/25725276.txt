It’s little things like this that add up.<p>That&#x27;s it. That sums up what&#x27;s wrong with the Linux desktop. It&#x27;s the little annoying, arbitrary and broken things. It&#x27;s that constant denial (the 2 decades old GNOME bug report is the perfect example), that <i>it&#x27;s not broken, people are just using it wrong</i> mentality among Linux desktop developers that breaks Linux desktop.<p>I know, desktop is hard. I know we should be thankful to GNOME developers no matter what. I am thankful! I just don&#x27;t want to use their broken software anymore. GNOME is dead to me since a decade. I just could not appreciate it as much as I wished to.')
