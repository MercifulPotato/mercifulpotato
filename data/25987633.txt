A market maker goes naked short when there is a buying frenzy. Their economic incentive is to then cover the short given they are <i>in a buying frenzy</i>.<p>The NYSE explicitly markets its specialist system to issuers as a stabiliser mechanism. It’s a selling point to long-term investors and Boards. The only people who get upset about this are hedge funds and day traders who get ahead of their skis.<p>[1] By Wall Street tradition, every long losing money must allege naked shorting. That doesn’t substitute for evidence of it. Large amounts of short interest do not indicate naked shorting. (Lots of FTDs do, but this figure has to be scaled to leverage and volatility.)')
