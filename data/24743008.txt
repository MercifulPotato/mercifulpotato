If you think an issue unrelated to what you&#x27;re doing  is more important than having a good working environment to work on that shared project, then I still think you should just quit since you&#x27;re not fulfilling your obligations as an employee.<p>As for the other kind:<p>&gt;A little while ago Github employees protested the involvement of their company with the ICE department of the USA government. In that case, could you simply say to the protesting employees, &quot;Well, you must just disagree with the shared goal of the company and so you should quit&quot;.<p>I believe you should tell them exactly that if they voiced their concern to management but they still decided to go forward with the deal. What else are you going to do? Sow a negative&#x2F;divisive work environment because your political views are more important than the product everyone is working on?<p>Politics are quite diverse, if every employee were to bring in negativity over every deal they disagree on, you wouldn&#x27;t have collaboration and your product would not exist.')
