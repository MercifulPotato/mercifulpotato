Could it work?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I recently saw that some Google employees are attempting to unionize and someone mentioned that Google&#x27;s customers wish they could unionize.<p>That lead me  to wonder: Could Google&#x27;s customers form some sort of union and attempt to hold discussions with Google?<p>On the one hand I think it would in Google&#x27;s interests to do everything to prevent having another party to have to negotiate with. On the other hand, if there was a union of customers and they occasionally demanded something everyone thinks is reasonable in the press, that may start something. Especially if Google caves on some of these issues.<p>What do you think?')
