Data are not. Oil is extractive. You can fly in tech and talent, pump oil, keep the rulers happy and not concern yourself with the local population. You can’t do that with data—its value, for advertising and influencing, is linked to the population’s productivity and power. Finally, data are ephemeral in a way oil isn’t. You can’t barrel up bytes in the middle of the ocean.')
