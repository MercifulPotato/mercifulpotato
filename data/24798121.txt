I wasn&#x27;t trying to emphasis my particular dislike for ads.  In fact, if the ad is haflway decent, or even interesting, I dont mind getting the occassional ad, especially since I see it as a way of supporting the actual channel owners.  What I object to, and in particular in the context of this posting, is that I regularily see ads which <i>never</i> would make it through on more local media.  Some of these are outright scams.  And I wonder, what is the difference between someone spreading &quot;misinformation&quot; on their channel, and someone else paying YouTube to spread &quot;information&quot; which will ultimately be used to scam the user.\nAlso, YouTube has channel which upwards of 1 mio subscribers which only consist of pirated content.  I truely wonder how these slip through the cracks.')
