There&#x27;s plenty of malware on the play store. I&#x27;d actually be willing to bet you&#x27;re more likely to install some malware from the play store than from an apk you get off a website or alternative store.<p>It&#x27;s a tradeoff for freedom vs a false sense of security. On android at least, the walled garden approach hasn&#x27;t seemed to stop malware, the majority of which, comes from the play store. All it&#x27;s done is teach users to blindly trust apps just because they come from a supposedly trustworthy source. If anything it&#x27;s taught people to think less about security and the kinds of apps they install. It&#x27;s on the play store right? Must be ok.')
