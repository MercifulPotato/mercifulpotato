If you want to run less on the output of one command or watch some thing change while still running other commands you either need to open a new second terminal emulator and go to the same place as the first or you need to use something like tmux (and either have some janky hack or be very careful about when you run tmux if you want to duplicate shells on a remote box for example).<p>I also think it’s not so useful anymore to just set up a pipeline and let it run off and do it’s work. Interactive shell usage is often mostly about editing or extending a small suffix of the previous command, so I think a shell should be optimised to do that well.')
