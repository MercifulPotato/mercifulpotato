Very little in the way of docs to go on right now and what little there is in the way of examples is buried in Rails gems. Should be mostly straightforward, with a thin Django middleware to check headers and the like. I guess The Turbo Stream stuff could be adapted to Django channels quite easily. I&#x27;ll wait and see how and when they improve the documentation, especially on the Rails-agnostic front.')
