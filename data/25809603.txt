Probably to push them into a corner until a new generation takes control, and until oil is worthless or worth less.<p>The issue is, that will take a shite tonne of manpower. We&#x27;re trying it in Yeman right now and failing. The same in Lebanon for the last few decades.<p>Instead of making progress, we&#x27;re actually losing. Iran has significantly increased its influence in Iraq since we &quot;liberated it&quot;.<p>So we either need to start sending in troops or reconsider entirely.<p>I&#x27;m also hopeful that a new generation will take over and be Pro Western. It is the only long term solution here.<p>But that won&#x27;t happen if we continue to attack Iran, Sanction them for nothing etc.<p>A while back, we (the west) picked Saudi as our ally in the region. That was a horrible mistake. Its time to reevaluate the whole map there and say &quot;what&#x27;s wrong with Iran as our, if not ally, person we can do business with?&quot;.<p>The only alternative to this is either a huge war or defeat and the whole region falling under hostile control...')
