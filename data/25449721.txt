No 3rd party storage like Dropbox required. In fact what I don&#x27;t like is GoodReader asks for too broad an access to Dropbox&#x2F;OneDrive if you try to set it up.<p>- Books is first party app so absolutely no tracking whatsoever. GoodReader had Facebook SDK and Google Analytics and was trying to contact a bunch of other trackers the last time I installed it.')
