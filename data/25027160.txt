The published PGP standard refers to RFC3447 which is PKCS #1 v2.1 for RSA. It is quite unlikely that there are any bonehead errors in any of the popular implementations.<p>&gt;The most trivial one is the 1×1 tracking pixel that phones home, which is pretty common in email for tracking purposes.<p>I think it was clear from context that I did not mean that no reverse channels existing anywhere, only in a form suitable for oracle attacks. The HTML image thing is a straight up leak that has actually been used to exfiltrate decrypted plaintext.<p>&gt;PGP is already decently well-known as being a bad cryptosystem...<p>That isn&#x27;t really true. It is actually one of the solidest cryptographic protocols ever.<p>&gt;...do not naïvely compose.<p>What does that mean?')
