I ended up passing LAPACK 3.4.2 through f2c before compiling the result with emcc. PCRE and some SuiteSparse libraries were the only additional dependencies needed for my project and they compiled with Emscripten without too much difficulty. The rest was just hacking GNU Octave&#x27;s Autotools build system, which gleans a lot of information from the system environment, into working with emconfigure and emmake. My changes to the GNU Octave source code are available here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rwl&#x2F;octave-4.4.1&#x2F;tree&#x2F;web-assembly" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rwl&#x2F;octave-4.4.1&#x2F;tree&#x2F;web-assembly</a>')
