Most of those ran a web server + background worker + redis + postgres.<p>Everything starts up no problem in development without any extra tooling when using Docker Compose.<p>Tests in CI are a different story, but I find wait-for-it to not be the tool to fix that problem. Instead I ended up writing this tiny shell script[0] to wait for a process to be ready between running a docker-compose up -d and running my test suite in CI. You&#x27;d run into this issue with or without Docker Compose too.<p>You could use it to wait until you can do a SELECT 1 on your database (the docs cover multiple database examples). The docs also cover why wait-for-it doesn&#x27;t work to fix waiting for a database and other common use cases.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nickjj&#x2F;wait-until" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nickjj&#x2F;wait-until</a>')
