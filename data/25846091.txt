So for example, as the North Sea fields die, the Cromarty Firth in North East Scotland is getting rigs at an increasing pace, they just mothball them in the firth in the hope they can get a refit or sell them, but they rarely seem to be able to do either these days (there&#x27;s a set of jack up legs that have been there for at least 15 years for example). Nobody&#x27;s buying them for scrap and paying to drag them halfway across the world any more (there was a suggestion money was going to get pumped into a breaking yard down the coast in England, at Middlesbrough, but looks like wasn&#x27;t financially viable). Financial incentives aren&#x27;t there, so it&#x27;s easier to just find a coastal location to moor them that&#x27;s cheap, where they rot. There&#x27;s no cash value in them, it&#x27;s usage that makes money and that ain&#x27;t happening a lot now, the owners of the ones Musk&#x27;s bought will have bitten his hand off.<p>Edit: for clarity, it&#x27;s a massive financial bet building a platform -- they have specific purposes and take a long time to plan and build, but the deployment environment (physical&#x2F;political&#x2F;economic) is volatile relative the build timespan. That doesn&#x27;t matter in boomtime, any hits are absorbable, but it is not boomtime. The above Scottish example, a fair % of the rigs in the firth at any one time are &quot;new&quot; (as in unused). They get kept in hopes of refits, not scrapped; it&#x27;s too expensive to scrap.')
