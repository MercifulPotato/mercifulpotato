As with OOM error testing, the I&#x2F;O error simulators can be set to fail just once, or to fail continuously after the first failure. Tests are run in a loop, slowly increasing the point of failure until the test case runs to completion without error. The loop is run twice, once with the I&#x2F;O error simulator set to simulate only a single failure and a second time with it set to fail all I&#x2F;O operations after the first failure.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;testing.html#i_o_error_testing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sqlite.org&#x2F;testing.html#i_o_error_testing</a>')
