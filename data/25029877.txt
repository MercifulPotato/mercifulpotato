After all, we&#x27;re still social primates operating in small groups! I think what I was trying to say was rather that to analyse this behaviour purely as &quot;what is the rational reason for this action&quot; gets you less far than looking at it as an emotionally-driven tendency that&#x27;s driven by the part of our brain that is not the rational-conscious-thought part. Sometimes it&#x27;s the rational thing to do, sometimes it&#x27;s something we can construct a rationale for after the fact (our brains are very good at that), and sometimes it&#x27;s genuinely a bad choice that a perfect rational robot would not make. But whichever of those any particular &#x27;status-seeking&#x27; act falls into, I don&#x27;t think many people are making the choice as a conscious purely reasoned cost-benefit tradeoff.')
