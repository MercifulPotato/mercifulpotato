Item(by='root_axis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603898759, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24912045, text='&gt; <i>I think that these large communication platforms absolutely resemble other large communication platforms that are currently covered by common carrier laws</i><p>They have nothing in common except the &quot;communication&quot; label.<p>&gt; <i>Specifically, a lot of the functionality that these platforms provides, fulfills a usecase that is similar to the phone network</i><p>They don&#x27;t. The &quot;phone network&quot; is what provides access to the internet, a website is not a phone company, it sits at a higher level of abstraction. That&#x27;s like saying a popular TV show is a broadcast network because everyone watches that show.<p>&gt; <i>online communication platforms are now as important as the phone system</i><p>That&#x27;s not true. If the top 10 most popular websites on the internet disappeared overnight there would still be many thousands of ways to communicate over the internet.')
