The reason why industry pays more is because that is what society needs.</i><p>That&#x27;s clearly false.  Industry&#x2F;capitalism&#x2F;profit-seeking by definition makes it incredibly difficult to do things where there isn&#x27;t a large expected monetary return.  But profitability is a poor proxy for whether a thing is useful to do or not.<p>For example, there are quite a few diseases&#x2F;conditions that affect a decent number of people, but we don&#x27;t find cures because the return on that investment would be too low, or often negative.<p>Capitalism suggests that the only thing that matters is having more money; I believe what truly matters is having better lives for everyone.')
