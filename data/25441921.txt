(The EU GDPR doesn&#x27;t care, it says it&#x27;s the responsibility of the site to get informed consent, which necessarily has to define what the chosen data processor does and can do with your data.)<p>So what Google does with that data? To me it seems GA is just the free incentive to get sites to start using their &quot;marketing platform&quot;, it&#x27;s the entry point for their upsell conversion funnel to selling you Google Ads. The real thing. And GA is a great way to get you to get vendor-locked-in early.')
