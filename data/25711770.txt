Legally, Parler could operate but no laws exist to guarantee it can.<p>If this scenario played out in another business, like a restaurant, then nobody could really stop them from operating. Even if the food supply companies stopped delivering, there is a decentralized network of small farmers and transportation companies that could pick up the slack. No such counterpart exists with internet companies. You&#x27;re either part of the grid or you&#x27;re out. Come to think of it, that could explain a lot.')
