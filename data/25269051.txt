I recently added AWS SAM to the mix as well so that I can automate deployments.  I have always wondered why Route 53 was so expensive relative to the other services.  I have a collection of low traffic sites that I run for local businesses and this is always the most expensive part.  I guess it&#x27;s hard to complain about $0.50.  But, given I could probably run them all on $5 DO droplet, it ends up costing a little more.')
