I could go to the grocery store and try to buy the entire stock of milk. They would probably refuse to sell them to me, and would be within their rights to do so, even though they didn&#x27;t put a sign specifically saying I couldn&#x27;t do that. I could complain that they should just keep more milk in stock, but they won&#x27;t, because I&#x27;m not the customer they want to sell to.<p>Businesses (in the US) can refuse service to anyone for essentially any reason besides discrimination. Why should hosting a server for someone be any different. Most services are going to put something generic in their TOS to accomplish this, because they can&#x27;t enumerate or foresee every way that people might do something undesirable.')
