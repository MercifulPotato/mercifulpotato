Can&#x27;t forget Wikipedia.<p>Of course other media (such as newspapers, magazines, books, radio shows, etc) has a lot of interesting stuff, and then of course other people knows a lot of interesting things, so if I get an interest on a thing I can start some search on a subject, but if you don&#x27;t have a specific query in mind, I agree that search engines give weak results.<p>Interesting question, I hope you get more answers!')
