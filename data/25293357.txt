A friend of mine and I got Vitamin D tests at the same time by coincidence and we both tested <i>very</i> low. So our doctors prescribed us the same 20,000 IU pills but got told absolutely different things on how to take them.<p>While I tested lower, I was supposed to only take 1 pill a week while my friend got told to take one a day for 1 week, then 3 a week, then 2 a week, then one every week. I just followed my friend&#x27;s doctor&#x27;s advice because it was November and I got literally no sun whatsoever and I didn&#x27;t see the need to take those 50 pills over the summer.<p>This was in Germany btw, where the advised daily dosage is 800 IU if you don&#x27;t get <i>any</i> sunlight. Seeing those Vitamin D posts over the last few months leads me to believe that 800 IU is an order of magnitude too low.')
