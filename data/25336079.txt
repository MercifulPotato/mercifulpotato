Reflective of the quality of conversation here, where I read daily but don&#x27;t interact. However, seeing quality lower even further by baseless well-written opinions prompted me to respond. I&#x27;m especially disappointed to see when someone challenges an opinion that it got downvoted. This type of voting behavior makes having a dialog impossible. I&#x27;m not even saying you&#x27;re wrong here, just the reaction is lacking substance.')
