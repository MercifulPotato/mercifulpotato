Stuff I&#x27;m doing less often than once a month I have to check in the manual every time. And it&#x27;s nothing inherently hard - stuff like removing one change from staging or cleaning up local branch to be exactly like remote. The interface just feels like stuff is arbitrarily assigned to different commands :)')
