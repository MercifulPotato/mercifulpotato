Peace in the Middle East.<p>Not once in my life did I think 2020 would be the year when many middle eastern countries sign peace deals with Israel. Heck thereâ€™s already Israeli Jewish weddings in Dubai!!!<p>The us government who helped broker these deserves a peace prize. If not with their help and assistance these peace deals would not have occurred.<p>I look forward to what 2021 will bring with the Middle East better aligned to future industrial and cultural growth.')
