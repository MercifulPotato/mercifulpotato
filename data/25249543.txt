However, I think one thing also worth mentioning is that essentially everything we do on computers looks like this: We take something we know how to do, and we make the computer do it faster. We don&#x27;t know how to score meetings using body language and facial expressions - or atleast I would be incredibly sceptical of anyone who claimed they could do so without incredibly intimate knowledge of the people involved. Any manager will tell you there are people who are productive when talking, people who are productive when quiet, and people who are unproductive when talking or unproductive when quiet.<p>What seems likely is this system is going to invite extroverts to your meetings. My gregarious bizdev lead is going to be coming to our standups to boost our scores.<p>Let&#x27;s just lay aside the concerns about this being a dystopian nightmare, it&#x27;s also going to be crap.')
