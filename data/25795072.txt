It makes thing harder for first time user. I think at least JSON or HTTP client lib should be included?<p>One of my use case is use Lua as an OAuth proxy, run inside Nginx, or use Lua as a S3 Proxy(with sign signature etc) and dealing with XML&#x2F;JSON&#x2F;HTTP Request is hard in Lua.<p>When I installed an external lua rocks, for it to be embeded inside Nginx, I have to make sure lua lib path are sync between luarock&#x2F;nginx.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to solve that problem other than reading the document. But explains all of them to a new comer to Lua&#x2F;Nginx is hard. It takes a lot of time until they can write code.')
