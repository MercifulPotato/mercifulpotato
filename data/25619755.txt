But some people are brainwashed to love tech debt:<p>1) Some people mistakenly interpret &quot;maximizing the work not done&quot; with maximizing tech debt.<p>2) Power is the ability to make people do what they do not want to do. Saying &quot;no&quot; is a way to exercise that ability. Some leaders become addicted to the feeling of exercising their power.<p>3) Cohesive groups of people tend to prioritize cohesion over rationality during decision making (i.e.: &quot;groupthink&quot;). Groupthink makes teams unable to make correct decisions or assess risks in a rational manner.<p>Many startups suffer of issues 1, 2, 3. And some even perceive those weaknesses as strengths. When that happens, the only way out is to decapitate the team, punish groupthink and reindoctrinate the team members.')
