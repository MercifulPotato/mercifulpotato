It took a huge mobilization of media manipulation fear mongering and gas lighting to get the American public to swallow the Weapons of Mass Destruction and&#x2F;or Saddam did 9&#x2F;11 lies. If people had been free to speak their minds (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.democracynow.org&#x2F;2013&#x2F;3&#x2F;21&#x2F;phil_donahue_on_his_2003_firing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.democracynow.org&#x2F;2013&#x2F;3&#x2F;21&#x2F;phil_donahue_on_his_2...</a>) back then we wouldn&#x27;t have been lead into that war like lemmings. Information is control. I trust the funny cat lady next door to not start a war with Iran more than I trust anyone on an editorial board of an American newspaper not to. Lies require censorship of truth to survive.<p>EDIT: added a reference. Keep in mind for every anti-war journalist fired for standing up to the official lies there were easily 100 who kept their heads down. Im not scared of flat earth lies. I&#x27;m scared of Iraq war or even worse, World War I levels of deception.')
