Item(by='wutbrodo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606321111, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25208720, text='Sure, the fact that there&#x27;s a plausible motivation on the doctor&#x27;s side is the reason I don&#x27;t have much of an opinion on the veracity of the claim.  That doesn&#x27;t preclude the possibility a trend exists within the medical system of worse care for the overweight due to treating weight as a hard blocker.  I chose my framing of the claim I&#x27;ve heard pretty carefully, and what you&#x27;re saying only supports it:  as being overweight is upstream of so many health problems,\nit seems entirely plausible that doctors (given that they&#x27;re human beings) would be prone to falling in the trap of not wanting to think about anything that can be done while the weight problem is still being worked on (or not).  Again, this doesn&#x27;t require assuming that doctors are horrible people; this kind of reductiveness is the way most people respond to everything.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s usually from people not doing much to lose the weight in the first place<p>This is far too arrogant an assumption for a doctor to be making about a patient. I don&#x27;t know any overweight people, but I do know people who have had (theoretically solvable) drug problems and other bad health habits, and the blockers to fixing them are not always &quot;just believe in yourself and have some willpower&quot;, especially when (even sub-clinical) mental health issues are involved.  Hell, I used to smoke way too much weed and not eat particularly well (though never badly enough to get overweight) and it turns out I had an undiagnosed sleep disorder.  If smoking weed happened to be associated with a bunch of health problems and I had a doctor who was narrowly focused on it and refused to help me with other incidental issues before I solved it, I&#x27;d be pretty upset too.')
