I&#x27;m not even sure people know what they want at this point..</i><p>Though I loathe concern trolling, on this aspect, I am very guilty.<p>None of the proposed measures I&#x27;ve read even acknowledge my concerns, much less offer remedies.<p>I&#x27;ll share mine if you&#x27;ll share yours.<p>I want to foster fairness and competition. The most modest, minimal measures are:<p>- prohibit self dealing, conflicts of interest<p>- impose rule of law over de facto marketplaces<p>- ban competing with one&#x27;s own clients and partners<p>That&#x27;s the very least we can do to oxygenate our economies. I also support far more assertive measures,<p>- repeated radical cashectomies<p>- fixed royalty schedule for all\npatents (taxes by another name)<p>- restore Eisenhower era corporate tax rates, with generous breaks for R&amp;D and employee profit sharing<p>-limit comparable compensation (of all kinda) between CEO and janitors to 40:1.<p>- reassert shareholder rights by banning minority control (eg voting super shares for founders)<p>That&#x27;s just my casual list, from the hip. I should probably draft a more comprehensive compilation of all the remedies I&#x27;ve heard proposed.')
