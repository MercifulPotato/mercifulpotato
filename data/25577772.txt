That&#x27;s not an argument I&#x27;ve heard made before, but I do find it persuasive.<p>They literally control large portions of the internet with AWS, are moving into air freight, ground freight and I assume sea freight is next. They control the warehouses and they control the customer experience. They have third-party sellers and then once popular they steal their ideas and drive them out of business, because they can afford to.<p>The bigger Amazon gets the harder it gets for someone to overtake them.<p>And while you may not care yet, the natural outcome is that once they are the only game in town, they will simply raise prices. On every purchase you&#x27;re winning the battle while losing the war.')
