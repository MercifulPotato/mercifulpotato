And then things break, and no one knows why because no one has the depth of knowledge to investigate it. But it has to be fixed, so typically one or two people in the team are assigned to it and are miserable for days or weeks while they painstakingly try and learn about the things they should&#x27;ve known in the first place, while at the same time try and fix a system under a lot of pressure from management.<p>I wish the software industry rewarded knowledge, correctness and excellence rather than speed of execution.<p>There are way too many things involved in a software system these days for people to know all of it. We shouldn&#x27;t expected people to be highly knowledgeable about all of a programming language, multiple frameworks, libraries, cloud providers, CI&#x2F;CD, security, and who knows what else. Instead, those should be specializations and teams should be composed of multiple specialists.<p>I&#x27;m well aware that what I&#x27;m saying is a pipe dream. The industry at large is fine with the idea of deploying broken things and patching them later, no matter the cost to the health of engineers, so it&#x27;s not gonna change anytime soon.')
