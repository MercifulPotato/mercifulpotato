Item(by='franga2000', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604663979, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24997221, text='I don&#x27;t know what else to say. I work with docker containers almost daily. We keep our own images in a private registry (GitLab, since we already pay for it) and those images are built on top of public images from the Hub (postgres, python, etc...). Our CI server pulls the base images from the Hub (keeps a cache), the source from GitLab, does the build and pushes the resulting images back to the private registry. Another server gets called when this happens to spin up a testing environment (pulling our images from the private and some 3rd party images from the public repo - again, cached). Automated and human testing is done against that and if it all passes, the signal is sent to the production server to update itself (doing on final round of pulls from both repos - often only the private one, as our app images are updated far more often than supporting services like postgres). Unless the base or supporting images are updated, the Hub receives nothing but a few HEAD requests from us and a push of that one FOSS image that we actually release publically.<p>Either way, I can&#x27;t be bothered with this thread anymore as there&#x27;s clearly no more constructive discussion to be had with you.
