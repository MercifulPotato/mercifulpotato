From where you sit, look around your room and contemplate the incredible energy expended to get these items where they are.<p>If your concern is about avoidable energy waste, you&#x27;d need to have a bizarrely weird misunderstanding of the scales here to pick Bitcoin as your hill to die on.<p>It&#x27;s like when people complain about how much water you waste by leaving the tap on while you brush your teeth while my dad has the water rights to waste 10,000,000L&#x2F;year of creek water because he owns a single cow. People have such little understanding of the relative scale of everything, so they laser-focus on whatever inconsequential, concrete morsel that sounds good to them.')
