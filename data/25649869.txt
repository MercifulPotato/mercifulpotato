This will mitigate the risk of losing access to the code.<p>It&#x27;s not advised for these Iranian developers to use any Github-specific features, such as issues, wiki, CI, because losing them will cause disruption &#x2F; knowledge loss.<p>And then the reason to use Github specifically, instead of something else is quite low.')
