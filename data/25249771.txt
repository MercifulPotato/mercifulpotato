You cannot use the arithmetic mean on interest rates because it does not make sense to add them up. If you just go for the geometric mean &quot;because it&#x27;s a rate and I have read online I should use geometric mean&quot; then you won&#x27;t learn why you need to use the geometric mean.<p>This isn&#x27;t quite correct. You can take the arithmetic mean of interest rates, and it is meaningful. The ensemble average of interest rates might tell you the expectation of interest rates over a class of instruments at a point in time. However, if you want to know the compound growth rate of a single instrument or portfolio, then you&#x27;re going to need to use the geometric mean.')
