I had simple markdown files at first, then vnl-log files, and now R notebooks (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dkogan&#x2F;vnlog" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dkogan&#x2F;vnlog</a>) to read &#x2F; plot.<p>It may seem like overhead, and there&#x27;s some snark in this thread about how it&#x27;s project &#x2F; team management without the project and team.<p>I completely disagree. If you set up your KR&#x27;s so they are 1) quantitative, 2) daily measurable, 3) simple to log ( a few keystrokes while journalling) and 4) completely under your control to achieve.<p>At the end of the day, I mark down my progress on all my OKRs. I can quickly plot them, look back at progress, and look back at goals and concerns by seeing the <i>types</i> of objectives I had. It&#x27;s a 10,000 foot journal that I otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have.<p>There&#x27;s more to this than simply quantifying yourself. We like #&#x27;s because they are representations of complex systems. The self and your personal history are absolutely a complex system worth tracking.<p>Looking back at my OKRs when I was dating my (now) wife, comparing the ways I put effort into our relationship and our changing priorities. Seeing over time my running distances, weight lifting activity, meditation record, and seeing how I consistently attempt to over-achieve by setting KR values too high ... Having those points of reference has made today more enjoyable, and been a constant reminder that progress comes slowly and missing on any particular attempt at something is irrelevant. It&#x27;s so completely a part of my life now that I can&#x27;t imagine setting goals or daily priorities without it.<p>Think of it like quantitative journalling.')
