I&#x27;ve lost count of the number of batteries replaced over the years. Doesn&#x27;t have an excess of functionality beyond what I need and fits easily in the hand. Only piece of hardware that I would grieve.<p>Edit: Reminds me of about 10 years back when a box of HP calculators was found in a local warehouse. Somebody went around taking orders and high-tailed it down there.')
