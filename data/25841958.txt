There is no new story in the Linux desktop world to make a Linux Laptop more appealing.  That people already selected to develop on MacOS and deploy to Linux tells you all you need to know there.<p>MacPorts and Homebrew exist.  Both support M1 more or less and support is improving.<p>Big Sur is a Big Disaster but hopefully this is just the MacOS version of iOS 13 and the next MacOS next year goes back to being mostly functional.  I have more faith in that than a serviceable Linux desktop environment.')
