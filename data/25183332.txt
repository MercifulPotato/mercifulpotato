I come from Rails and thought CoffeeScript (CS) could make it way more readable, like Python but with cool string interpolations!<p>But you&#x27;re absolutely right, it made my code really hard to reason about. I don&#x27;t know why this is the case but it was always harder to read my own CS than raw JS. I found myself putting blocks into the CS2JS just to read inner workings.<p>While it made me less verbose and short-term faster, longer term it made me slower.')
