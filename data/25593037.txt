The EU has established that various forms of contract (eg: employment contracts) do not allow for consent to be given freely - and as your tailor is rich, I&#x27;m assuming that you&#x27;ll be comfortable with the less ambiguous French wording: &#x27;[le] consentement [...] doit être donné librement&#x27;.<p>However, I do agree &#x27;unnecessary&#x27; is an odd choice of word from the EU here, as &#x27;consent&#x27; is the only legal basis for data processing which does not include the word &#x27;necessary&#x27; in the actual regulation.<p>&gt; I have never been clear about the basis for claiming that consent is not freely given if it is linked to accessing the service.<p>The basis for this is Article 7.4.<p>As an example, if I walk in to a restaurant, it would be &#x27;unnecessary&#x27; to require me to provide a name before serving me. They can still require it, and they can refuse to serve me if I don&#x27;t.<p>HOWEVER, if I <i>do</i> provide my name they cannot claim that I have consented to doing so (and therefore, they must have another legitimate basis for processing my personal data - a good recent example might be a track and trace scheme, where they have a legitimate basis to process personal data as it is in the vital interests of both myself and other patrons).<p>However, it would not be unnecessary to require me to provide a name before reserving a table, as the name would be necessary to identify me as the person who reserved the table, and so they <i>can</i> rely on consent as a basis for processing my personal data here.<p>Moving back to Facebook:<p>It <i>is</i> necessary for Facebook to process some personal data in order to provide the service of allowing me to communicate with my friends - for example, my name, my friends&#x27; network graph, maybe my email address, information that I upload to the site, etc. As a result, this personal data can be processed under the basis of consent.<p>It is <i>not necessary</i> for Facebook to share that information with advertisers, so they cannot use consent as a basis for processing this data, and they must have another legitimate basis for doing so (and they may well do, I would imagine they could build a pretty solid case either for performance of a contract or legitimate business interests).<p>This means that either: Facebook agree that they are processing this data based on consent, in which case consent can be withdrawn or refused for <i>specific purposes</i> (which is not possible), or they cannot rely on consent as a basis. It is important which legal basis is used for processing personal data as the paperwork and thresholds for passing PIAs vary.')
