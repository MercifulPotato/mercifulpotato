It is true.<p>If I got a penny for every time Larroccha gets mentioned in the discussions about small hands and alt sized keyboards I would be a millionaire.<p>First of all, nobody, ever in their right mind would bring up Larroccha when talking about greats. Frankly the only times Larroccha would get brought up... is when talking about pianists with small hands. Severely limited repertoire.<p>Secondly, isn&#x27;t that curious that they don&#x27;t mention what the actual reach of Ashkenazy was? Well, it turns out that he doesn&#x27;t have small hands, merely on the smaller side when taking the absolutely gigantic hands of every other concert pianist as a reference point.<p>I&#x27;ve heard by some people that Horowitz had small hands too (compared to whom, a 7ft tall giant who can reach a 15th?)')
