Instead you took the position that expressing a <i>desire</i> for nice tools is a sign of their total incompetence at programming, that they are complaining because they <i>cannot grasp its complexity</i> (despite them saying &quot;I can use Git&quot; which suggests they can grasp its complexity). You dismissed &quot;<i>The Git UI directly models the Git internal model and that&#x27;s just bad design</i>&quot;, launching straight into calling them stupid and saying they need handholding, for merely <i>wanting</i> good design - because good design makes things easier to use, and things being easier to use is for stupid people.<p>You could have argued that Git is easy to use and therefore they are stupid for not being able to use it. Or that the interface modelling the internal workings is a good design. Or that Git&#x27;s complexity is necessary and no simpler interface is possible. Instead you agree that it is complex and thrill about the complexity and use it as a showoff point about how it makes you superior. That&#x27;s the manliness part. Not as you willfully misrepresent it &quot;<i>if you can&#x27;t grasp complexity you really shouldn&#x27;t be writing code</i>&quot; but &quot;if you don&#x27;t want to spend your life on the complexity <i>of a supporting tool unrelated to the problem you really want to solve</i> you really shouldn&#x27;t be writing code&quot;.<p>Git is a tool in support of programming, learning Git is not the whole point. Programming involves dealing with complexity (often in the sense of <i>simplifying</i> complexity and hiding it away), but that doesn&#x27;t mean <i>everything</i> has to be complex <i>to use</i>, and it doesn&#x27;t mean that someone has to enjoy the complexity in <i>everything</i> to be a good programmer.')
