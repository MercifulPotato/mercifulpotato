But no cream! Fuck that.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amsterdamlachgas.com&#x2F;lachgas-toebehoren&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amsterdamlachgas.com&#x2F;lachgas-toebehoren&#x2F;</a><p>Somebody should start a 24&#x2F;7 milk and cream delivery service. DeliverMOO!<p>I think you could make a killing delivering 24&#x2F;7 fresh milk, cream, and dairy accessories like breakfast cereal and chocolate mix.')
