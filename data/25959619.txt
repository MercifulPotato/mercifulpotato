I would guess that a vast majority of people don&#x27;t have time&#x2F;knowledge to look into official reports. One big table with different companies, number of people in trials, results etc. would be nice. For example, what I just found out is that Moderna is actually not 95% effective on all age groups but on 18-65 [1].<p>Back to J&amp;J. How old were the 15% that did develop the most serious symptoms? The article says that &quot;more than 40 per cent had other illnesses [...] including obesity, diabetes and HIV.&quot; Isn&#x27;t the base rate for obesity in a population something like that or higher? Finally, if we just look at the numbers (if they are even comparable), can we objectively rank these vaccines by how good they are? No ones feelings should be hurt if we can conclude that their vaccine is close to useless (think of how vaccinated population will demand loose measures although 40% of them are still at risk).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;future&#x2F;article&#x2F;20210114-covid-19-how-effective-is-a-single-vaccine-dose" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;future&#x2F;article&#x2F;20210114-covid-19-how-eff...</a>')
