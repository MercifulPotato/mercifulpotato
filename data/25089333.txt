I&#x27;m sorry that happened.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever quite seen that dynamic, so I&#x27;m actually really curious for details. What kinds of things did you find yourself apologizing for? And then, what were people picking on you for? And what was the relation exactly?<p>If you&#x27;re a moderator of a group who has to make hard decisions, depending on the group, it can be a thankless job since you&#x27;ll always piss off half the people no matter what.<p>I suppose the original post doesn&#x27;t talk about what <i>does</i> require apology vs. what doesn&#x27;t. E.g. making a necessary and correct decision that still pisses people off is usually better done with empathy for those who it bothers, but not apology.')
