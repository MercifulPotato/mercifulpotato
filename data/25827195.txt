It -is- saying that the amount of time is &quot;surprisingly little&quot;.<p>But to the topic at hand, the logical implication is that &quot;to do it&quot; =&gt; &quot;takes surprisingly little time&quot; (that is, doing it implies you took surprisingly little time)<p>Not &quot;taking surprisingly little time&quot; =&gt; &quot;to do it&quot; (that is, taking surprisingly little time implies you do it; after all, you might have taken surprisingly little time to do -something else-).<p>Same as the above; the implication is that &quot;success&quot; implies  &quot;(at least) a surprisingly small number of adults were involved&quot;, not that &quot;(at least) a surprisingly small number of adults were involved&quot; implies &quot;success&quot;.<p>I find it helpful to use formal logic to explain stuff like this. If I make a statement that p =&gt; q (that is, p implies q), and that statement is true, it does NOT necessarily follow that q =&gt; p (that is, q implies p) is true (it may or may not be; it is independent from a formal logic perspective). It is necessary to evaluate q =&gt; p separately, in which case we may find it to be true, OR we may find q =&#x2F;&gt; p to be true (that is, q does not imply p; or put another way, the fact q is true tells us nothing about whether p is).<p>As an example, &quot;My shoes are wet because it is raining&quot;, p = it is raining, and q = my shoes are wet. p =&gt; q means if it is raining (p), my shoes are wet (q). But it does not also follow from that that q =&gt; p; that is, just because my shoes are wet (q) it does not mean it must be raining (p; I might have, after all, been out watering the lawn). Thus, q =&#x2F;&gt; p.<p>For the tango example, p = a tango is possible, q = there are two people. p =&gt; q, but q =&#x2F;&gt; q (that is, two people does not imply a tango is possible).<p>In this case, p = foster child is successful, and q = a number of adults (sometimes a surprisingly small number) were involved with them. p =&gt; q, but q =&#x2F;&gt; p.')
