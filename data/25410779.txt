Item(by='HexagonalKitten', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607896891, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25406178, text='&gt; Capitalism is about free market trade.<p>A sort of freedom. Not <i>free</i> from taxes, free from interference. But that&#x27;s really never the case.<p>Say you buy something from a store, and you expect their use of your data to follow the terms on the loyalty card. They&#x27;ve got a bunch of commercial-code laws that protect them. You can&#x27;t pay with counterfeit money, or give yourself a 2-for-1 discount. If you use credit and don&#x27;t pay, men from the state with the right to use violence come and collect for the store. They&#x27;re totally legally protected. But how are you protected? Only at the end of a hugely expensive court case in the best outcome, but probably not at all.<p>The potential risk to the store from you is limited to the cost of goods, the risk to you is almost unbounded. You might lose healthcare coverage, or your boss might buy your data and use the store to link your id to your pornhub usage and fire you. Minimal, limited risk for them, huge unbounded and unprotected risk for you.<p>But then you discover after buying your gallon of milk, that they (knowingly) sold your data to someone who then sold it to, let&#x27;s say an insurance company, in direct violation of the words on the back of the card. Now, how do <i>you</i> get made whole?<p>So, no. I don&#x27;t actually feel that the free market meets that description for 99% of transactions. Between two citizens over a used lawnmower, yes. Between Warren Buffet and Bill Gates, yes. But between you and the supermarket - not even a little.')
