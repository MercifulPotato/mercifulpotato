So, 43 total in the combined 166 subjects. That suggests that if the drug has no effect, there is about a 26% chance that a subject will die or need a ventilator (which is not surprising given that all the subjects were elderly).<p>If the drug has no effect and the death&#x2F;ventilator probability is 0.26, then the probability that the control group of 83 would have &gt;= 29 deaths&#x2F;ventilators is 0.044. The probability that the test group would have &lt;= 14 deaths&#x2F;ventilators is 0.034.<p>That seems good enough to warrant further research.')
