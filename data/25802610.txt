Bruce is (in my personal opinion as an observer of people with zero professional training in psychology) a depth-first learner and naturally seeks to understand how things work by looking at the layers.  Building up from there allows true understanding and even mastery of the material.<p>This is exactly how I am as well, and the result is often that it can take a while for me to pick things up and really understand them (since I have to cover so much more material than a typical person) but my level of mastery afterward is typically very high.<p>My experience now from well over a decade in the industry is that most people are not this way, and also that many people who <i>are</i> this way <i>don&#x27;t necessarily realize it</i>.  If you feel like understanding history, layers, etc helps you understand things much better, do yourself a favor and follow Bruce Eckel&#x27;s blog and read his books.  Thinking in C++ 2nd edition is 20 years old now.  A third edition would be wonderful.  Or maybe even better, &quot;Thinking in Rust&quot; :-D<p>[1] Volume 1 available for free on Archive.org:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;TICPP2ndEdVolOne" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;TICPP2ndEdVolOne</a><p>[2] Volume 2 available for free on Archive.org:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;TICPP2ndEdVolTwo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;TICPP2ndEdVolTwo</a>')
