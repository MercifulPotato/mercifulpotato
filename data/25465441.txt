Item(by='pmeunier', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608284389, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25459092, text='&gt; I&#x27;d argue that diffs in the presence of renames aren&#x27;t natural, and git handles them better than other version control systems.<p>Maybe this is because I designed that part in Pijul, but I disagree. Pijul has renames commute with other types of edits, and renames are faithfully modeled in Pijul patches, not just &quot;guessed&quot; after the fact based on contents.')
