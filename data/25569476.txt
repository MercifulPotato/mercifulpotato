Rather than flying low cost and standing in the bus for 3 times longer than the taxi ride.<p>We want to allocate resources to people who accomplish important things for us. Not just as reward or motivation, but in our own interest, we invest in the most capable and competent to have more of our stuff taken care of.<p>Jobs aren&#x27;t just about sitting in a chair and taking cash and we just pick who gets to sit in which chair to enjoy that cash. It&#x27;s <i>doing things</i>. And we want those things to be done well.<p>This is the idea behind meritocracy. Not that we praise people for their genetics.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this is how it works currently, just that this is what we mean by meritocracy that we should move toward.')
