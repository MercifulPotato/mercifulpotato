Facebook had their reasons for coming up with it, because their user base is hitting the <i>billions</i> in scale.<p>&quot;But my mobile app makes too many requests!&quot; says the hopeful engineer, &quot;and graphql means we can optimise the network!&quot;<p>Well, yeah, it probably looks like that when you see one nice request from the browser dev-tools, rather than dozens, but that&#x27;s not what it will look like on the server side, or in the database, when you can get into situations with quadratic queries, never mind N+1. And yes, I&#x27;ve seen that with my own eyes.<p>If you&#x27;re sending a dozen or so requests to the server to render a screen in a mobile app, then the slowest thing might just be the stage where you spin up a connection and do the old TLS dance. Unless you&#x27;re hitting Big Tech scale that&#x27;s probably acceptable versus the insane amount of money you&#x27;ll dump into building and maintaining a GraphQL-based architecture without any data proving that this approach would actually be an optimisation.<p>Just like Kafka, Kubernetes, etc. which have come out of incredibly large-scale projects and businesses...you don&#x27;t have to and shouldn&#x27;t use this stuff just because it&#x27;s the popular thing to do. Startups and small businesses became successful without any of this.')
