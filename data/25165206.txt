Over the last year I&#x27;ve been building a modular workbench using 2040 aluminum extrusion as the skeleton.<p>I have a &quot;sidecar&quot; for my contractor table saw (which otherwise stows on a slide out shelf for storage).  One of the 2&#x27;x4&#x27; workbench pods then acts as an out-feed, and I can use the others as a combination of in-feed, left and right wings, or more out-feed.<p>One of the coming-soon projects is to make a router side-car, and the easy answer is to drop $500 on one of the fancy router lift &#x2F; fence combos.  Having a hard time pulling the trigger on that though...<p>Maybe even put some steppers in it and get some CNC component to get some &quot;DRO&quot; and &quot;tool change position&quot;.  That might be real nice.')
