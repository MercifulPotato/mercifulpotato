Item(by='jolux', descendants=None, kids=[25319733], score=None, time=1607207594, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25313311, text='Nitpick: the latest standard is R7RS-small (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;small.r7rs.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;small.r7rs.org</a>), which is (expectedly) smaller than R6RS. I believe it was supposed to be accompanied by something like R7RS-large, covering the rest of what is expected in a Scheme standard to succeed R6RS.')
