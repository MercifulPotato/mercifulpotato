Internet says about 70% of people there own a car.<p>Doesn&#x27;t that mean people who live in Manhattan (or other walk-able cities in the US) should have similar fitness levels? I also know little about fitness levels of people who live anywhere, but does it follow that if it&#x27;s the walkable city making the difference, then people in Paris, NYC, London... any walkable city would have the same fitness level?')
