I definitely do, and I &quot;like&quot; what I feel when I get to eat it.<p>Yet I may be no more than a replicating machine whose purpose it is to build these new machines which may likely replace us one day, maybe keep us in a zoo, or as pets, if we get lucky.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine what motivates these molecules to behave, to group the way they do; why the existing energies get channeled to make them move that way, since there is no need for the energy to do anything at all.<p>Something motivates me, and I see no reason why there isn&#x27;t motivation in these molecules; what they do is already complex enough to be considered as something which may have a special purpose.<p>We do have consciousness. There is this something in me which sees and tastes, which experiences life. It&#x27;s hard to believe that this is something material. To me it feels as if complex enough structures of molecules allow something to plug into this universe, to absorb its information and to feed something into it, like instructions which allow this &quot;me&quot; to interact with it.<p>The same could well be applicable to bacteria or to the most rudimentary lifeforms. Because a bacteria forms part of my body doesn&#x27;t mean that it can&#x27;t have its own consciousness; the same may be valid for all this stuff that (maybe) &quot;lives&quot; inside my cells. Lucky me, that I get to stand on its shoulders in order to perceive this universe the way I can and interact with it.<p>&quot;Works&quot; and &quot;replication&quot; isn&#x27;t wrong, but removing the &quot;wants&quot; and &quot;likes&quot; from this equation doesn&#x27;t feel right.')
