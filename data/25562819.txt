Their hand having been forced, the team then gave interviews to Scientific American and NatGeo with some more details, emphasizing that the signal is probably RFI. Now, I’m pretty grumpy about this. SETI has extensive post-detection protocols that were not followed by the leaker, exactly to avoid this sort of situation. Especially since the team was definitely going to announce this, there’s no need for the leak.&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>---<p>It&#x27;s a bit amusing that after decades of SETI touting their post-detection protocol, they couldn&#x27;t even keep a sorta-maybe interesting find under wraps for five minutes before someone went running to the media.<p>Where&#x27;s Jodie Foster when you need her?')
