A circle with a slash through it will appear on top of the picture of the microphone. This is referred to as &quot;muting.&quot;<p>This should be enough to see why it is called &quot;muting your microphone.&quot; While you could say &quot;disable your microphone,&quot; this can lead to confusion, such as thinking that you are talking about more permanently disabling it, such as you do in your computer settings.<p>The most important thing about language is that it is understood. &quot;Mute your microphone&quot; is going to be understood.')
