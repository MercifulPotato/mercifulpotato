Item(by='globular-toast', descendants=None, kids=[25577439], score=None, time=1609280179, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25575157, text='&gt; Men are more vicious and ferocious<p>I mostly agree with what you&#x27;re saying but it&#x27;s important to address this fallacy. &quot;Men&quot; are not more vicious or ferocious. On average, &quot;men&quot; are mediocre. Compared to the average woman, the inability to reproduce makes the average man far less valuable. It is only a select few individuals who carry exceptional abilities. Women don&#x27;t have to compete with average men, they have to compete with the top men. It&#x27;s the top men society looks up to. It&#x27;s the top men that women want. Average men are invisible. A useless by product of natural selection.')
