I wished to say that he isnâ€™t so universally <i>admirable</i>. That is, what you see as constructive in his ideals and aspirations, other people today might find destructive.<p>&gt; That may well be true, but this feels like an ad-hominem argument<p>Well, human beings are social animals, so ad hominem arguments are perfectly valid here. If something feels cringe to a large group of people (even to most of those who one would have expected to be sympathetic), then it can fairly be called cringe.<p>Also, these idealistic, Zamenhof-lauding green-star-flag-waving world-peace types were infamous for often having the least ability to actually converse in Esperanto. They would be visible at congresses, but in a way they were least involved in the actual Esperanto community. You&#x27;ll also find plenty of arguments that those people actually hold Esperanto back from appealing to outsiders and getting more people involved.')
