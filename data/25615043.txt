Is the author the worst journalist since the dawn of the newspaper era, or a genius of words for whom a Pulitzer is not even near enough?<p>Why does Assange have to be a &quot;saint&quot; or a &quot;sinner&quot;?<p>He is a person involved in journalism and activism.<p>He is also an individual with a personal life, habbits, traits, etc.<p>Intelligent critique knows how to separate the personal from the political.<p>Intelligent critique also knows that people ain&#x27;t saints or sinners, but just people, and if it feels the need to bring in analogies from theology (which might ocassionally make sense), it surely doesn&#x27;t need to bring the most extreme dichotomy from it...<p>Assange doesn&#x27;t have to be either. As for his public work can be very good, very bad, or something in between for the world (possinly nearing toward one or the other), regardless of what &quot;he&quot; is.<p>(As for my personal opinion, historical and political savvy people also understand there&#x27;s a lot of saving face and retaliation at play from those exposed by Assange, plus all kinds of made-up BS accusations and diplomatic pressures).')
