I&#x27;ve been using MacPorts for 16 years and I&#x27;ve never had to wait more than a few minutes for a Python install to complete. Most packages are pre-built. I can even get clang without having to compile. Plus one for MacPorts though. It rarely lets me down and unlike Homebrew stays in &#x2F;opt&#x2F;local instead of polluting &#x2F;usr.')
