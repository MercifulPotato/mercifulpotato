The &quot;less traffic&quot; part doesn&#x27;t really seem to be holding up though.<p>It&#x27;s a bit encouraging to see what seemingly-impossible things people can accomplish when working together.  We&#x27;ve done a lot more than anyone was planning to do to address climate change this year without that even being a primary motivation.  Maybe that will recalibrate some expectations about what is possible.')
