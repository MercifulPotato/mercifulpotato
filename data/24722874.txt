My tinnitus has actually improved.<p>As a child, I noticed a high-pitched sound during a particularly windy night in Wisconsin.  Over the next few days it got louder and louder to the point it was quite frightening.  Obviously, I had tinnitus, but unfortunately lacked the words to describe it to my parents (or they just wanted me to go to sleep haha).<p>Eventually I figured out that it was a cycle.  The more I focused on the sound, the louder it got.  As I worked to focus on on other things, it gradually subsided over a few days.<p>Now, as an adult, it is with me all the time.  It gets much louder some days.  This can be caused by a bad night of sleep.  Or random things I can&#x27;t figure out.  Doctors have variously mentioned salt, tomatoes, trying antihistamines, etc.<p>But one thing I know makes it worse is noise - especially higher frequencies.  As a result, I really dislike many of the newer (pre-covid) restaurants with the hard surfaces and tinny speakers playing harsh music all the time.<p>My kids got me iPod Pro&#x27;s for Christmas and it has been wonderful.  We went to NYC and by wearing them, I was able to enjoy loud restaurants, deal with the subway, etc.<p>I also notice that by wearing them for even a few hours, my tinnitus is often significantly improved.  My theory is that it improved by decreasing the amount of stimulation.<p>For those who experienced the opposite, I wonder the quiet they experience allows them to hear the tinnitus clearly for the first time?  Then they begin to focus on it which increases it&#x27;s apparent volume as I did when I was young.')
