It&#x27;s $100, but it&#x27;s nice and compact and has a ton of gates. Also has a built in programmer and 256 MiB of DDR3.<p>Neither of these have high speed serial interfaces (for things like ethernet, PCIe, HDMI, etc.), but they&#x27;re fun starting points.<p>I&#x27;d love to get into making my own FPGA boards, but man, BGAs are scary from a hobbyist perspective. The Spartan 6 LX9 is neat (from a hobbyist perspective) in that it&#x27;s a big QFP.')
