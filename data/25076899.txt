So you need that finer application timing.<p>Of course that doesn&#x27;t require tying it to a particular user account,not even a device ID, just a sessionID that changes each time the device restarts would probably be granular enough.<p>However since we&#x27;ve got that other stuff in place per device wouldn&#x27;t it be great to see if there&#x27;s a correlation between people using an app on there Mac and using it or another App on there iphone, ipad, or watch. What piece of data can we include to match up a user across all their devices? Maybe some kind of obfuscated or derived userID.<p>Of course you&#x27;d hope that other interests such as a commitment to privacy would rule out the use of such a dataset. If Apple did have such a dataset then you&#x27;d hope they&#x27;d be doing whatever processes (social, business, and technical) it can to obfuscate and seperate how that dataset is tied to a specific user.<p>The only real argument against Apple not having it is the balance between the cost of creating&#x2F;exploiting such a data set, the expected profit, and the legal and reputational costs of such behaviour.')
