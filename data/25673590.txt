I like to ride outside 4-5 days a week in good weather when I can. I only own a mountain bike and had been looking all summer for a way to get hard core cardio during the winter months. Also, as a resident of the PNW, this year we experienced horrific fires, oppressive smoke, and awful air quality for a significant chunk of September. This meant no cycling.<p>Mountain bikes generally don&#x27;t work too well with trainers so I started looking at spin bikes. I researched the Peloton and honestly, it&#x27;s kind of a rip off. Huge upfront cost, limited classes for West Coasters (when I looked, anyway), and that pesky monthly fee. You are paying for brand exclusivity, IMO.<p>I ended up getting a Schwinn IC4 for &lt; $1,000 and no monthly fee. I hook it up to Zwift and an iPad or my TV for structured riding. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my decision. I would still have preferred the Peloton&#x27;s integrated screen but at literally twice the price of the IC4 (plus ongoing fees for classes if you choose to utilize them), I just couldn&#x27;t justify it.')
