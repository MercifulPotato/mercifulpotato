I would argue that creating multiple accounts in your bank is akin to creating multiple disk volumes.<p>If one volume runs out of storage, you have to resize it, and requires decreasing the size of another volume.<p>Just like if one bank account runs out of money, you have to move money from another account.<p>Though I am unfamiliar with the products mentioned, so perhaps these are virtual accounts that all draw on the same underlying “physical” account, and thus can have a negative balance without incurring overdraft fees.<p>In which case this would basically be a (simple) accounting app provided by your bank.<p>I could certainly see some value in simplified accounting added to a banking app, if however you are after “proper” view of your finances, a real double entry accounting system should be used, where you would be able to also track assets outside of the bank (like cash on hand), liabilities (debt), etc.<p>Personally though I do see value in having a secondary (bank) account for fixed expenses, but that is only because I am too lazy to do “real” accounting, so having this separate account makes it easy to view a history of all fixed expenses (for next year’s budget).')
