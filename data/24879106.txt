The reality of the people and the personalities was that there was a smear campaign of RMS by his enemies going back to at least ESR and early versions of CaTB. The open source movement started out as &quot;free software without Richard,&quot; with some pretty nasty people wanting to be the new leadership.<p>Perhaps it was inevitable that RMS would be taken down by neutral third parties, but now we&#x27;ll never have any way to know. The reality is he WAS taken down by people who had been smearing him with exaggerations and half-truths for at least the last quarter-century, and this was part of that dynamic.<p>I don&#x27;t feel bad if people are taken down fairly. I only feel a little bad if people are taken down by, in your words, &quot;a witch-hunt by prudish SJWs.&quot; I feel very bad when people are taken down by enemies spreading half-truths.')
