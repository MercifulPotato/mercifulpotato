Especially considering that Jabra&#x27;s official support had confirmed to me that you can only be actively paired to 2 devices at a time with the Elite headsets (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Jabra&#x2F;comments&#x2F;g32aom&#x2F;elite_75t_active_use_on_multiple_devices&#x2F;fnpio5n&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Jabra&#x2F;comments&#x2F;g32aom&#x2F;elite_75t_act...</a>). Either that has changed since I first purchased the Elite or you&#x27;re stretching the truth. On top of that, the Airpods automatic switching can&#x27;t connect to devices that are in sleep mode so I feel like you&#x27;re stretching the truth with that too.')
