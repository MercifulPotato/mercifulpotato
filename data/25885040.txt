This is an unbelievable growth rate for a bootstrapped SaaS. It usually takes many years to reach these numbers. Very happy to see people build sustainable businesses this way â€” venture funding is not the only way to go!<p>I&#x27;d be very interested to learn more, things like: is it a B2B or B2C SaaS? What is your ARPU and LTV, are you spending on marketing, and if so, what is your CAC? (I do realize you might not want to share these numbers, just saying that this is what I&#x27;d love to know :))')
