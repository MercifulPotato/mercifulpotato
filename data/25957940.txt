But surely other professional investors ((hedge) funds, high frequency traders, algorithmic traders) are also jumping on the bandwagon, to (1) eliminate a competitor and (2) make a profit themselves on the way. I read yesterday that (at least one platform for) algorithmic traders have been monitoring subreddits like &#x2F;r&#x2F;WallStreetBets since the start of 2020, to immediately buy what is mentioned favorably there before retailers bring the price up.<p>The way I see it, is that among the professional investors, one will lose hard (Citron), while most others will profit. When the sell-off starts, they&#x27;ll be able to sell first, thanks to their sub-ms connections to exchanges, algorithms that monitor media in real time (including reddit!), and employees that are constantly monitoring this whenever the markets are open (as opposed to retailers doing this in their free time).<p>Among the retailers, a few will win big (&#x2F;u&#x2F;DFV), while most will lose. They&#x27;ll either stubbornly &quot;HODL&quot; if they&#x27;re in it to &quot;get a message across&quot;, or if they&#x27;re in it for profit, they&#x27;ll notice the sell-off too late and act too late, probably exacerbated by RobinHood suffering outages at that point.<p>So my prediction is that in the end one hedge fund will go down while others will profit from it... Most retailers will lose. Then what was the point?')
