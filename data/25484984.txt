It&#x27;s also the best way to tend after the grass. You can also reach everywhere :)<p>Styria was probably the best part in all the hiking. It has the densest and oldest forest in Austria and it is a little tiny bit more out of the way for tourism to reach it except Vienna. I spent nearly a 3 weeks there and did some extra tours criss-cross around the region because of how beautiful is there.<p>Sadly never been to Tasmania. I did the backpacking thing back in the early 90ies, where coming from Indonesia I visited Perth, bought a car and then drove around the continent for a year. Best time of my life and only fond memories of Australians and how they welcoming they were. It was mind blowing to see such a culture difference for a stiff European and be warmly greeted even in the supermarket with &quot;have a great day&quot;.<p>Best memory of Australia (many good ones) was when I had a boat drop us off at one of the uninhabited Whitsunday islands just with enough water (and not enough food) and we camped near the beach. Monitor lizards eating our food (so after day 3 we hunted and ate them because fish wouldn&#x27;t bite). We also tried to eat the lime color ants which we heard the Aboriginals would eat. (you won&#x27;t get full from them) Totally nuts lol.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.schroeckenfux.at&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.schroeckenfux.at&#x2F;</a>')
