I skimmed over some explanations and somewhat understood what it was trying to achieve. I&#x27;ve been in the space a few years and I&#x27;ve not been this excited about any other project in the space. It was without a doubt the single most interesting idea I&#x27;ve encoutered. By far. I soon joined the community and continued learning about its inner workings. During the learning process, I soon realized that there are very few in the Grin community, and outside of it, that understand the underlying idea. This was surprising to me because unlike all the alternative technologies that aim to improve privacy, Mimblewimble, specifically the Grin implementation, was designed to be extremely simple. In fact, I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s the only technology that has a simpler design than Bitcoin!<p>I&#x27;m convinced the idea stands out among all the other ideas in the space (at least the ones I&#x27;ve seen). It&#x27;s very hard to find a design that fits this nicely together. A few days ago, I&#x27;ve decided to write a short series of posts that try to present the idea to the wider audience. In order to reach the average crypto Joe, I avoided talking about the underlying cryptographic primitives because they would only confuse people. They&#x27;re also not important to understand the idea underneath.<p>Most privacy technologies make certain tradeoffs and Mimblewimble is one of them, but I promise you that if you take the time and try to understand it, you&#x27;ll at the very least learn something new and appreciate the idea.<p>I hope you guys enjoy the read and if you find it interesting, consider joining the Grin communication channels.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phyro.github.io&#x2F;what-is-grin&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phyro.github.io&#x2F;what-is-grin&#x2F;</a><p>Happy new year and all the best in 2021.
