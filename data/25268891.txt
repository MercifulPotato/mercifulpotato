I seem to remember CPU speeds listed alongside available memory for AWS Lambdas, but the pricing page seems to just list memory now[0]. At the highest end, you&#x27;re still limited to ~10.2GB of memory, which is considerably lower than what&#x27;s available via EC2. And while I have no personal experience with the EC2 finer-grained pricing that was announced[1], it sounds like that approach may be a better approach to the described scenario above. We can nitpick on these architectural details, but my response was largely that there are other architectural alternatives that could be more ideal; especially in response to a comment that seems to dismiss the value of pricing at finer time intervals.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;lambda&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;lambda&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;18&#x2F;aws-starts-charging-for-ec2-by-the-second.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;09&#x2F;18&#x2F;aws-starts-charging-for-ec2-...</a>')
