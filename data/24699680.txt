It is about us and the world we want to live in. &quot;<p>... we have to recognize that &#x27;we don&#x27;t own this stuff&#x27;.<p>Yes - I do support anti-trust and possibly &#x27;breaking up companies&#x27; but we have to be very, very careful at how we intercede into private groups affairs.<p>The agents doing the &#x27;breaking up&#x27; might just believe that they have incredible ability to &#x27;oversee markets&#x27; and leverage the power for what they believe to be the &#x27;greater good&#x27;.<p>The power of &#x27;free markets&#x27; is often overstated but we should remind ourselves that there is a lot of value there, more importantly <i>it&#x27;s not obvious</i>. In the short run, it&#x27;s easy for someone to delude themselves in to the view that &#x27;one&#x27;s responsibility to the ostensible greater good as governor&#x27; combined with &#x27;the grand view of markets&#x27; should legitimately empower towards control and market manipulation. After all - a bunch of &#x27;really smart analysts&#x27; should be able to maximize social utility through some kind of restructuring of whatever exists at any given time in the markets.<p>It&#x27;s a vey slippery slope and a hard thing to &#x27;get right&#x27; - so any gains to be made here are going to be really correlated with how thoughtful and intelligent government will be on this one. Even with the greatest intentions it could be a mess.<p>Whoever doing this needs to be really, really smart about it.')
