You&#x27;re arguing for the ideals again. This isn&#x27;t new, many people have been trying for the past 15 years but there&#x27;s a reason it just doesn&#x27;t work out. If you want to find a <i>&quot;paretto-efficient basis for frontend development&quot;</i> then good luck, but reality has shown that CSS is not separate from HTML, they are the same concern because presentation <i>includes</i> structure.<p>Cascading rules and specifying by HTML layout are hard to deal with, especially in larger projects, because that structure may change and rules can overlap in complex ways. It&#x27;s far easier to just atomically apply some classes directly to your HTML. And yes, you can use Tailwind as mixins within your sass rules without ever touching the HTML if you want.')
