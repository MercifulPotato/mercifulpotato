In CL it is trivial to determine both at compile and at runtime the package of all symbols involved. Same for generic methods, you can query the runtime which methods it is going to use for some concrete combination of parameters. Much easier than to determine how which overload of a C++ operator did the compiler&#x2F;linker deemed to fit in given context.')
