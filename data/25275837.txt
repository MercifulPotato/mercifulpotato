Best thing to do is to never even start connecting it to a WiFi network and use an external TV receiver. That way it most certainly will not connect to any network whatsoever. I also never agreed to any terms that are on the start display, which may also add to that. Just switch to your Input channel (external device etc..) and enjoy your &quot;dumb&quot; TV.')
