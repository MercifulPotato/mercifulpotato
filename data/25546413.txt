The original company was General Motors Corporation. That went bankrupt, and the name was changed to Motors Liquidation Company. If you were a GM stockholder before the bankruptcy, you ended up with stock in Motors Liquidation. If you were a creditor of GM, you were a creditor of Motors Liquidation.<p>A new company, General Motors <i>Company</i>, was created, and it bought the more useful assets of Motors Liquidation. Not all of them. Motors Liquidation was left to sell off unwanted plants, and such assets as GM&#x27;s car collection. (GM used to have a collection of one of everything they&#x27;d made.) Today&#x27;s GM is General Motors Company, much smaller than &quot;Old GM&quot;.')
