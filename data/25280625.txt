This is where part of the modern &quot;progressive&quot; movement runs into a bunch of walls, because it&#x27;s actually calling for <i>re</i>gression.  Less travel, less fun, less food, less family, less space, less comfort.<p>If you want to continue progress on an issue you care about, you have to tie it into actual material progress.
