It is a cognition problem.<p>Computers or computer based &quot;AI&quot; are good at solving bounded problems that do not require open ended or on the fly model building and judgement exercising in real time. At this biological intelligence, honed by millions of years of selective evolution still excels.<p>Computers can &quot;solve&quot; GO or Chess because fundamentally the rules are simple and the models required to play these games are subject to only a few, static constraints.<p>Driving, in all conditions on all roads, on the other hand, requires a flexible model of the real world that approaches that built by sentient biological intelligences.<p>The problem is not sensor or perception latency.<p>Sure LIDAR can blow human perception out of the water.<p>But that does not matter.<p>What matters is making the correct decision based on sensory inputs using a high fidelity model of the real world.<p>Computer does not understand the difference between two people playing catch by the roadside, parallel to the road and a situation where a child might be chasing after a soccer ball. This is not just combinatorics and probability...it is theory of mind. Thus until AGI is invented FSD will be a misnomer.<p>Doesn&#x27;t matter how much faster a computer can perceive if it does not know how to integrate the raw data it receives into a model of the world that yields correct decisions to the circumstances.')
