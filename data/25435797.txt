The best way I can describe it is &#x27;acceptance&#x27;.  I accept who I am, at my core, is defined by my genes, my experiences, and my experiences&#x27; affect on my genes.  I used to think that if I <i>just</i> tried hard enough, I could be different.  I could be cooler, more attractive, etc.  Now?  I simply accept that I am simply not compatible with some people, and that&#x27;s ok.<p>I know that sounds like some sort of cringe hallmark card.  I know I completely dismissed that sort of sentiment when I was younger, but as I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve found it rings more true.')
