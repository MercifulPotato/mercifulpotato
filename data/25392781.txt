Soooo many more duplicated systems and stuff to maintain and repair.  With the fleet of small tractors you have like 4x the number of hours tied up in service.<p>And before anyone say &quot;hurr durr muh electric&quot; I would advice you to google up some small machine manuals, look at the service intervals and see what you&#x27;ll be doing the most of.  Electric motors don&#x27;t mean you can throw out your grease gun.  The bulk of the hours on heavy equipment maintenance are spend on the business ends of the machine that take the abuse, attachments and drive-train, not engine&#x2F;trans.')
