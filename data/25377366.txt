Tell it which container to run and off it goes. You get zero-downtime rolling deploys, automatic restarts on crashes, easy rollbacks, service discovery (if you have multiple services) and more for free.<p>Managing a cluster is the tricky part of k8s but just running your stuff on an existing cluster is extremely straightforward.
