His cleverness is pointing out that this is intentional: if we could easily tell all interesting properties of the results our programs give us, we wouldn&#x27;t need them in the first place (of course this isn&#x27;t always true, but don&#x27;t be so literal). It&#x27;s another way of saying that software exists for its essential complexity, and that that complexity -- as formal methods&#x2F;software analysis research tells us -- is high.')
