I cast my vote on prop 22 based on my personal beliefs about where the government should sit in a relationship between two consenting parties. I haven&#x27;t used a ride share app in about 2 years. It has nothing to do with the money spent on the campaign, or my loyalty to any company, or marketing through an app.<p>Despite what people on the internet like to think, people actually have beliefs that aren&#x27;t based on cynical, simplistic, one dimensional worldviews. People who&#x27;ve never used a rideshare app might object to the government demanding companies solve a problem few people had. Especially in California, where the State is extremely paternalistic and overbearing.')
