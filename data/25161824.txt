I haven&#x27;t touched any Pascal code since the first year of highschool over a dousen years ago :). Forgot it even existed.<p>Yes I hate bloat but I&#x27;m starting to hate it less and less each day due to understanding more and more the effort required to build things (in general, not just desktop apps).<p>I think, unless you have the resources to dedicate yourself to just one OS&#x2F;toolkit, for which your app performance is an absolute must, it&#x27;s better to prioritize delivery speed and adoption, using generic tools, with plenty of resources and skills that can be transfered from other areas, like web frontend is in this case. One thing is for sure, I don&#x27;t have time and resources but I have a pretty fast laptop, so the choice is easy in my case.')
