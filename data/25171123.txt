Put your desk and computer in a separate room, and it&#x27;s pretty clear that qualifies. If you live in a small apartment and have your desk in your bedroom, then I&#x27;m not sure.<p>(2) It&#x27;s only a deduction. Having someone else pay all the costs is much better than paying them yourself but getting back your marginal tax rate times the cost.<p>(3) As you mentioned, it&#x27;s only for self-employed people.')
