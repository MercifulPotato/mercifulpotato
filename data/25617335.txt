I mean this sincerely. I feel bad saying it because I know there are lots of people probably on this site that worked on them. But I literally often have no idea how to proceed when using these products. That&#x27;s something that hasn&#x27;t happened to me since before I was a teenager.<p>As 2 random examples, I&#x27;ve used both Confluence and Crucible in the last month. In Confluence, when I log in I see everything that anyone in my (1,000+ people) organization worked on most recently. People I&#x27;ve never even heard of show up as having edited some random document that doesn&#x27;t concern me. Meanwhile, I can find no way to list all articles that I created. There&#x27;s a small list of things I edited or looked at in the last 30 days, but no way to say, &quot;just show me everything I created.&quot;<p>Meanwhile, in Crucible, I literally can&#x27;t figure out how to do anything. I&#x27;m reading through the changes to some source code and adding comments, and after an hour of doing that, it still says I&#x27;ve completed 0% of my review. WTF? And when I start my own code review, every god damned time, it tells me, &quot;You&#x27;re about to start a review with no reviewers.&quot; It then offers me 2 choices: Abandon the review or cancel. I get what &quot;abandon&quot; does. What does cancel do? Cancel the review? Cancel abandoning the review? Why is there no button right there to add reviewers? That&#x27;s what I most want to do! (And there are no reviewers yet because it literally has not yet given me the option to add them previously in the work flow. WTF?)<p>You can talk about performance all you want. I won&#x27;t bother until the products actually perform some useful function. As of now, as far as I can tell, they don&#x27;t.')
