They need to be able to create it at will.<p>The point is to be able to easily zero an account. Paper money in your possession cannot be instantly destroyed without your permission. A digital currency could be used to induce monetary velocity...i.e. spend the money by Saturday or it is deleted. Or, if you are arrested for protesting the Government, your account is zeroed.')
