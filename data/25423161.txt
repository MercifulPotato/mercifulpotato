Your position seems to be that a contender would need to be able to replace (and improve) C generally, and I don&#x27;t totally agree (not that you need to be convinced, but I&#x27;ll elaborate on my interpretation anyway).<p>E.g., if somebody came along and said that C would be bloody perfect if it just had a garbage collector then that alternative language would be totally unsuitable as a replacement for C in many contexts, but for a ton of other scenarios it&#x27;d still be &quot;C but better,&quot; and I don&#x27;t know that it should be disqualified just because it isn&#x27;t a full replacement.')
