Item(by='chrismorgan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604763139, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25013103, text='This is not handling HTML entities properly, which does a number on my own site where various hrefs have slashes escaped as &amp;#x2F; because Zola has taken the OWASP guidelines on the topic of escaping which erroneously instruct to escape forward slash, and I haven’t been bothered to undo this. So almost all my links are broken. And as for my article title &amp;lt;_&amp;gt;::v::&amp;lt;_&amp;gt;…<p>(The OWASP thing: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cheatsheetseries.owasp.org&#x2F;cheatsheets&#x2F;Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cheatsheetseries.owasp.org&#x2F;cheatsheets&#x2F;Cross_Site_Sc...</a>, “the forward slash is included as it helps to end an HTML entity”. This is <i>wrong</i>, and slash escaping is 100% stupid; this was related to an SGML feature that I don’t believe ever made it into <i>any</i> HTML parsers, or past HTML 3.2 at the latest, and even if it <i>were</i> so it would still be a stupid guideline because if a character’s entity-<i>ending</i> behaviour matters then (a) you’re doing something <i>catastrophically</i> wrong, and (b) you should be entity-encoding <i>every</i> non-alphanumeric character. But people have been blindly copying what OWASP says here for at least ten years and making things worse for the sake of it, e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rack&#x2F;rack&#x2F;issues&#x2F;27" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rack&#x2F;rack&#x2F;issues&#x2F;27</a>. Perhaps I should try again to see if I can figure out how to get them to fix this bad guideline. I think it’s probably five years since I last tried and failed; I might be more successful in finding the place to complain nowadays, looks like the source might be hosted on GitHub now.)')
