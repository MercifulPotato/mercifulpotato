Item(by='spondyl', descendants=None, kids=[25854602], score=None, time=1611190037, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25848322, text='Having actually run through spantaleev&#x27;s matrix-docker-ansible-deploy twice in the past, and run the Matrix bridge stack for a few months each time, this is interesting.<p>Eventually I would have some bridges get out of sync (ie I responded on mobile but the bridge doesn&#x27;t show my message or messages would get lost) but overall, it worked really well.<p>The downside of having one error in relative isolation is not the bug itself but that it makes you distrust the stack entirely and you end up double checking the source messenger &quot;just to make sure&quot;<p>Having said that, it looks like you&#x27;ve done quite a bit of development on the bridges from a quick glimpse of the Gitlab repos.<p>How are those forks related to Tulir&#x27;s bridges? Does he integrate any of your changes and vice versa or are they two unique development streams? In your comment, it sounds like Tulir is working with you?<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m looking forward to this very much because the multi-messenger thing has been the bane of my existence, I swear. I would gladly pay $10&#x2F;month to fix this as I have online (and offline) friends all over the place.<p>Oh, for the unified inbox, is there any way to &quot;group&quot; by a person? For example, if I primarily chat with someone on Line but then occasionally talk through iMessage. I would expect them to render as two different &quot;conversations&quot; but logically, they&#x27;re one person of course.<p>Lastly, I thought the line about shipping an iPhone was satire. You might want to put a note in there like &quot;No really&quot;.')
