Granted my direct research was narrow on some aspects of solvent extraction related to actinide separation, but I did get a general impression of other areas from hearing stories and presentations at conferences and such. My impression is that you&#x27;re vastly underestimating the complexities and challenges of those steps. Yes, this is just an appeal authority type argument, but your point is a lot of generalized high level statements without supporting evidence. What you&#x27;re saying could be true, but from my impression it&#x27;s more likely to be magical thinking. I&#x27;d love it to be true, but just because we want something to be true or it sounds nice doesn&#x27;t make it more likely. In fact, we should double our due diligence for claims that tell us what we want to hear.')
