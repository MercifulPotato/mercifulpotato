If you believe it&#x27;s not wrong, it shouldn&#x27;t be either regulated nor educated against.<p>Now, if you do believe it&#x27;s wrong and it should be educated against, how would this work? Do you think that this is wrong beacsue people are going to lose money? Maybe then it makes some sense to give better education, but this is obviously a special moment and it&#x27;s hard to educate people so that they don&#x27;t engage in a social phenomenon. Not to mention, a lot of educated people may be making some pretty educated bets and winning a lot of money; other educated people may just be &#x27;paying&#x27; money for a cause that they believe in.')
