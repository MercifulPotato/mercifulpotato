That is what confuses me. I don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on something that will be always on,  and usually idling,  and finding that its power usage is way higher than I thought. But perhaps there is a metric that tells that. I have not looked closely at it.<p>Also, even though the CPU may draw less, can still the power supply waste more, just because it is beefy? Comparing with a sports car, they have great performance, but also use more gas in ordinary traffic? Can a computer be compared with that?')
