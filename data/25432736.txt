Her pants _are_ visible, so she is not half-dressed, she is just wearing pants that are much more useful for fashion than relaxing, which makes me think she has social activities planned. We also get a fairly large portion of the room in the shot, and it looks expensive and well-cleaned.<p>Again, I didn&#x27;t notice this at all, but I do not think the poster is projecting at all, just reading into different cues.')
