It will be understood by the other person, however they may think that you&#x27;re a bit strange for referring to &quot;an orgy of ants&quot; for instance.<p>That&#x27;s the funny thing about language; it&#x27;s highly contextual, and humans are great at filling in the gaps based on context if there is some part of a communication that is not understood, miscommunicated or not even heard.')
