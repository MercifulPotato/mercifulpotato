Why would you think that it would depend entirely on the ultimatums and the circumstances of each, when we have a long history of racism and sexism, both systemic and individual; when we have a deep body of scholarship on things like unconscious bias and its effect on hiring, job decisions, promotions and punishment; when we have decades of experience successfully mitigating or eliminating the influences of sexism and racism in job actions, and seen the corresponding effects disappear?<p>Really, we <i>know</i> that racism and sexism exist and have impacts even at places like Google.  So when we have a case where the differences with other similar cases are the race and sex of the individual, it would be odd <i>not</i> to conclude that race and sex were probably strong, if not determining, factors.')
