Newspapers...are almost entirely narrative driven but do include the factual description of at least one event around which the stories are based. &quot;Instant&quot; media (e.g. Twitter, TikTok) is even more extreme in being narrative driven.<p>Because of the time commitment involved in consumption, I suspect that long form journalism won&#x27;t ever get the audience that other types of media gets.')
