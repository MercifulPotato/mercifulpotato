I think this has to be more than just about threaded conversations though. A thread isn&#x27;t a great organizing tool for good ideas, just a structure for a linear conversation.<p>Async communication can really shine when the most important&#x2F;engaged with content is the most visible. Reducing the signal to noise ratio is key. I think Aether.app does a good job of this by implementing a familiar forum like voting system[0]. It gives precedence to the important ideas by making it easy to spot the ideas that are getting the most attention&#x2F;support.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aether.app&#x2F;docs&#x2F;features&#x2F;#voting" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aether.app&#x2F;docs&#x2F;features&#x2F;#voting</a>')
