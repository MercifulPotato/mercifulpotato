Eg I&#x27;m pretty sure that the line you quote,<p>&gt; Don&#x27;t use anything from STL that allocates memory, unless you don&#x27;t care about memory management.<p>is not meant condescending but literally. Ergo, if you don&#x27;t care about memory management (which is fine), then feel free to use lots of STL stuff.<p>Case in point: for lots of embedded software, memory matters a lot and it&#x27;s important that it&#x27;s obvious to the reader of the code what memory gets allocated where. The STL classes you quote make this harder to see. But if you have lots of RAM anyway (ie &quot;you don&#x27;t care about memory management&quot;) then this does not matter much.<p>A key goal of this list appears to be, I quote, &quot;Projects written in Orthodox C++ subset will be more acceptable by other C++ projects&quot;. This particular guideline makes it more likely for your code to be deemed acceptable by embedded programmers so it seems to fit. I don&#x27;t think it was intended to be condescending in any way. I think the same holds for the other points.<p>It could&#x27;ve definitely been written a bit clearer though.')
