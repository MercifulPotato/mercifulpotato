Whether its a social network, a game, a fitness app, etc there are many obviously good uses for the end user. Going further it was pretty awesome years ago when there were apps that would connect your contacts to your Facebook friends and they would sync things like birthdays and their profile pictures back to my contacts.<p>The issue is that some asshole had the genius idea of trying to monetize and spam the contacts once they were given and other assholes followed suit. I would never give the 2 way sync permission to some random app anymore and I almost never give the contact permission to bigger apps as well.<p>What I hope is that eventually there becomes some way to determine if my contacts also use an app without the app knowing they are my contacts nor giving up the information of contacts not on the app. That seems like a hard but not impossible task. Eventually I&#x27;d like there to be a safe way to return to the 2 way sync, but I&#x27;m not sure if that is even possible.')
