Its still has a MSRP listing on this page:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;accessories&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;products&#x2F;keyboards&#x2F;natural-ergonomic-keyboard-4000&#x2F;b2m-00012" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;accessories&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;products&#x2F;keyboar...</a><p>Along with a &quot;#1 Best selling brand of ergonomic keyboards&quot; icon that isn&#x27;t on any of the other ms keyboards I just checked.<p>There have been times when they stopped producing them for a while and I thought they were done. But they have come back after a year or so.<p>Although, I was at best buy last year and they were $15 each and I bought the entire stock out of the store and its stashed in my attic. So maybe they are planning on an updated version. The only problem with them is really the keyboard feel is a little squishy, but nowhere near as bad as just about 99% of the other non mechanical keyboards out there.<p>MS has killed the intellimouse a couple times too, and they keep resurrecting it. And it keeps being this crazy good &quot;sleeper&quot; mouse. The latest &quot;Classic Intellimouse&quot; is again maybe the best tracking mouse out there. I just went through my mishmash of various high end mice and swapped them for the classics because I slowly over the span of a year or so (and lots of messing with the tracking on a couple high end logitech mice that cost 4x) came to the conclusion that it simply tracked better on the machine I had one plugged into. I have a desktop resolution that is crazy high, and the combination of sufficient acceleration+fine sampling required to land a mouse pointer on a small button somewhere on the screen is difficult on all but the best mice. I recently found myself struggling to do accurate text selection, swapped in the MS mouse and problem solved. The buttons and infinite scrolling thing on the Logitech&#x2F;etc will be missed, but at the end of the day its about tracking, and MS again delivers.')
