There were two motivations for doing so. First, I was simply curious if I could; I&#x27;d had up to that time a reasonably successful life as a writer, but I&#x27;d never written anything longer than ten pages in my life outside of a classroom setting. Two, my ten-year high school reunion was coming up, and I wanted to be able to say I&#x27;d finished a novel just in case anyone asked (they didn&#x27;t, the bastards).<p>&gt; In sitting down to write the novel, I decided to make it easy on myself. I decided first that I wasn&#x27;t going to try to write something near and dear to my heart, just a fun story. That way, if I screwed it up (which was a real possibility), it wasn&#x27;t like I was screwing up the One Story That Mattered To Me. I decided also that the goal of writing the novel was the actual writing of it -- not the selling of it, which is usually the goal of a novelist. I didn&#x27;t want to worry about whether it was good enough to sell; I just wanted to have the experience of writing a story over the length of a novel, and see what I thought about it. Not every writer is a novelist; I wanted to see if I was.')
