Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=[25832378, 25832607, 25832409], score=None, time=1611054728, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25831789, text='For a 100kWh battery, you&#x27;re taking 6MW of power to charge the battery to full in a minute. 6MW is a small nuclear reactor or a medium sized hydroelectric dam. I cannot imagine a charging station wired for that kind of power being drawn when charging, nor can I imagine a connector that would safely carry this power. It can be done &quot;safely&quot; in the million volt range, but you&#x27;re not going to charge a battery(typically 400-800V) with that. Just for a &quot;fun&quot; calculation, 6MW at 800V is 7500 amps - the cable for it would be bigger and heavier than the car, if it&#x27;s even possible at all. And then finally, I can&#x27;t believe there really exists a battery that just wouldn&#x27;t boil at those rates, nor that we could effectively cool it.')
