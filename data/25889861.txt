Serious enterprises do not like to invest in something if it mean that 10 years later they would have to rewrite their entire codebase again.<p>Even on my home computer, I simply do not have the time to rewrite the many <i>Python</i> 2 scripts that have written over the years that run my computer. — it is cumbersome enough that once in a while part of my desktop stops functioning because my distribution removed a <i>Python</i> 2 library which I had relied upon as a system library that I now have to install as a user library but that was hitherto quite easily fixed.<p>Do these men think that time is free?')
