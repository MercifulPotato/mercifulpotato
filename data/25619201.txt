The &quot;tri-state&quot; is still binary, the third state is to allow attaching multiple outputs to the same bus. Or in the C pseudocode:<p>Regular binary:<p><pre><code>     enum { FALSE, TRUE } value;\n     value = result()\n</code></pre>\nTernary:<p><pre><code>     enum { UNKNOWN, FALSE, TRUE } value;\n     value = result()\n    </code></pre>\nTri-state (as Z80 and every modern computer does it):<p><pre><code>     enum { FALSE, TRUE } value;\n     if (enabled())\n        value = result()\n</code></pre>\n(the idea is you might have multiple components driving the same &quot;value&quot;, and only one of them should be enabled at a time. Bad things happen if more than one is enabled at a time, or none are)')
