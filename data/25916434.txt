Item(by='thu2111', descendants=None, kids=[25917152, 25916855], score=None, time=1611673149, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25914864, text='<i>There was fury about Belgian authorities taking away sandwiches etc from UK lorry drivers</i><p>That happened once and people were right to be furious because the Dutch customs guy was a dick. No rule requires him to confiscate the lunch of lorry drivers and then say &quot;Welcome to Brexit&quot;. It&#x27;s that kind of nasty backstabbing pettiness that makes EU ideology so deeply unattractive that the UK voted to leave.<p>Nonetheless it&#x27;s hilarious that so far despite the EU&#x27;s best efforts to create as many problems as possible via &quot;work to rule&quot; type approaches, the media focuses on that. The EU-loving media class spent years telling people that if the UK <i>dared</i> to leave this horrible organisation there&#x27;d be immediate shortages of medicine. Now they have to hype up stories about dickish border guards whilst desperately trying to hide the fact that literally weeks after Brexit happened there are medicine shortages <i>in the EU</i>. People who argued against Brexit have been wrong about so many things so far I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised but that one still takes the biscuit.')
