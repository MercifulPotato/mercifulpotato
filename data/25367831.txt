Item(by='JoshTriplett', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607560620, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25355745, text='&gt; I also see it pointed out that DoH could have been specified in a way that facilitated filtering for the local network. Given that it&#x27;s so obviously possible<p>No, it couldn&#x27;t have been, and this is exactly what I was referring to in my comment. Any mechanism that allows the local network to intercept the traffic of a device that doesn&#x27;t trust the network can and will be abused. The entire point of DoH was to make DNS clients secure, by preventing ISPs and other network providers from monitoring, intercepting, or tampering with DNS results.<p>You&#x27;re asking for DNS to be left insecure, so that you can tamper with it. You&#x27;re asking for the security of clients that <i>actually</i> give users control (laptops, phones, etc) to be sacrificed so that you can continue to tamper with DNS results for clients that <i>don&#x27;t</i> give users control.<p>&gt; On top of all that, DNSSEC already exists which allows you to verify the authenticity of the query result.<p>DNSSEC isn&#x27;t nearly widespread enough to expect to find it everywhere. Only very specialized clients could make it a requirement; most clients cannot. DNSSEC requires upgrading most of the world before people can rely on it; DoH is an incremental solution.<p>&gt; As such, the argument in favor of DoH would seem to be limited to preventing your DNS resolver (but not your ISP or VPN!) from tracking which sites you visit.<p>SNI is being fixed. Once SNI is fixed, DNS is one of the last holes that allows your ISP or other network provider to track you.<p>And as mentioned above, since DNSSEC is not a viable solution anytime soon, DoH is <i>also</i> critically important to prevent ISPs and other network providers to tamper with your DNS results.')
