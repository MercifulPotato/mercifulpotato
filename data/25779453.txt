However, only very few people bother to do it.<p>In so far as to how dangerous it is, there are 630,000 legal full-auto&#x2F;select-fire weapons in the US.  They do require a Class III license to purchase and own and there have been no new ones since 1986.  As I recall, of those 630,000, only 3 have been used illegally since 1934 and 2 of those were, ironically, by cops.')
