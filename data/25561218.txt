Also being able to run multiple seasons worth of crops.<p>That the rich and naturally irrigated soils of the midwest and northeast are basically only used for animal feed agriculture now is a real shame from an economic diversification and health POV but also from an environmental perspective. Giant swathes of topsoil are depleted every year, and fertilizer and pesticide runoff pollutes entire drainage basins of these regions.<p>Cash crop agriculture like this is highly capital intensive, so squeezes out smaller operators, and does very little to support the surrounding towns.')
