Item(by='ska', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608247130, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25460173, text='I typically do, although some dinners or lunches will have a component that is reheated (e.g., reheat some frozen braise from last weekend, but with fresh cooked veg and potatoes, say.)<p>If I&#x27;m in a hurry, there are lots of things I can make in 30 min or less.  More often if I&#x27;m busy I&#x27;ll make something that doesn&#x27;t require much interaction; e.g. 10-15 min prep and 60 nearly untouched in a 500 degree oven for a roast chicken with root veg in one pan.  I do other things in that hour.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;ve been doing this long enough I&#x27;m pretty efficient.  I could save a little time buying more prepared food, but my meal quality would go way down so I don&#x27;t mind.  Shopping is pretty efficient too, as I mostly don&#x27;t shop by recipe.<p>To be fair though, I find cooking relaxing as a way to wind down after work, so sometimes I&#x27;ll do something more involved just for the hell of it on a random Wednesday.')
