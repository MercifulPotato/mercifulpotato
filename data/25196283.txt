I had it running for a while without the prometheus operator, and I didn’t have any issue.<p>In the beginning I was even running everything on a one $10&#x2F;mo “cluster” (cheapest DO offers). Even Postgres and Redis, all inside the cluster.<p>As I got more customers, I needed something less risky, so added more nodes, and moved the database out.<p>But to be honest even the 1 instance $10 cluster was fine.')
