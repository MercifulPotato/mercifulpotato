I think we need to find the balance between &quot;no&#x2F;hardly work from home&quot; vs &quot;never come in office&quot;. Employers have to be flexible about letting employees work from home whenever needed. When I was an employee, I wanted flexibility to sometimes do that when needed. I usually wanted to go to office because I like getting out of the house. I get that some people love working from home 100% but I am a big proponent of finding a balance and not going extreme one way or the other.')
