Currently in Finland we have chargers like this. They&#x27;re known in the EV circles to be utter shit and don&#x27;t work more often than they do. The station does show in all maps, but if you check the reviews it&#x27;s all red.<p>The reason is that the owner bought them from a random company, they installed it and do have a service contract - the problem is that the service queues are measured in weeks and spare parts are scarce.<p>The same thing is with chargers on the parking lots of some chain stores. Corporate has mandated that there has to be X charging spots - enter &#x2F;r&#x2F;maliciouscompliance - ok boss, here&#x27;s the charger. Does it work? No. Do they care? No. Does corporate actually care? No, they can quote numbers of installed charging stations in their quarterly reports.<p>Meanwhile bigger operators standardise on one station provider, have their own trained staff and a stockpile of common spare parts. A few even frequent the local EV driver FB groups and interact with their customer base there.')
