Item(by='enkimute', descendants=None, kids=[25253351], score=None, time=1606737991, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25252822, text='Absolutely :<p><i></i>Algebraically<i></i> we can always use the Hodge dual and its inverse to move to&#x2F;from k-vectors from&#x2F;to n-k vectors.<p><i></i>Geometrically<i></i> we can always say two points define a line or two lines define a point.<p><i></i>Group Theory<i></i> - here we can&#x27;t swap. Two reflections make a rotation but two rotations do not make a reflection. So reflections are &#x27;naturally&#x27; grade 1.<p>If you want everything to fit intuitively together, you want reflections to be grade 1, and by consequence hyperplanes (lines in 2D, planes in 3D, etc) to be grade 1 (i.e. vectors).<p>Doing it the other way around is possible but will be more verbose and less intuitive. (also with &#x27;reflections&#x27; as natural grade 1 elements, the move from Euclidean to Conformal becomes trivial, simply reflect in (hyper)spheres instead, in this space it is also easier to see that the two approaches are not equivalent, it is natural to say that (in 2D) the &#x27;meet&#x27; of two circles is a point pair, but not that the &#x27;join&#x27; of two points is a point pair. (why would it not be a line just like in PGA?)).<p>Imho, one should learn to appreciate both halves of the picture, as for each specific problem one of them might be more natural. (for the popular Euclidean group and its associated geometry this view we&#x27;re not used to may very well be more intuitive one, imho).')
