Item(by='togs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611083195, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25809846, text='When it comes to suffering, for me it tends to be like &quot;I&#x27;ll be much happier when this is over&quot;, or &quot;Oh God, make it stop&quot;, like I&#x27;m on the verge of throwing up in my mind and waiting for merciful release. And then eventually I get fit and more attractive and slightly more confident. Sometimes I even want the pain. No idea why. It&#x27;s certainly not rational. Thinking about it probably makes it worse.<p>So Nike probably got it close (&quot;Just do it.&quot;), but I think a more accurate slogan is &quot;Don&#x27;t think about it beforehand--just do it, y&#x27;know, for a little while, unless it hurts really bad, in which case you should stop doing it and consider seeking medical attention.&quot;<p>Suffering sucks. It sucks especially when there&#x27;s nobody to see&#x2F;tell about it&#x2F;nobody cares, no prestige, or sense of moral worth to be derived from it. If I jog by myself, I&#x27;m a nobody. If I jog on a team I&#x27;m part of a story. I think this is why jogging around the neighborhood doesn&#x27;t stick. It just sucks, all by itself, and you may even get heckled for it. Nobody cares, and if they do it&#x27;s for the wrong reasons. By myself I&#x27;m not contributing to anything besides my ego.<p>I think my class bias shows clearly here. This middle-class type of suffering is voluntary...<p>I was going to write more, but that&#x27;s all I have for now.')
