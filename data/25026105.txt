It seems quite nice &quot;in the small&quot;.<p>But I&#x27;m a programmer and I make heavy use of my machines. I expect performance.<p>For example, I&#x27;m creating a column of numbers. In emacs, I wrote a keyboard macro to update the 10s column (i.e. 10 0s, then 10 1s, up to 10 9s) because who needs to type 100 numbers and 200 arrow keys?<p>In Linux this keyboard macro updates 100 lines and runs as fast as a single keystroke.<p>In WSL it takes MINUTES to run. And when it completes, the next keystroke takes minutes. In frustration I started doing the same task by hand. It worked fine until I had about 1000 lines at which point I could watch the screen updates lag so badly I had to wait for the machine. The performance continued to degrade. Apparently they are updating the whole files worth of screen on every keystroke. At 2000 lines I could go for coffee while it updated my last 10 keystrokes.<p>Normally I would consider this a bug. However over the years I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that Windows is a pretty toy. It works wonderfully &quot;in the small&quot;. But it isn&#x27;t useful for significant programmer workloads (like typing :-) ).<p>If you think you can use it anything significant, like program development, think again.<p>Your mileage may vary (but I suspect your odometer will be lagged :-) )')
