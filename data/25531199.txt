I remember dozens of edge cases that involved errors and back buttons and flash scope and on at least one occasion, jquery plugins.<p>Or back buttons and CSRF tokens and flash scope...<p>Or, let&#x27;s talk about a common use case. Someone starts filling in a form, and then they need to look at another page to get more information. (This other page may take too long to load and isn&#x27;t worth putting in the workflow, or it was cut from scope to place the information twice.) So, they go out to another page, then back, and are flustered because they were part way through the work.<p>So, if you want this to work, you&#x27;re going to need state management in the client anyway. (Usually using SessionStorage these days, I&#x27;d presume?) So, then, we&#x27;ve already done part of the work for state management. You are then playing the &quot;which is right, the server or the client&quot; game.<p>You accumulate enough edge cases and UX tweaks, and you&#x27;re half way down the SPA requirements anyway.<p>Now, hopefully Hotwire will solve a large number of these problems. I&#x27;m going to play with it, but the SPA approaches have solved so many of the edge cases via code and patterns.')
