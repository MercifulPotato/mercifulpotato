Obviously the legislature doesn&#x27;t like it, or the original law wouldn&#x27;t have passed. If it wasn&#x27;t essentially unmodifiable then the legislature would just annul it via amendment. There didn&#x27;t need to be a measure allowing to be amended by the legislature at all, the 7&#x2F;8th requirement is just in there to allow the legislature to do non-contentious fixup changes.')
