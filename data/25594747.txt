That&#x27;s a weird definition of success, if I may say so.<p>As-is, people will need to drive 2.5 hours from SF to Merced, wait for a train, take a 1.5 hour train ride to Bakersfield, then rent a car and drive another 1.5 hours from Bakersfield to LA.<p>All that saves about 1 hour of travel time (at the most!)... but requires renting a car, gas, etc.<p>Basically, this thing is completely useless. Finally the government realized this and cancelled the entire project.<p>Yet, the California Tax Payers that voted for the $30 Billion Bond Measure will continue to pay the extra taxes for decades to come...')
