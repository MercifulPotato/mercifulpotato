For reasons.<p>The energy density of the plasma is necessarily so low that a useful power plant would be absolutely monstrous. Then, it would destroy itself with neutron flux in short order, leaving thousands of tons of radioactive scrap. There is no possibility of such a plant being competitive with solar and wind at current prices, and they are still on their way down.<p>The prospect of commercial power generation is not the driver of fusion research. Rather, it is a jobs program for high neutron flux physicists, to maintain a population available to draw upon for weapons work. So, expect it to continue burning $billions indefinitely, with no deliverable.')
