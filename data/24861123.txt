At standard LA prices of $3.50 (right now), that was $112 every time the tank was refilled. A normal sedan like a 2020 Camry has a 14 gallon tank, which would cost approximately $49 to refill.<p>How much you pay for electricity depends on where you live, so it&#x27;s very possible that a Hummer EV would cost less than an ICE sedan on a refueling cost basis.')
