A company could only afford to hold onto a patent for as long as it causes the companyâ€™s revenue to grow exponentially. Once the patented technology matures and growth plateaus, keeping the patent would become prohibitively expensive. This would completely eliminate patent trolls and patent squatting&#x2F;speculative patents.')
