Jeopardy! and The Sound of Music are the two things my grandparents (b. 1920 and 1921, now deceased) and I (b. 1981) could always watch together and enjoy. Even when I was a 17 y&#x2F;o delinquent shit I could always watch Trebek with grandma, and it just felt good. As others have mentioned - the passing if Mr.s. Trebek and Connery is the end of generation-spanning eras. Iâ€™m having a few too many drinks tonight as my own way of remembering them.')
