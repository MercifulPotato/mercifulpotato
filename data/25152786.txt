I think the general public is usually frustrated by &quot;missing out&quot; on IPOs as they are gated to accredited investors&#x2F;hedgefunds&#x2F;VC funds. Having a monetary value gating entrance to be an accredited investor(assets over $1 not including house, or income over $300k for 3 consecutive years) seems exclusionary but it really shields the average public from getting pulled in by hucksters selling bad investments. Having these checks in place most times ensures that the person who invests in risky assets is informed and knows what they are doing. That being said people who match the requirements for a AC investor can and do make some really bad investments.')
