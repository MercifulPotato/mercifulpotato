A lot of it was perfectly legal as long as it wasn&#x27;t overboard (funding grocery shopping as business expenses for example), wasn&#x27;t recurring and wasn&#x27;t too high without reason (funding your wedding as a business expense for instance).<p>The UK tax laws are a joke. As told to me by multiple HMRC auditors, and my accountant (who is funnily a former HMRC auditor). The US&#x27; laws are an even bigger joke. After incorporating on the mainland, I&#x27;ve found that Swiss&#x2F;Liechtensteiner&#x2F;Luxembourgian tax laws are actually pretty decent and exacting, in spite of them being criticized as a tax haven and all.<p>Also, was neighbours with a ton of Arab guys in Knightsbridge who used to offset the risk of being caught (since they were into active money laundering), by donating to the Tories. Disgusting, but it is what it is.')
