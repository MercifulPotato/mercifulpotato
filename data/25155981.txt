Most of the kids who end up at Texas State are the ones who did not study in High School - - - or, they just don&#x27;t have the smarts or the motivation.  The local town police and the local bars feed off the freshman and suck as much money off them as they can (new crop every year). Crime has gone WAY up, likely due to the increased minority enrollment. Not a racist thing, just FACTUAL reality.')
