Religious practices  in violation of social duties or subversive of good order are not protected under free exercise of religion (Reynolds v. United States).<p>In particular, it&#x27;s a nigh-certainty that discrimination in matters of employment based on caste will be ruled illegal under Title VII (a fortiori, even employer or customer&#x27;s preference for individuals of a particular _religion_ cannot be taken into account; a fortiori intra-religious preferences will not be taken into account either. This is almost certainly what will happen in California v. Cisco).')
