It&#x27;s almost certain that whatever languages you are used to, they have a much larger pile of gotchas than Haskell (because Haskell has an atypical small number of them), but that doesn&#x27;t stop them from being useful.<p>&quot;Yeah well your language isn&#x27;t good either&quot; isn&#x27;t a very good argument for why a language is _better_. If the idea is &quot;Haskell works better than other languages as long as you happen to know how to make it so&quot;, isn&#x27;t that just every language that exists? Due to Haskell&#x27;s branding, I was under the impression that the issues the above user is describing should be impossible. If Haskell doesn&#x27;t even make good on those guarantees, but instead shifts that guarantee as &quot;Things you should&#x27;ve known not to do&quot; onto the user, how is that different from any other language?<p><i>edit</i> And since this thread has a lot of tension and vague hostility, I will add, I am not attacking you or the language you enjoy. I legitimately would like to better understand.')
