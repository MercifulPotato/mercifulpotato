I mean, even if he said something inappropriate it just doesn&#x27;t make business sense. People say all kind of inappropriate things all the time. If a comment violates your policy have a chat with them and continue normally. Firing an employee is very expensive. Firing them over inappropriate comment is also demoralizing to the rest of the team.<p>I mean it&#x27;s better to have some co-workers who are dicks, some that call you a grammar nazi and maybe even some who disagree with you politically than to play a Russian roulette with words every day - you never know which one is loaded and terminates your career.')
