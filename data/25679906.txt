You disrupt the government in such a way that the rule of law fails.<p>Come on. Rule of law doesn&#x27;t stop working just because a couple of politicians don&#x27;t get to sign papers on schedule. If it was that easy, the country wouldn&#x27;t last a month without a successful coup.<p>&gt; In fact, it&#x27;s been reported that at least one Trump goal was to push certification out beyond the 11 day (I think, details are fuzzy) deadline in the electoral count act and force the house to decide.<p>I&#x27;d think the supreme court would have to decide if that&#x27;s constitutional. If it is, then it&#x27;s a crazy legal loophole and Trump would just be the first to exploit it.<p>&gt; You&#x27;re simply saying that it didn&#x27;t work.<p>No. I&#x27;m saying that this &quot;insurrection&quot; is being blown out of proportion. Biden is elected. Trump has called his goons home.<p>&gt;  It is VERY easy to imagine an alternate universe where Pelosi and Pence are still being held hostage right now.<p>Sure, but moving forward, should we judge these people by what one might imagine <i>could have happened</i>, not what actually happened? I don&#x27;t think so.')
