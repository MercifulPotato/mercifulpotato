The break-even bar for a reasonable monolith is a lot lower than for microservices, so the GP&#x27;s question is specifically asking, under a hypothetical where the team simply uses a monolith, what benefits the team would miss out on relative to microservices. If there are none, or they aren&#x27;t relevant to the project scenario, then microservices probably isn&#x27;t justifiable.<p>(I, too, am in the position of pushing back against microservices for hotness&#x27; sake.)')
