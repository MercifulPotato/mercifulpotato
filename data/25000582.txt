These people aren&#x27;t going to say no based on your CI system.<p>Having made the mistake myself (multiple times), OP is 100% correct, and it&#x27;s one of those messages that can&#x27;t have any nuance, or people won&#x27;t do it right. It&#x27;s a treacherous vortex of failure for programmers-turned-founders: coding is much easier and more familiar than selling, so you find all sorts of reasons to write code when you should be talking to customers.')
