There is nothing wrong with nuclear families if you add in something like &quot;nuclear communities&quot;.<p>In many small towns or suburban cities, 3 generations live nearby, with all the aunts and uncles. Help with care is always next door, and children are raised with dozens of frequent visitors or caretakers. I&#x27;m quite jealous of the quality of life of my inlaws &#x2F; extended family for these reasons.')
