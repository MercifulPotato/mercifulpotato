The WGA didn&#x27;t just say &quot;our members aren&#x27;t interested in working under these conditions&quot;; they issued angry denouncements of anyone who did work, sabotaged production company efforts to find temporary replacements for guild writers, and recruited friends in adjacent jobs to strike with them. For over four months, the industry was just on pause, and there was nothing anyone could do about it until the union monopoly and producer monopoly reached an agreement.<p>I have nothing but respect for the many workers who <i>have</i> to unionize, because they won&#x27;t receive acceptable pay and working conditions unless they do. If the WGA feels that writers are in that position, I&#x27;m not going to tell them they&#x27;re wrong. But I don&#x27;t think software engineers are, and I have no interest in working in an environment where my coworkers might disappear for four months and demand nobody else step in to do their jobs.')
