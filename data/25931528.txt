Because the inflation is concentrated at the top, the people at the bottom won&#x27;t get priced out of the things they need.  They&#x27;re not getting priced out of anything they couldn&#x27;t have afforded 20 years ago.<p>A nice house that cost $100k in 1999 costs $200k today.<p>A fabulous house that cost $500k in 1999 costs $5,000k today.')
