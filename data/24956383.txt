Examples of shenanigans that can be pulled that a term sheet would address:<p>* With an even split, in theory any two employees could declare a 200k dividend and walk away with 50k in pocket on day one.<p>* Similarly, the CEO and chairman could decide to oust you if things start going well since they own half the company.<p>* Where’s the stock pool for potential future employees?
