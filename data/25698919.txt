This is of course completely imaginary. Liability wouldn&#x27;t be avoided by simply publishing everything.<p>Others assert that Facebook has had a shitty net effect on society and could be punished if not for 230. This is a little closer to reality but provides no conceptual framework for deciding what obligations Facebook has or how it meets them.<p>I don&#x27;t believe that any reasonable solution starts with repealing 230 because fixing the internet one lawsuit at a time is horribly expensive, intractable, suffers from challenges as to jurisdiction and anonymity, unavailable to 90% of the planet.<p>Instead if you do not like the current state figure out how to articulate Facebooks obligations to society.')
