There are millions of single board computer knock off versions of the Pi, new ones coming out every day with different features. None of them catch on. Why would a random new SBC, even at the exact same price or lower, have any chance of replacing the Pi with no identifiably better user facing features other than “it isn’t Arm and it does the exact same thing or less things!!! And it is vastly incompatible with all the software ecosystem and uses you actually care about!”<p>This is like me handing you a RISC-V iPhone (same price) and 30% of the apps work. Would you ever, ever, ever switch? No.<p>Sorry, Arm architecture skyrocketed to popularity because of an ultra long term strategy and a few rocket ship design wins like Android and the iPhone. I am afraid the door is shut.<p>Tizen might have been a good idea, but without a rocket ship to subsidize the improvements of the OS, it died. RISC-V boards are not different.<p>I am looking for a rocket ship, which is a new high volume use case which is not properly covered by the current set of solutions. Self driving cars? AI cameras? Robots? Nothing looks like it needs RISC-V in particular, none of it seems likely to produce iPhone scale novel designs that will eat the rest of the market out from Under arm.')
