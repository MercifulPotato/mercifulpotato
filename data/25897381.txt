I recently changed the pricing model, as the one-time payment was not sustainable, so the product has now an upfront cost + optional yearly maintenance fee (you can use it forever, but if you want new features and support you should support it).<p>I have used many amazing open-source projects that got abandoned over the years, I would have gladly paid for many of them if that meant sustaining the future development of the project. And, before anyone mentions it, donations are not the answer.<p>(I left the same comment on the article)')
