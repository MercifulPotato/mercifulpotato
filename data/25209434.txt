Head over 4chan and you&#x27;ll see a factory line of ideas being thrown at the wall to see what sticks - which is then further spread across social media.<p>If you were a foreign power and wanted to sow discord in a rival country, you had to buy off dozens of journalists and funnel money to media houses and hope that they&#x27;d at least be secretive, if not effective.<p>Now you can just pop open Photoshop, come up with 10 memes in 30 minutes, and use your sock puppet accounts to spread them everywhere - an operation that a single person can handle all by himself.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly naive to think that social media is not absolutely flooded with propaganda and counter-propaganda by malicious actors. And it&#x27;s only going to hasten the collapse in democratically minded countries across the world.')
