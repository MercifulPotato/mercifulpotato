You&#x27;re going straight in spacetime, but spacetime is curved by the mass of the Earth so you&#x27;re following that curve into the center.<p>The surface of the Earth keeps you from actually falling in, and is therefore pushing you away or upwards from the center. This is the acceleration acting on your straight line path through curved spacetime. This is the deviation from your geodesic.')
