People shopped online instead of going to the mall.  Network is over capacity.  UPS is hit the hardest because they took new business in without having the capacity.  Capacity goes like this.  Carrier has X capacity.  At 2X capacity stuff starts to fall apart which is your normal BFCM.  We’re at 8X capacity.  Stuff is just sitting in trailers and probably won’t get handled till next week that’s if you can get your stuff picked up.')
