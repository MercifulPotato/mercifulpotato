I hadn&#x27;t noticed the lack of it but I will eventually. To be fair, markdown is supposed to be readable and meaningful in plain text, so even if the symbols are displayed without formatting it&#x27;s still useful.<p>&gt; - Poor support on windows desktop<p>I have not used the Windows app, but the macOS app is infinitely better than WhatsApp&#x27;s shoddy WebUI.')
