The best way to earn more money is to reach more people (read: increase market share). You can think of prices as indicators of inefficiencies. The high price invites participation which causes competition. The players, driven by greed or desire for profit, seek to eliminate competition (or become monopolies in their field). With the right legal incentives this competition is healthy and innovation leads to lower prices to gain market share. Again, market share == people, and poor people are included in that group.<p>From this perspective, Capitalism (or &quot;the market&quot;) can be viewed as a tool governments can use to increase the quality of life of its citizens.<p>Granted this explanation is a bit banal and hand wavey and leaves out a ton of stuff (consider impacts on jobs for instance); this is an internet post not a thesis on economics. :) Hayek, Mises, and Friedman are good sources if you care to explore more.')
