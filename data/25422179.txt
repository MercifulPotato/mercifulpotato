Amazon, Google, Microsoft start building their own chips for their own clouds.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;ec2&#x2F;graviton&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;ec2&#x2F;graviton&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; 5. If you want to develop for AWS you&#x27;ll be safer to have a laptop with an Amazon chip,<p>Since I mostly work on Java that runs at Amazon, I develop locally using Amazon Corretto (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;corretto&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;corretto&#x2F;</a>), less for performance than for greater confidence I won&#x27;t run issues between JVM differences when deploying at AWS.<p>&gt; Or we&#x27;ll end up with 5 different laptops (unlikely) or one that connects to a remote desktop running in the appropriate cloud with the correct chip.<p>We&#x27;re already there when deploying Python with dependencies that need to be compiled from a different OS. The options that I&#x27;ve used so far are 1. Only using pure Python dependencies, which mostly works, and 2. Running a container locally. Thinking about the CPU you&#x27;re going to be running on might make sense if you&#x27;re working on native code, but it probably won&#x27;t be a big deal.')
