They&#x27;d say the name of a game, and describe it as e.g. &quot;it&#x27;s worker placement with area control&quot;, and that was the end of their description and analysis of the game. Seems to me they&#x27;re missing a fair bit of nuance and more importantly, it doesn&#x27;t tell me anything about how likely it is I&#x27;d enjoy the game. Oh well, to each their own. ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯')
