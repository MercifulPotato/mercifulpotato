Why would builders and landlords give up such an obvious advantageous arrangement?<p>People are pushing for change, common holds are slowly becoming a thing. But ultimately there’s a housing shortage in the U.K, and beggars can’t be choosers. It sucks, but you can’t argue with reality.<p>&gt; &quot;Purchasing&quot; one of these &quot;long-leases&quot; strikes me as doublespeak, a gimmick no different from prepaying 99 years of rent. Ownership doesn&#x27;t expire.<p>It’s just like purchasing a future, or any other time bounded asset. Your purchasing the opportunity in a manner of speaking, your ownership of the lease never expires, it just becomes worthless after 99 years.')
