Item(by='mschuster91', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607195248, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25317108, text='&gt; Of course, there’s also the simple thing of “enterprise stuff costs more for no reason.”<p>That &quot;no reason&quot; is usually a combination of the following:<p>1) Support avenues - commercial customers want rapid support in case something breaks, including overnight &#x2F; on-site repair. That infrastructure costs more money compared to consumer appliances where the customers have to ship stuff to a central repair place.<p>2) Quality. Consumers are used to stuff failing after 3 years and get the next new hot thing, commercial customers want a decade or more in life span with as few maintenance calls as possible - and especially they don&#x27;t want to redesign enclosures when the model is no longer available so they demand longer shipping times - again, on the order of 10 years or more. Also, these displays generally have to work in a wide variety of environments - directly in sunlight&#x2F;heat&#x2F;cold, vibrating&#x2F;otherwise moving. Higher quality components cost <i>a lot</i> more money. Add more money for certifications required for medical or military deployments.<p>3) Spare parts. Again, the longer availability terms mean more costs for the support infrastructure - while for ordinary TVs the parts stock can be emptied out after 3-5 years, stock has to be kept around for way longer for commercial TVs, and that includes buying up spare parts when a supplier EOLs a part.<p>4) Features. Commercial TVs tend to have more selection of (rare) inputs, e.g. BNC or SDI (the latter to drive an array of screens around a spread-out location from a single signal source, you can&#x27;t do that with HDMI).<p>5) Firmware. After three to four years no manufacturer except Apple gives a flying f..k about the firmware, which means security holes go unpatched. Commercial customers demand longer update cycles (and better validated ones), again that costs more money.<p>6) Vandalism and elements protection. This one is <i>huge</i> and ties into the quality part. While your home TV won&#x27;t need to be protected much against anything, vandals <i>will</i> go and attack anything without mercy - with anything from graffiti over hammer blows to hydrofluoric acid. Add to that nature: bird crap, vomit, tree sap, pollen, drunkards stumbling into your digital signage... or humidity&#x2F;harsh rain.<p>7) Loss of revenue from advertising, as you mentioned.')
