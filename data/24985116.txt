This isn&#x27;t even remotely a controversial statement in economics.<p>Unless your argument is that the Austrian and Chicago schools of economics doesn&#x27;t actually exist, this is quite wrong, since the Austrian school denies the existence of natural monopoly and argues that harmful monopoly can only exist as a product of government regulation, and the Chicago school likewise holds that absent regulation, monopoly is a transient condition, not a stable one; both favor removing regulations that they see as stabilizing harmful monopolies, rather than regulating to manage naturally-formed-and-self-stabilizing monopolies, which they don&#x27;t acknowledge the existence of.<p>Now, I think the Chicago&#x2F;Austrian positions on monopolies are wrong, but you really can&#x27;t reasonably deny that this is a fundamental area of controversy.')
