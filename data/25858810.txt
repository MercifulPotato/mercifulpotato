And that&#x27;s being charitable and assuming you&#x27;re sincere). Giving that voice oxygen is making the matter worse.<p>Cinnamon tried to re-invent the wheel. They made it very sparkly and shiny and colourful and forgot that it had to be robust, round and capable of rolling.<p>Jesus wept, you criticise other people for not reading the entire discussion, and yet you somehow missed the part in JWZ&#x27;s post where he explains that Cinnamon-screensaver was NOT written from scratch. So congratulations, you hypocritically own-goaled yourself there too. Which again, makes me question the charitability of assuming sincerity.<p>And JWZ is supposed to &quot;work with them&quot; when their code fouls up for the Nth time? No, the idiots should&#x27;ve been writing modules for JWZ&#x27;s engine, seeing as JWZ&#x27;s is the one that a) they did indeed steal from and b) still screwed up.<p>Yes, he&#x27;s voiced his valid criticisms before. And the damn Cinnamon tards STILL KEEP MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES. This adds to the discussion. It adds useful, educational history that the Cinnamon morons are so stupid that they repeatedly, in the face of history, keep making the same goddamn stupid mistakes.<p>I get to &quot;the other side of the road&quot; just fine with JWZ&#x27;s screensaver. I just FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO had to step the housemate through replacing her new Mint install&#x27;s Cinnamon screensaver with xscreensaver; because what a surprise, it&#x27;s 2021 and the $hitpile that is Cinnamon screensaver lock would NOT RESPOND to keyboard or mouse and wouldn&#x27;t let her log in. And either she had to either magic-sysrq, or I had to ssh in to the root account to kill the stupid pile of crap that is cinnamon-screensaver.<p>And I found this ridiculous comment on this thread, because I was trying to show her a reference as to WHY Cinnamon-screensaver is stupidly broken in its principles and why xscreensaver should be used instead.<p>Clement Lefebvre has some pretty big balls to have written what he did; and that&#x27;s good. Because it&#x27;ll make it easier to repeatedly kick him in them as he deserves for this. And defence of his positions is... not particularly defensible.<p>I don&#x27;t <i>wish</i> to be rude to you; but I finally stopped lurking on HN after <i>years</i> and created an account for the purpose of telling you these things. And by years, I mean that my Slashdot ID is in the 500,000s, rather than say the 60-millions.')
