Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602173598, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24720233, text='&gt; Where are the expert witnesses in this case?<p>Expert witnesses play a role in trials, they play no direct role in appeals where fact claims (to the extent they are reviewable at all, which is normally limited when, as in this case, there is a jury-trial-by-right, because otherwise you obviate the right to a jury trial, though its worth noting one of the issues in this case is that the Federal Circuit tossed aside the jury verdict using a standard which is not usually appropriate for review of fact questions in such a scenario) are decided by review of the trial record and, to the extent that the trial record is not sufficient, remand to the lower courts for further proceedings with legal guidance.<p>&gt; Do we really expect judges in their 60s and 70s to understand basics of coding in order to come to the right conclusion?<p>We expect the parties to have developed their fact claims at trial or, failing that, to be able to explain to judges why any issues needing factual evidence are insufficiently developed in the trial evidence such that if they were critical it would require remand (and the reason better be something like &quot;we were improperly prevented by the trial court from presenting evidence&quot; or &quot;this is a issue that somehow was allowed to be raised for the first time on appeal so we had no opportunity to present evidence on it at trial&quot;.)')
