NICE is shown writing populist dreck for the equivalent of the Mail, and at the same time, publishing densely worded scholarly essays, to achieve the same manipulation in different groups of people. It is remarked on that the readers of the intelligent publications are further manipulated into liking the material aimed at them by the existence of the populist material, as they are eager to demonstrate their intellectual superiority by reading credulously publications they seem superior.')
