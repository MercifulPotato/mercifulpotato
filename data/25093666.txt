Probably, statistically, apple will know better.<p>On the other hand, despite the above, if you want to call apple devices &quot;owned&quot; (vs &quot;leased&quot;) then yes, the user <i>must</i> be the ultimate decision maker. They might <i>want</i> to delegate these things to apple (or someone else for that matter) most of the time. But they must have the <i>possibility</i> to simply run what <i>they</i> want.<p>I think we&#x27;re seeing the &quot;HN crowd&quot; be so frustrated about this because it is a pretty transparently anti freedom thing to do, and HN folks do love themselves some freedom.')
