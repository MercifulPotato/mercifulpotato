The first thing is where one is doing something non-obvious on account of an unintuitive (and possibly undocumented) fact about either the problem domain or some remote part of the the system that it is infeasible to change; the second is some non-obvious corner-case (a subtle issue of thread- or exception-safety, for example); and the third is where the algorithm itself is non-obvious (Jon Bentley wrote of a colleage who found that one of his algorithms had beem &#x27;fixed&#x27; and &#x27;improved&#x27; to the point where it was no longer efficient; a suitable comment might have avoided that (and there&#x27;s also the famous &#x2F;* You are not expected to understand this *&#x2F;, for which no mere restructuring or renaming seems to offer an effective alternative.))<p>I am sure you are aware of these exceptions, but not everyone on the comment-deprecating bandwagon seem to do so.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lions%27_Commentary_on_UNIX_6th_Edition,_with_Source_Code#%22You_are_not_expected_to_understand_this%22" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lions%27_Commentary_on_UNIX_6t...</a>')
