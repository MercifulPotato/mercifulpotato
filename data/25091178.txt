People were installing without understanding what the app did, subsequently uninstalling again as memory is scarce. Its hard to understand, but sometimes people just browse and download things out of boredom, curiosity or because they misunderstand what the app is for.<p>We also had complaints like yours &quot;I didn&#x27;t install this app&quot; but when we contacted them direct (googled name, sent email&#x2F;FB message) we often found that a spouse &#x2F; kid had done so. Shared phones are common.<p>Im not sure if this could be related to your circumstances, it depends on the type of app you have. Also if its something that a kid may download, recent events may contribute. With covid there are lots of kids using their parents devices at home, with low cost &#x2F; free data plans in place to support online schooling.')
