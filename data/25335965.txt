Guitar centric music may not be popular anymore, but you&#x27;ll find guitars in a lot of places these days.<p>There&#x27;s also a trend towards guitarists that play with samplers and loopers and perform live that way.<p>I see plenty of new guitar music on youtube in a huge variety of styles and genres.<p>I also frequently hear guitars, albeit hidden under layers of effects, in hip-hop and electronic music. I think guitar music is a long ways from dead.<p>Rock and its derivitives and the typical 4 or 5 piece drum, bass and guitar ensemble may be dead, but guitars are doing just fine and I think if anything, there&#x27;s so many more avenues available for incorporating guitars into music with a lower barrier of entry than previously.<p>Someone can actually sound pretty decent strumming a few chords, looping them and playing with the sound without needing to learn as much.<p>It&#x27;s not the same, but guitars are everywhere and these days they&#x27;re even being incorporated with midi technology or other things to let you do some crazy stuff with them.<p>Also, trends come and go at some point you&#x27;ll get a group of young people who wanna rebel against the &#x27;digital electronic sounds&#x27; the older people like and suddenly discover acoustic instruments and stuff again, they&#x27;ll be new and cool, the even older people will shake their fists and say things like<p>&#x27;those darned kids, we used to play real instruments before any of that electronic stuff came along&#x27;<p>and the cycle will continue.')
