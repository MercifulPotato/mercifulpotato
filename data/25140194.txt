Item(by='bit-rot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605723216, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25138468, text='What&#x27;s funny to me about your comment is that you actually chose a perfect example of the importance of critical thinking in how we discuss terminology.<p>The message behind the English idiom you chose is clearly one of self empowerment; &#x2F;you&#x2F; are the master of &#x2F;your own&#x2F; destiny implies independence, freedom, and agency.<p>In the context of git, and distributed systems more broadly, `master` is specifically chosen for its association with a power differential between one special entity giving the orders, and some collection of other entities taking the orders. In some DB systems, for example, the language is as literal as `master&#x2F;s<i></i><i></i>`. Even without &quot;s<i></i><i></i>&quot; in use with `git`, there&#x27;s a clear association with `master` being the branch that broadly holds sway above the other branches.<p>We chose symbols and metaphors to aid in our mental modeling of complex systems. I&#x27;m further amused by your own choice of &quot;policing&quot; to describe a push for cultural healing coming from a minority population. I recommend reading up on the history of policing to see why this metaphor is ill-advised.<p>&gt; Like, we&#x27;re just going to scratch a whole bunch of words from the dictionary because someone somewhere is offended?<p>This is a strawman; nobody is calling for this.<p>&gt; The other day, people at my workplace were saying that expressions like &quot;blind spot&quot; and &quot;falling on deaf ears&quot; needed to be purged.<p>Based on your use of &quot;policing&quot; and &quot;[scratching] from the dictionary&quot; I&#x27;m wondering whether these folks literally said &quot;purged&quot; in their own language. But otherwise, cool, it sounds like they are exhibiting the positive human trait of compassion. If a disabled person tells me they&#x27;d prefer I don&#x27;t use this idiom, I&#x27;d happily find another way of saying the same thing. What&#x27;s the big deal?<p>&gt; AFAIK, &quot;blind spot&quot; is not actually about blind people, it&#x27;s a term related to driving and the angles seeing people can&#x27;t see in without looking.<p>This isn&#x27;t really how language works though, is it? When people are forging associations with words or phrases, they&#x27;re not opening a webster&#x27;s dictionary, but rather drawing on a complex web of cultural associations. A more extreme version of your argument here is that it&#x27;s unreasonable to be rattled by the use of a swatstika in western culture, since the &#x2F;original&#x2F; meaning behind that symbol was one of peace. Nobody would buy that. However, in certain east asian cultures, the symbol is still in use for more positive associations.<p>The specific choice of `master` as a symbol in distributed systems holds meaning due to its evocation of a power differential. Whether this is intentionally &quot;bad&quot; holds no meaning whatsoever. What does it say about us if we can&#x27;t honestly hold some degree of empathy for someone who, affected by a violent history of subjugation and dominance, might not love the idea of using symbols chosen for their hierarchical power association?')
