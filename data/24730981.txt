If you&#x27;re worried about it, that means you can audit the frozen codebase for any given version from a top-level crate down through the dependencies, and once that trust is established, it can&#x27;t be leveraged for a silent dependency change later on, which can only happen through a version update on the end-user&#x27;s side.')
