It was not clear from the title and home page that this is the target but looking at the demo video makes this clear.<p>As a tool to actually document code however as the title suggests this would be a terrible, terrible idea. No code comments or commit messages except a link to a video hosted on a website that may become broken or simply shut down at any time in the future? No thanks. What if I take 2 hours to write 10 lines of code, do I expect people who come after me to watch a 2 hour long video to understand what I was doing? It would also make public a mental process that may be messy, and maybe cause a similar effect to being watched over your shoulder while you code. Not to mention the usual problems of video like low consumption speed, linearity, and non-searchability.')
