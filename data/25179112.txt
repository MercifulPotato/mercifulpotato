Could you elaborate on how we could&#x27;ve gotten you to tell us? :)<p>(I get that GH issues is probably not the way to go, but wondering what other tool&#x2F;channel would work? Also I think there&#x27;ll be no silver bullet since it requires some energy &amp; care to actually jump to action over a random project you find interesting and that will never be the case all the time, but then again this is basically what we need to work on to get people like you to try&#x2F;use it!)')
