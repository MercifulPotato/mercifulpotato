We also don’t seem to entirely want to know “the truth”.<p>For example the entertainment media on the one hand say that entertainment does not influence people via depictions of violence, etc., to emulate such things.  On the other hand they say that how people are portrayed for positive role models “I could be that person” they are necessary and instrumental and thus the need for representing a cross section of the population.  Yet on the other hand they would (with good reason) resist showing only positive plots (ala modified 1950s but contemporary).<p>I agree though.  If sexual violence is a non starter then so should lethal violence be a non starter.  Else there is a non sequitur in reason.')
