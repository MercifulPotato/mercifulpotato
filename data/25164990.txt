NuScale, one of the most promising SMR companies, is losing backers for its first big reactor build. This is a result of cost under-estimates and delays:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemag.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;several-us-utilities-back-out-deal-build-novel-nuclear-power-plant" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemag.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;several-us-utilities...</a><p>&gt; announced that completion of the project would be delayed by 3 years to 2030. It also estimates the cost would climb from $4.2 billion to $6.1 billion.<p>Unfortunately it has become a pattern now for the nuclear industry to promise that the next tech will suddenly make nuclear energy cheap and fast to build.  They consistently have failed to deliver on their promises -- the fiasco of the AP1000 reactor build at Vogtle in Georgia is a recent example.<p>It seems like the problem of the nuclear industry is the industry, not the technology itself.  They&#x27;re too used to relying on fat taxpayer subsidies, and are not well equipped to compete against other energy sources on the free market.')
