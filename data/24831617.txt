I tried several times, no email. I have a record of every email sent to my address for the past several years regardless of spam status so I can be 100% positive they simply never sent it.<p>In the end I had to give up. I can&#x27;t log into Patreon today, because of their insistence on sending me an email even though I&#x27;m logging in from a computer I&#x27;ve used many times before.')
