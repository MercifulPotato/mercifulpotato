If you highlight &quot;Lancet Psychiatry,&quot; right click, and search Google, this study is on the front of the site. Put in some effort FFS.<p>&gt;Without any link to the study, this is meaningless information. This article is implying the virus directly caused those symptoms. [...] There&#x27;s no mention of the effects a possible quarantine may have on one&#x27;s mental health.<p>They consulted a medical expert on the matter. If you&#x27;d have read a bit more of the article you would have come across this quote from an actual psychiatrist:<p>“This is likely due to a combination of the psychological stressors associated with this particular pandemic and the physical effects of the illness.”<p>Oh, so the article actually does mention the effects that the quarantine might have on mental health. Did you just not read it? You could also have read the study, which does indeed suggest that the virus itself could be causing these problems:<p>&quot;Rates of insomnia diagnosis were also markedly elevated, in agreement with predictions that circadian disturbances will follow COVID-19 infection.&quot;<p>You also conveniently left out that rates of diagnosis for dementia are elevated in Covid-19 patients, which is very unlikely to be caused by acute stress.<p>&gt;Why is this assumed to be something the virus is directly causing as a symptom rather than looking into anything else?<p>Again, it&#x27;s NOT just assumed that this is the case, and in the case of dementia, there&#x27;s no evidence that the quarantine is even possibly a factor.<p>Comments like this are gonna quickly turn this place into just another &#x2F;r&#x2F;science, where people of no particular qualification chime in and try to make themselves feel smart by contradicting a peer reviewed study without taking the actual effort needed to properly question a peer reviewed study, especially one in as prestigious a journal as the Lancet.')
