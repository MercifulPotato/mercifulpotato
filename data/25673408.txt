Some alternative comes up (let&#x27;s call it Foo) that lets Trump speak freely.  How many Facebook people are going to move to Foo to hear Trump?  (Remember that the value of a social network is proportional to the square of the number of people there, and nobody&#x27;s on Foo yet.)  Sure, some will go, and Foo becomes a nest of die-hard Trump supporters.  And over there, they get worse, more hardened in their position.  They also don&#x27;t get many new converts, because if you&#x27;re not already a hard-core Trump supporter, why on earth would you go to Foo?<p>Is that better or worse than the current situation?  I think it&#x27;s better, because it shuts down the recruitment pipeline.')
