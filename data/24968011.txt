Significantly the USSR was buying more grain and food from the world market, so while the USSR was able to keep up with technology, it was not able to keep up with efficiency gains that the US was realising.<p>Corruption was also a huge problem for the USSR, and it still is to this day in Russia.<p>The Americans bankrupted the USSR on multiple fronts.  Capital allocation is a capitalist system notion, but, more generally, the US was able to allocate deploy its available resources in a way that out-competed the USSR.  The USA was able to organise its society and economy in a more efficient and productive way than the USSR, and that is a Macro Economic argument.<p>Until the 80&#x27;s the USA had second most equitable distribution of wealth next to the USSR.  The USA imposed significant taxes on everybody up to a marginal rate of 80%.  If you want to &quot;Make America Great Again&quot;, you need to restore taxation to the levels seen between 1945 and 1981; maybe even to the end of the 80&#x27;s.  American government funding through the DARPA project lead to numerous technological advances that most people, worldwide, now depend upon.')
