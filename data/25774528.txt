Quantum mechanics is the result of trying to find a theory consistent with both sets of experiments.<p>Originally, the double slit experiment was seen as proof that the wave theory is correct. So if you want to challenge your wave theory, look to different experiments. Wave theory of light was predominant from the mid-19th century to the emergence of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century, so I would focus on science from the early 20th century, such as the ultraviolet catastrophe and the photoelectric effect.<p>Consider the photoelectric effect. If light were a wave that carried energy, this wouldn’t explain why an equal amount of energy has a different effect depending on its wavelength. The quantum explanation is that one packet of light contains a different amount of energy, which depends on wavelength. “Light is a wave” kind of falls apart as a theory, because it is unable to explain this.')
