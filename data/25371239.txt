It should be _possible_ to publish criticism for all; that doesn&#x27;t mean there should be equal amounts of criticism.<p>Otherwise, you could have one administration that mishandles a lot of thing complain that they were treated unfairly, just because they&#x27;re rightfully criticized for their shortcomings. (Which it looks like has been happening recently.)<p>The question is, though, what happens if one side keeps knowingly publishing baseless allegations to stir up fear and mistrust.')
