What counts as &quot;misinformation&quot; or a &quot;false claim&quot; and who makes that decision? Will YouTube be contacting primary sources to verify all claims made in videos? Will they be relying on some designated &quot;fact checkers&quot;? Or maybe they&#x27;re trying to tell us that ALL claims of voter fraud will automatically be deemed false without any form of review (this was the approach Twitter took with their labeling)?')
