Rates will be set by market forces, not any concept of &quot;fairness.&quot;<p>Clearly companies are willing to pay $200k+ for top talent.  \n&quot;Cost of living&quot; or however you want to break down that salary is irrelevant to what companies think employees are worth.<p>Unless the company is getting less value, they can stand to pay the same no matter where you are physically.  Calling it a cost of living decrease is just kabuki for paying less.<p>If WFH continues, salaries should normalize across all regions but its yet to be seen what the value of top talent vs average employee is at a global scale.')
