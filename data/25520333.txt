I love watching trailers!  They have enough plot in them it&#x27;s almost like a mini movie or short story.  And also I like to know what new shows and movies are coming out so I can watch them later or read the books they were based on.  I&#x27;ve subscribed to movie trailer channels and like, watch and upvote them all the time.  Yet youtube constantly recommends me other nonsense and I have to direct-search for movie trailers.  I haven&#x27;t trained the alogorithm to show me movie trailers, or maybe youtube is smart enough to KNOW I will now hunt and search for the movie trailers on my own, so they will only recommend me other things?  I click &quot;do not show me this&quot; and &quot;I don&#x27;t like this&quot; on the other videos.<p>Anyways, it&#x27;s my personal youtube white whale and I haven&#x27;t made any progress, so suggestions welcome!')
