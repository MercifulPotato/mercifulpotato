Across a set of rote problems that you know how to solve: take the problem and write down in any language the steps <i>you</i> take to solve it, then also write down why you took those steps at the points you did. When youâ€™ve covered the set, review them all. If you tried to record a tutorial for someone else at that point to follow in your footsteps, what would you say?
