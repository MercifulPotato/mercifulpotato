Care to share a bit more?<p>One thing comes to mind: we don&#x27;t bill by data volume. Wavefront is charging you for the volume of data your applications produce. This can lead to negative outcomes, such as surprise bills from a newly deployed service and a subsequent scramble to find and limit the offenders.<p>We think this pricing model forms the wrong incentives. Charging by volume means a company is more incentivized to have their customers (you) send you more data, and less incentivized to help them get more value from that data. This is a fundamental change we want to bring to the market--we want our incentives to align with yours, we want to be paid for the value we bring to your company. We charge on a per-user basis. You should monitor your applications and infrastructure the right way, not afraid to send data because it might blow the budget.')
