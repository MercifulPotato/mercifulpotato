It&#x27;s not like buying a $2000 computer where every single one pumped out of the factory is the same or you warranty it. There&#x27;s a ton of variance in instruments. A $2000 guitar can play and sound like a $200 guitar and vice versa, even factory new. It&#x27;s like buying a used car sight unseen online: you might end up with a knocking engine and cigarette stench.')
