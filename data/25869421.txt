They haven&#x27;t produced polarization, radicalization, scams, privacy issues like Facebook, Youtube or Twitter.<p>In the news&#x2F;social media the reliance on Like&#x2F;Follower&#x2F;Click&#x2F;View&#x2F;Upvote counts as the basis for a reward&#x2F;ranking system was not just that it raked in the cash or successfully captured attention, but that it was the easiest thing to implement. Back then it was just hard to do language understanding. NLP tech was pretty hopeless and so we got page rank and the Like&#x2F;upvote count as half baked substitutes to work out who&#x2F;what is interesting. With human moderation filling the gap.<p>But its obvious the human moderation on Wikipedia&#x2F;Stackoverflow&#x2F;HN etc have produced very different outcomes from what Twitter&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Youtube have.<p>So I just wish more of the debates on privacy, echo chambers, disinfo, polarization etc focused on Reward System. But most of the time debates on  central&#x2F;distributed, crypto, scaling, privacy, radicalization etc etc dont touch much on the Reward system and its role.')
