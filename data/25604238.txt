The purity requirements and vibrational limits for those parts are very high.<p>ASML has plans to get into sub 1nm level. 2nm and 1.5 nm is already in the pipeline.<p>The technology high-NA EUV (high Numerical Aperture Extreme Ultraviolet) becomes just insane. Mirror manufacturing process requires atomic scale corrections and the whole metrology is moved into vacuum.<p>The limit for mass production is measuring and calibration. The measurement  accuracy is comparable or exeeding Large Hadron Collideror gravitational-wave astronomy. The speed (wafers per hour) must eventually slow down, requiring more machines and making the process more expensive.  Then Moore&#x27;s law finally dies due to the cost.')
