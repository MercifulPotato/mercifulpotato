I&#x27;m just talking about the multiplayer service infrastructure, not the whole game.<p>Despite doing a lot and having a lot of smaller moving parts, the mp infra is of moderate code size and build complexity is not a concern. The whole thing compiles in less than 5 minutes, and can be done with nimble (the package manager). We have a docker builder image that spits out the final production image containing the apps, and a docker-compose setup then runs those as needed.<p>Any kind of per-platform specifics are handled in nim itself (when defined(Linux): etc) and via nim.config&#x2F;nims.nim, to link in platform libraries.')
