This means sustained peak performance and overall less fan noise. If I have anything to critisize about the MB Pro, it is that there is just too much fan noise with even not so big loads and the machine just getting very hot. Adding more battery lifetime would also be a welcome improvement.\n(Though, 8 high performance cores would also deliver a quite impressive speed)')
