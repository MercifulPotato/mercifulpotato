There is nothing stopping anyone from offering a hosted Kafka.\nYou seem to be conflating Kafka with Confluent&#x27;s own products.<p>&gt;No. Apache Kafka is licensed under Apache 2.0. The license change only applies to our Confluent software that was previously called “Confluent Open Source”: Confluent Schema Registry, Confluent REST Proxy, Confluent ksqlDB and some Confluent Connectors.<p>I love that they try to make it sound like they even have a choice in changing Kafka&#x27;s license.')
