Item(by='fragsworth', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603045202, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24819868, text='I&#x27;m not really sure the context, but due to the context of the article, I have a feeling the titles of these jobs are somewhat misleading. Perhaps it&#x27;s not someone who just drives trucks being called a &quot;truck driver&quot;, but someone in charge of a truck driving fleet? And maybe it&#x27;s not just a &quot;lifeguard&quot;, but someone who manages beach safety for some popular beaches? Some of these people need to be paid a lot for the system to work, especially if they&#x27;re coordinating things.<p>If we could see what they actually do, day-to-day, then I think I can understand better what&#x27;s going on. I don&#x27;t see these details here.<p>I have a feeling that if you dig into it, there&#x27;s nothing here. Otherwise I think we would see the article actually dig into it.')
