And the pimps and the pushers and the slavers?<p>I think you missed the point of the article. You don&#x27;t get virtue points for tolerating gays if you&#x27;re not a homophobe. You just get to be known as a person who tolerates gays because that&#x27;s how it is.<p>&gt; Nobody&#x27;s missing out by kicking the nazis off the platform.<p>Are you kicking nazis off the platform because you hate nazis or are you kicking nazis off the platform because of the potential for harm?')
