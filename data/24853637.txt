Lots of griping about the problems with YAML, but no solutions. What does the author think is better? XML doesn&#x27;t map to the same data structures as YAML, JSON, and TOML, so it&#x27;s not really a comparable beast.<p>The author mentions a desire to be able to teach a data format to people in the way someone can comprehend HTML or Markdown easily. But the formats have different goals.<p>The goal of HTML and Markdown are to provide a way to encode document formatting in a simple text syntax. There&#x27;s not one single correct way to format a document intended for presentation to and consumption by humans. Pretty much anything goes, HTML and Markdown just provide some decoration.<p>But the purpose of YAML (and JSON and TOML) is to provide a way to represent strictly defined data structures for consumption by a computer. The reason YAML is frustrating is because you can&#x27;t fudge the result; you can&#x27;t be sloppy or inexact; YAML operates at the boundary between the human and the computer program, and just like any HCI, it&#x27;s going to be frustrating and error-prone.<p>Now, would it be possible to come up with a better format than YAML or JSON or TOML that does the same thing? Maybe. But the facts that tools exist to search and manipulate these formats and that we&#x27;ll probably still be using them in 2030 isn&#x27;t evidence that they are bad. The fact that yq can exist and is useful is a point in favor of YAML, imo. If simple tools can be written to do useful things with a data format, that makes the format <i>more</i> useful.')
