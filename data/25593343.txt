The buttons are clickable divs, not actual HTML buttons or even marked up with proper ARIA. I haven&#x27;t yet ventured any further into the app.<p>Given that the app is a WebAssembly development environment, my first guess was that it was built in WebAssembly itself, with a custom UI framework. But in fact, it&#x27;s plain React, using its own home-grown components for basic things like buttons.<p>It breaks my heart that when this project was started in 2017, some 20 years after web accessibility advocacy had started in earnest, the developer was still uninformed enough about accessibility that they would create a custom button component with no ARIA support. I suppose we could also blame the web platform for making it hard enough to customize the look of a standard button that the developer would reach for the div tag. What do we do about this?')
