I was looking for a way to automatically generate plots from a project written in Prolog (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stassa&#x2F;louise" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stassa&#x2F;louise</a>). Until now I was  composing some R plotting scripts with Prolog, which can get a bit clunky. Swi-Prolog has a solid library to convert from Prolog terms to json so it should be straightforward to translate between program output in Prolog and Vega-Lite json. I will definitely give this a try.<p>Just a question to @domoritz - I noticed that in this example plot, that shows relative numbers of different types of animal produced in the US and UK rendered as emoji:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vega.github.io&#x2F;vega-lite&#x2F;examples&#x2F;isotype_bar_chart_emoji.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vega.github.io&#x2F;vega-lite&#x2F;examples&#x2F;isotype_bar_chart_...</a><p>- the data is encoded as hard-coded values that tell the engine where to place each icon of a sheep, pig or cow. Isn&#x27;t it possible to derive these positions from numerical data, automatically?<p>For instance, instead of enumerating each instance of a &quot;pig&quot;:<p><pre><code>    &quot;values&quot;: [\n      {&quot;country&quot;: &quot;Great Britain&quot;, &quot;animal&quot;: &quot;pigs&quot;},\n      {&quot;country&quot;: &quot;Great Britain&quot;, &quot;animal&quot;: &quot;pigs&quot;},\n     ... etc. \n</code></pre>\nShouldn&#x27;t it be possible to input the actual number of pigs and have the engine put it into bins as necessary?')
