The M1 Macbooks are actually quite reasonably priced IMO. Right now it&#x27;s even hard to find an AMD Ryzen 4000 laptop with &gt;FHD screens...<p>If you get Linux developers onto your platform, you unlock the server market, I assume. I don&#x27;t get why Apple would not open that <i>possibility</i> for their silicon future.<p>I think a downside to have Macs running Linux would be extended hardware support and evasion of their obsolescence strategies.<p>Overall, I think they could win a lot, so there is a desperate hope they change their minds on that. At least, I would be completely lost on them, if AMD manages to match their performance and there gonna be well-screened AMD laptops.<p>Apple, you got this current advantage to win people like me over. Once the others catch up, this opportunity will probably not arise again, as I will never ever settle on MacOS or Windows, especially with the current course of increasingly restricting how I could use a &gt;1.5kâ‚¬ device.<p>If the M1 Air had proper Linux support (at least committed), I would buy <i>right now</i> in an instant.  I naively believe, if you don&#x27;t get Linux people like me, Apple&#x27;s silicon endeavour will not get a hold in the larger CPU&#x2F;GPU market.')
