I have 13 years of experience in many hybrid roles incorporating design and development. I&#x27;ve worked for both start up creative agencies and consulting firms as well as very established in house teams. I have extensive CSS&#x2F;HTML skills from years of email development and a hunger to join a software development team to work with technologies like React or Vue full time. I am open to any and all opportunities, FTE, PTE, contract.<p>I look forward to connecting with you.<p>Cheers, \nRussell')
