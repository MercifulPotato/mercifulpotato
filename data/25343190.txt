Finally, promissory estoppel is usually only granted if a court determines that enforcing the promise is essentially the only means by which injustice to the promisee can be rectified.<p>The open source project would not suffer an economic loss by not using Travis. They would be free to stop using Travis or go to another competitor providing a free plan.<p>Exceptions to the above I can think of:<p>* Travis didn&#x27;t charge them, then started charging them despite the promise<p>* they suffer an unrelated economic loss because they stop using CI<p>* they&#x27;re forced to hire someone to convert them to another CI system (economic loss in form of wages, money to operate their own CI), though the loss would have t obe substantial (is that relative? e.g. in case of a low budget, is even a small sum substantial?)')
