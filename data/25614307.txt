For example, &quot;Write 10 reviews on twitter&quot;. I would have liked to see a parenthetical &quot;(1 per week for 10 straight weeks)&quot; or &quot;(within 60 days)&quot;. Without this its hard to put concrete tasks on a calendar.<p>BTW I like your goals, too. They seem quite wholesome and achievable, and reasonable (granted I don&#x27;t know your BMI now, for example, but waking up before 8:30am is a good one.)')
