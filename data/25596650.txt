Chat, built right into Gmail. It works. But. BUT.<p>- It does not support video. Drop in a video, and you get a bizarre error message telling you to try &quot;JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, and HEIFimage files&quot; (sic) instead.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;dcposch&#x2F;status&#x2F;1303193761313206272" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;dcposch&#x2F;status&#x2F;1303193761313206272</a><p>- Tiny little chat windows. No replies, no reactions. Basic UX that feels like abandonware from 2010.<p>- If you have Google Fi, you can take phone calls thru Hangouts, but you cannot send or receive text messages (??)<p>I just feel bad for whatever rump team of a few engineers has to maintain that product. They are plainly caught on the wrong end of some strange and gross internal politics.<p>Google has a self-defeating practice of emphasizing &quot;new products shipped&quot; in their promotion packets. That probably explains why their army of PMs has, instead of improving Hangouts for a billion Gmail users, chosen to create the following instead: Google Meet, Duo, &quot;Google Chat&quot;, and an endless parade of now-cancelled apps like Allo.')
