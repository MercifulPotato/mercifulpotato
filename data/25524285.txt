Item(by='dilap', descendants=None, kids=[25527252], score=None, time=1608773445, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25519960, text='Well, I can just report my experience with a git repo w&#x2F; a bunch of binary files in it.<p>It got really really slow to clone (like multiple days -- we gave up on cloning and just copied the checked-out folder around); git lfs fixed this. I should note most of the binary assets had no changes and were not deleted; it seemed to be something inherent in git&#x27;s handling of the binaries that made it slow, not just downloading the data. (I.e., I don&#x27;t believe most of the wins in git-lfs were simply in doing a &quot;shallow clone&quot; as it were.)<p>So as I see it the situation is as follows:<p>- Even for a full clone, git becomes inefficient with a lot of large binaries<p>- For doing a partial clone, things like git-lfs <i>work</i>, but are clunky because git-lfs is not natively integrated with git<p>- The partial clone abilities of git-lfs are strictly &quot;time-based&quot; -- you go to a particular checkout, and then it goes off and downloads the files. There&#x27;s no way to say, &quot;I have a big monorepo with a bunch of binaries, but I&#x27;m only interested in some subset w&#x2F;o the binaries.&quot;<p>So these are all areas where I think git can be improved on.')
