It&#x27;s not a magic cure, but my semi-okay-coping mechanism is to make daily to-do lists.<p>The key though, is not just &quot;making to-do lists&quot;.... it&#x27;s right-sizing the items on them.<p>Every task should have a finite end state and (this is crucial) shouldn&#x27;t be longer than 15-20 minutes or so. If they are longer than that, it almost certainly needs to be broken down into constituent tasks.<p>So even something like &quot;clean my office&quot; probably needs to be broken down a little more -- when I&#x27;m on my game I break it down into &quot;vac office&quot;, &quot;dust office&quot;, &quot;organize desk drawer&quot;, etc.<p>This pairs nicely with the &quot;Pomodoro method&quot; if you&#x27;ve ever tried it.')
