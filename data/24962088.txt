I&#x27;m thinking about getting it, but I&#x27;m worried I wont be able to do my usual stuff, including using things like Signal or WhatsApp.<p>I don&#x27;t have the first hand experience, but I was doing research on this very topic earlier today. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.github.com&#x2F;nanu-c&#x2F;axolotl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.github.com&#x2F;nanu-c&#x2F;axolotl</a> looked promising. (ubuntu touch only)<p>As others have mentioned, anbox is another alternative.<p>I ended up going with the xcover pro instead, but I&#x27;m still highly considering getting a pinephone to do dev work on. There&#x27;s exciting stuff to reinvent over here!')
