The expected offspring for an individual of a certain gender is (total offspring)&#x2F;(number of individuals of that gender). The fewer individuals of one gender there are, the higher the expected offspring and the greater the selective pressure to produce more offspring of that gender. So the gender ratio is self-stabilizing.')
