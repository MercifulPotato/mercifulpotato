It can even restart more than once. This benefit doesn&#x27;t exist in some of the dual boot setups that have been described here though.<p>As others have said, attackers are meant to be prevented from getting in directly by the Windows password, and they can&#x27;t just put the disk in another machine to read because it wouldn&#x27;t have the right TPM. I don&#x27;t know enough about TPMs to know what stops an attacker from installing an OS on another hard drive on the same motherboard and using that to access the TPM to decrypt the target drive, but presumably that&#x27;s been thought of. It&#x27;s certainly susceptible to turning the machine on and then physically lifting the RAM out into another machine to extract the key (cooled RAM keeps its contents reliably for long enough for this to be feasible), or dismantling the TPM, but both of these are high skill attacks.')
