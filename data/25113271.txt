Guess what SN did before they moved to software? They made and sold hardware that essentially implemented Hyperscan in FPGAs (and SRAM, on PCI boards), for IDS &amp; virus scanning at speed. They even had a patch to add support to Snort for it. SN eventually moved to a pure software model during the 2008 downturn (which smashed a bunch of their customers plans) and ultimately sold to Intel.<p>End of the day it is a real bitch to do right, and it was very hard at 10Gbps, and the problems are essentially identical now (only with more stuff over https).<p>I have no idea if they&#x27;d use them, but Intel also acquired a heap of patents on doing exactly this using the techniques that Hyperscan implements, and while they&#x27;re probably happy with you doing it in software, they&#x27;re probably more diligent in fighting off hardware adversaries.')
