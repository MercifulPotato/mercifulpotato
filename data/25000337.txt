From my perspective the market will quickly be saturated by big tobacco, since they already have all the plantation &amp; manufacturing infrastructure needed to mass produce smoking products.<p>It would depend on how the laws are structured, as well as market demand.<p>Microbrews and local produce markets come to mind. They are popular precisely <i>because</i> they are not large: their smaller scale allows them to offer higher-quality and speciality products.<p>I suspect something similar would show up very fast in the cannabis industry if the laws are structured to allow it.')
