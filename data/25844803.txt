I certainly remember how confusing 0-based indexing felt for a long time when I first learned to program.<p>On the other hand, I’ve made an observation about timelines in music production software, where bars are counted starting from 1. As you zoom out, only every 4th bar tends to be labeled, which creates this strange sequence: 1, 5, 9, 13, 17… I always found that incredibly hard to reason about, and perhaps it would have been a better idea to label the first bar as 0.')
