I&#x27;d love to read more technical details.<p>Since this is purely mechanical, it is probably extremely simple in design.  I suspect that there are two relays (representing 2 bits) under each square&#x27;s reed switch, encoding the number of &quot;left turns&quot; to make upon entering that square.  The whiskers probably trigger a simple incrementer for each square to keep track of the number of left turns to make.  When the mouse is dropped in a space, it probably turns left to reorient itself, but then knows the direction to walk once it reaches a point in the path where it has solved before because the number of left turns it needs to make in that space is already solved.')
