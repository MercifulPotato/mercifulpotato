Individual market participants make <i>tons</i> of mistakes, and absolutely won&#x27;t be able to evaluate short (or long!) arguments correctly in many cases. That&#x27;s actually one of the key elements supporting the efficient market hypothesis, and why so much ink is spent encouraging small investors to use index funds.<p>But it&#x27;s a question of scale. The fact that any one investor may make mistakes doesn&#x27;t mean that the market as a whole, in the medium or long term, also makes these sorts of mistakes.<p>&quot;Some hedge fund guy released a report saying stock X is bad and the stock tanked 30% from small investors panicking before recovering when people realised it actually wasn&#x27;t bad&quot; is pretty silly, yes. And it&#x27;s a bit rough on the small investors selling at a loss into the large investors who <i>are</i> able to correctly analyse the report, absolutely. But does any company actually <i>go bankrupt</i> in cases like this? The answer seems to be no; there&#x27;s no evidence for it happening, and it&#x27;s hard to see how it even <i>could</i>. Confused retail investors can lead to price volatility, but they don&#x27;t make or break a new share offering.')
