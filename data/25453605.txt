It bit-bangs a GPIO pin to transmit arbitrary radio, turning your Pi into a messy SDR transmitter. By connecting a wire to the GPIO pin you can transmit for tens of meters.<p>I attached a low-pass filter to the GPIO pin and was able to control my ceiling fan with my Raspberry Pi.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;F5OEO&#x2F;rpitx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;F5OEO&#x2F;rpitx</a><p>Edit: This generates square waves which have harmonics. You will transmit signals on unintended frequencies if you don&#x27;t use a filter.')
