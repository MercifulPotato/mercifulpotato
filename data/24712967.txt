Item(by='dpc_pw', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602106246, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24712645, text='&gt; The current 40 hour workweek we enjoy and the weekends we have off are because of the organized labor movement in the US.<p>Arguably it was achieved first and foremost because increase in productivity caused by capital investments actually made it economically possible.<p>I mean, I don&#x27;t deny that 19th century capitalists required a little bit of a &quot;push&quot; for it to actually happen, but it&#x27;s debatable if it was actually necessary and wouldn&#x27;t just happen naturally.<p>&gt; class consciousness<p>That&#x27;s a part of political opinion, that I just don&#x27;t share. I was born in family of a blue collar family of a coal miner and school janitor, now I&#x27;m a intellectual worker, and in a way I already joined &quot;evil capitalist class&quot; and hope to entrench myself in it even more with time.<p>Thinking in people having assigned &quot;classes&quot; is just so a low-resolution way to look at complex reality, that it is just not helpful.<p>&gt; If your choices are between working for one of several capital-owned tech conglomerates, or accepting their money for the runway to compete in the current business climate, can you really call that an even playing field?<p>I just don&#x27;t think labor organizations help with anything. What helps is having more options (competition), better social mobility (access to education and knowledge) and general economic prosperity that allow entrepreneurship (taking risks). Labor unions typically work against all of it.<p>I do know that field is not level, but I just think naive ways to trying to level it make more harm than good.')
