Item(by='slg', descendants=None, kids=[25922327, 25917379], score=None, time=1611676270, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25916976, text='It is annoying to see the cheapening of the word &quot;censorship&quot; recently.  It isn&#x27;t censorship when a private company makes internal decisions about the content it wants to produce.  It certainly isn&#x27;t censorship when a company will share content on its platform but refuses to buy exclusive rights to the project.  Apple and Amazon are facilitating people watching this movie.  If MBS was going to retaliate for it, I don&#x27;t think &quot;it is only up for rental&quot; is going to be a convincing excuse.<p>Also since you bring up the extra fee that this costs, I want to highlight the price.  The distributors set the price at $20 for a rental.  That is their decision not Apple&#x27;s or Amazons.  If they wanted this movie to seen by as many people as possible, lowering that price is going to do a lot more good than complaining to Variety.  That $20 price makes me think the reason this is for rent on Amazon and not free with Prime is because the price tag would have been too high to justify purchasing exclusivity.')
