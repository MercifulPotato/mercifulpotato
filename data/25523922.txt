And I can sympathize with those who instinctively avoid JWT due to concern that there are other design&#x2F;spec flaws lurking.<p>(JWT is so simple though -- it&#x27;s what you&#x27;d design if you designed a thing for signed, base64&#x27;ed messages and then added a couple of extra fields. Some people will respond: &quot;So then do that instead!&quot;. :)<p>IMO, as long as you think of JWT as a simple and standardized signed message format, with broad cross-platform support, it&#x27;s perfectly suited for its purpose.')
