The idea is to imagine the best environment a new intern can experience in a team at a software company and then apply the same principles to treating open-source contributors (if they are willing to dedicate several hours of their time).<p>Enthusiastic developers can join a virtual meeting (on Discord and&#x2F;or <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeshare.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codeshare.io&#x2F;</a> or something) where they, I, and anyone else who wants to spectate can discuss a feature from the idea phase all the way to the phase where everyone&#x27;s personal tasks are designated.
