MS has worked pretty hard to maintain backward compatibility. They should mostly work, maybe requiring a little fiddling with the compatibility settings. But itâ€™s not perfect, and I hear you might have better luck with WINE with some applications.<p>The break is with 16-bit applications, which 64-bit Windows 10 no longer supports. You can still run them on 32-bit Windows 10.<p>All that winevdm does is emulate the 16-bit processor and translate 16-bit-Windows api calls to their modern equivalent, so you can run 16-bit programs on 64-bit Windows again.')
