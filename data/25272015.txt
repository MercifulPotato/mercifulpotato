The closest any phone is that I can find is the Pro1 X, which hardware wise is a Pixel 2, but it isn&#x27;t open hardware, it&#x27;s just documented so that you can more easily run what you want.<p>I&#x27;d love to see a current Snapdragon, Mediatek, Exynos, etc. chipset in one of these open phones. I&#x27;d even be willing to pay flagship prices for one.')
