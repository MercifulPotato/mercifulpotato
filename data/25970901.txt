Margin accounts don&#x27;t have an unlimited bottom. If you put $1000 in a margin account, you can buy more than $1000 worth of securities. As soon as the value of those securities drops below $1000, those shares are liquidated. Typically, you are never on the hook for more than your initial $1000.<p>From Investopedia:\n&gt; &quot; The Federal Reserve has a 50% initial margin requirement, meaning you must front at least half the cash for a stock purchase.\n&gt;  This requirement gives you the ability to purchase up to $20,000 worth of stock, effectively doubling your purchasing power.&quot;<p>It is very risky to invest in volatile stocks with a margin account because you can hit a margin call fast. Suppose you put $2000 into RH and get $2000 worth of GME. If GME drops 50% in a day (highly possible), you get a margin call and <i>poof</i> your $2000 is worth zero.<p>&gt; Many customers think they&#x27;re betting Â£1000, they don&#x27;t realise they&#x27;re actually betting their house.<p>This isn&#x27;t true on either part. To see why, take a peek at RH&#x27;s FAQ on margin: &quot;Access to margin is not automatic to everyone, and requires you to upgrade to Gold.&quot;<p>In other words. To make leveraged purchases, you have to deliberately upgrade your account to gold and have $2000 in your account. The whole reason people upgrade to gold is to get access to margin.<p>It is possible to put yourself out there quite a bit further than you want and lose everything you invest, but it&#x27;s pretty hard to lose more than you invest. (I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s possible).')
