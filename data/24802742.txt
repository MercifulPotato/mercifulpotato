Item(by='littlestymaar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602867769, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24796052, text='&gt; that the left&#x2F;right divide correlates as strongly with the US vs. Europe as you suggest.<p>Right, talking about “right and left” was a mistake because the meaning of these words are pretty fuzzy and highly context-dependent. I&#x27;d give a more precise description then:<p>Comments containing criticism of mainstream economics, references to Keynes, arguing that “all capitalism is crony capitalism” or “capitalism didn&#x27;t defeat communism, welfare state did”, being in favor of strong state intervention etc. are going to be much more upvoted when Americans are asleep.   And conversely for comments referencing Milton Friedman, praising the power of the market, economic growth as the main goal for social wellware, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve seen more than once my comments on the aforementioned themes being upvoted multiple times, then grayed several hours later, to end-up with a positive score the next day. I didn&#x27;t notice the temporal correlation until someone brought it in a thread, and many people shared the same experience.<p>If you want to have a look, the recent thread on the Nobel prize in Economics smells like a good candidate for investigation (even though I didn&#x27;t participate in the thread, so I have no evidences there).')
