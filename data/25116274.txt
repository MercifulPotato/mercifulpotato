They have had lockdowns, e.g. severe limits on social gatherings. You can only say they haven&#x27;t had lockdowns if you take the pedantic view that &quot;it&#x27;s not a lockdown if it&#x27;s not legally enforced, even if everyone follows your rules&quot;.<p>Also, arguably the excess deaths in March&#x2F;April (comparing to Nordic neighbours especially) and the surging cases now are not &quot;reasonable results&quot;.')
