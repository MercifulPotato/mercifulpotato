We don&#x27;t yet know how to combat the disinformation campaign the president and fox news are waging. Greenwald was just on Joe Rogan yesterday and they each are either ignorant or unmoved by the effects this disinformation is having on our public discourse. Greenwald purports to be the ultimate protector of free speech and want us to be free to question all our the most sacred ideas but what does it mean when what&#x27;s published is not a good faith critique of our institutions but is instead just lies. How do we fight back because it is a fight.<p>I can&#x27;t help but also add that Joe Rogan is leaning heavily Right in this election because he&#x27;s pissed it&#x27;s not the old days where he could hop on the mic with your everyday misogyny, sexism, and dull thinking without repercussion -- this is the Left&#x27;s doing in his mind.
