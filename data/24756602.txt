The past three centuries have had ups and downs, but overall there&#x27;s been a remarkable and consistent global trend towards tolerance, liberalism, and democracy.<p>This didn&#x27;t happen because intolerant groups decided to let up on their zealotry. It didn&#x27;t even happen because intolerant ideas were violently suppressed. (In almost every conflict, it almost always was the anti-liberal faction that initiated hostilities.)<p>It happened because starting with the Enlightenment, we built a culture around an open marketplace of ideas. In places with liberal cultures and democratic governments, totalitarian ideologies like fascism and Marxism consistently failed to gain traction. They don&#x27;t need to be forcibly suppressed. Scratch their surface, and virtually everybody realizes that these ideologies are obviously stupid and inconsistent. Sunshine is the best disinfectant.')
