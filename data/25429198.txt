The same is true for the Union and the Maastricht and Lisbon treaties. European history isn&#x27;t finished as long as there are Europeans.<p>The U.K. wasn&#x27;t a founding member of the E.U. nor has it ever been a stalwart partner of the E.U. ever since it joined the Union back in There has always been contention in the U.K. about being a E.U. member ever since it joined through the 1972 Treaty of Accession. The U.K. even held a referendum as early as 1975 about the question of remaining in the then E.C.C. (67.33% voted remain)<p>The same is true for many other E.U. members, notably newer members who joined the union in the wake of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the breakup of the Warsaw Pact after 1991. Their incentive to join the union was just as much geo-strategic as it was economic. That doesn&#x27;t mean there weren&#x27;t voices opposition within those countries as well as elsewhere in the union.<p>These two companies coming under scrutiny isn&#x27;t just because they monopolize a consumer market. It&#x27;s because they enable forces of contention - nationalism, identity politics - that have led to some very dark chapters in the recent European history.<p>The E.U. such as it is today, originates from ideas that gestated right after WWII under such proponents as Winston Churchill, and the primary incentive was... creating a stable structure for peace on the continent. The E.C.S.C. as founded by the original 6 founding members (Schumann) was about consolidating the coal and steel markets exactly because those were enabling factors during both wars.
