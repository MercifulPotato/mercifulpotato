Item(by='nyanpasu64', descendants=None, kids=[25604111], score=None, time=1609501853, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25600338, text='&quot;mnt&#x2F;tabs&#x2F;by-id&#x2F;*&#x2F;title.txt&quot; asks your shell to expand a wildcard match, generating a list of files holding the title of each tab. If I were to feed it into a command-line app, I might start running into command length limits.<p>Would it work better as a &quot;relational database&quot; than a hierarchical tree filesystem? I noticced that &quot;by-id&quot; and &quot;by-title&quot; and &quot;last-focused&quot; are several views into an underlying source of data, and changing one view causes other branches of the filesystem to change automatically. Maybe it could be more cleanly modeled as a relational data store with one row per tab, and columns with different meanings. Then use SQL, or a cleaner notation for relational algebra, to query this interface.<p>The downside is that you can no longer use command-line utilities that operate on files (find&#x2F;grep, fd&#x2F;rg).')
