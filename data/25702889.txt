There is also Gradle, but it doesn’t seem to have gained much traction outside of Android development.<p>My personal favorite is Bazel (and others from the Blaze family of build systems). It uses a python-based language for describing build rules, an extensive documentation and developers that respond to issues. Among the downsides is the lack of proper dependency management which is critical for public, open source projects.<p>There is also Nix which takes it even further, but it requires much more involvement from the developer.')
