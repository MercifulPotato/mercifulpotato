Prolog is <i>not</i> a conventional language, in the sense that <i>most</i> programmers don&#x27;t know it (and I&#x27;d wager close to half of programmers have never even heard of it, if not more). C, C++, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby, even Rust are all imperative languages at their core and represent the dominant group of languages in conventional use.<p>If the OP was teaching people a language like Prolog then there wouldn&#x27;t have been the same confusion.')
