I’m not veggie, and I love the impossible and beyond burgers. Easily the best fake-meat I’ve had, and for the cause I think that’s really important. I.e, better for the cause to match taste of carnivores than those who have been veggie for a decade.<p>Curious what existing meat alternatives you think are good. I’ve always been really disappointed with anything besides like picking tofu in Thai food or paneer in Indian food.')
