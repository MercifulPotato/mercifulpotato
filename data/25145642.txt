Game theory is a curse that needs to be eliminated. Prisoner&#x27;s dilemma does no one good.<p>The biggest impediment to trust is non trustworthy people at top.<p>Geopolitics IS for nice people, we just need to make sure nice people are involved in geopolitics and make it to the top. I know people with power who have been absolutely moral despite no oversight. The could&#x27;ve given their children or themselves so much benefit but they did everything for collective good of everyone. People like that exist, but they also prefer hanging out with people like them. Not opportunists. Humans win collectively with cooperation.<p>The other option is going backwards and tribal.')
