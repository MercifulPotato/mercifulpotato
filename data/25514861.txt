This allows for designing sparse data flows and learning relations between pairs of input elements.<p>Graph NN layer: f(X, A) = g(AXW), where g is an activation<p>Fully connected layer: f(X) = g(XW), like GNN where the adj. matrix A=I<p>To put it in context a few years ago GNNs became a hot field. They are very similar in a way to transformers because both do pairwise interactions between elements, the difference being that GNNs use explicit and transformers implicit graphs.')
