Generally speaking where I am from, the best minds go to medicine, the next best to engineering and law, and the leftovers go to the military &#x2F; religious study.<p>The failure of those best minds to produce results is an artifact of non-reason based education (in my country there was a huge emphasis on rote learning) and a lack of institutional support.<p>My friends in the West from other Muslim countries have corroborated this. It&#x27;s always the bottom tier of students or the particularly devout that end up in the clergy.')
