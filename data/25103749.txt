I really liked the idea of a Tesla model 3 before I drove one. The fact that electric cars are being politically “shoved” up our throats doesn’t help there. That just creates more hatred. Also let us not forget how hard it is to charge them for many people. Many newer cars already have a lot of engine choices canceled because of questionable emission laws. It all just increases the dissatisfaction with politics from car enthusiasts. It is theoretically easier to make an electric car faster, but in practice that needs hacking of software etc and is a far cry from what tuning cars was&#x2F;is. Also tuning electric cars is very expensive and there is less diy. There surely are people who enjoy tinkering with electric cars but those are probably more IT nerds than car nerds. \nChoice is cool. Ever heard of hydrogen internal combustion engines?')
