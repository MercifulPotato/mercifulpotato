No one has to listen to algos. If your algo is buggy and suggests to kill rather than hire a candidate, would you?<p>Secondly, how is anyone&#x27;s business what kind of algos I run in course of operating a privately owned company?<p>The thorny issue is how did we get to this situation where property rights have become so weak that busybodies of all sorts feel entitled enough to order others how they ought to use their property (that is, data and algos).')
