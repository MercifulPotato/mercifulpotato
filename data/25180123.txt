I mean, launch any paint program developed for any platform in the last 40 years; chances are you can select a rectangle and just drag it.<p>There is a rhyme and reason to the way GIMP does it, and you can learn it quickly, but it&#x27;s going to cause complaints.<p>It could be that 99% of the anti-GIMP ranting is caused by this one issue.')
