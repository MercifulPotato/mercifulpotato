Entertainment or gaming apps that directly or indirectly reference the COVID-19 pandemic in any way are not appropriate for the App Store.<p>LOL, what a bunch of stupid people.<p>EDIT: I can see many legitimate uses of the &quot;viruses&quot; screensaver (so sad that we&#x27;ve got to the point to need to discuss these things).  For example, let&#x27;s say that you work on a lab that investigates this virus.  You may feel very natural to use this screensaver, that matches your similar desktop background.  All in all, it&#x27;s difficult to be angry about that.  The author of xscreensaver voluntarily accepted apple&#x27;s policies, implicitly and explicitly, by choosing to publish for this platform, so he had it coming.')
