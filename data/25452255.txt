Or they could have a &quot;rocky-release&quot; package with `Obsoletes: centos-release, redhat-release` and a `yum install <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rockylinux.org&#x2F;rocky-release-8.2-1.noarch.rpm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rockylinux.org&#x2F;rocky-release-8.2-1.noarch.rpm</a> ; yum upgrade` is all that&#x27;d be required to swap...<p>TL;DR: should be very easy, but there&#x27;s minor variations in methods that I doubt are finalized.')
