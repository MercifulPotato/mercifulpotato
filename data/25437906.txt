I would&#x27;ve thought the orientation of the curve was in the sense of maintaining a &quot;constant radius&quot; from the end of the lens stack. (exit pupil?)  I.e. the curve helps bring in the distant parts of the sensor closer and more orthogonal to the light rays.<p>But the diagram shows the <i>opposite</i> kind of curve!  That makes even less intuitive sense to me.<p>(I can&#x27;t imagine someone not involved with the company creating this diagram, or it being so wrong and not being caught by some review process?  I figure the diagram is legit?  Someone drawing ray tracing level details would get it so wrong?)')
