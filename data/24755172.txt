Quoting from the same link you posted:<p>&quot;The term &quot;paradox of tolerance&quot; does not appear anywhere in the main text of The Open Society and Its Enemies. Rather, Popper lists the above as a note to chapter 7, among the mentioned paradoxes proposed by Plato in his apologia for &quot;benevolent despotism&quot;â€”i.e., true tolerance would inevitably lead to intolerance, so autocratic rule of an enlightened &quot;philosopher-king&quot; would be preferable to leaving the question of tolerance up to majority rule. In the context of chapter 7 of Popper&#x27;s work, specifically, section II, the note on the paradox of tolerance is intended as further explanation of Popper&#x27;s rebuttal specific to the paradox as a rationale for autocracy: why political institutions within liberal democracies are preferable to Plato&#x27;s vision of benevolent tyranny, and through such institutions, the paradox can be avoided.&quot;<p>&quot;The chapter in question explicitly defines the context to that of political institutions and the democratic process, and rejects the notion of &quot;the will of the people&quot; having valid meaning outside of those institutions. Thus, in context, Popper&#x27;s acquiescence to suppression when all else has failed applies only to the state in a liberal democracy with a constitutional rule of law that must be just in its foundations, but will necessarily be imperfect&quot;.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I make no excuses for those people. They are garbage human beings that I would rather see dead than alive, but we must be sufficiently lucid to keep separate our personal preferences and our public policy proposals.<p>Facebook certainly has 100% the right to make that move, and I&#x27;m personally happy to see it. But the floor is extra-slippery. Let&#x27;s be careful.')
