Really the big thing is the screens finally felt good enough that I was able to occasionally forget what I was looking at was because I had two monitors strapped  to my face.<p>That said, I think I&#x27;m probably going to wait one more generation before I spend the money on a new headset. Hopefully the improvements in gen3 will comparable to those between gen1 and gen2.')
