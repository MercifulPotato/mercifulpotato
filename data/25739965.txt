Outer Worlds characters drew me in much more but the gameplay was dry. I&#x27;ll definitely go back to Cyberpunk when they turn on PS5 ray tracing.<p>Well the only side quests I got so far are go here and kill people grinds, but the bar is low. I consider a side quest interesting if it gives you some speech options or has some kind of immersion to the side quest environment. Having novel puzzle solving or forcing some kind of reasoning skills, revealing something fascinating about the world that adds depth to what is going on, those are great side quests.<p>There was definitely world building in the computer messages which was good. You can hack a computer to skip some side quest requirements, it&#x27;s not bad. To me the world is kind of cliche and dreary, again contrast with the playful inventiveness of Outer Words sci-fi world.<p>Actually I started playing on hard but switched to normal and then got super bored because it was too easy. Hard was kicking my ass and I couldn&#x27;t do anything but it does emphasize the hacking you are talking about and probably is how I would make the game interesting for me.<p>I got dejected after I ground out the money for the doctor who helps you and it had no impact on anything and realized my craft deconstruction perk was tearing up valuable sellable things and not giving much XP (you can&#x27;t turn it off). If it had scaled XP to value that would have been cool.')
