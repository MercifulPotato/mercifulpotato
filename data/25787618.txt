Nothing interesting happens as far as your neighbours are concerned, traffic passes in and out of your node, but that&#x27;s true for any number of application protocols of no interest.<p>However the comment you&#x27;re replying to talks about <i>exit</i> nodes, these are potentially obnoxious for your neighbours, as from them of course emerges traffic that somebody else didn&#x27;t want to admit to sending.<p>Now, perhaps it&#x27;s a young gay guy in a country where homosexuality is illegal, reading an essay by someone who has been in a similar situation.<p>Or a fourteen year old looking at pornography bypassing a &quot;family filter&quot;<p>But more likely it&#x27;s vandals trying to replace every mention of a pop star they don&#x27;t like on Wikipedia with the words &quot;Jerk Poop-head&quot;, a spammer sending piles of unsolicited commercial email, or a botnet operator trying to send C&amp;C packets to direct a DDoS.<p>For this you will of course get blocked by various services, and explaining it isn&#x27;t actually you might prevent getting <i>arrested</i> in many jurisdictions, but won&#x27;t mean everybody lets you use their services from this obviously tainted connection.<p>So, doing that on your personal ISP connection is probably a bad idea.')
