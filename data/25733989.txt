Item(by='fishtoaster', descendants=None, kids=[25735179], score=None, time=1610390840, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25733038, text='This complaint seems to include a ton of things like:<p>- AWS was especially mean to us<p>- AWS is hypocritical, look how bad twitter is<p>- We were singled out for political reasons<p>- This will kill us<p>All of which might be true, but none of which is illegal.  The main (only?) real legal complaint here seems to amount to &quot;AWS banned us to prop up Twitter in an anticompetitive way that&#x27;s illegal under antitrust laws.&quot;  That seems incredibly weak to anyone who&#x27;s been following this story at all.<p>The charitable interpretation of AWS&#x27;s actions would be that they banned Parler for refusing to moderate effectively.  The less charitable version is that AWS doesn&#x27;t care about Parler, but caved to public and internal pressure to ban them.  In no reasonable interpretation did AWS do it because they just love Twitter so much.  I don&#x27;t see this suit going anywhere.')
