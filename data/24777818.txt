Incandescent lightbulbs are perhaps the poster child for solid state devices which with a limited lifespan.  You can design lightbulbs for a 100 year lifespan at the cost of efficiency and bulb brightness.  Even then an incandescent bulbs lifespan is dramatically shorter if your power cycling it every 2 minutes. But eventually stuff like electromigration for example will be an issue for solid state devices. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Electromigration" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Electromigration</a><p>When designing wireless charging the same efficiency vs lifespan tradeoffs exist.  Sure, they might be fine, but donâ€™t expect them  to last 20 years or anything.  Further, the mats are significantly more expensive than a cable.<p>PS: Connector specifications are generally a dumpster fire because nobody wants to be forced to build expensive cables.  And even if the spec says X, if Y is cheaper and still mostly works then you can bet people will do Y. Failure tends take a while at which point people buy a new cable vs returning the old one etc.')
