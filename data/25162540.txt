Types are also much more precise and less brittle than tests, they establish clear contracts that reflect the actual structure of the program whereas tests provide assurance that some minimum subset of behavior is correct enough for the software to meet the expectations of users.<p>Ultimately, a lack of types is a form of technical debt because the data structures <i>do</i> exist whether you spend the time to formally acknowledge them or not.')
