There is no GOP rep who is out there stirring anything up on reversing this and despite the words &quot;urging its reversal&quot; there is not and will likely not ever be any action in this direction.<p>I can&#x27;t really imagine someone following American politics for more than a year and not realizing this. Almost none of the policy white papers these parties and candidates write will ever be implemented, at all.<p>The GOP almost never does anything its base actually wants, in the socially-conservative sense. They just pretend they will, to get votes; the same way the Democrats pretend they&#x27;re going to do any number of things for their base that never happen. It&#x27;s just kayfabe, it&#x27;s just an act to get you to vote and legitimize their power so that they can continue to do whatever is easiest and most expedient for each individual politician and player at any given moment.')
