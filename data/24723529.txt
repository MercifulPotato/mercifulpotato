I&#x27;m posting this in good faith.)<p>I&#x27;d say yes, but basically in the same way Coinbase&#x27;s band on political speech in the office is a stance.<p>Consider religious people whose theology holds that they should attempt to convert everybody in their circles, even their professional circles.<p>It seems to me that banning that is tantamount to saying either (a) their theology is wrong, or (b) it&#x27;s not wrong but the employer is resisting it regardless, or (c) the business has no place for employees holding those beliefs.')
