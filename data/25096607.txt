Even though I don&#x27;t have any Australian presence, my content is available in Australia, which might meet a standard for offering a service in Australia. I know this is not what this ruling is about, but it does bring reality closer to my hypothetical.<p>Secondly, why should local laws be enforcable globally? Should Australia really be able to globally forbid speech which is prohibited in Australia? Facebook&#x27;s initial response was to follow Australian rules in Australia, and geoblock the contested posts. According to this ruling, this is insufficient, and Facebook is required to block these posts, and &quot;equivalent&quot; content, globally.<p>edit: I did indeed misread &quot;Austria&quot; as &quot;Australia&quot; throughout the entire article')
