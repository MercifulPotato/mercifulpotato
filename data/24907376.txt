You must not watch sports then. High fives. Butt slaps. Chest bumps. etc. In fact, we might even say that there&#x27;s a big problem with men inappropriately touching people, just look at the next potential Leader of the Free World, they both have a reputation for inappropriate touching. If you can be President of the United States while also &quot;Grab &#x27;em [women] by the pussy&quot;, I think we&#x27;re being taught as men that we can easily get away with inappropriate touching.')
