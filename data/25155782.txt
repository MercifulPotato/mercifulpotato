Item(by='rglullis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605829473, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25155227, text='Let&#x27;s make this discussion a bit more concrete.<p>Take a look at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25155424" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25155424</a> and tell me where the CSS is inseparable from the HTML? Or where would one have to change the HTML structure if the designer decides to change the styling of the component&#x2F;page?<p>I am genuinely curious to get some feedback about it. I&#x27;m working on this project where I am dealing now with frontend stuff and I do want (need) to make it as easy as possible for others to integrate with their systems. If there is anything wrong with my approach I&#x27;d be very pleased to find out earlier than later.')
