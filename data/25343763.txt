And those publication has been known to pop up all kinds of rumours <i>only</i> to pump up TSMC&#x27;s stock price. And has relatively poor track record of any Apple information, or as a matter of fact, <i>any</i> information.<p>It would be interesting if Apple did make a discrete GPU, that would means they are making a separate GPU die for their Mac Pro and iMac with volume estimated to be no more than 1M unit per year. It makes sense from a technical perspective, it surely doesn&#x27;t from a cost perspective. Although Apple could happily charge $1000 just for the GPU to make up for ROI.')
