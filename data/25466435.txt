If base images still need to be updated it&#x27;s no different to traditional app deployment. If you deploy without containers, the program you&#x27;ve deployed is &quot;immutable&quot; in the sense that running apt-get upgrade won&#x27;t change it (assuming no new version of the app itself of course). Only the dependencies will change.')
