Item(by='erinaceousjones', descendants=None, kids=[25373574], score=None, time=1607605572, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25372276, text='Really like GFN, unfortunately the developer backlash renders it pretty useless since I can&#x27;t play most of the games I want to on it - pretty much only Ubisoft games in my Steam library show up these days. Wanted to play Borderlands 3 - nope, not on GFN. Conveniently on Stadia, though......<p>I have a new (2020 model) Philips Android TV, and unfortunately GFN has an experience-breaking audio bug on it, and I hazard that it probably won&#x27;t be fixed anytime soon, if ever, because &quot;it&#x27;s not supported hardware&quot; despite them developing the Android TV app and it having a really common MediaTek chipset. Don&#x27;t really want to fork out more money for a Shield after buying a brand new TV!<p>I tried Shadow last year and I really liked that, despite it being a little pricier. Regretfully cancelled my subscription, so I can&#x27;t get it back until NEXT JULY according to the preorder page!<p>What I&#x27;ve tried so far:<p>- Moonlight (so, local streaming): Best experience, hands down... For local network, and assuming you have a decent computer anyway. So, great if you want to stream from a PC in your office to your living room. If you&#x27;re lucky enough to get fiber to the home in your city, latency might be low enough and upload speed high enough that you can stream games outside your home. My cable ISP tops out at 10mbps though, so not for me. I use it as proof that there&#x27;s nothing wrong with my Android TV&#x27;s hardware though, since it&#x27;s happy to stream at 4K HDR 60fps H265 from my PC with only ~30ms latency.<p>- Shadow: Good quality, good virtual PC specs (GTX 1080 baseline), surprisingly little latency, lets you play any game that runs on PC. My friend even managed to play through all of Half-Life Alyx on his Quest using Virtual Desktop streamer on my Shadow instance. Unfortunately your subscription can take _months_ to become active -- might improve in future if the company scales up?<p>- Stadia (sideloaded to Android TV): Playable. Played a bit of Destiny 2 and Borderlands 3. Both in 4K and HDR. Picture quality a little muddy at times. Latency a bit too high to comfortably play first person shooters, but probably okay in other games.<p>- GeForce NOW: Playable, but the picture quality was also a bit muddy and the latency was higher than Stadia, and on my TV it suffered from the audio glitch (distorted audio, like the buffer chunk&#x27;s being played back at 44100 when it should be 48000, or the bit depth is wrong, or something). What really stops me from using it though - disappointing absence of most of my games from its library.<p>- Parsec, Blacknut: OK, have a bunch of free to play games in their respective libraries. The streams are only like 720p though.')
