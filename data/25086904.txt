I&#x27;ve spent weeks going to sleep to the sound of police grenades going off. I&#x27;ve been to CHAZ. I&#x27;ve watched, in bafflement, for weeks, at how news coverage - <i>particularly</i> national, but also local has painted an entirely different picture from what I&#x27;ve seen with my own two eyes.<p>The events he cites have taken place - but because of the superficial level of knowledge he has of the situation, he is omitting vital context.<p>I will absolutely gatekeep on this. Everyone&#x27;s entitled to an opinion, but it&#x27;s quite clear that _iyig has no first-hand knowledge, and only superficial second-hand knowledge of what he&#x27;s talking about.<p>At least, that&#x27;s my most charitable interpretation of the situation.')
