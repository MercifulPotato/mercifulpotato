I saw a video about tpms and privacy issues. Because each sensor have a unique id, and beacons it out every minute. With four weels, you have an unique is every 15 seconds or so. The industry response was that it was an unreasonable attack since each car brand had their own protocol. Well, the rtlsdr projects now can decode a dusin. But my point was, that since there is no standard on how tpms should communicate, why would there be a regulation dictating it do be done in a specific manner? The end goal is that the cars drive with correct tire pressure.')
