But for businesses that have adapted business processes to use them, Gitlab&#x2F;MediaWiki&#x2F;Dokuwiki simply don&#x27;t cut the mustard. We have an extensively customized Jira installation that&#x27;s used for tracking budget requests, cage access tickets, and system change requests--none of those fit into a &quot;bug&#x2F;task&#x2F;defect&quot; tracker like Redmine or Github Issues. And for anyone who&#x27;s gotten a manager using Confluence&#x27;s editor, moving to writing wiki source in Dokuwiki is a big step backwards.<p>The thing Atlassian had going for them is that we could get our non-technical people to use their stuff, understand it, and even customize it themselves to meet their needs. I&#x27;m not looking forward to trying to bend some other issue-tracking system to do it, so I&#x27;m guessing we&#x27;ll pony up for the DC-class charges (for the few years they continue offering that option) and see if a competitor emerges.')
