We have tons of unsolicited ballots with no chain of custody. We have tons of confirmed cases of dead people voting, and women having votes case under maiden names. There is unmistakable, wide spread, voting irregularity. This isn&#x27;t just the messaging of the president, this is a corrupt media that is on the side of establishment Democrats and Republicans that is clearly feeding a pure bullshit narrative to anyone willing to dull their senses, turn off all sources except the official industry standard media (Which got weapons of mass destruction wrong, which got Syria wrong, and which has a historic record of getting nearly everything wrong).<p>If you stop listening to the various Ministries of Truth (both private and government) the entire idea there was &quot;no election fraud&quot; falls apart. The voting machines were&#x2F;are a red haring. The real issue has always been the massive amounts of ballots with no chain of custody.')
