Ignored by his superiors, they keep him happy by letting him pick out <i>one</i> painting from the depot in the basement every year for his birthday. Due to his ability he knows which paintings are truly good among all the kitsch.<p>Then one painter suddenly gets world-famous after his death, and eight of his &quot;worthless&quot; paintings he had are suddenly worth millions. Then his boss demands that he hands over the paintings again, accusing him of stealing from the municipality.<p>This is the start of the film. I highly recommend it, even it&#x27;s not really about this but it&#x27;s a really good character study.')
