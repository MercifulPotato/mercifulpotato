I have no clue tbh, but probably has to do with I can do code and thus can give it away, and can&#x27;t do assets and thus can&#x27;t.</i><p>I&#x27;ll not claim to speak for your reasons, but in general the motivation seems to be defense of things like trademark&#x2F;trade dress or restrictive franchise licensing and adaptations to other media.<p>Eg. If Doom&#x27;s assets were entirely free of any and all restrictions, anyone could have produced a Doom movie (including an inevitable Rule 34 version), not to mention sequelae.')
