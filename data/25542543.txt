I absolutely adore my Onyx Boox Note2 — it’s e-ink display is just brilliant, but it also proves your point: they’re a Chinese company through and through, building amazing tools and gadgets because patents don’t scare them off.<p>Also, the fact they ported basically every software feature from the Note3 which came out weeks after I got my Note2 made me amazingly happy, their after sales support has been surprisingly good, the new firmware has removed literally all latency when using the Wacom stylus for note taking, and I recently bought the Staedtler “pencil” Wacom compatible stylus and now I’ve literally ditched pen and paper for good.<p>It’s that excellent, for me.')
