We can speculate that the game’s feature set is unfinished, but is it also not possible that this video game in its “finished” state just isn’t what people wanted it to be? Clearly there are bugs and I agree the product right now isn’t finished, but once any glitches and performance issues are fixed, I’m not sure if the gameplay will ever meet expectations.<p>Edit: not sure of why I have -5 points.')
