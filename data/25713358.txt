Get a tracking app to keep track of the days you are showing up (Google calendar app has one built in called Goals). Show up daily.<p>Did only 3 pushups? Bench pressed only 40 pounds? Walked only half a mile? All good. The only thing matters is that you showed up. If you need a metric to keep motivated, track streaks.<p>Once the habit takes hold you will magically improve the type of exercises that you do and enjoy. You will see improvement in health and mood. The positive feedback cycle will push you further. Good luck.')
