Background check companies don&#x27;t have to be licensed, and no one keeps track.<p>But you are correct: The burden of proof should be reversed. We know most folks aren&#x27;t a flight risk and gentle measures - such as having folks check in and calling folks to remind them of court dates - have good results.')
