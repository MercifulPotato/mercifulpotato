We would argue that this is not true to the spirit and goals of Haskell, and we have attempted in this paper to remain within the space of “reasonably idiomatic” Haskell. However, we have made abundant use of strictness annotations, explicit strictness, and unboxed vectors. We have, more controversially perhaps, used unsafe array subscripting in places. Are our choices reasonable?</i><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.ru.nl&#x2F;P.Achten&#x2F;IFL2013&#x2F;symposium_proceedings_IFL2013&#x2F;ifl2013_submission_20.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.ru.nl&#x2F;P.Achten&#x2F;IFL2013&#x2F;symposium_proceedings_I...</a>')
