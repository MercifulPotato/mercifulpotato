Item(by='bumby', descendants=None, kids=[25339408], score=None, time=1607381229, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25338591, text='&gt;<i>first stage it&#x27;s comparable to something like one modern Olympic games event cost.</i><p>To continue on with the steelmanning, the first stage is probably a drop in a bucket compared to the entire effort. How much freight do you think it would take to colonize a planet with a population large enough to be relatively self-sufficient? Just the payload cost would be huge and that&#x27;s just to park it (not to assemble, maintain etc.) I think the steelman argument would be to focus on things immediately needed, like healthcare, before space adventurism.<p>Edit: to put a finer point on it, the commercial space industry is essentially subsidized by the government precisely <i>because</i> it&#x27;s not currently economical. In other words, if the government wasn&#x27;t a customer there would be no commercial space industry. There&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with this because it&#x27;s how high-risk industries often get started (e.g., the airlines), but the fact that it is subsidized by the government points to the fact that it is (currently) inherently <i>un</i>economical')
