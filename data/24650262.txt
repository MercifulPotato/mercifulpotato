These were complete guts down to the studs with new windows, doors, electrical, plumbing, insulation.<p>Expense wise, you need quite a few tools and obviously materials. Doors I always went with solid core doors (vs hollow) and double pane windows. We used fiber glass insulation and drywall was appropriate to the room (water proof drywall in the kitchen &#x2F; bathroom, regular in the rooms) always at least a half inch.<p>Demolition was fun if not exhausting (plaster and lath walls). Neighbors took the original doors to match existing builds.<p>Took time to get good at mudding the joints to get them smooth. I did the electrical; sub contracted out for plumbing. I don&#x27;t mind electrocuting myself lol, but a leak in plumbing and you can throw all of your work out.<p>Dad (who has experience) helped and I learned a lot from him (especially on cutting trim and tile). Otherwise watching a ton of home improvement shows; youtube videos; etc...<p>All of it is totally doable; just need to take your time, measure 20 times, cut once, etc...<p>My favorite work was masonry - I built a brick pizza oven 1 year; then a concrete block planting wall with a fireplace in it the following year.<p>Can&#x27;t say I want to do it again; took all 8 years before we divorced and she kept it to get everything but 1 bedroom done; but if I have to when I buy my next house, I know I can and how.')
