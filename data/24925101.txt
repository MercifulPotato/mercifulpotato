But my first idea was to put phrases like, &quot;Did you know the first computer programmer was a woman? Ada Lovelace&quot; and other surprising, encouraging facts about women, minorities, and inclusivity in STEM on posters, flyers, or whatever.<p>I think one of the keys to getting anyone (child, high schooler, adult, etc) interested in something is to make it cool. Making something cool requires a different approach for different groups. Adults might think it&#x27;s cool to make a lot of money, but kids often don&#x27;t care about that. But if you know anything about your child&#x27;s generation and what her age groups thinks is cool, try to find facts that highlight how &quot;cool&quot; STEM is in their context.<p>Please don&#x27;t interpret my use of &quot;surprising&quot; to be condescending, I mean that I think most high schoolers will find these things surprising.')
