It doesn&#x27;t just do the same thing but faster, it does a lot more besides, and it creates social, political, and economic effects that extend far beyond the physics and math involved in construction and programming.<p>QC will probably be similar. It&#x27;s too early to tell what the qualitative changes will be, but QC&#x27;s place on the developmental tree of technology will depend on how unexpected and extreme they are, and not just on how hard it is to get to a useful number of cubits.')
