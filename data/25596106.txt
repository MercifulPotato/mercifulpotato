This likely has terrible effects on a sexually developing, novelty-seeking brain.<p>Boys and girls today will both have an unnatural understanding of sex because of pornography. The sex they see on the internet is joyless an without love, let alone that the sex portrayed in porn is better categorized as &quot;feats of strength&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s ironic to me that the content being deplatformed by Big Tech is the content that will help people find God&#x27;s path, yet OnlyFans is just fine. Sickening.')
