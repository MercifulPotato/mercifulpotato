Item(by='mattnewport', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607649154, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25379743, text='The &quot;prisoner&#x27;s dilemma&quot; stuff at the end of the article makes no sense. The article starts by explaining why UPS does this - it benefits UPS. UPS doesn&#x27;t do this to be a &quot;good citizen&quot;, it does it because it is more efficient for UPS. UPS doesn&#x27;t even do it because it&#x27;s somehow better for UPS overall even though it&#x27;s worse for individual UPS drivers. If an individual driver could do better by turning left according to their route planning software then it would have them turn left.<p>If this works in general for typical routes driven by individuals (rather than only for delivery routes like a UPS driver is making with multiple stops that don&#x27;t have to happen in any particular order) then it would make sense for individuals to do it and they could benefit by doing it without needing anyone else to do it as well. There is no prisoner&#x27;s dilemma here.')
