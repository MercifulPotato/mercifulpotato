I think a lot of people can see themselves in this story. The desire to walk off and be alone and sure potentially to just give up and die somewhere. If he really just sat down and decided to starve or was so deeply depressed as to be unable to see he was slowly dying he had some deep issues that we&#x27;ll probably never know the extent of.<p>Any time something like this comes out it reminds me, especially during the holiday to season, to reach out intentionally to people I care about and make sure they know I&#x27;ve got their back.<p>Just last week I did some sleuthing and found out an old friend had been incarcerated for 15 years for a drink driving crash that killed someone. I knew his family life was a mess and even though we hadn&#x27;t talked in 10+ years I wrote him a letter to let him know someone was at least thinking about him.<p>Whatever happened to this guy his story reminds us to take care of each other.')
