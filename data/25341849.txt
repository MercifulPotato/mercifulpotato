It might be that the structure Rabois has put together allows him to avoid taxes on equity after he moves; but most people who are leaving will still have to pay those taxes when they finally sell.<p>Regarding their actions being a symbolic betrayal of the Bay Area, I suspect most of them feel betrayed. High income tax in California doesn&#x27;t reflect high provision of services. It&#x27;s due in part to poor cost control and in part to poor property tax policy, such that California&#x27;s income tax is a de facto transfer of wealth from working people and capital investors to property owners. These investors, companies and workers have paid a tremendous amount in taxes, and have been repaid with ever greater taxation, ever decreasing access to the property they are helping to subsidize, poor services, and even disrespect.<p>There&#x27;s no reason to assume that every tax, fee or levy that the government issues is justified. The authors refer to Twitter and other companies as being &quot;...let...off the hook...&quot; for a tax but fail to mention that this was San Francisco&#x27;s effort to impose its own payroll tax!')
