Chlorophyll is immensely inefficient<p>A simpler explanation is chlorophyll is balancing energy production vs. safety.<p><i>Instead, for a safe, steady energy output, the pigments of the photosystem had to be very finely tuned in a certain way. The pigments needed to absorb light at similar wavelengths to reduce the internal noise. But they also needed to absorb light at different rates to buffer against the external noise caused by swings in light intensity. The best light for the pigments to absorb, then, was in the steepest parts of the intensity curve for the solar spectrum â€” the red and blue parts of the spectrum.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quantamagazine.org&#x2F;why-are-plants-green-to-reduce-the-noise-in-photosynthesis-20200730&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quantamagazine.org&#x2F;why-are-plants-green-to-reduc...</a>')
