If these users exist, they probably wouldn&#x27;t be found around these parts.<p>I do find it interesting because conversely in a car I absolutely do prefer an OEM integrated infotainment system as opposed to after market. Granted my experience with after market head units is kinda old, but I recall them seeming fairly antiquated with an OEM unit from the same vintage. Their real appeal was to &quot;modernize&quot; a legacy vehicle.')
