They rely on goodwill and reciprocity and great relationships to get things done as they have zero power. Early power comes from getting people to buy into your vision.<p>Corporate middle &#x2F; senior managers rate higher because it it generally all about the power.<p>The interesting insight was that as an entrepreneur, when your business scales it is hard to retain the “low Machiavelly” approach.
