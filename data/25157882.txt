That just depends on (1) how strictly you have configured the type checker and (2) how specific you make your type definitions.<p>The more advanced types just allow more specific type definitions. So if try to you them, and you can&#x27;t get them to work... you can just avoid the advanced features and leave the type definitions more vague. Just like how if you can&#x27;t get the basic types to work, you can always use &quot;any&quot;.')
