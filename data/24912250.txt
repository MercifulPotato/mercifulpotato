You seem to be missing various points:<p>- Mathematics is a very large field.<p>- For beginners, it is necessary to have wiser people than yourself put up some signposts.<p>I found the comment you&#x27;re referring to very illuminating. I&#x27;m not naively assuming the author&#x27;s view is the only one, or &quot;correct&quot;, but s&#x2F;he certainly like they have some familiarity with graduate&#x2F;research level mathematics in relevant areas. So it was very helpful to see, at least from the point of view of some mathematicians, that this is not considered an important area.<p>I was left wondering whether the author of that comment understood the importance of this stuff in computer science (i.e. in academic approaches to programming languages, might be the right term, I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m pretty ignorant of  these areas myself), or whether they were only able to criticize it from the point of view of pure mathematics.')
