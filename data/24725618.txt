On the other hand, I&#x27;ve spent 1% of my remaining life under lockdown so far, and expect to spend an approximately equal amount before a vaccine. At what point is it not worth it?<p>I&#x27;ve thought a little about this in terms Quality-Adjusted-Life-Years, let&#x27;s say &quot;Covid lockdown&quot; gives a discount factor of half (maybe should be less, but been feeling kind of shitty recently). In these terms, I&#x27;ve already spent 2.5X more QALY from lockdown than the Micromorts I&#x27;d get from Covid and expect to spend another 2.5X more before this is all over.<p>Other factors are A) I’m in a pod with older family members, so I&#x27;d have to exit the pod. B) If I got sloppier, I’d increase the chance that somebody else got it, which feels like a dick move. C) The long term health effects are not known, and even if I live it could fuck me up for life (this could be worked into the QALY).<p>How are other people dealing with this?')
