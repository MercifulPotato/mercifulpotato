I&#x27;d also set all bill payments to autopay so you avoid any late fees&#x2F;delinquent accounts which needlessly hurts your credit. I highly encourage you to list out your regular monthly expense categories and write out what that is (e.g. mortgage&#x2F;utilities&#x2F;subscriptions), add that all up, and then see what the delta is every month so you know where your discretionary spending is going. Even better is to have a financial goal with a finite number so you know how you are progressing towards it (e.g. emergency fund, vacation fund, retirement, etc).')
