Primarily, they were arduous - by the middle of the year, any window with a title containing certain strings, even ones as innocuous as &quot;Firefox&quot;, would be closed automatically without warning. It got in the way of legitimate activities - a number of teachers also found ways to avoid them as sites they needed were often blocked. It was also interesting to keep having to find new ways to get around it (&quot;CGI proxies&quot;[1] found via Google -&gt; self-hosted proxies -&gt; wildcard domains to bypass filter lists -&gt; access via IP and random port -&gt; local admin exploit to disable protection&#x2F;monitoring software).<p>In the process, we discovered that the security was rather inadequate. A VNC server was installed on all machines, including staff machines, with the very imaginative password of &quot;vnc&quot; (not hard to guess once you see a member of staff typing in a three character password), and we shoulder-surfed a domain admin password and it was just &quot;school&quot;. This was later changed[2], but we bruteforced a cached hash[3] and found it was just the name of the school with a &#x27;0&#x27; in place of an &#x27;o&#x27;. We had a &#x27;shadow&#x27; domain admin account for _months_ before it was noticed, even after the staff were aware people were poking at holes in the system (someone else had sent a Window messenger service message to the entire domain around the same time).<p>We never really used it for anything though - we created the domain admin account to see if we could, then it basically went unused after that. We only got caught after someone else used a script to change the local admin password on every computer (I&#x27;m still not entirely sure why). It did provide an interesting lesson in OPSEC though - it was only tied back to us as they were tracking USD device names, and someone called their USB drive &quot;&lt;surname&gt; USB&quot; and still had it connected when logging into the domain admin account.<p>The punishment was to spend a week working with the IT technicians (mostly doing busy work such as cable managing rooms and tracking down serial numbers&#x2F;asset tags), which gave us plenty of time to fully explain the flaws we found. I think they took security more seriously after that.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jmarshall.com&#x2F;tools&#x2F;cgiproxy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jmarshall.com&#x2F;tools&#x2F;cgiproxy&#x2F;</a><p>[2] we had no malicious intent, so upon realising that gave you read&#x2F;write access to everyone&#x27;s files, we left an anonymous note containing the login details at the IT technicians&#x27; office hoping they would improve things. Some of the teaching staff were also aware, and their only advice was essentially &quot;Don&#x27;t get caught&quot; (and one asked for a copy of the Ophcrack live CD).<p>[3] Booted from an Ophcrack live CD, something that was &quot;fixed&quot; by removing the CD drive from every machine in the school')
