For example Tesla&#x27;s cost to make a model 3 is estimated to be around $28k which they sell for an average of $45k (as a guess, certainly more than $40k).  It doesn&#x27;t make sense to apportion Tesla&#x27;s cost of new factories onto the &quot;cost of production&quot; of its cars.  This is all finance 101.')
