You may well already have the ability to form the well-reasoned argument (achieving a PHD is evidence of this) but finding the words in a timely manner - especially during an adrenaline-fuelled debate - is difficult.<p>I would recommend trying to find a regular spot in your routine where you can spend a timed 10 minutes doing an exercise of your own choosing - and record yourself on your phone doing it. For example, you might spend a week with the exercise &quot;Pros and cons of a technology&quot;. Then speak to the camera and write out the lists.<p>For example, one day you might choose PHP, and decide to be against it - so you would write<p>Cons:<p>Poorly designed<p>Leads to terribly written programs<p>Lack of decent security patterns<p>Pros: - each having a counterpoint, because you&#x27;ve decided to be against it.<p>Ubiquitous (but rubbish that everyone uses is still rubbish)<p>Good documentation (it needs to be because it&#x27;s so hard to write well)<p>Good online help (though also poisoned with bad advice)<p>Keep each line 10 words or less, and if you find yourself becoming incoherent, strike through the line immediately and move on to a different pro&#x2F;con. Don&#x27;t be disheartened if the first few goes at this are all crossed out lines!<p>Don&#x27;t feel you HAVE to watch back the recording - it&#x27;s simply there to provide artificial pressure, and can often be useful when things go wrong as a kind of post-mortem - why did I start to stutter there? What words could I have used to better convey my point? How did that look from someone outside my head?<p>The key here is to practice your arguing skills, pressure management and multi-tasking - not to improve your knowledge - so use topics you know well and start with viewpoints you hold yourself. As it gets easier, try to flip to the opposite viewpoint, e.g. argue that PHP is the best language, and try to argue that. Then, try to come up with new challenges for yourself that work on the key weaknesses you&#x27;ve identified in yourself.<p>Once you feel you&#x27;re getting the hang of it, look into joining a local debating club or public speaking club. Many exist, with vastly different flavours - and having a real human being on the other side of your argument will notch the difficulty up a bit, but in a supportive environment. And often you&#x27;ll get good feedback on your technique.<p>Lastly, remember that most people are secretly socially awkward (especially in Tech). Some of us present a better facade than others. Don&#x27;t be scared to take a deep breath, or say &quot;I&#x27;ll come back to you on that&quot;, or ask &quot;can you reword that as a question?&quot; and write the question down to deal with later. This is a difficult skill that we&#x27;re not evolutionarily designed to excel at, so cut yourself some slack and build your personal heuristics. You can do this, but it takes practice. Good luck!')
