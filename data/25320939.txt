No mention in the article of DECNet, which was the networking suite for the VMS operating system. [1] It was my first intro to inter-process communications. The libraries were easily accessible from VAX FORTRAN, another awesome DEC product.<p>Besides enabling processes on VAX&#x2F;VMS hosts to share data easily, DECNet could also interoperate with networking on IBM operating systems like MVS. At one point DEC apparently could network IBM computers--which had wildly different architectures--better than IBM itself.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DECnet" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DECnet</a>')
