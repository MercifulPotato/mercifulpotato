I do found idyllic to go to the countryside here in Sweden and spend quite a few weeks there for summer and winter but that&#x27;s not the life I&#x27;d like to be living for years.<p>I enjoy being in a city for my hobbies, such as music, it&#x27;s easy to find good concerts, people to mingle and chat about those hobbies. I like the human connections of cities, I enjoy meeting my friends to do something, to see an art exhibition, to make music together.<p>Nothing of that is possible with little money, I&#x27;d need to save a lot through decades to keep this lifestyle work-free.<p>I don&#x27;t want a family life so that leaves me tied to having friends and spending time with them, moving to the countryside would be worse for my needs than having to work.<p>Not everybody dreams of owning a house and settling down in peace in the middle of nowhere, with all the free time to look at trees and write about them. I love going to a secluded cabin, bringing all my music gear and staying there for weeks but it&#x27;s not something to live on for years.')
