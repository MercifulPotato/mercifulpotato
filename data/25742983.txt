Worst case is you get assigned a stock you wanted to own anyway, but at a discount to the original face value + you’re paid to do it.<p>Actual worst case is the underlying pops and you “only” get the premium you collected and not the full upside.<p>So definitely not a profit maximising strategy but still a reasonable one. Especially if the market&#x2F;underlying are generally moving sideways.')
