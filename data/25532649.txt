And the previous chancellor Sajid Javid? Or the previous PM Theresa May, or the previous Home Secretary Amber Rudd? Or arch-Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom. The ERG does fit that caricature to a certain extent but the mainstream Conservative party and its leadership doesn&#x27;t.<p>And whether they do or don&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t mean their politics is any more or less enlightened. If we&#x27;re going to pick an axis to complain about it should be quite clearly be class, not gender or race.<p>Or just judge people on their individual actions or position of privilege.<p>I don&#x27;t suddenly feel all warm and fuzzy about Rishi Sunak, who made millions off subprime and is now richer than the Queen, or Sajid Javid who was at the heart of disastrous decision-making from Deutsche Bank before the 2008 crisis and now fabulously wealthy as a result, because they&#x27;re from ethnic minorities.')
