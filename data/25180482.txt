It&#x27;s plausible, but lots of things are plausible - it&#x27;s plausible that the original reporting is correct, plausible that Stillwell is embarrassed about his involvement, plausible that Cambridge was involved in some way that didn&#x27;t involve Stillwell. You seem to have reached a stronger conclusion, that Stillwell&#x27;s statement is definitely correct and the reporting was definitely wrong, and I don&#x27;t see how you got there by just looking at plausibility.')
