Item(by='idoubtit', descendants=None, kids=[25595711], score=None, time=1609373543, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25586426, text='In France, there are distinct certifications: &quot;Bio&quot; for organic food, and &quot;Label rouge&quot; for high quality meat. For instance, animals with the later certification may eat non-organic food, but they spend most of their days outside, their feeding is sane, and the food process is controlled down to the distribution. No hormones, no chlore... Of course, some products can have both labels. And some farms, especially the smaller ones, apply similar processes but without any certification.')
