Look at any documentary talking about a man who is considered attractive and see what word they use first. &quot;Tall, dark and handsome&quot; - notice the order. The list goes on and once you start looking for it you&#x27;ll be surprised. Look at romance - novels - see how many of the men are short.<p>You could also speak to some women and ask them about it. If you ask enough you&#x27;ll get at least some honest responses (not disparaging women, equally men may often be deceptive on this kind of question).<p>I&#x27;m also not sure I understand your argument - both men + women contribute to height, male height is only part of the equation (my dad is normal height my mum is very short and I am short for example). Also nutrition has been HUGE in stunting growth, societies with better nutrition have a very big increase in height (which also suggests sexual selection plays a role I&#x27;d say).<p>Height is also in a pretty narrow range anyway, +-2SD.<p>Finally I&#x27;d say that if you were significantly shorter than average and male + had tried your hand with dating you&#x27;d have a very raw and immediate series of data points that would be pretty compelling.<p>This isn&#x27;t really a controversial point, in the same way men have a preference for a certain hip&#x2F;waist ratio in women (&quot;why don&#x27;t all women then have that hip&#x2F;waist ratio&quot; you might ask following your existing argument...!)')
