I&#x27;m pretty sure if this was true, everyone would be using it for database work now, except no one does. So these claims are baseless.<p>Business are doing exactly that. They are using private blockchains to improve their existing architecture and enable new features.

You don&#x27;t even seem to be sure and are just guessing that it&#x27;s novel and surely has some value, but you don&#x27;t know why?<p>I&#x27;m not the deciding factor in what bitcoin becomes and won&#x27;t try to guess what its use cases will be. We didn&#x27;t know why&#x2F;what the Internet was going to be used for and then it grew and evolved into what it is today.<p>&gt; Trillions?

It has several improvements to the store of value use case. Gold&#x27;s market cap is ~$9 trillion.

You don&#x27;t understand why blockchain technology is so important.')
