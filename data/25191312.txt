People are weighting the events of 2020 far too lightly.<p>The American identity is under siege... being told where you can and can&#x27;t go, and under what conditions (mask &#x2F; no mask), is totally alien to an American, and I don&#x27;t know why it would shock anyone, anywhere, that understands even the slightest bit about our culture to hear this.<p>And that&#x27;s just one small aspect of the cultural component of this pandemic.<p>No... 2020 is going to change the entire world, or more accurately, COVID-19.<p>EDIT: Oh yeah, Morgan Stanley is already issuing guidance that 2021 is going to be a commercial real estate bloodbath, lol, so, you know... there&#x27;s <i>that</i>.<p>Not to mention the huge influx of people into flyover states once they realize New York is only a nice place to be if you can actually go out and do shit.
