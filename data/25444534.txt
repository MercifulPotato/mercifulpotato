If I were optimizing, I&#x27;d have some in US institutions, some abroad, some in land, some in blockchain, some in gold, etc.<p>The US has had a nice 250-year run. Past performance doesn&#x27;t always predict future performance, and more importantly, if I live 100 years, that means the US has been around for 2.5 of my lifetimes. I think that&#x27;s a good indicator of the level of stability. There&#x27;s perhaps a 1-in-2 chance of some major event within my lifetime, consider things like the American Revolution, Civil War, or Great Depression to be major events.<p>Not all of those would wipe out my assets, but I&#x27;d say about a 1:5 chance of my assets being neutered or neutralized within my life.<p>We tend to plan for the common, minor stuff (typo, guy loses $50k), and overlook big, rare events (like the current, entirely predictable pandemic).')
