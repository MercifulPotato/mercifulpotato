Beginners might be tempted to approach their fitness by asking that question:<p>what muscle I want to grow today?<p>That is not the way to go.\nIf you start out or especially during a pandemic where you need to work with everything you can get go for composite exercises that hit more muscles and are the opposite of isolation exercises you might be tempted to choose from a page like this.\nBeginners: full body workouts.\nAdvanced: 2 to 3 day split.\nExpert: you know your drill. and will do whatever works for you.<p>So who should be using this site?\nBeginners and advanced should use a plan that is preconfigured. Pros know what exercises they want to configure into their routines.<p>Don’t get me wrong: It’s nice to have for reference but do yourself a favor and use some preconfigured workouts if  you’re starting out.<p>You won’t get a sixpack by only working out abs. Train your whole body and reduce body fat. That’s the way to go.')
