There are many attempts to study this and many different takes on it, for example Tainter&#x27;s <i>Collapse of Complex Societies</i>.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that this should be terrifying, civilizations come and go, it&#x27;s a question of when rather than if, unless you think our civilization is unique among all the others. But I don&#x27;t think people should stay awake, worrying about civilizational collapse. Our own individual life is much more fragile, so maybe worry about getting enough exercise instead.<p>But this point doesn&#x27;t seem very profound or interesting to me, nor do I believe it is Burke&#x27;s central thesis, which I really believe is about the connections between different technological advances. That is, how does technological process happen, and specifically, how did it happen in the West? History of technology is fascinating to me.<p>I love this show, it&#x27;s really a masterwork and a great learning program for young students as well as entertainment for us geezers.')
