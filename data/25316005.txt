When I run a Linux router, I am not choosing at random from all the vendors. It&#x27;s the same for my phone. I choose which one to use on purpose. Not only can I install my own apps, but I can install my own system as well. This lets me run devices from 2013 on the latest version of Android.<p>Answers below until I am no longer rate limited:<p>&gt; Sure but almost nobody can do that because they didn’t make the same careful choice as you did.<p>What does that have to do with anything? Just because all iOS devices are bad and many Android devices are bad doesn&#x27;t mean all devices are bad. I choose from the good devices.<p>&gt; Also, you routinely make unsupported claims<p>Show me one unsupported claim I have made.<p>&gt; you are going to say nearly 100%, you’ll need to show a source.<p>I have literally never seen an Android phone that does not allow sideloading. I have heard of many that do not allow unlocking the bootloader, but sideloading is standard. I can&#x27;t provide a source because the idea that an Android phone would not allow sideloading is so absurd that nobody would bother explaining why it doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>&gt; it contradicts what others say when I suggest Android is an open alternative to iOS.<p>What have others said?<p>Edit 2 for the second post:<p>&gt; Usually when I bring up sideloading as a reason why people should choose Android if they don’t like the restrictions of iOS, people claim that it is too hard for regular users to do because of the configuration required.<p>The OS takes the user to the settings checkbox to check. This has been true for as long as I can remember.')
