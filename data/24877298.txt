Whether it is a copyright violation depends on whether Youtube&#x27;s license includes letting visitors make permanent copies, as this is considered a separate type of license. The TOS has nothing to do with it.<p>YouTube is not the copyright owner (in almost all cases). Downloading a video with youtube-dl may not be a copyright violation if you already separately hold a suitable license, or are in fact the copyright owner yourself (as in the case of one of the grandparent comments).')
