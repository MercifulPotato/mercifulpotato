It&#x27;s not 500$ extra for 8GB more, it&#x27;s 500$ extra for being able to do ML at all basically.<p>AMD GPUs have near zero support in major ML frameworks. There are some things coming out with Rocm and other niche things, but most people in ML already have enough work dealing with model and framework problems that using experimental AMD support is probably a no go.<p>Hell, if AMD had a card with 8GB ram more than nvidia, and for 500$ cheaper, I would still go with nvidia.  \nEveryone wish AMD would step their game up w.r.t ML workloads but it&#x27;s just not happening (yet), Nvidia has a complete monopoly there.')
