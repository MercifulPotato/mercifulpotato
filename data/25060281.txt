Actually deploying something into the real world, effecting real change, is the hard part, but most researchers are focused on getting the next publications accepted, and only that.<p>Not every researcher is like that, but it&#x27;s a problem. The researchers I worked with, also, unfortunately, had this idea that engineering is somehow beneath science. That&#x27;s just worrying about the details. They think that the idea itself is the real advancement. They think of themselves as smarter and more important than engineers, and they don&#x27;t like when engineers press them on how they would actually implement their ideas into something real.<p>Sorry if I sound cynical, it&#x27;s because I am.')
