They did a bunch of analysis to see what the target demo for a music channel is, what that demographic wants to see in general, and started playing that.<p>But, obviously, if I turn on the MUSIC TV channel, I expect to see <i>music</i>.<p>I&#x27;m the &quot;target demo&quot; for Science Fiction. That doesn&#x27;t mean I want to see SciFi when I turn on the evening news. It doesn&#x27;t mean that I never want to see a period drama, or a nature documentary.<p>But based on a purely <i>statistical</i> analysis, I should only be shown Science Fiction forever and ever, on every channel, because that&#x27;s my favourite content category.<p>Similarly, the number #1 most popular content for the <i>general public</i> is sports for men and celebrity gossip for women.<p>Does this mean that every streaming service, TV channel, and content producer should create nothing else other than Soccer, Football, Dancing with the Stars, and Big Brother Celebrity?<p>It seems producers think so. They <i>really do</i>, and NetFlix is going down that path as fast as their statistics will carry them...')
