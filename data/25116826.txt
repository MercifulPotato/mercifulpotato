It simply offers an assurance that, at around the time of sending, a given email was mostly likely sent from the server that signed it.  It can&#x27;t prove _anything_ about who actually sent it, because it can&#x27;t guarantee the ownership of the email account.<p>&gt;For better or for worse, the DKIM authenticity stamp has been widely used by the press, primarily in the context of political email hacks. It’s real, it’s important, and it’s meaningful.<p>There&#x27;s no _better_ there -- only for worse.  It would be better to dispute the validity of using DKIM for non-repudiation of emails than to propagate the lie and ask server operators to publish their expired secret keys.')
