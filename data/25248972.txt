Double espresso every morning, 10-15 minute naps in the classroom&#x2F;subway&#x2F;literally anywhere&#x2F;nights without sleep at all - I had it all. The only exception were Sundays, where I would get solid 11+ hours sleep.<p>I think during these times I learned the value of high-quality sleep and I am simply afraid to miss on it now.<p>Also no alarm clocks, coffee&#x2F;energetics only when it&#x27;s really necessary (once a few months at most), regular exercise (does not matter what exactly, as long as I move any parts of my body, even plain walking around is amazing) - all of it goes a long way to help with the sleep.')
