It might be the case if you are trying to target IE9, but &quot;we&#x27;ve been trying it over a decade&quot; is no longer an excuse in 2020 when there are only 2-3 relevant browser engines and all of them are reasonably up to spec.<p>&gt; Also, it&#x27;s not a matter of strictly separating the groups of people doing one task or another. It&#x27;s a matter of being able to extend in one dimension while keeping the other untouched.<p>Have you   worked on a website with a complex web design? If you know how to do this where you write the HTML with only semantic markup tags then don&#x27;t touch it again while you style it with CSS, you&#x27;re breaking new ground because nobody has figured out how to do this.<p>That&#x27;s why Tailwind, Tachyons, Bootstrap etc. exist and continue to evolve - nobody has figured out the best way to do things yet. The MVC style you can do in other languages just isn&#x27;t practical with standard HTML and CSS and it&#x27;s not through lack of people trying. CSS has rapidly been improving the last few years but we&#x27;re still a long way away from being able to avoid e.g. adding a wrapper div or shuffling HTML around to solve CSS issues.<p>&gt; all they are going to do is this mushing together of their structure and their presentation layers<p>I think the issue here is you think HTML is for structure only and CSS is for presentation only, when the practical reality is HTML is mostly part of the presentation layer as well because CSS alone isn&#x27;t powerful + practical enough.<p>Large websites already store their page titles, page content etc. in a structured CMS database. What tangible benefit are you getting by pushing to separate structure and presentation more than this?<p>For non-web apps, how is structure and presentation split up more than this and how does it differ from web apps?')
