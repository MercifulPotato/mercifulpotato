Item(by='Tor3', descendants=None, kids=[24688042, 24692496], score=None, time=1601901072, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24686993, text='I counted 16 vending machines side-by-side outside a random shop I visited in &quot;my&quot; town (the town where I stay when I&#x27;m in Japan).<p>And yes they&#x27;re everywhere. I appreciated them particularly the first couple of years I visited, as at that time shops <i>insisted</i> on you paying as accurately as possible, they tended to refuse accepting banknotes if that implied returning a lot of coins. Strange thing, and that has since changed (i.e. that&#x27;s not a problem anymore), but, back then the easiest way out was to simply buy a 100yen coffee from a vending machine, paying with a note, and keep the change to use in shops.')
