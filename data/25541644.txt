Entrepreneurial success is measured in money.  And the only way to get money is to get <i>people</i> to give it to you.<p>So, it&#x27;s really about people - their problems, their needs, how much pain that causes, how they do things now, what alternatives they know about, what they can adopt, how difficult that will be.<p>This is real marketing (not the &quot;advertising&quot; it&#x27;s sometimes thought to be).<p>---<p>You mean Antonio Salieri, presented as Mozart&#x27;s rival?<p>I think that zone is ideal for entrepreneurs, because you are smart enough to solve problems, while still dumb enough to feel them as problems worth solving - i.e. you can identify with the struggles of ordinary folk (I think geniuses don&#x27;t really quite believe that other people find things so difficult.)<p>On the other hand, there&#x27;s an argument that genius is not something you <i>are</i> (e.g. high IQ), but something you <i>do</i>. There are acts of genius, not geniuses. And all these acts of genius took a lot of time and effort (perhaps somewhat hidden, as preparation before and application afterwards). It helps to be smart, but maybe will and physical constitution are more important.<p>---<p>Finally, the choice of problem is crucial. There must be a gap in the market - going back to the people part. There must be something to discover.<p>Einstein was smart and hardworking, but after general relativity, he didn&#x27;t discover anything of note... which seems to have been because there was nothing of note left to discover in that area, with the available data. At least, nothing as significant has been discovered since him, and university physics departments have shrunk.')
