There are lots of characters in Unicode I&#x27;d love to know the history of, but searching for such things is hard, at best.<p>The one I&#x27;ve stumbled across recently are the &quot;Negative Squared Latin Capital Letter&quot; (1F170 - 1F189 [1]).  The 26 letters are there, but &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, and &quot;P&quot; are special.  Blood types and a parking symbol.  Sure, but why?  Why was it decided we needed all of the Latin letters in inverted squares, except those?  Why aren&#x27;t they their own symbol?  I&#x27;m not complaining here, I just want to know the history.<p>I&#x27;d also love to know the history of the other Latin letter ranges.  It feels super odd to me to have, say the &quot;Mathematical Bold Fraktur&quot; range of characters (1D56C - 1D59F [2]).  What&#x27;s the history of including a font in Unicode?  Why did we stop with the few that are in there?<p>This is probably somewhere online, but I can&#x27;t find it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unicode-search.net&#x2F;unicode-namesearch.pl?term=negative+squared" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unicode-search.net&#x2F;unicode-namesearch.pl?term=negati...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unicode-search.net&#x2F;unicode-namesearch.pl?term=mathematical+bold+fraktur" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unicode-search.net&#x2F;unicode-namesearch.pl?term=mathem...</a>')
