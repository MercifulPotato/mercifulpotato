How do you suppose you would transform and capture those vibrations to electrical signals with enough fidelity? I&#x27;m aware of techniques like perhaps laser diode self mixing. How will you do it in a way that cannot be detected even by <i>experts?</i><p>What I&#x27;m getting at is: how do you capture those signals without the use of obvious silicon devices (so no MEMS or opamps or whatever)? I&#x27;d imagine you have to hide it in software somehow. Then how do you acquire that signal? A simple analog input pin to the ADC of a cheap microcontroller is not good enough.')
