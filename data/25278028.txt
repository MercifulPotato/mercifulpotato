Item(by='noelherrick', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606926716, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25275727, text='&gt; TSMC is promising at least 250 million transistors per square millimetre for its 3nm node, the reality may turn out nearer 300 million. [...]<p>&gt; TSMC is already producing [...] its new 5nm node, which is good for 173 million transistors per square millimetre. [...]<p>&gt; Intel 7nm is estimated to deliver around 200 to 250 million transistors per square millimetre. So falls somewhere in between TSMCâ€™s 5nm and 7nm nodes for density.<p>If my math is correct, Intel 7nm could be as good as TSMC 3nm for density - it definitely looks better than 5nm. I also believe this will be the first EUV node for Intel, so that would make sense that it&#x27;s competing more with TSMC&#x27;s EUV powered nodes.')
