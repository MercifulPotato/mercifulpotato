I just gloss over the propaganda crap there, on twitter, facebook, etc. When I want to do politics for real, I do actual fact-based research (as opposed to &quot;my facebook friend watched a youtube video about chemtrails!&quot;). I personally find it easy.<p>Youtube CAN be a time sink, but so can movies, books, and music. It&#x27;s my responsibility to manage my time, but I appreciate that it makes it easy to find content I WANT rather than crap.<p>I grew up dirt poor, homeless twice before I was ten. I make 6 figures now because I work hard, I&#x27;m good at what I do (and also because being a white male in America is very useful), and because I know how to spend and not to spend. Good tea is worth it, grocery store milk and butter are fine. A good car is essential, it should work well and look nice, but I&#x27;m not buying a Mercedes ever. I have an $1,000 TV that I got for $450 because I love to bargain hunt like some people like to actually hunt.<p>I don&#x27;t _generally_ care about remarketing ads, as long as they don&#x27;t go on for months. My biggest problem is when I see ads for three weeks AFTER I BOUGHT THE DAMN THING.<p>So I can go to Duck Duck Go, get Google results, but without the benefit of having a profile to determine what&#x27;s most likely more relevant to me? That doesn&#x27;t sound useful. I LIKE that Google says, &quot;hey, the last three things he searched were actors in the same TV show, I bet when he&#x27;s typing a name it&#x27;s probably related to that same show.&quot; I like that Google knows if I search &quot;stars fell on alabama&quot; the chances I want the lyrics to the Frank Sinatra song are 100%. That&#x27;s beneficial to me.<p>I have a personal domain for vanity reasons, and  also control, yes. If I decide to leave, it&#x27;s on my terms.<p>I applaud you for being in charge of your own life, I think I am too. I will say, however, that I think you probably concern yourself with the concept of privacy than me. I&#x27;m not a big &quot;what if&quot; person, not a big existential question person. To me, privacy was ALWAYS a lot less encompassing than we ever thought, and at the same time, no one cares about us nearly as much as we think they do. Do FAANG know a lot about me? Yep. but I don&#x27;t care, because they don&#x27;t care about me, I don&#x27;t matter to them. I&#x27;m a line in a database, nothing more.<p>My life philosophy is, &quot;The universe wants to kill me. Eventually it will. My priority is prolonging the magic.&quot; That doesn&#x27;t include worrying about how many databases know I like BSG, Sinatra, Mountain Dew, and liberal politics.')
