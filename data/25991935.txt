For example Black people were brought as slaves into South America and into Caribbean region in particular but were they excluded from the society in the same manner? Were Blacks in South America after getting freedom from slavery segregated in the same way as in US?\nIt is not a question of &#x27;special effort&#x27; it is more of the question of why descendants of slaves were not viewed as part of the civilization, why there was such push against integration.<p>There are lots of things about US culture that are rather strange when looking from outside.')
