Most of us have one or two DBs that we work with day-to-day but still want libraries we contribute to be broadly portable across any of the backends the framework they plug into supports.  e.g. I can&#x27;t maintain a test suite vs Oracle when I don&#x27;t license it, but I still want to know that It&#x27;ll Just Work if someone uses it in such combination, or that it&#x27;s at least close enough they&#x27;ll not have trouble making it work.<p>More broadly I think the myth of testing every supported combination leads to a brittle mindset of saying &quot;not supported, won&#x27;t help&quot;, especially when systematised in a commercial environment, and to me it&#x27;s the antithesis of good engineering.')
