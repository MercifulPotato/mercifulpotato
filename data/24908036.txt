All right, now whenever you try to e.g. send a (paper) mail, you have to sign the waiver that yes, you do allow the post office to see and handle your name and your mail address. Not only that, all such waivers seem to be written as &quot;I hereby allow &lt;insert the legal entity&gt; to handle my private data in whatever way they want to&quot;, so we&#x27;re back on square one, just with more perfunctory paperwork required.')
