There was a selfish incentive there too (10s of millions of dollars). Even though they had plenty of money to just pay the fee, they could argue that they were financially benefitting themselves while also helping the entire academic community. I don’t think businesses&#x2F;organizations would ever do something totally altruistically without some inward benefit.<p>I think the math for Epic Games leans more selfishly in their lawsuit than many others, but I don’t think the motivations were entirely selfish either. It’s possible that I’m wrong though.')
