If someone runs a web site with code released under the AGPL, but they have removed the source code download link, <i>they have violated the AGPL, and therefore violated copyright law</i>.  There is no way out for them by offering to send source code after the fact.<p>The copyright holder can choose not to pursue the matter if the web site hosters send the source code, but that has nothing to do with the requirements in the actual AGPL.')
