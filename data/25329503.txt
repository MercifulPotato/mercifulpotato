That&#x27;s not how its composers and practitioners think of it, and critically, it misses out entirely on the whole concept of a raga, which defines not just a set of notes (the way a western scale does), but also their ordering when ascending and descending, and comes with a large amount of cultural attribution (evening ragas, seasonal ragas, emotional ragas and so on). What is played is not an <i>elaboration</i> of a line, but an <i>exploration</i> of the raga.<p>If you were going to draw comparisons to western musical practice, I would think that Schoenberg&#x27;s 12 tone&#x2F;serial experiments have at least as much in common.')
