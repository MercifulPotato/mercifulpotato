This one just released today, and seems like the more interesting one to me. There&#x27;s also a 9-panel project called Rhythm Horizon (used to be called Impulse I think?) that&#x27;s I think going to be sold fully assembled.<p>I&#x27;ve been looking through the plans, yeah it seems like all the parts so far are either 3d printed or can be bought &quot;off the shelf&quot;. Only exception I found so far is seems like you have to solder on a small number of components on a pcb the way they&#x27;ve suggested to order it.<p>I am still working through the sourcing though, so take with a grain of salt.')
