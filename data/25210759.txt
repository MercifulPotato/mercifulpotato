Item(by='zbrozek', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606320920, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25200869, text='I&#x27;d argue against that. I was in the solar industry (as an intern) 2008-2009. The amazing decline of the cost of crystalline silicon shortly thereafter was overwhelmingly the driver of panel cost reductions. The basic recipe of tempered glass, encapsulant, cells, soldered stringing, encapsulant, backsheet for the panels has been mildly optimized but has not seen major revolution in quite some time.<p>The cells themselves also very much are up against physical limits. Last I checked, the theoretical maximum efficiency of a silicon cell in sunlight at the surface of the Earth was something like 29%. The best cells made aren&#x27;t far from that, and the cells you can actually buy and put into panels en masse are 20-24%. We can talk about multijunction III-V cells, but those are exotic and are unlikely to ever become cheap.<p>Given the upper bound of efficiency with commodity materials and construction, the only &quot;squishy&quot; places for further cost reductions are improvements in manufacturing efficiency, installation efficiency, and regulatory overhead. On my own home - where I&#x27;m installing a 14 kilowatt array - the regulatory overhead is close to 30% of the total cost. That&#x27;s large, yes, but even if we snapped our fingers and zeroed it, we&#x27;re still not talking anything close to the gains we&#x27;ve had in the past.<p>I completely agree that further improvements are going to be &quot;a couple percent here and there&quot; but I don&#x27;t think that there&#x27;s a whole lot of total room to cut. We&#x27;re just not going to see another 10x reduction like we&#x27;ve seen a couple of times since PV became a thing.')
