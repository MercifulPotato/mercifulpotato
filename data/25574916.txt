So if nothing happened that would be caught on video, say just verbal bullying or it was in a blind spot, then nothing will be done because there&#x27;s no proof.<p>Now the scenarios I&#x27;ve been talking about are where the bullying has become physical. Most schools that have a zero tolerance policy will punish both people who were involved in the fight&#x2F;pushing&#x2F;etc regardless of who started it, again it&#x27;s mostly due to lack of proof, but the policy expressly forbids any violence. So even if someone punches you first and continues to attack you, the policy means that if you punch back you are in violation too and will be punished. So if you are in a corner and can&#x27;t run away, the policy says you just have to take it without fighting back or get punished for defending yourself.<p>So the same will be for your scenario of running and telling the school. For one, you have to escape that bully and hope you&#x27;re faster than them (before you get trapped&#x2F; tackled and it turns physical) or you both end up being punished. Then you have to have some sort of evidence that shows you were innocent and the bully person was unprovoked. Incidents without proof generally result in no action from the school due to that lack of proof, so the bully will continue tormenting you.')
