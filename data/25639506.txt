It must have been such an emotionally difficult time for everyone involved in piecing back together their processes.<p>I was there as a consultant and didn&#x27;t know anyone there when I went.<p>I won&#x27;t provide any details out of respect for those fine people, but the grief was so thick, you could have cut it with a knife.
