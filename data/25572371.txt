Item(by='Nkuna', descendants=None, kids=[25572931], score=None, time=1609263670, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25572144, text='&gt; there is no &quot;volunteer[ing]&quot; in prison.<p>&gt;&gt; &quot;It&#x27;s a great thing,&quot; Pate tells me. &quot;It beats the alternative. Rather than sitting in your tiny little cell, you get to come out here.&quot;<p>&gt;&gt; They were just thinking about their options in prison, and in that perspective, the farm looked pretty good.<p>You&#x27;re making the point of OP. When the only other option is &quot;sitting in your tiny little cell&quot;, there&#x27;s not much choice in it. It&#x27;s less volunteering, and more escaping a psychologically untenable situation.<p>Given other options, I doubt many inmates would be willing to &#x27;volunteer&#x27; or work for peanuts.')
