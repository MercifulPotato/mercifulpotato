It worked just fine. I know of quite a few other libraries that do the same thing with their own unique approaches, so there are many flavors of this that all work on stable Rust.<p>If you&#x27;re asking for something like this to be built into the standard library... that&#x27;s very unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future.')
