Once the validation is complete via a back&#x2F;forth exchange the clients then know they can encrypt emails to the destination, thereby turning the from field green on the next email exchange.<p>Sure people using those services would also be allowing the service to see their private keys, but for phone apps, or desktop applications the key generation portion could be done on the machine and only the public key pushed to the email providers keyserver.<p>Plenty of other email services (proton mail, symantec) make this very easy for the end user.')
