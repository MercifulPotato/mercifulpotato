HDD would be better for that.<p>But HDD isn&#x27;t your only other option. How important is the data, How often will you need to access it, and will you need to rewrite to the storage medium? You might want to consider Blu Ray. Or both, stored in different locations. Also look into LTO tape drives. LTO 6 drives should be cheaper than 7&#x2F;8 (though still not cheap) and have a capacity around 6TB.')
