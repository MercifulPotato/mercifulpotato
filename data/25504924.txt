Item(by='retsibsi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608633743, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25498879, text='&gt; because there&#x27;s a power dynamic. I can accidentally kill a pedestrian, a pedestrian can&#x27;t accidentally kill me unless they throw a brick off an overpass.<p>I think this point supports the other side of the argument. The pedestrian already has a very strong incentive to be careful: they might die otherwise. Of course most car drivers would be horrified to hit a pedestrian, but most care much <i>less</i> about a stranger&#x27;s safety than their own (and some are complete psychos who won&#x27;t care unless it materially costs them). So placing the main legal burden on the driver will do more to deter risky behaviour than would placing it on the pedestrian.')
