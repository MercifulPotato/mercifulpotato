Do you want to avoid &quot;always on-line&quot;? OK, now you have to worry about Root Certificate management on your box which means you&#x27;d have to come up with a way to renew them or deprecate such hardware at some point. And trust that those certificates can&#x27;t be tampered with by hostile actors (nation states, common crackers, etc) as well.<p><pre><code>  If ransomware starts to change (encrypt and delete) gigabytes of data within minutes, would it not make sense that your operating system pauses the process, shows a popup question and asks you if process X is supposed to be doing what it is currently doing?\n</code></pre>\nHow would the OS know if such process is encrypting? Assume the ransomware uses an in-house encryption interface that doesn&#x27;t depend on the OS&#x27;s native interfaces, for instance.  The deletion can be detected probably through some sort of inotify(7)-alike subsystem, but there&#x27;s always a chance of racing conditions, etc. Hm, one could reverse them or undelete them, but I don&#x27;t see it working across all OSes people care about. I don&#x27;t know.<p>The dialog part may make sense, but how is a clueless user - remember that not all users are as technical as we are - meant to understand any of that? What if the ransomware uses a filename to disguise itself as a legit OS service or similar?')
