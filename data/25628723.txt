I use a piece of software to capture an image of the desktop (and which application is in focus) on all of the computers I use (laptops, workstation, kitchen computer) every few seconds. And I have number of 4K cameras setup in my office -- 12 split between office and server closet -- and two Kinects, and in my workshop, six more cameras, hooked up to a microcomputer that captures an image from each camera at a regular interval and stores it on the server.<p>I haven&#x27;t done anything interesting with the data yet, beyond running basic &quot;is someone in the office and should I capture that&quot; detection.<p>I&#x27;ve got a few years of data captured at this point.
