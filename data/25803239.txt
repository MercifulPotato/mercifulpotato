But, the other answers that say that p is prime iff p is not a unit, and  p | ab implies p | a or p | b, or, alternatively and equivalently, p is prime iff p generates a prime ideal, are really the essential qualities of what makes something prime.  And, even at that, most of the time, one doesn&#x27;t care very much about whether individual <i>elements</i> of a ring are prime, but rather what are the prime ideals.  The set of all prime ideals of a ring is called the spectrum of the ring, and can be used to impose a topology on it called the Zariski topology.  This is useful for turning algebraic questions about a ring into topological questions that can be answered with topological methods.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Prime_ideal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Prime_ideal</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zariski_topology#Spectrum_of_a_ring" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zariski_topology#Spectrum_of_a...</a>')
