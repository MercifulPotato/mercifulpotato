Everyone has to use Slack&#x2F;Teams&#x2F;whatever to interact, so you don&#x27;t feel like everyone in the room is ignoring the remote guy inside the little box on the table.<p>* If you have a home office, it is _way_ more comfortable than anything else you might usually have at a &quot;regular&quot; office. For instance, you get a door you can close instead of open space insanity.<p>* If your kids are still in school (and not sent home because of COVID) you get to pick them up (that&#x27;s my daily outdoor exercise).<p>* You are no longer taking hours (sometimes days) travelling to the office, customers and whatnot.<p>Bad points:<p>* More, shorter meetings that completely destroy focus time. I&#x27;ve taken to block out 2h a day at least where I will simply not take calls or even reply to chats in order to get stuff done.<p>* Longer working hours (which I also completely blame on the pandemic--it&#x27;s become much worse this year).<p>* Your life feels more &quot;crammed in&quot;. Part of it is due to the insane work schedules, but confinement means shopping and chores (like doing the dishes, cooking or laundry) have to be done _somewhen_, often into the night time.<p>* You may be physically around your kids, but most often so busy or exhausted that it takes extra effort to devote the required level of focus and attention you absolutely _have_ to give them in these trying times.<p>On the whole, though, I still don&#x27;t want to go back to an office.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s harder to create new relationships, to learn a new org, etc. But even when things get back to &quot;normal&quot; (if ever), I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to deal with going to an office more than once a week, because the benefits will then far outweigh the downsides (at least for me).')
