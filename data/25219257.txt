(even with trackpad) sometimes the contextual options provide ANYTHING but copy&#x2F;paste.<p>* Apple&#x27;s FileProvider... I like to do something quite common to my computer workflow, work within a Dropbox folder.\nThis works nicely for few minutes, then you get a message complaining access failed and it closes the document (showing you tons of Conflicted copies).<p>So for me at least, even declared usability of iPad for any productivity is subpar to macOS.\n(even with trackpad and keyboard)')
