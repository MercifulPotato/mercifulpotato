Initially we always referred to it in financial terms but what we found was that buyers were using the word franchisee themselves and preferred the term. It makes sense if you look at it from an absentee landlord share-cropping view, except in our case, we provide a fully managed service where you don&#x27;t have to actually do any work.<p>We&#x27;ve set aside 5 PoPs for people that want to be part of a pool in case the $20k price tag is too high for them. We&#x27;ve just started to see some traction on that, so it&#x27;ll be interesting to see where it goes.')
