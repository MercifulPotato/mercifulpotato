Not because a stylus was a good way to use a portable device, and not because capacitive touch screen technology was unknown - it was invented long ago. It’s because of cost. You’re just conflating standardization with cost cutting.<p>If there was a cheap and easy to install OS in that era they’d all use it. Oh wait that was DOS &amp; Windows, that was the whole point, that’s what happened, it was adopted because 999&#x2F;1,000 vendors are interested in cost cutting not innovation.<p>It’s hard to celebrate cost cutters. History never celebrates the crummy cost cutters. I feel no nostalgia for that.')
