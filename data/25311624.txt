Lots of vegans won&#x27;t eat the impossible burger and don&#x27;t consider it vegan because one of the chemicals in it was tested on rats before FDA approval, even though the number of animals harmed is O(1) - i.e., the marginal amount of animals harmed from eating an impossible burger is 0. I&#x27;m vegan and think that view is idiotic but whatever.')
