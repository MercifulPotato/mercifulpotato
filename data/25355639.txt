They would likely not understand the difference between this and any website that puts the &quot;256 bit SSL encryption&quot; blurbs on checkout.<p>We are not a privacy first service per se, but do want to give users full control over their data, so let them opt out of things like a partnership we have where we analyze their driving data to match them with car insurance. Very few users take advantage of these settings.<p>I don&#x27;t say this as a knock on the idea at all, but am sharing my experience of serving consumers outside of the tech scene.
