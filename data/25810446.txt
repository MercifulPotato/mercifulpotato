How is it different from SMTP or other comparable protocols or products? The page tells me it&#x27;s meant to replace email, it binds together features like charts into this smtp replacement (don&#x27;t quite get why one needs to have anything to do with the other), and then tells me where I can download it. The only link to a design spec goes to a Github repo with 1 issue namely &quot;todo: design docs&quot;.<p>What&#x27;s here to see if not that? I&#x27;m not going to spend hours on installing, running and testing software when I don&#x27;t even conceptually know how it works. It&#x27;s like linking a download page for yet another instant messenger, saying it&#x27;ll have certain high level features, but not how the design will be better than the existing messaging services. Why should I install that?<p>I&#x27;d love to read about a concrete design that could fix (some of) email&#x2F;smtp&#x27;s problems and get invested in the idea and run a server of my own etc., in that order, but not spend hours investigating something with a 95% chance of not being better in the first place.')
