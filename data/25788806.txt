It does make the fans come on, which is expected.<p>- Still stutters on certain games, but it wasn&#x27;t purchased for that. Kinda surprising though, I maxed out all the options minus the disk size when I bought it.<p>- The key travel is just right, I think slightly less than the 2015 version but more than my wife&#x27;s 2018. Goldilocks.<p>- The Touch Bar is ok, not something I&#x27;ll miss. I&#x27;ve set it up with BetterTouchTool to have a combination of the open apps and a thing to pull up iTerm2. A minor nuisance is I&#x27;ll be typing something and I slightly touch the bar, and it pulls up another app.<p>- It eats battery. With my old set of MacBooks, you could never tell which power adapter it was connected to, because it didn&#x27;t matter whether it was a slightly lower power. With the 16 it&#x27;s noticeable. If there wasn&#x27;t a virus lockdown I&#x27;d probably struggle to take it out to a caf√© for a day&#x27;s work.<p>- Screen is beautiful as always. They seem to have found a way to reduce the bezel size, because the 2015 and 2020 models look to be pretty much the same size externally. They actually fit nicely one on top of the other when closed.<p>- Larger trackpad is ok, not killer. Maybe it helps some people&#x27;s wrists to not have to move all the way to the middle.<p>Reasons for upgrade:<p>- Less energy use could make the thing properly mobile<p>- Should be a noticeable speed increase<p>- MagSafe makes it feel safer. I have kids, the USB ports seem like they could easily get broken if someone steps on a cable. For now I&#x27;ve got adapters anyway, in order to make use of all my old MagSafe chargers, but it would be nice to have it all the way up to the port.')
