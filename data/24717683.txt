And take a look at the numbers for the year 2000.<p># of deaths Jan-Aug (due to either flu, pneumonia or Covid)<p>2000: 40,436\n2020:  14,013 + 48,168<p>Yes, this is significant and certainly Covid seems to be able to spread across a vulnerable population much more quickly than the flu but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be orders of magnitude deadlier on balance. I get why people thought it was 10-20x in the beginning but it seems as we&#x27;ve learned more it is not the plague we thought it was.<p>Also note the numbers for August have already flipped so that 4x more people are dying of flu and pneumonia now than of Covid.')
