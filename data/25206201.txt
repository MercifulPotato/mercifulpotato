The disappearance of this &quot;surplus&quot; (and if you follow history, you know where such surplus typically went â€“ not the common people) was a blessing for all but the palatial elite.<p>It took over 10 generations for people to forget the horrors of the Bronze Age, with its &quot;economy surplus&quot;, and agree to come together again to form centralized societies. That is no co-incidence. You underestimate human intelligence if you believe &quot;the Sea Peoples came and made a boo boo and everyone had no choice but to go dark for 400 years&quot;.')
