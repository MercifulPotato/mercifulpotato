Indeed, the highest safe rate has fallen in the wake of every recession.<p>To me, this suggests major structural problems in the western economies. It&#x27;s hard to think of a single explanation that applies to all (pre-pandemic) zero-interest rate western economies, however. The economic foundations in Australia, Canada, the UK, the US, and the EU are different enough that there is no obvious single structural fault common to all of them.')
