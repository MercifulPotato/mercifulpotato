This theme is becoming a real trend, and we have currently reached the point where we consider ourselves as decisors rather than simple choosers. But is this real or a perception we crafted through enhanched post-modern world sensibilisation?<p>Apart from the italian article I liked to share with you (I hope you can go through thanks to google translate), a professor of mine, while I was a visiting student at Lund University wrote a very interesting and insightful article on this topic: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ephemerajournal.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;contribution&#x2F;14-1bertilsson.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ephemerajournal.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;cont...</a>. \nHere he analysed the example of IKEA: a brand ambassador of Swedish Values, women equality above all. They fell under huge and murky scandals, such as the one of airbrushed women in the Saudi Arabian catalogue, where the inner reality of Brand beliefs emerged.<p>At the same time popular brands are leveraging on this &quot;façade&quot; by means of a &quot;bluffing&quot; communication, cases to be considered are the one of Nike exploitation of children work and Adidas decentralised, low-pay workforce in Taiwan while promoting sustainability with limited edition sneakers. Here the situation tips over and the customer really feels to be the one that impacts the world with his own choice.<p>In these days something really huge just happened: Twitter and Facebook position on Trump behaviour. Something that is going beyond the simple &quot;façade&quot;.<p>Now I&#x27;d like to know from you what&#x27;s your opinion on that and if you know some virtuous, relevant example on this theme that you&#x27;d like to share.')
