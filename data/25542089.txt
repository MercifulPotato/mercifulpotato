I said I end up with 10-20 upvotes. I also mentioned that these are opinions that HN as a whole finds popular.<p>It&#x27;s the discrepancy between the initial voting within the first few minutes and the later voting that is strange. And it&#x27;s always an initial 2-3 immediate downvotes, followed by dozens of upvotes.<p>That said, any discussion of downvotes or upvotes on HN will draw downvotes. That&#x27;s a given.')
