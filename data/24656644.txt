Sometimes fluff in the port causes the plug to losely attach, making the cable fall off or simply not charging a phone overnight even when apparently connected. A lot of my friends have this issue with their phones, the port is too deep and rounds dirt up from fabric in your pocket. USB-C requires cleaning like no other plug I ever owned.<p>And in general, dust or no dust, it feels like a flimsy plug. Even the shorter micro USB typically snapped vigorously at their ports.<p>I think these physical design flaws are also quite an oversight for something that wants to be the plug-to-end-all-plugs.')
