Item(by='littlestymaar', descendants=None, kids=[25429821, 25429891, 25429779, 25429787], score=None, time=1608036174, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25429182, text='&gt; shameful that a device that is marketed as the gold standard in privacy<p>It&#x27;s being marketed this way, that&#x27;s it. It doesn&#x27;t mean Apple care about privacy, and they prove every once in a while that they don&#x27;t respect anyone&#x27;s privacy at all. They spy on their users as much as anyone else (and overall, they have access to much more information than everybody else except Google).<p>All they want to do is prevent <i>third-party</i> tracking on their devices, so they have a monopoly on their users&#x27; data.<p>But they do collect those data and they share them with third party “partners”. Don&#x27;t trust me, just look at their privacy policy, it&#x27;s explicitly written there: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;privacy&#x2F;en-ww&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;privacy&#x2F;en-ww&#x2F;</a>')
