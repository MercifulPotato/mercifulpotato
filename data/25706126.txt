When countries like China censor, what they do is make companies delete anything they don&#x27;t like. Now it is the company directly who decides to censor which in my opinion is worse.<p>Why worse? Because you don&#x27;t get to elect those who run the company. In a democracy you have the chance to change the government but that can&#x27;t be done with a private company. Now, when you have a few companies that control most of the communication channels and they can censor indiscriminately anyone who they don&#x27;t like, you&#x27;re absolutely doomed.')
