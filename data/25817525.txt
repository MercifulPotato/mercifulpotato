For those, password is the secret part already.<p>If someone phished someone&#x27;s password AND stole one&#x27;s Yubikey - well, this is a very peculiar situation, where, indeed, the scenario fails. If someone steals a laptop with Yubikey plugged in - they (hopefully) don&#x27;t have passwords. Unless someone had set it up to login and open their password manager with just a touch of the said Yubikey, without anything extra. Which is, again, quite a peculiar situation.')
