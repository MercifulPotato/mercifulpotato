Not saying that I am against having loosened restrictions, but maybe we loosened things a tad too much.<p>Because after the summer vacations were over, everyone went back to normal. People returned to offices, children to school. At schools, measures were in place for the first two weeks. Since then, business as usual to a large extent.
