That will make you work like using a MacBook Pro keyboard-trackpad layout but with a fantastic HHKB.<p>This project was designed in Blender. And I am providing all the .blend files and a printable .stl model. Feel free to make any tweaks and remix. To print this project, you will need a 3D printer that can print up to 30.5 cm * 26.5 cm.<p>If you have any problem, you can find me here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;LeaskH&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;LeaskH&#x2F;</a> .<p>This project is not for commercial use.')
