I guess I can see why they did this. allowing players to create arbitrary weapons out of physics props systems could cause a lot of balance problems for an mmo. not everyone is willing to program their own missile guidance system. unfortunate though, one of my favorite parts of space engineers is designing complicated weapons and enjoying the chaos that ensues.')
