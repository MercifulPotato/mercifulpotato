TAO - tailored access operations - is known to intercept physical delivery and re-solder chips onto hardware to get access. It is all a question of &quot;how much do you spent on a specific target&quot;.<p>However every such change could tip the target off: if you replace the certificate and the target knows the key of the cert they expect, that will tip them off. Now a lot of these tools are about mass surveillance and big data: collecting metadata about everyone, not about some well defined target, then run big data analysis on it to discover targets. Like you have one person who is flagged and they talk a lot to this &quot;HackerNews-Server&quot; and so all others who talk to that server get an increase in score and now multiple of those people have a score above a treshhold and get flagged. Can&#x27;t do that if you don&#x27;t spy on everyone.<p>But they can&#x27;t run active intrusion against every civilian ever without exploding costs and high chance of being detected.')
