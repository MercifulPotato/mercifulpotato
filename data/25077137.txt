Gmail&#x27;s filter has too many false positives and false negatives. We shouldn&#x27;t give up on email just because gmail is bad at it.<p>Besides, I feel that gmail and most other webmail providers have created a bad usage pattern for email. Email is much more pleasant when used with an indexing tool (notmuch&#x2F;mu), custom filters (sieve) and a proper spam filter. Custom domain with dedicated account (or alias) for development also improves the situation.')
