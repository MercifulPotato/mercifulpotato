Unfortunately the RISC-V instruction set is crippled performance-wise, by design. It looks like a clone of MIPS, which is a textbook implementation of a clean and well-thought ISA, except that the delay slot and a couple of things have been removed.\nCritical and frequent code fragments are two times longer compared to ARM, needing 2x the CPU clocks to execute, so there goes the high clock frequency...\nFor details, take a look at this:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24958423" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24958423</a>')
