This would allow for code formats without syntax errors (i.e. storing the valid AST in binary as separate, likely structured in binary, from the editor representation).<p>Diffs would then be truly semantic, representing semantic refactorings (e.g. &quot;extract method to function&quot;, &quot;rename symbol&quot;) at the patch level. you could easily then query &quot;when did this variable show up&quot; even post-refactor where the variable moves modules. Sure this has its limits but it&#x27;d push the tooling to levels virtually impossible to automate with text-based code now.<p>A man can dream!')
