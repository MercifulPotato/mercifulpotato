I see a lot of people calling out big tech trying to root their stance in the Constitution, when the Constitution was a chain designed specifically to restrain government -- not individuals.<p>As much as I hate what tech companies are doing in the free speech arena, my position is this: Legally, they can censor whomever they like; as perverse as that is, they&#x27;re in their right. But to them I say, don&#x27;t, and I repeat, don&#x27;t, say you stand for freedom of expression when you have appointed yourself the arbiter of truth.<p>I am a work in progress when it comes to removing my own bias. I&#x27;ve had to confront and remove so much tribalistic, hypocritical bias from my own life; but today, a large segment of our society is pretending to actually have integrity in their analysis of current events.<p>But what do I know. I&#x27;m anti-censorship, so I guess that makes me a Nazi-sympathizing, white supremacist (#immexicanbro), right winger.<p>Edit: the #immexicanbro refers to the fact that I&#x27;m Mexican-American, <i>por si no lo sabias</i>.')
