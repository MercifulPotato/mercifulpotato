Some amount of preprocessing on on the space segment is valuable for certain mission types, but I don&#x27;t know how generalizable it is.<p>By doing all your processing on the space segment you have eliminated the possibility for analysts to take the level zero &#x2F; level one products and reprocess them manually, either for quality assurance purposes or to develop enhanced or entirely new capabilities with the data.<p>The other main problem I have with satellite-as-a-service type approaches is that it requires building generic spacecraft hardware by necessity, which means that you&#x27;ll never be optimized for a particular mission type. When you build a mission from scratch, you get to carefully specify sensor parameters to achieve your remote sensing objective. Not so much when you&#x27;re trying to build a generic bird that does everything. For <i>most</i> applications that benefit from generic data, what&#x27;s the advantage over, say, downloading data from Copernicus (which already has pole to pole coverage at moderate resolution and revisit) or tasking a DigitalGlobe satellite to do the work?<p>I can think of some edge cases where realtime calls might be valuable (eg: dynamic re-tasking based on realtime image analysis, especially if you have a wide-view forward squinted sensor and a higher resolution nadir sensor), but I really don&#x27;t see the broad applicability.<p>It&#x27;s true that communications is definitely a bottleneck in high resolution wide-coverage missions, but there are other intermediate approaches that work before going all the way to doing the entirety of the processing including decisionmaking on the space segment. We have a lot of room to grow in the comms space, such as moving EO missions to Ka-band (and above) and free-space laser for missions without stringent data latency requirements. Sure, it&#x27;s a crowded world if you&#x27;re doing X-band from an isoflux antenna, but there&#x27;s other architectural options to improve throughout. We can also look at doing selective preprocessing on the space segment (ie: up to Level 1 products) which may allow for better data compression.<p>I&#x27;m not saying there isn&#x27;t room for space segment processing and dynamic tasking - I saw a really interesting mission proposal a while back that used it extensively. But I don&#x27;t see the business case for it on generic satellites in all but particularly niche cases.')
