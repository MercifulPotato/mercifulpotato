As such, one can expect most benefit from XSLT which uses lots of literal XML content embedded into XSLT. But that can be had with any general-purpose language having XML literals as well (such as JSX or old E4X). Other than that, XSLT still remains a competent markup processor, and XSLT 1.0 (but no later version) is indeed highly portable.<p>Since DSSSL (precursor of XSLT) is based on Scheme, I&#x27;ve always wondered if some HNers will pick-up OpenJade as its reference implementation.')
