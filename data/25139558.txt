In view of the complexity of these techniques, an accurate and systematic moral judgment is necessary. When they do not involve disproportionate risks for the child and the mother, and are meant to make possible early therapy or even to favour a serene and informed acceptance of the child not yet born, these techniques are morally licit. But since the possibilities of prenatal therapy are today still limited, it not infrequently happens that these techniques are used with a eugenic intention which accepts selective abortion in order to prevent the birth of children affected by various types of anomalies. Such an attitude is shameful and utterly reprehensible, since it presumes to measure the value of a human life only within the parameters of &quot;normality&quot; and physical well-being, thus opening the way to legitimizing infanticide and euthanasia as well. And yet the courage and the serenity with which so many of our brothers and sisters suffering from serious disabilities lead their lives when they are shown acceptance and love bears eloquent witness to what gives authentic value to life, and makes it, even in difficult conditions, something precious for them and for others.\nâ€” John Paul II, Evangelium Vitae, 63<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vatican.va&#x2F;content&#x2F;john-paul-ii&#x2F;en&#x2F;encyclicals&#x2F;documents&#x2F;hf_jp-ii_enc_25031995_evangelium-vitae.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vatican.va&#x2F;content&#x2F;john-paul-ii&#x2F;en&#x2F;encyclicals&#x2F;do...</a>')
