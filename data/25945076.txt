Your body then stores fat in-between your organs as <i>visceral fat</i>, which is the &quot;I don&#x27;t know where to put this&quot; kind of panic. The visceral fat is what&#x27;s really indication of health problems (the &quot;fat fat&quot; people get it too ofc), where subcutaneous fat isn&#x27;t as unhealthy.<p>Fructose intake (making up at least half the sugars in most sugar sweeteners) isn&#x27;t metabolized like glucose, with a delicate and specialized load response and processing. It&#x27;s metabolized like alcohol in the liver and then directly converted to fat, then shoved into the blood stream. Fructose is the reason why you increasingly see non-alcoholics with &quot;alcoholic&quot; fatty liver.<p>Now, when you eat an apple, the fructose content doesn&#x27;t hurt you (unless your digestive system gets issues with it), because it&#x27;s processed slowly, has to be broken out of the fiber matrix and is partially broken down by bacteria. However, blending the same apple, the fructose will overload your system all the same as drinking fructose water. Btw. many &quot;healthy sugars&quot; actually have a worse fru:glu ratio than table sugar, e.g. agave syrup or honey.')
