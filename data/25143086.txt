Explain how they were circumvented, or retract your claims.<p>I feel that there&#x27;s a corollary to Schneier&#x27;s Law [1]. I&#x27;d phrase it as &quot;Any person can think they can break a security system that they don&#x27;t understand, or don&#x27;t want to understand.&quot;<p>[1] “Any person can invent a security system so clever that she or he can&#x27;t think of how to break it.”')
