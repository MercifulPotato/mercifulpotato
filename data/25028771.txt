How does mass spying help in cases like the Vienna attack? If the authorities had done their work as I would expect as citizen and tax payer (the government already admitted massive failures, basically they clearly failed to act on existing intelligence) this would not have happened.<p>I also think this could spawn lots of Signal-like, self hostable chat-server solutions that will be much harder to spy on.
