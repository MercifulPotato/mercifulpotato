The reasons are somewhat technical but mostly center around psychology.<p>From a technical perspective not many laptops come close to my desktop&#x27;s performance and if they did they&#x27;d cost way more.<p>But the psychological benefit of having a desktop to do my work on is when I get home I don&#x27;t continue working. I lock my ability to do most of my job (DevOps) to my desktop at my private office away from the home. That means when I get home I can do basic tasks on my 2020 MBP but for security reasons there&#x27;s a lot I can&#x27;t do.<p>Maybe this is something to consider when making your choice? Let me know how you get on.')
