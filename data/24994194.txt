My critique is primarily of your rhetoric.  You requested a citation without offering a rebuttal.  Yet, you you made a claim that appears to be equally well-founded, or as you&#x27;re implying, un-founded.<p>Saying &quot;citation needed&quot; is a somewhat bland, passive-aggressive statement that itself lacks content.  I&#x27;d have (and still would) appreciate reading the rationale for your skepticism.')
