You are intentionally trying to not see the details because it&#x27;s in the details that it matters. Walking into a train or an office with a speedo on will not make you an outcast in your circles. Not wearing a hijab in certain Muslim cultures will, specifically your family. It will lead to tension and conflicts and shunning. It is not free of consequences in a much stronger way than walking into a train with just a speedo on in western cultures and you KNOW it.')
