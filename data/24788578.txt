My post above gave a reason why some would criticize nativist anti-immigration attitudes in Europe while being concerned with the Uighursâ€™ situation, but I have not presented my own opinions on the morality of either Europe nor Xinjiang in this thread.<p>&gt; for Europe I think you&#x27;re fundamentally mistaken.<p>The sociolinguistics of second- and third-generation language shift in Europe are well documented in innumerable studies. In cases where people think that immigrants in their country are failing to assimilate linguistically, their perception is skewed due to first-generation immigrants (whether the first to arrive, or those who come later on family-reunification grounds) or that portion of second-generation immigrants who maintains active use of the language. However, anecdotes from laypeople are not data.')
