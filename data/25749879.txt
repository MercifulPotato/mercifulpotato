They were not unionized. They were protected by the same law that protects unionized workers when striking. When Google retaliated against four of those 20,000+ people, the NLRB launched a federal investigation, the same way the NLRB would if they had been unionized.<p>&gt; Unless you&#x27;re striking against a specific unfair labor practice, your employer has the right to simply replace you, and reinstate you only when a new job opening is available.<p>That&#x27;s not quite true. If it happened exactly as you describe, that would be a pretty clear-cut wrongful termination lawsuit, and the NLRB would come down pretty hard on the employer.')
