Is this the definition of hypocrisy?<p>In what way? It&#x27;s not like Norway is responsible for the worlds dependence on oil, or that they&#x27;ve ever claimed that they&#x27;re saving the world. They haven&#x27;t said that others should stop using oil&#x2F;gasoline right now either. They&#x27;re just trying their best to help develop alternatives.<p>If you have oil, what&#x27;s the third alternative? Should Norway just not have extracted any of its oil ever? Is that realistic to expect? Would it even have helped in any way, or would it just be offset by increased production in the middle east?<p>It&#x27;s a huge discussion around this in Norway btw. The green party wants to cut all oil production by 2035. Obviously it&#x27;s not very popular, although the green party has been growing quite well recently. The main argument against it is that cutting oil&#x2F;gas production will easily be offset by other nations, most of which have worse CO2&#x2F;methane pollution from their oil&#x2F;gas production, and cutting gas to Germany could increase coal usage. It has been a big focus on that in Norway, to the point that Equinor is building a wind power plant to supply oil rigs with cleaner electricity rather than burning gas in inefficient power plants on the oil rigs. Of course, a lot of people are saying that this is green washing. Personally I&#x27;m ambivalent. Cutting production early would send a very strong signal, and could <i>perhaps</i> push other countries to cut oil&#x2F;gas use, but at least building those off-shore wind power plants will help reduce cost of off-shore wind.<p>Norway is not the &quot;good guy&quot; here, but then nobody is. Everyone that has cheap&#x2F;easy access to oil reserves has developed them. Expecting anybody to do otherwise is naive. Everyone in the world is hopelessly dependent on oil. We&#x27;re all product of the circumstances of the 20th century, and all we can do is to try to do the best we can going forward.')
