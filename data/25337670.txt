Item(by='naravara', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607375872, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25333550, text='&gt; There&#x27;s a reason Apple don&#x27;t make Time Capsules any more. Servers are usually commodities, and Apple don&#x27;t make commodities if they can reasonably avoid it (anything they make that&#x27;s even close to a commodity still, at least, can be turned into a fashion accessory, like the aluminum keyboards and stuff).<p>Also, they can sell you a monthly subscription to iCloud storage instead. I&#x27;d rather be in that line of business than selling an overpriced and under-featured NAS. Anyone who cares that much is probably technically savvy enough to prefer a proper NAS anyway.')
