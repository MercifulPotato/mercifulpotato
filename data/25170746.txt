But these abstractions should be flexible enough that they can be adapted for any use.<p>There might be very good reasons that the underlying function is not public (I can think of private methods in OO where end users absolutely should not be calling them). To me, this seems like the public interface is lacking or perhaps too rigid, or maybe not well-understood (either by designer or user).<p>In any case APIs are hard.')
