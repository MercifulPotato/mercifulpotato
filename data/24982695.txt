For example, Universal signs a deal with a UK channel that includes the exclusive right to distribute in the UK. These exclusivity deals are mutually beneficial - Universal has less deal-signing overhead in dealing with fewer distributors overall, besides the additional exclusivity royalties paid to Universal, and the distributor benefits because exclusivity makes their platform more attractive to end-consumers, who are now forced to deal with that distributor in order to watch that film.<p>Meanwhile, a streaming distributor (i.e. Hulu) comes to Universal and shows interest in distributing the film as well. Universal tells Hulu, that it&#x27;ll sign a distribution deal, but this deal must not violate any of the other dozens or hundreds of distribution deals that Universal already signed, so that Universal won&#x27;t violate its preexisting agreements. Streaming distributors need to figure out exactly which films can be distributed exactly where; for many films from many distributors with non-standard agreements in many regions, this is a non-trivial problem to solve.<p>Many distributors - like Hulu - make the business decision not to solve it at all. Hence, region locking.')
