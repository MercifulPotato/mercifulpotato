I know they now have a &quot;family&quot; option, but it is still quite limited.  I would love to be able to use my iPad Pro (with active data sim) for this.  There is no technical reason for me not being able to do this.  I am never going to switch to an iPhone, so it&#x27;s on them.  If they want to expand their market, this is an easy one for them.')
