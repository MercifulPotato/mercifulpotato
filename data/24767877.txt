I can&#x27;t stand the constant mind numbing noise. I can&#x27;t stand the traffic, the lack of parking, and the public transit necessary to deal with it but which stops running early and poorly connects significant parts of the city.<p>But I don&#x27;t see a reason to argue it with you: Different people have different preferences and I don&#x27;t doubt that SF is great in all kinds of ways that matter to you.  For me not living in SF was a trivial decision that had nothing to do with real-estate prices, and so it&#x27;s easy to me to imagine how things are for people who decided otherwise but with the pandemic are finding that the trade-off they made doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>My point was only that there were are many people who find it generally awful and only counterbalanced by factors that, at least temporarily, now don&#x27;t apply.<p>&gt;  Show me a place with affordable real estate and I&#x27;ll show you a place that not many people want to move to.<p>That is a misrepresentation of the economics. Prices can shoot to the sky based on relatively modest differences between supply and demand.  Some places have affordable real-estate because they&#x27;re a lot less attractive, but others have more affordable real-estate because they&#x27;re only slightly less attractive or because they have slightly less constrained supply, which can just be a product of geography or differences in public policy.')
