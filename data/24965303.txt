Apart from the work for writing this up it is already hard enough to follow the amount of publications coming out in most fields at the moment. Non result publications would just not be read and would make finding the right literature so much more difficult.<p>What is really needed is publication of the data. The big problem with that is that there are no good systems for data publication that don&#x27;t require significant extra work. Ideally the data would be made available directly from some electronic labbook system, with the relevant metadata attached to it. At the moment all systems are miles away from that (even if we don&#x27;t consider how bad record keeping is in many research labs).<p>If funding agencies would really want to do something about open data they would significantly invest into a good data system and make data entry mandatory and in particular not just at the end, but during the study (private, but then made available at the selection of the PI or after some time)')
