We&#x27;ve been waiting for someone to make BT headsets that can be real jewelry for semiformal affairs.  We figured someone would make a bluetooth version of Elektra King&#x27;s ear cuff (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;xJbkQs8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ibb.co&#x2F;xJbkQs8</a>), and make an absolute mint.  The market has been slow to catch on.<p>While I&#x27;m sure you have some good design acumen, I&#x27;m with others in making sure that the visible part is an easy-to-integrate standard so you&#x27;re not a blocker on the fashion side.  I&#x27;ll happily pay a premium price for the BT side of it, but you&#x27;re not going to be able to produce enough variety to suit everybody&#x27;s tastes.  If I can have my jeweler create custom fittings, then I can make them whatever I want.')
