We used to have a single streaming platform with an awesome library, a granular review system, and user reviews. You could easily take a quick look to read other users thoughts on a film. Now I have to lookup metacritic &#x2F; reviews myself, and the NF recommendation is based on whether I&#x27;ve said something is &#x27;palatable enough to watch, isn&#x27;t terrible, but I&#x27;d never watch it again&#x27; (thumbs up). I&#x27;ve taken to only thumbs upping stuff that I particularly like to see if that&#x27;s any better. It all seems to be the same from an uninformed end user perspective.<p>I remember they stated the reviews would still be available in some form for export.<p>It&#x27;s no longer the Netflix of old imo.')
