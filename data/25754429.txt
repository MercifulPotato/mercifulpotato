You have the right to say it, but you don&#x27;t have the right to force others to listen, read or see it - nor are publishers or conduits required to broadcast or transmit it.<p>Your online &quot;self&quot; does not exist.  There is no such thing as a right to free speech in an online sense as there is no shared utility that must accept all speech.  Every step of the way is owned by a business - be it your ISP (which is <i>not</i> a utility - at least at the moment), a platform provider, or content publisher, or web infrastructure provider.  All of them can and do have Terms of Use that any user must comply with in order to use their service.  Unless&#x2F;until that changes, any discussion of &quot;right&quot; to free speech online is patently ridiculous.')
