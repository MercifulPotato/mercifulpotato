It&#x27;s like an earlier Google. I tried a few searches that made me rage on Google (dnsmasq, HP&#x2F;Win10 and ACPI, Openwrt and TomatoUSB related) and Yandex actually shows some decent stuff.<p>Like holy hell, Google tried very hard to show trash from the biggest websites like Youtube (of course), Microsoft (fuck their answers forums, honestly), HP (ditto), Reddit (actually useful), the usual. Even Github is lower in the rankings.<p>Bing is slightly better, but not by much. Yandex shows some useful links I haven&#x27;t come across. Very interesting, I need to remember to use it more.')
