For sites that are a good fit for &quot;the regular old web&quot; we are speaking about at least an order of magnitude here.<p>- Oftentimes it is companies&#x2F;products with significant resources that embark on the SPA ordeal. This usually means that they also have several teams demanding product analytics, A&#x2F;B testing and what not, and hence their sites end up loaded with random shit (gtm, analytics, optimizely, facebook pixel and the kitchen-sink).<p>For all these reasons, it takes an extraordinary (i.e: significantly better than average) team, from the developers all the way to management, to deliver on the SPA promise.<p>As a result, most SPAs suck, and hence a lot of people cultivated an aversion to them. It really is that simple.')
