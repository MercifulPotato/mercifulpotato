Notes to self.<p>Alternative experiment to do in computer.<p>Make each sphere with a neuron that learns about space, time (given n cordinates of movement, how many cpu cycles it took to move).<p>Next make each sphere made of optical material that can see outside from within.<p>Wait until the sphere learns a visual model of its surroundings.<p>Now the sphere can predict movement of other spheres in motion. It can focus on a single particular sphere.<p>Let it find a way to communicate and then human snoop in.<p>The sphere learns about itself from other sphere. (A group of spheres atached to them self and mimicing a sea wave)<p>Overall a good candidate to be in here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;imvetri&#x2F;artificial-intelligence&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;Lab.md#group-of-spheres---neural-fluid-i-was-looking-for" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;imvetri&#x2F;artificial-intelligence&#x2F;blob&#x2F;mast...</a>')
