As I get older, I feel myself and others pressuring me more to &quot;know the answer&quot; to things and don&#x27;t believe I have as much room to be wrong as I did when I was younger. When I was learning Swahili in Tanzania in my 20s, I was wrong a <i>lot</i> but I guess I wasn&#x27;t as worried about the consequences.<p>In short, learning a new language can make us look stupid and as we get older, we may feel more afraid of looking stupid :-D')
