It&#x27;s still resulting in surveyors deeming the property unsafe, and it&#x27;s still resulting in the leaseholders (not owners) of those buildings having to pay millions to &#x27;remediate&#x27; it.<p>This coupled with decades of deregulation, poor construction and minimal oversight has resulted in over 5% of the market suffering from the same problems, ACM, Non-ACM, 50 meters tall, or 5 meters tall.<p>And nearly all of it is driven by the banks. The government has only banned ACM cladding, The banks have done the rest.<p>The banks don&#x27;t give a shit that your odds of jump out your window are 50%. The banks just want to make sure the property they&#x27;ve given you a loan against doesn&#x27;t burn down when you die from the fall.')
