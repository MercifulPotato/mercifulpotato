C and C++ are very much aimed at the latter.  By the time you&#x27;re in a situation where you need to mess with a specific version of a library that is included in your host system, something has fundamentally gone wrong at an earlier point.<p>C and C++ don&#x27;t provide an application-level package manager, and I think this is pretty much intentional.  Both languages &quot;want&quot; to build a system, not an application. Case in point: the C standard library is largely specified in POSIX, right next to system tools - not ISO C.')
