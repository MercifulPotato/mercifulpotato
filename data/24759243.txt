Item(by='BeetleB', descendants=None, kids=[24759782], score=None, time=1602535522, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24757301, text='&gt; If you ask someone to itemize the costs of car ownership, they tend to miss or underestimate a few. The big ones are insurance and depreciation. I am confident that my total rideshare costs over the past year are less than just the difference between my city insurance premium and my suburb premium on the same used car, and my record is spotless. The math is surprising.<p>I did this exact analysis on my car some years ago, after 5 years of ownership. I took into account all repairs&#x2F;maintenance, purchase price, depreciation, insurance, gas, city fees and parking (yes, I keep track of all those expenses).<p>It came out to $288.77&#x2F;month.<p>In reality, it was a bit less, given that 2 years later someone wrecked my car and their insurance paid more than it was worth (with no major repairs in those 2 years).<p>I then bought a much, much cheaper used car (about same value as my old one when it was wrecked), so the cost would be significantly less what I show above ($100 out of that $288.77 was just depreciation).<p>Depreciation seems to be the major cost, and my car was fairly used (8 years old when I bought it, but low on miles). Don&#x27;t buy a used car for more than $10K - mine was less and you can still see the amount of depreciation! A lot of people think they&#x27;re beating the game by buying a 2-3 year old used car, but the depreciation will still be really high. Of course, you can get good cars for under $4K, but it may be risky to go long distance in those.<p>Of course, the other trick is to get a reliable car. Pick only models with good histories (buy the Consumer Reports guide as one reference for this), and do a buyer&#x27;s check before buying it. If you go to a used car lot and they don&#x27;t let you do that check, then refuse to buy it.')
