If you view relational-ness as a spectrum its not so simple. I think part of this knee-jerk reaction was because we over advised things like &quot;denomralize everything&quot; which lead to these monstrous schema  diagrams that effected everything in the application  pipeline: query performance, permissions, caching, transaction isolation, realtime capabilities, understandability, schema management nightmares, and more.<p>In fact the world proved through NoSQL that a lot of what hyper-relational models we&#x27;re  providing  us weren&#x27;t required to  run a business. And you could succeed and do things quickly when taking an extreme stance against relations.<p>I think the average app should probably revert to something in the middle. I&#x27;ve been building applications recently with only acyclical hierarchical relationships. Forcing that constraint up-front does tie your hands a bit but it makes EVERYTHING a ton easier once you design your models around it.')
