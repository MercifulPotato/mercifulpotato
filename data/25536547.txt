To me that sounds like an agenda to encourage the use of less privacy conscious operating systems. If the OS can be remotely updated, nothing stops bad actor from updating particular phone with a keylogger to bypass any end to end messenger a target is using and so on. Remote update is a great option if it is initiated from a trusted source.')
