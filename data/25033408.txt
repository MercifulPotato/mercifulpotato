You cannot implement a communist dictatorship within the scope of the current US constitution. The supreme court provides another check as the composition changes slowly.<p>Your charge could be leveled in reverse and better wielded.<p>&gt;People in rural areas tend to think similarly due to a similar environment. What a rural area desires in the nation&#x27;s leader does not necessarily align with city voters. You must see the danger in a few, smallgroups having the majority of the power.<p>&gt;Say 10 states comprising less than 3% of the population decide that a communist leader would be best for the country. How the hell do residents outside the cities stand up against that in any way but force.<p>Note the 10 lowest population states really do comprise less than 3% of the US population.')
