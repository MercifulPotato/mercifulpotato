Item(by='nullc', descendants=None, kids=[25968943], score=None, time=1611960661, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25963369, text='I think you might underestimate how deeply and inexplicably confused people can get.<p>I fielded a question from a friend who was furious that his broker wouldn&#x27;t let him exercise a call yesterday ... a call that he was _short_.  But he understood his position enough to understand exercising the call would be very profitable for him.  Part of the reason that he thought he could excercise it was because there were notices about call exercise (presumably that it was still available for people who were already long the calls).<p>It&#x27;s extremely hard to anticipate all the ways someone might become confused and adding additional material to resolve a potential confusion risks introducing other new and novel confusion. There is a constant trade-off and probably the only universal fix is the ready availability of competent human support, which doesn&#x27;t exactly fit inside the normal &quot;app&quot; business model.<p>I think the goal of an actual &quot;everyman trading platform&quot; is essentially achieved by the sorts of interfaces offered on 401k accounts-- geared around not-more-than-daily trades of highly liquid securities (and if not outright curated, at least focusing  on diverse relatively safe funds).  What RH is doing might be marketed as an everyman trading platform but for many (most?) users it&#x27;s just a casino.')
