Buying a new car in itself is a luxury.<p>Dunno where you live, but here in Poland there&#x27;s over a 3x difference between the cheapest (new) petrol car and cheapest new electric car... And the electric&#x27;s price includes state subsidy. In result, there&#x27;s plenty of people of modest means (pensioners even) who buy new petrol cars - as they intent to own them for 10-20+ years while doing minimal mileage, making the purchase quite economic - while electric cars are basically still exotic toys.')
