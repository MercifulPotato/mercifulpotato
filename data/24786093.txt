You want to split the work and implement each thing where it is most efficient.<p>Things a print spooler should do:<p>- Queue print jobs, be able to watch progress, cancel them.<p>- Manage permissions, maybe implement quota or similar.<p>- Offer desktop integration in print dialogues: N-up, shrink, duplex, and other common postprocessing features. With a print dialogue, a lot of manual labor of creating temporary files and editing them with a particular application is saved.')
