They’re doing it because in 2035 they lose access to the world’s 4th largest economy - California. No manufacturer can take that kind of hit. All manufacturers see the writing on the wall - they need to invest in EVs or perish. In 10 years if it looks like a majority of manufacturers are successfully making the transition, every jurisdiction will enact a rule similar to California’s.
