Saying it&#x27;s caused by  &quot;pressure to succeed,&quot; is kind of dumb. If you want to know why cheating happens, look at the rewards of being seen as a winner vs. likelihood and consequences of being caught, and like cycling, there is an equilibrium change after which it becomes irrational <i>not</i> to cheat to find an edge. People cheat for the same reason they do anything: because it&#x27;s worth it.<p>You can see this in business culture, and even in public life, where once a few compromised competitors succeed, it has a cascading effect on the incentives of the entire game. The culture polarizes, with earnest and talented people  at the bottom or at the edges, with mediocre performing but skilled liars at the top. When finding these unfair advantages happens at the micro level it&#x27;s called cheating, but I think when it takes hold, we call it professionalization.')
