Get the data models right and most other technical debt is a lot easier to pay down. If you keep adding work on top of bad data models, things get more and more out of hand. I&#x27;ll always fix data modelling as soon as the abstraction is found to be incorrect, even though that can cause a delay.<p>But, if you have repeated functions, or two similar react components which could be merged, that&#x27;s a far lower risk to current and future development velocity.')
