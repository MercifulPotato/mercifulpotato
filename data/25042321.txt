I am not angry with Apple. I&#x27;m using them and Google, with their large cash piles as practical proof points.<p>I don&#x27;t blame them for what they&#x27;re doing. Do I wish that people were more responsible, over all, in giving back to the system? Yes, absolutely. But I don&#x27;t feel particularly angry over it. It would be a waste of my energy.<p>&gt; Why not blame the government that in your view is supposed to be funding that?<p>Except I&#x27;m not looking for anyone to blame. It feels like to me, and I might be wrong, that you&#x27;re approaching this from the perspective of someone trying to find fault. That&#x27;s not my goal here.<p>My goal is to point out what works and what doesn&#x27;t. We&#x27;ve found that, historically, the public purse has furthered the long-term goals of humanity.<p>And that private enterprise has helped to mature technologies from the lab and turn them into usable products.<p>It is clear that one cannot function without the other. Sadly, in the US, right now, there&#x27;s a preference to overstate the achievements of the latter over the former.<p>&gt; Why not reduce hundreds of billions US government is spending on, say, healthcare, and instead spend that on fundamental research if it&#x27;s as huge ROI as you believe it is?<p>Once again, this is a false dichotomy, and it feels - again this is subjective - like another way to find blame. First off, healthcare is important too! We can think of this as the Eisenhower Matrix,<p>Healthcare is Urgent &amp; Important. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s absolutely critical for the functioning of a broader free-market economy, as people dying from disease usually don&#x27;t have the cash to spend on apps, new TVs, and nights out.<p>Can the US healthcare system be reformed? Absolutely. Should it be reformed? Yes. Does that mean we should stop doing it? No, of course not. Not only would it be cruel, it would be counter-productive and would send us back the dark ages.<p>Fundamental Research is Not Urgent &amp; Important. There needs to be a balance between it and the rest of the concerns. Where this balance exists is a question that requires further analysis and careful study. It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m qualified to do alone.<p>&gt; that if California did actually tax Apple more, the resulting revenue would fund teacher&#x27;s pensions and some other high speed rail to nowhere, and even less of the Apple&#x27;s pile of cash would get used for research than it is when Apple is buying corporate bonds.<p>[Citation Needed]<p>That being said, the &quot;pensions&quot; that you talk about are just another bond holding entity, exactly like Apple with payouts based on returns.<p>As for the high-speed rail fiasco, yes, that&#x27;s troubling and a significant issue to solve. It&#x27;s one of many issues to solve, but saying that we should underfund our public institutions because we the citizens didn&#x27;t hold them to account doesn&#x27;t make any sense.<p>The answer isn&#x27;t either&#x2F;or. I don&#x27;t understand the split you&#x27;re trying to make here.<p>&gt; The truth is that fundamental research is hard, and spending more money would not necessarily bring better results. The incentive structure of doing science on public dime is already broken as it is, and there&#x27;s no clear way to fix it.<p>Sure there is,<p><pre><code>  - Open access to research + data\n\n  - Reinstatement of Tenure\n\n  - Providing &quot;Carte Blanche&quot; grants for tenured professors\n\n  - Using one of the trillions of proposals on how to reform the grants system\n\n  - Making institutions such as the NIH more independent from Congress\n\n  - Shifting appropriations from a line-item model to a CERN-styled model where organizations like DARPA, the NIH, NSF etc receive a fixed amount per year, indexed to inflation that they can spend however they like to their expert discretion.\n</code></pre>\nWill it be easy? No. But it&#x27;s worth trying.')
