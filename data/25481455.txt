Item(by='KaiserPro', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608413901, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25478079, text='&gt;  For one thing, nobody has battery technology good enough to allow someone to walk around with a headset on for the entire day<p>Facebook&#x27;s project Aria does this now. Apple has a set of glasses in development that are more impressive and actually has screens. Google? fuck knows.<p>&gt; This claim of yours to mm accuracy needed leading to mass surveillance is a figment of an over active imagination<p>This is my professional area of interest. Sadly its your imagination that&#x27;s letting you down. Google and Apple know where you are at all times. As does your phone service provider. An app _can_ steal your location, but that&#x27;s fairly obvious, or not very accurate. This is because your phone&#x27;s location is only accurate when either using GPS, or lots of post processing by your service provider. All of which sucks power.<p>AR _requires_ that location services fit in a budget of &lt;250mw. You can&#x27;t have AR without visual positioning. You can&#x27;t have visual positioning without a database of key points.<p>Once you have a database of keypoints, anybody can geo locate a picture within 5 minutes, automatically. This means that even if the AR glasses app blocks out precise location, its trivial to recover afterwards. This means that any app that runs on these glasses can trivially create it&#x27;s own surveillance network. That is the risk.<p>&gt; Will we have other privacy invading tactics wielded against us by more unethical corporations in the meantime?<p>I&#x27;m specifically talking about AR, and AR only.')
