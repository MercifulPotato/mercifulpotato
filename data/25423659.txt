Because it used a power meter?  Unless a tube is stuck in your mouth for you to breath through, they are all just “predicted VO2Max”, not measured. I don’t know which is more accurate, but I would hesitate to favor one over another without baseline against a real VO2Max test. However, like a weight scale, as long as it is accurate versus itself it is still a useful number.<p>EDIT: though you might not be wrong: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sites.udel.edu&#x2F;coe-engex&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;16&#x2F;how-accurate-is-your-garmins-vo2max-estimate&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sites.udel.edu&#x2F;coe-engex&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;16&#x2F;how-accurate-is-...</a>. Summary: Garmin&#x27;s algorithm from Firstbeat is pretty darned accurate.')
