It was a bit too rigid for me - that sort of system is designed for a computer, except I was the computer doing the task.<p>What works for me now is writing my most important TODOs on a whiteboard and not erasing it until I complete it. The limited space forces me to prioritize. It&#x27;s also obvious which items have been there the longest, either indicating lower priority or mental blockages. It helps that the ink is harder to erase the longer it sits there too :)')
