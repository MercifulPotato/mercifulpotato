Are Tender Offers usually closer to preferred or common pricing? Does it just depend on the company and that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s so few resources?<p>Also, I see liquidation preferences mentioned very very briefly, but in my opinion it&#x27;s insanely important for prospective employees to get a sense of the cap table.<p>Also, if you&#x27;re joining very early and a sought after talent, negotiating a longer post termination exercise window is doable, rather than the typical 90 days.')
