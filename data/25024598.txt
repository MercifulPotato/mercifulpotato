The NSA does stacks double for the secure version of the mobile phone that they give to high level diplomats and POTUS and there are cases like during Cloud Bleed where the only sites that were fully secure turned out to be the ones that used client side encryption in addition to HTTPS. I&#x27;m not saying that this would <i>necessarily</i> be more secure, just that is tends to be more secure based on all of the research I&#x27;ve done and personal experience on projects as well as conversations with people that actually break encryption for a living. The devil is in the details, though, and it also depends on the nature of your adversary.')
