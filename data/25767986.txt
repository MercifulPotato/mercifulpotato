The state of documentation in erlang <i>libraries</i>, though, is frankly atrocious.  Even libraries that had their genesis in elixir (like telemetry) are basically unbearable to read.  I wish at least there were a reasonable way to get erlang libraries to have their docs laid out exactly like the erlang docs.')
