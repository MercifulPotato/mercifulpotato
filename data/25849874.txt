Their official purpose was something something search something social media. Not in the US, but he was featured on our local version of Shark Tank at some point.<p>During interview it became clear that their &quot;product&quot; was actually bundled malware that replaced google&#x27;s and other ads in the browser. Evidently hot founder guy was using this startup as cash cow for his other ventures.<p>There was some noise in the press about it a couple years later and founder guy defended himself saying he sold the company and wasn&#x27;t responsible, except it was already malware when I interviewed and he was still owner so I know it&#x27;s bullshit.')
