Having the answer for &quot;how to do Y&quot; under the correct label would be useless to these people because they&#x27;d never know they needed to do Y.<p>If you really do need to do X, then explain why clearly in your question and you&#x27;ll likely get an answer for it. And of course SO allows multiple answers, so we can have both the technically correct and the not technically correct but still useful answers.')
