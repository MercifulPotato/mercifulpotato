Parler was literally hyping up about killing multiple politicians ( eg. Planting the head of the VP on a tree).<p>Additionally, they got really far, up to the chamber where they hid. If they would have breached that chamber, the coup could have succeeded ( eg. No Pelosi&#x2F;Pence&#x2F;Biden&#x2F;..)<p>I severely underestimated the talks on Parler until I saw the evidence and Amazon banned them.<p>As a reference, the coup on 06&#x2F;01 is very similar to this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Beer_Hall_Putsch" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Beer_Hall_Putsch</a><p>Also, the 50 lawsuits without any sufficient evidence to throw out legitimate votes and trying to win by in person peer pressure doesn&#x27;t belong in any western democracy.<p>This was a coup.\nA failed coup is still a coup.<p>( Belgian )')
