I’m a bronze customer, and I’m definitely not going to opt to pay for a 5x price increase, because I don’t need all those extra bells and whistles.<p>Getting funding to pay for something that has free alternatives is already difficult in corporate settings. Having your cheapest (non-free) option be $228 per user per year is a pretty hard sell, especially for those self-hosting Gitlab.<p>Super annoying to have all the bells and whistles they keep adding being used as a justification to jack up the prices when you don’t actually <i>use</i> those bells and whistles.')
