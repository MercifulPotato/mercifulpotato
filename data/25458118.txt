Fresh corn vs canned corn is well studied: the nutrition in canned corn can be higher due to preserving the food at peak-ripeness.<p>Fresh corn loses nutrition the longer it sits around. If you&#x27;re able to grab corn from a farmer&#x27;s market, its really good and nutritious. But if that corn was shipped for miles, sat at the back of a warehouse for a week, then got to the grocery store, and then sat at your house for a few days before eating... well... a lot of that nutrition evaporated away<p>---------<p>Canned corn loses some nutrition into the water as its canned. But you can preserve that nutrition by integrating that water into your meals. Ex: canned corn in chili, just pour the corn AND the water into your meal, and you keep all the vitamins.<p>In either case, the dietary fiber of the vegetable remains in tact even though the canning process. And that&#x27;s the stuff that a lot of people are missing in their diets.')
