The internet needs its own money. Anybody remember coin-operated game arcades? You just put a coin in it and you get entertainment. No having to input your card credentials, no leaks, no banks taking a cut, no recurring scams, no 3 letter agencies watching your every move etc. It&#x27;s not a technology issue, but a regulatory one. If ppl want to solve this, governmnets need to allow people and businesses to send&#x2F;receive a small amount of money per month completely anonymously.')
