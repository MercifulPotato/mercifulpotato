That is a product of the way it is arranged, which is a matter of design, not of necessity. It&#x27;s hard to imagine any particular reason why a function would need to have &quot;java&quot; in its name in order correctly calculate the maximum of two numbers.<p>The crux of the case, then, is the copyrightability of those <i>design decisions</i> about how the API members are arranged. The set of specific functions it performs is, as per <i>Baker</i> not the focus of the argument.<p>To take a hypothetical that cuts much closer to the accounting analogy: imagine if H&amp;R Block came out with tax preparation software with <i>exactly</i> the same capabilities as TurboTax. That would, I believe, be fine, in and of itself, because the functionality itself is not copyrightable. However, if the interface to their tax preparation software were arranged identically to TurboTax&#x27;s, to the extent that a set of automated UI tests written against TurboTax would also work with H&amp;R Block&#x27;s app, then we would likely be looking at a case of copyright violation.')
