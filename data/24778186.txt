Item(by='GuB-42', descendants=None, kids=[24778307], score=None, time=1602691558, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24777115, text='&gt; NSA surveillance program did not prevent a single terrorist attack<p>Because terrorist attacks that were prevented didn&#x27;t happen, there is no way to know. We could only speculate by correlating terrorist attacks and surveillance, but there are so many external variables that it is effectively impossible to prove causation.<p>What the ruling said is that the NSA surveillance program resulted in only one conviction related to terrorism, and that it could have been made without it. i.e. it didn&#x27;t help catch any terrorist, which is a different claim. The end result is the same: the NSA surveillance program is illegal and considered ineffective, but unlike the title claim, it is a fact.')
