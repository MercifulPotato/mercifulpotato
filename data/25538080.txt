Item(by='CraigJPerry', descendants=None, kids=[25538455], score=None, time=1608920775, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25537538, text='This was a good list, just for fun i had a bash at #1 (an excuse to learn as much as anything...):<p>prepend-selection.ps1:<p><pre><code>    $before = Get-Clipboard\n    [void][System.Reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName(&#x27;System.Windows.Forms&#x27;)\n    [System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys]::SendWait(&quot;%({TAB})&quot;)  # when launched, a powershell.exe opens and steals focus, this alt+tab takes focus back to the app that has the text selection\n    [System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys]::SendWait(&quot;^(c)&quot;)  # ctrl+c\n    $after = Get-Clipboard\n    Set-Clipboard -Value ($after + $before)\n</code></pre>\nNow for the impossible bit - perform this action on ctrl+[ keypress... I created a new shortcut on the desktop (in the start menu would also work) with a target of:<p><pre><code>    powershell.exe -executionpolicy bypass -noexit -file prepend-selection.ps1\n</code></pre>\nAnd the &quot;start in&quot; was set to the dir containing prepend-selection.ps1<p>Lastly the &quot;shortcut key&quot; of the shortcut was set to CTRL+SHIFT+[ -- i couldn&#x27;t use CTRL+[<p>... and it works. Open an app like notepad, put something on the clipboard, select some other text then ctrl+shift+[ with notepad still having the focus and... wait far too long but then eventually powershell.exe opens and i have the selected value prepended to my clipboard.<p>0 out of 10. Would not do again, AHK definitely beats powershell for this use case :-)<p>For #2 i know how to do that already - create a Shell.Application com object and then cycle through the window list and set width &#x2F; height &#x2F; top &#x2F; left to suit.<p>For #3 i didn&#x27;t try it but i wonder if there&#x27;s a mechanism where i can insert a function to be called back into window&#x27;s message processing loop. Like how i imagine AHK does it. This is just a thought, i&#x27;d just use AHK before i actually tried this.<p>For #4 this suffers the same issue as #1 with the &quot;define a keypress&quot; limitation but otherwise it&#x27;s just an exec + focus window + send keys (likely with some hacky sleeps in between).')
