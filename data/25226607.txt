So if ground control says, &quot;Fire the thrusters for 174 seconds&quot;, even over undecipherable one-time pad encryption, every nation with any kind of interest in space would <i>see</i> (or otherwise learn about) that particular spacecraft firing its thrusters for 174 seconds at a particular time. That&#x27;s true even with military payloads where they try to keep things secret; with scientific missions, trajectories are openly shared anyway.')
