Unless those people who spent $6k on a bike &#x27;need&#x27; the money they&#x27;ll be looking for a premium price.<p>Once the market stabilizes the bike manufacturers and dealers will go back to offering generous trade-in and &#x27;last years model&#x27; discounts and those impulse bikes will have to drop a lot off their original price to look like a bargain.\nI suspect it will look a lot like the US used car market where a new car is cheaper than the same thing with 20k miles - by the time you account for manufacturer promotional discounts and dealer haggling.<p>Also I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d want to roll the dice on any used carbon frameset or wheels.  Are modern carbon frames less brittle than I am led to believe?')
