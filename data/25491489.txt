That was lost entirely after gnome 2.\nI mean that&#x27;s a &quot;minor&quot; thing but as a developer that cost me wanting to do any further development, which I&#x27;d been working on getting into.    And then there was needing to run master versions of everything and not distribution versions, which made things amazingly disruptive to work on a computer that also had to do other tasks (eg : job work).\nThis has since gotten reachable if you have really giant hard drives, but that&#x27;s budget too...\nanyway the walls were so high then I walked away, and nothing has suggested  they&#x27;ve gotten any easier or any more worth climbing.<p>Rule 1 for any UI design team is don&#x27;t copy Apple.  (or if you do, justify it.   &quot;because Apple&quot; isn&#x27;t good enough.  Even Apple isn&#x27;t sticking to this).')
