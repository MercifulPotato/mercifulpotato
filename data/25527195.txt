To me, something that is not flaky never errors for no reason. Something that is flaky errors infrequently and not obviously why. Something that is broken errors a lot. So, to me, flakiness is stochastic variation in a recurring process &#x2F;with&#x2F; some ambiguity about the sources of variation. Flakiness make sense to me as a term for describing variation in relation to cause. That&#x27;s different than just variance - or maybe flakiness is just variance? I am wondering what the FB framework looks like from a statistical process control POV.')
