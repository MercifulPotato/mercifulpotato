Item(by='zzo38computer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604004090, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24934569, text='I do have a NNTP server set up, and I use some Usenet newsgroups too. I recommend using this. Note that this does not preclude the possibility to have a web interface too, although they should contain text (visible in any browser, including Lynx) which specifies the NNTP service, so that you may use that if you prefer to do.<p>Someone else also mentioned private blogs that are exposed both as NNTP and as HTTP(S)&#x2F;HTML, and this would also be good; if you are doing a blog, you could reject articles without a References header (which must reference a blog post) unless you wrote them by yourself (the articles without a References header are the blog posts, while those with a References header are the comments).<p>A subset of Markdown (without HTML, and maybe a few other things also removed) could be used if wanted, as long as it has a MIME type defined (so that you can identify NNTP articles which use it vs those which don&#x27;t), and is perfectly readable without a Markdown parser.<p>I thought of making up a URI scheme for referencing Usenet&#x2F;Unusenet articles. They mandatorily include the message ID, and optionally include server name, timestamp, newsgroup name(s), and&#x2F;or hash. (This is better than using Google URLs.)<p>I would also suggest perhaps even with the Hacker News, to add a NNTP interface (or an extension to a NNTP client; at least for my &quot;bystand&quot; NNTP client software, protocol extensions are implemented as programs that communicate NNTP on stdin&#x2F;stdout, and possibly those writing other NNTP clients might want to implement it too).')
