It was an internal Wiki page at Google written when I was an SRE.  After I wrote the original page, someone put up an internal shortlink at &quot;go&#x2F;nohello&quot;.  After I left Google, someone took the Wiki page content and [illegally, since it was Google confidential, simply from being on the internal Wiki], and put it up on the net at &quot;nohello.com&quot;.  The linked article at nohello.net is a paraphrase of the nohello.com content; compare the list of salutations (especially &quot;yt?) and the paragraphs at the end mentioning &quot;asynchronous communication&quot;.\n(&quot;yt?&quot; was a favorite of Raymond B---., who was in many ways my mentor at Google and who I&#x27;m forever grateful to.)')
