Imagine a targeted attack having both an &quot;average color&quot; of the rendered password, produced by known background and foreground colors and a known typeface and also having a strong cryptographic hash of the password, where the hash takes for example ~0.1s to calculate.<p>The attacker then before trying to hash a candidate password they can first calculate the average color of it to check if it even remotely matches, which can be much faster than the hash function.<p>Average color could be a rough predictor of password length too, depending on circumstances.')
