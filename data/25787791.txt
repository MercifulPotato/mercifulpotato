Unfortunately, and maybe it is my loss, but any link (on any topic) using wordings such as &quot;Greatest&quot; and &quot;of all time&quot; I always cautiously read comments first before clicking. I already <i>feel</i> the headline cannot be true based on so many other experiences - Awesome lists are another.<p>Would it fuel more interest if simply <i>Greatest</i> was italicized thus emphasizing the method over the list?')
