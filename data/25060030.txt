Refactoring 10K lines of Python in a sweeping fashion is much harder than 100<p>* How many of those 1000 lines of Java are boilerplate, and could be generated&#x2F;hinted at by IDE&#x27;s?<p>* The more you&#x27;re abstracted away from what&#x27;s actually going on (types, memory, etc), the harder it is to optimize for performance, or even let it become part of your initial design&#x2F;thought process.

If it takes longer to write error-free code, then the line count comparisons aren&#x27;t always that meaningful')
