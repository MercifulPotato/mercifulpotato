Plans are just plans. Lots of them are stupid. Planning officers often make strategic plans as simple exercises in considering all factors. You can be assured that Soviet invasion of the US mainland was hardly one of the more farfetched ones, <i>as such things go</i>, though the conditions never came close to presenting themselves.<p>Nuclear weapons make <i>most</i> military plans &quot;fanciful to the point of being stupid&quot;.  We&#x27;ve been in a state of unavoidable mutually assured destruction since the late 1960&#x27;s. This hasn&#x27;t stopped weapons development. Being able to move large amounts of soldiers and weaponry around at high speed is a generally useful thing.')
