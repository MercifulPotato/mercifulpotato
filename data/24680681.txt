But at what cost?<p>&quot;Cloud native&quot; is a buzzword without a meaning. Any modern service, library, or framework understands that it&#x27;s most likely going to be executed in a Cloud virtualized environment. After that, the differences are negligible.<p>The real power of the cloud isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s &quot;someone else&#x27;s computers&quot;, it&#x27;s the rich diverse ecosystem of different services that INTERPLAY with one another in &quot;<i>&lt;provider&gt;</i>-native&quot; ways.<p>Whether it&#x27;s AWS, or Azure, or Google. Pick one, and invest your platform into it.<p>The CNCF landscape may offer you the ability to migrate between a provider easier, but whatever discounts you might realize on raw virtual instance cost per hour will be MINISCULE compared to the A) additional overhead of building cross-cloud, and B) the opportunity cost you will leave on the table of not being able to utilize specialized services from these providers that solve immediately problems you&#x27;ll need to instead reimplement yourself.<p>Lastly, and now we&#x27;re getting into personal feelings territory instead of raw facts of &quot;total cost of ownership&quot;, the whole CNCF leaves a rotten taste in my mouth by pretending to be an impartial agenda-free organization (a la Apache) when in reality it&#x27;s origins and real mission are Google&#x27;s attempted play at competing in the cloud wars from 3rd place.<p>There is no debate about this. At the core of everything in CNCF is Kubernetes. And while you <i>can</i> run Kubernetes on any server in the cloud or otherwise, managing it and maintaining Kubernetes infrastructure is a full time job that anyone who tries wants to immediately delegate to a provider. And here comes along Google saying &quot;Well actually, we have a Manged Kubernetes service in GCP, and wouldn&#x27;t you know it, it&#x27;s the best one? I mean you know Kubernetes came froM Google originally right, so it makes sense that we would build the best one.&quot;<p>And everyone nods and goes along with it. What percentage of CNCF platforms are running on GCP? 90%? Higher? And once you embrace one of those Managed Kubernetes services, you&#x27;re just as locked in if you had built on AWS Lambda or Azure Functions, only you&#x27;ve spent way more time and money for <i>ZERO</i> benefit to your actual underlying business.')
