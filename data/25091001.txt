Most of the comments are ideological, on the side of capital, and generally incorrect and ignorant of history.<p>As someone who actually grew up in a real communist country (East Germany), I can tell you you’re on the wrong here.<p>I know the feeling first hand when you went into a store and wanted to buy something as ubiquitous as an electric drill and they had none, no matter which store you tried.<p>And that was the result of a centralized economy because in West Germany, they never had that problem. The free market always balanced out supply and demand through the pricing mechanism.<p>Leading economists in East Germany 1989 admitted in the so-called Schürer-Papier that it was the centralized socialist market that was driving factor of running the country and its economy to the ground.<p>The USSR despite being so huge copycat a lot of designs from the West simply because the centralized market hardly allowed for any innovation on their own.<p>Computers, cars, planes and much more were imported from the West or stolen and then copied.')
