I am not.&quot;<p>The default docker python image is 885MB. python:buster-slim is 114MB which is much more reasonable. Even if you&#x27;re not &quot;cramming resources&quot;, pushing 885MB vs 115MB vs 20MB across the wire does add up over time.<p>In my case, we do quickly iterate and pull docker images so it does make a difference for my colleagues if the image is 30MB vs 500MB. Even if we&#x27;re all on gigabit internet.<p>&quot;Cargo culting&quot; implies doing it without knowing why we&#x27;re doing it. The benefits of reducing the size of docker images is apparent to everyone, although there are diminishing returns. With dive[0] it is very easy to figure out where the waste is.<p>&quot;The reality is that my projects and many others are really, really over-provisioned. Looking at my graphs right now, I am on the front page of HN and my server load is still only 20%. &quot;<p>Optimizing docker images has nothing to do with being over-provisioned.<p>I will concede that it&#x27;s very different as a solo developer vs even a small team.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wagoodman&#x2F;dive" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wagoodman&#x2F;dive</a>')
