The monopoly of newspapers put a price on information and by that rate-limited lazy bits. Now spreading (mis)information is free. The short&#x2F;simplistic message wins over complexity every time.<p>Additionally there is a fundamental difference in fitness for left and right discourse to this new ecosystem. There is a reason right wing terrorism isn&#x27;t needed to be as centrally organized, as historical left wing terrorism has been. If you find spontaneous unity in atrocity your political movement has no clear borders; whereas the left is constantly fighting itself over irrelevant intellectual nuances. If the left answers to ceiling-less rightwing populism, this will end in race to the bottom. The right will always one-up the show.<p>I think right wing politics is the better, fitter meme in the current environment and the left hasn&#x27;t found an answer yet, as better arguments isn&#x27;t enough.<p>We will all lose in this. I hope we find a way to shift incentives in social media soon, or this will be the end of civilization.')
