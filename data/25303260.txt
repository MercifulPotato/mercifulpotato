EV&#x27;s use regenerative braking, which results in some people using their physical disc brakes so little that they are barely worn down after many years of vehicle operation.<p>Even my 2009 Honda Civic Hybrid only needs new pads after 3-5 years. It has minimal regenerative braking, but I&#x27;m good at maximizing it without annoying other drivers. I&#x27;d estimate it reduces my need to dump energy in to the physical brakes by at least 40% when coming to stops off the freeway.<p>Now the tire dust, I could understand. If you look through the Tesla subreddit, you see lots of people burning through tires after 20,000 miles, when those tires are warrantied to 40,000 or more. The weight plays a part, but so do operators who do not maintain proper tire pressures (and alignment and balance), and those who floor the accelerator pedal any chance they get. (Heh, I can&#x27;t blame them. Those things are like rollercoasters!)')
