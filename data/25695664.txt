Any scientist should know by now, all forces factor into an equation for whatever outcome. So the phrase &quot;nature versus nurture debate&quot; is annoying to read and I assume it generally confuses the public. Similar to how doctors used to say someone has a chemical imbalance in their brain for the cause of whatever illness the person is suffering from. I feel like until people understand &quot;cause &amp; effect&quot; an ignorance is going to continue existing and that really misleads the general populace towards incorrect assumptions or even magical thinking.')
