Look at measures like wealth inequality, police violence, parental and other forms of leave, infant mortality, child hunger and poverty. The US underperforms Europe on many of these metrics.<p>Also, that the US accepts more immigrants is not an argument for its inherent superiority, especially given how vilified and abused they&#x27;ve been in the past four years. All it means is that there are countries worse than the US, or that better ones have more restrictive immigration policies.')
