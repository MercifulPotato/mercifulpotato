It just so happens that Apple desktop computers are either way underpowered or way expensive. An MBP is basically the sanest way to run macOS. So MBPs tend to become makeshift portable desktops, with external screens, keyboard, mice &#x2F; trackpads, power bricks, and cooling pads.<p>If your work processes are not beholden to Apple software, building (or ordering a customized) desktop is a refreshing gulp of power. You suddenly can afford much more, or spend way less.<p>I&#x27;m writing this from a Linux desktop, and I&#x27;m quite content with it.')
