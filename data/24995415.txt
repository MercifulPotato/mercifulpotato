A guy just picked a central state with cheap warehouse rent, then advertised quick delivery on specialty airplane radio antennas (most planes have several sticking out), composite shrouds&#x2F;covers, etc. and made a killing. He uses Fedex, but same idea of picking the friendliest state for a nation-wide business.) Those items weigh ounces, so shipping costs are on the lowest tier.')
