It took a year for me and my buddy to make this.<p>It is a bit odd time for launching travel-tech products, so we only ask for HN community feedback. Don’t use it to plan your travel now, stay safe at home :)<p>What’s TravelRank and why we made it?\nTravelRank is the travel destination recommender powered by AI and neural network. We made it for frequent travelers like us, productivity geeks, who prefer to make quick and data-informed, deliberate decisions and tired of endless googling. \nI was looking for a similar tool but didn’t manage to find one. So I decided to build one for myself and likeminded travel enthusiasts and asked my buddy Ruslan for help.<p>How we built this (and where the data are coming from).\nThe product is built on MERN stack, AWS ML services (for matching and recommendations), AWS ElastiCache (for Ranks). We use Foursquare API to import the user checkins.<p>The ML model was trained on an anonymized checkins dataset obtained from Foursquare. It contains 33M of checkins, created by 227K users in 415 most popular cities worldwide. On top of that, we calculate the matching score not only by interaction data from these 415 cites in our predictions (similar travel behavior), but also by meta-data similarity from a much larger city dataset (50K+, similar place), provided by 3rd party content API (based on Wikivoyage, Wikipedia, OSM city profile). \nEach of these 50K+ destinations is mapped to the closest airport in the 200km range dataset (0.5M of entries), so we could simultaneously offer the best flight price for each of our recommendations. Which is handy for the price comparison.<p>Give us feedback\nSo give it a try, add your travel history, check if personalized travel recommendations hold value for you along with your travel stats and rank, and let us know, what was your impression. What features were useful and why? What features are missing and why you need it?<p>More about our story and why we made this. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;travelrank&#x2F;why-we-built-the-travel-product-in-the-middle-of-the-pandemic-9e96e0cbcd15" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;travelrank&#x2F;why-we-built-the-travel-produc...</a>')
