Yes, there were one or two glitches - a character walking into the elevator through closed doors, one or two disappearing cars - which can break immersion, I get it, but I have seen such things in a lot of other games at launch. I wonder as a developer myself, why aren&#x27;t these obvious things not fixed by the studios? Is it so that they are just at the bottom of the &quot;todo&quot; pile? There is a LOT in the game just from the point of view of skills, perks, cybermods and whatnot. And the second patch (another ~18GB one) just arrived last night for the EU region. I hope this will be a great game in a few months and attract new players. I did read some articles about &quot;lack of depth&quot; and &quot;wonky AI&quot; and the way these pieces were written did make me feel uncomfortable - I&#x27;ll see how I feel myself before judging the game too harshly.')
