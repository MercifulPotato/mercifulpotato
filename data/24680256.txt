Which, whether or not they can prove that, means they can arrest you, and deplete the money you&#x27;d have used for your defense as bail. And they do so enjoy that trick where &quot;intentional&quot; generally applies to whether you intentionally did a thing that was against the law, even if you didn&#x27;t know that it was against the law.<p>Let&#x27;s also not so easily dismiss as unproblematic a conclusion that you owe five times more money than you actually have in back taxes plus penalties and interest, which someone wouldn&#x27;t have who filed the same tax return as you but didn&#x27;t raise the ire of anyone in power.<p>&gt; Due to the complexity of the tax code, there is a very high bar for criminality.<p>If only all of the complex laws actually worked that way.')
