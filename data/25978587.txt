Here we\nintroduce Nano, a cryptocurrency with a novel block-lattice architecture where each account has its own blockchain, delivering\nnear instantaneous transaction speed and unlimited scalability.\nEach user has their own blockchain, allowing them to update\nit asynchronously to the rest of the network, resulting in fast\ntransactions with minimal overhead. Transactions keep track\nof account balances rather than transaction amounts, allowing\naggressive database pruning without compromising security. To\ndate, the Nano network has processed 4.2 million transactions\nwith an unpruned ledger size of only 1.7GB. Nano’s feeless,\nsplit-second transactions make it the premier cryptocurrency for\nconsumer transactions&quot;')
