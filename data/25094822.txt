This includes anxiety, depression, and things like eating disorders which all parties can agree are probably not associated with increased rates of violence.<p>But if we limit it to diagnoses like bipolar or schizophrenia I&#x27;m sure there are increased risks of violence.<p>My mother (who had schizophrenia) for instance was fine 364 days a year.  But on the 365th she&#x27;d try to claw my grandmother&#x27;s eyes out because she thought she was the devil.  And EMTs and other people who aren&#x27;t being called out to deal with my mother on the 364 days a year she&#x27;s fine.<p>The other issue with those studies is they control for a host of other factors to get the conclusion it&#x27;s not correlated with violent crime.<p>If you just look at a bland, we separate people into two buckets, mentally ill and non mentally ill.  Which bucket commits more violent acts per capita, the mentally ill do.  You have to do a lot of statistical correction before you found that mental illness isn&#x27;t correlated with violence.')
