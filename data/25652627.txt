Apple was not joking about how easy the conversion is [1]. It took me 15 minutes and 1 command to port my extension [2], and I didn&#x27;t even need to install Big Sur!<p>But when the Safari 14 GM release came around, I couldn&#x27;t justify spending $100 per year just to get my extension on Safari. My goal is to test my product ideas. Chrome gives me plenty of installs to do that, and Safari&#x27;s user base is too small on the desktop. Adding Safari also means that I have to manage another release system, deal with all of Apple&#x27;s app store approval quirks, and support customers on a new platform. The added $100 &#x2F; year just adds to the trouble.<p>I still think Safari supporting WebExtensions is a big win for the web platform. When I do scale and when Apple sorts out the new platform quirks, I think I will pay the $100 per year and all the added time and technical costs.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;rayshan&#x2F;status&#x2F;1292270249362956288" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;rayshan&#x2F;status&#x2F;1292270249362956288</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finance.shan.io&#x2F;stock-inspector-discover-new-companies-etfs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finance.shan.io&#x2F;stock-inspector-discover-new-compani...</a>')
