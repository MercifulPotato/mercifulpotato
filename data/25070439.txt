The job market must be really good if they can use this as a metric for pursuing a job opportunity. I was the only person from my country when I joined my current employer. It never even crossed my mind that it could be an issue.<p>There was also a post on HN a few months ago that said asking minorities to attend things like recruiting fairs in order to show the diversity of the employer was unfair.<p>It&#x27;s a chicken and egg situation for employers.')
