Item(by='ManlyBread', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602138225, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24713655, text='The problem with alternative sites like these is that these do not try to be their own thing and instead focus on being an &quot;anti-reddit&quot;. Which - given how political reddit is - already resulted in creating a site that you describe. It&#x27;s called Voat and it&#x27;s dominated with right-wing politics and consipracy theories and it is pretty much unusable for anything else. There&#x27;s not a single community on Voat that is worth suffering through pages of political nonsense. Gab has the exact same issue.<p>The problem is not that reddit doesn&#x27;t allow free speech, the problem is that these sites became the front of war for people who live and breathe real-world politics. That type of content seems to dominate everything else on these websites and turns off people who just want a nice little community to discuss their niche hobby.<p>I believe the next reddit won&#x27;t be a site that advertises itself for allowing free speech; I think it will be one that bans real-world politics and does it&#x27;s best to keep it this way.')
