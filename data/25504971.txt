C++ is the most capable and featurefull language (good) but it is a continuously evolving monstruousity and (for the usecase of C) lacks a sable ABI.<p>The downsides of each result in extensive use of metaprogramming or radically different stacks resulting in very little common ground between different programmers. There is no equivalent to &quot;JavaScript the good parts&quot;. There is no one true way to write something like in Python.\nThis puts a lot of responsability on the programmers instead of putting it on automated tools (compilers, linters, etc.). This is why I favour newer languages like D, Nim and Rust for low level (manual memory management), and something with a garbage collecting VM like Python, Go, C# for higher level.<p>But in the end it doesn&#x27;t matter which is &quot;better&quot;. You will probably use the language used by the platform or stack you want to use. Or the language used by your employer or university teachers.<p>If the question is which one to learn, that is entirely different and it&#x27;s a question about career planning.')
