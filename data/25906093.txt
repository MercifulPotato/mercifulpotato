I&#x27;ve never bothered with studded tires because the number of days when it would really make a difference is not high enough to be worth the bother. The city recently put in some separated lanes on the main roads that they plow and salt (sorry, chain), but the painted bike lanes everywhere else gets slushy and rutted just as described in the video. And cars park in them because the spaces aren&#x27;t cleared. Some of my coworkers think I&#x27;m nuts, but as the video says, most of them speak from no actual experience.')
