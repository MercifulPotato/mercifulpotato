I&#x27;m not trying to be a dick.  I should have replaced &quot;you&quot; with &quot;I&quot; in my response.<p>For those who&#x27;ve found themselves stuck in the rat race, including myself, I think it&#x27;s important to answer the question: Why is wealth and social status a poor value system?<p>My answer is: because wealth and social status are largely outside of my control.<p>Put another way, values are only bad insofar as they are hard to achieve.<p>Ok, then, the question is: What are better values than wealth and social status?<p>In my search for an answer to this question, I read Carol Dweck&#x27;s book &quot;Growth Mindset&quot; where she argues that self-growth, in of itself, is a worthwhile value.<p>At first, I was convinced.  Aha, I just need to value growth.  Then, I will have motivation to engage in all these challenging activities AND I have a value that is entirely within my control (which makes it a good value).  After all, I can grow as a person without fail.<p>Alas, after further reflection and trying to adopt this mindset, I realized that valuing self-growth, for me, was just a way of hiding from my true values: wealth and social status.  That is, no matter how hard I tried to focus on growth as an end in of itself, I was always secretly still chasing after wealth and social status.  Self-growth, for me, was just a way to disguise rat-race values.  Put another way, Dweck&#x27;s school of psychology tries to train you to focus on the means instead of the ends.<p>In order to escape the rat race, I believe you have to truly replace your old values with intrinsic values that are 1) ends in of themselves and 2) within your control.')
