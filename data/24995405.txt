My response was directly to your implication that &quot;committed code to a repo&quot; (or however you want to phrase it) is a protected class like race or sex.<p>&gt; &quot;Oh, you committed code to a repo I consider dubious though nothing proven... hmmm not sure I&#x27;ll hire you&quot;.\n&gt; &quot;Oh, you shop at a store run by a non-white person.... hmmm not sure I&#x27;ll hire you&quot;.\n&gt; &quot;Oh, you follow a religion, but I&#x27;m atheist... hmmm not sure I&#x27;ll hire you&quot;.<p>There are zero laws on the books to stop a company from firing you for committing code to an open source project.<p>Unless you can find me a law that actually says &quot;Companies can&#x27;t terminate employment or otherwise discriminate based on a code repo commit&quot;.<p>There ARE actual laws that say &quot;You can&#x27;t discriminate based on Race&#x2F;Religion&#x2F;Sex&#x2F;ethnicity&#x2F;etc&quot;.<p>Whether or not YTDL is illegal (I doubt it is) is irrelevant to this thread. Just like a company firing you because of a post on facebook or twitter is generally allowed (local laws and state statutes may grant more protections).<p>Please... prove me wrong and provide laws - local or otherwise - and possible a case where someone successfully sued for wrongful discrimination based on code they wrote.')
