Item(by='goto11', descendants=None, kids=[25465649, 25465635], score=None, time=1608284227, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25465258, text='&gt; why couldn&#x27;t there have been a &lt;vcenter&gt; from the beginning?<p>Because HTML is incrementally rendered. The content of &lt;center&gt; can be rendered line by line as data arrives, but a &lt;vcenter&gt; would need the full content to be loaded before it could be rendered, since you need to know the dimensions of the content before you can center it vertically in a container.<p>Vertical centering cannot be supported in the ordinary top-down incremental flow rendering. It requires a more complex layout model like table, flex or grid.')
