I take 2000iu daily, drink a glass of milk almost daily(along with a protein mix, for workouts). Eat Chicken|Beef|Fish daily and run almost 5 days a week in the middle of the day to get maximum sunlight in Southern California. I had a blood test a few weeks ago thinking I was over-doing it on vit. D and guess what, my levels were slightly lower than average(though not deficient).<p>People are not getting enough in general, I would strongly suggest to request a blood test from your Dr. and up your levels via supplements or proper foods&#x2F;sunlight exposure. I think in general humans are meant to be outside alot and being forced indoors has not been a good thing for us as a species.')
