Most dutch payment service providers give you an url back from there api and when you send the user to that url they can select their prefered payment option. So recurring payments with Ideal is just sending 1 additional boolean to the api.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mollie.com&#x2F;en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mollie.com&#x2F;en</a> does this for example. (Disclaimer I worked in the same office as the dutch payments provider Qantani. They sold all their users to Mollie.)<p>I know of some dutch companies that check all the prices and based on the payments option the customer wants they sent the user to a different payments provider to save money on processing fees. I&#x27;m not very familiar with Stripe, I have only set it up on a wordpress website once. but if they do not allow you to do cheap recurring payments then just implement a second provider and switch between them.')
