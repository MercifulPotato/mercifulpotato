In the end you need to implement a lots of parts twice for Windows and macOS due to the differences interaction models.<p>In the case just share the business logic, and write UI separately, works perfectly fine. I have written apps that run on the web, natively on Android, macOS, iOS, and Windows were the only change is the UI layer and data storage (e.g. iCloud on Mac etc)')
