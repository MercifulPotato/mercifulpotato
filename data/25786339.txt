It provides a toolkit for data collection, analysis, and visualization. The aim is to make it easy to build a long-term time series database, share it with collaborators, and actually gain insight from the data you collect.<p>I&#x27;ve been mostly focused on data from experimental electric vehicles, but I am also really interested in hearing your experience building a sensor network. I&#x27;d really love to hear what kinds of challenges you encountered building a distributed sensor system like this, particularly with collecting and sharing the sensor data. If you&#x27;re willing, please reach out to me at the email in my bio!')
