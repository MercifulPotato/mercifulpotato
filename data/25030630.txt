I&#x27;m thinking more about 1-on-1 support rep or sales rep interactions though.  If the rep only has a handful of those per day, I think they would be able to tell.<p>I think a simple &quot;hold feedback from me until increment.me has collected x responses&quot; would address that.  So for example, I&#x27;d get a dump of 5 responses at a time instead of getting them as soon as they are written if I choose x=5.<p>It sounds like this works for getting anonymous feedback from groups of people though, which sounds like a decent addressable market.<p>I have no reason to collect feedback at the moment, but I could see myself paying $4&#x2F;month for this if I ran a small business.')
