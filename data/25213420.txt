Even Firefox doesn&#x27;t update itself on my Linux box.<p>That&#x27;s kind of why I was thinking of Linux as cheating on some level. Windows&#x2F;Mac programs basically <i>can&#x27;t</i> do the same thing, since they don&#x27;t have the same infrastructure.<p>&gt; I just meant to point out that programs using the Internet are probably a fairly considerable majority for most regular users.<p>I would push back a tiny bit on this -- I don&#x27;t think regular users would be surprised by a native program contacting the Internet, but I do think they would be surprised if that rest request failing meant that the program couldn&#x27;t launch.')
