And let’s not pretend the Thiel-sponsored Terry Bollea case was anything but a good ole boy lynch mob.<p>And not that Gawker wasn’t fond of its toilet journalism, but compared to OANN and the rest of the reich-wing hate machine it was a fricking angel. If only the peanut gallery was half as outraged by the disease spreaders and seditionists in its own camp. Did I mention hypocrisy? Yes, I did.<p>As for Apple TV? Pretty sure that’s even less relevant than Gawker, and Gawker’s dead. Hey, at least Gawker went out with a proper good bang, not the slow rot of insipid rent-seeking.')
