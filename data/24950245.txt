Fox News honestly doesn&#x27;t even register as a legitimate news organization for me most of the time.  I actively avoid using them as a source.  It&#x27;s like getting upset over supermarket tabloids.<p>Yet this organization sure had an awful lot of blood on its hands with its recent pandemic coverage and yet all I ever hear about is papers like the New York Times.  Rogan himself seems to have shown a lot of sympathy for Fox News worst tendencies on this matter.  The last time I remember outlets like the NYT having so much blood on their hands was during the Iraq war and that reporting was about a generation ago, AND Fox was even worse than them even back then.  Yet all I hear about is the perils of the dastardly MSM and their legions of partisan so called fact checkers.')
