Note I stated &quot;If the shareholders and board...&quot; in my comment, so that&#x27;s totally a different scenario from the one I mentioned. In my example, everyone knows there&#x27;s a party happening and the majority of shareholders agree with it. So long as everyone knows what&#x27;s happening and the majority agrees with it, they don&#x27;t have to bother trying to make a profit. They don&#x27;t have to bother to make returns. If the shareholders decide buying Maseratis for everyone is what the company wants to do, there&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with that.<p>Corporations don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to maximize shareholder value. Corporate actors need to be beholden to the interests of the shareholders, but that does not mean they need to bother to make a profit. Most publicly traded companies do focus on making a profit, and most people buy shares in companies with the expectation they generate returns. Nothing says this has to be the goal.')
