Business can work without it, as I explained above.<p>And yes, I find platform politics to be disgusting and anti-user in essence. Stadia isn&#x27;t huge as desktop Linux, not even close yet. And potential is all abstract. Linux has also a lot of potential, if these would release games for it. They don&#x27;t care.<p>It&#x27;s not about potential or size of the market, it&#x27;s about being paid extra incentives by the platform owner. I.e. dirty platform politics.')
