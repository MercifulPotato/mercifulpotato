Why not increase the sha512crypt iteration count by orders of magnitude if he want the hashcat test to fair equal or better under the testing methodology in use? Why is he using hashcat and basing decisions solely on that tool? Why is he using shacrypt at all and not a a proper KDF, such as PDKDF2, plugging in SHA2?')
