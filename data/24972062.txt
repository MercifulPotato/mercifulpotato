Item(by='whimsicalism', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604345417, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24971777, text='<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Functional_programming" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Functional_programming</a><p>&gt; Functional programming is sometimes treated as synonymous with purely functional programming, a subset of functional programming which treats all functions as deterministic mathematical functions, or pure functions. When a pure function is called with some given arguments, it will always return the same result, and cannot be affected by any mutable state or other side effects.<p>It is a closely associated idea, but it is not necessarily &quot;core&quot; to what FP is.')
