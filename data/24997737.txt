If I don&#x27;t update this comment with an edit, it means it succeeded in crashing my system.<p>edit: did not crash my OS like advertised. it just opened a file dialog which keeps showing up even if i click cancel. annoying but i wouldn&#x27;t call it a crash. i had to force quit chrome _myself_ though by force closing chrome since idk how to get out of it.')
