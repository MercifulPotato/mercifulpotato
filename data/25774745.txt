Take a hard look when the history actually changed.<p>As long as politicians didn&#x27;t fear for their own precious lives, they didn&#x27;t mind throwing heaps of others&#x27; lives to shift the balance of power by 1%. They weren&#x27;t starting these wars for merely economical value of land or money - it was always about (non-economical) value of power. Since 1945-1949, the stakes are suddenly too high and that&#x27;s why don&#x27;t have major wars anymore.')
