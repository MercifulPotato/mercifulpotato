If you are capable of understanding algorithms of any complexity you should be able to learn how to use git (and how much of it) without treading on ground that is dangerous for you to use. All of this &quot;it&#x27;s too hard&quot; rhetoric is infantilising or coddling people who frankly shouldn&#x27;t be trusted to code anything of importance anyway. There&#x27;s no shame in admitting your own limitations, but there is definitely shame in lowering the bar for others so much you are actively harming the industry.')
