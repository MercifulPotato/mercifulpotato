The goal of Brett&#x27;s arguments is how to teach students to learn programming, not making every programming problem ever visual.<p>Once a person learns how to think about programming problems, they become better at creating their own mental models and visualizations. And maybe someday they&#x27;ll figure out how to create visualizations of these complex things you and I can&#x27;t yet :)')
