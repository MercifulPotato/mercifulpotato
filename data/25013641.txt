On such a community they will bemoan things like a &quot;Do I pass&quot; thread on lets say, Reddit or Tumblr, because they will notice how the fact that the answer is invariably the same is an insult to their intelligence and self-insight as well as being painfully repetitive and pointless.  I&#x27;ve observed that those from &quot;Disadvantaged&quot; groups are more drawn to 4chan rather than less and tend to see the negativity as a sort of filter to keep out users with an ego, who desire a community that gives it to them straight.  4chan for better or worse serves as an anti-thesis and refuge from the reputational internet and sticks around because nobody is offering what it&#x27;s selling.<p>Targeted harassment on 4chan like shunning and ostracism aren&#x27;t even possible if you&#x27;re truly anonymous, only impersonal and vague forms of harassment are possible.  Intersite harassment is possible because your hackernews of the worlds enable targeted harassment through the use of persistent identities, some communities like FaceBook explicitly introduced such identities for the sake of retaliation against the undesirable.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good thing for 4chan to be drawing people into its culture who didn&#x27;t consent, yet the people who enabled targeted harassment are the rest of the internet who gave up on anonymity, and 4chan is merely hacking the system to harass the wrong people.')
