The point is that if you project things about human intelligence i.e. &quot;but humans like ants so why wouldn&#x27;t the reverse be true? &quot;or &quot;most humans don&#x27;t pay attention to ants so why would aliens care?&quot;on to other types of intelligence, you&#x27;re making a big assumption.<p>A superintelligent ant colony with an &quot;of ant&quot; intellect is going to be so alien to our kind of intellect that the goals are just impossible to compare.
