It was the most educational experience I&#x27;ve ever had learning computer architecture. I&#x27;d be lying if I said it wasn&#x27;t a lot of work though and breadboards are fraught with issues.<p>The difference between this and the apple-1 though is that Ben&#x27;s computer is effectively a third gen computer on breadboard, whereas the apple-1 is pure fourth gen. I guess the fair comparison is ben&#x27;s 6502 kit.')
