If 1000 &quot;real&quot; (ie, not bots) accounts were closed every day for the next 80 years, there&#x27;s a 98% chance that I (or any other individual user) would never have a problem.<p>Obviously, if some number of people are having problems that&#x27;s, well, a problem, but as an individual user I mostly assume that it&#x27;s not going to happen to <i>me</i>, much like I largely don&#x27;t think about the 1-in-103 chance that I&#x27;ll die in a car accident.')
