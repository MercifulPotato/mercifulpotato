Half the &quot;open source&quot; projects are mixed license these days. All the useful and interesting bits are paid up extras which involve navigating half assed vendors with sales teams that don&#x27;t even understand their own product line. I&#x27;ve spoken to two major well known players in CNCF and they were a total shit show of incompetence. I&#x27;m not sure if they have a maturity index but I think it probably comes from tarot cards, a crystal ball or the bottom of a tea cup.<p>What happened is we traded one vendor lock in for management of a hundred different vendors all pushing incompatible bits of junk that cost a lot of money to stick together and everyone points fingers at the other vendors. At least when I worked at an MSFT only shop there was only one vendor to fight.<p>I&#x27;m considerably older than you and the definition of &quot;getting too old for our sector&quot; is actually probably the tiresome experience we have. You see the forest not the trees and you realise the forest floor is made of the death of a thousand stupid ideas and mistakes remarketed in a different way.')
