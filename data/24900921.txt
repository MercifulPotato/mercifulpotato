The first time I was acquihired, my compensation actually decreased because they kept my base salary and rewrote the bonus structure such that it was impossible to hit previous payouts. Meanwhile, my prior company received a large payment for the transfer of our team.<p>Ironically, the new company was paying new hires much more. I would have been better off quitting and getting re-hired.<p>It&#x27;s better if the employees can negotiate their own way into a different company or companies. No sense in letting the previous company try to cash in on the team on their way out.')
