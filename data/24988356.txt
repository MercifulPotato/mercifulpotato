Item(by='Torkel', descendants=None, kids=[24990728], score=None, time=1604492546, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24988187, text='I use ImGui for gui in a user-facing app that is &quot;large-ish&quot; (~500k LOC maybe). When removing items from lists etc I used to keep drawing non-removed items in the list so the user would not see a &quot;glitch&quot;. But I realized it is not necessary. Just cut it short. The user can only take one action per frame from mouse click or button press etc. It&#x27;s totally fine to render one frame a bit &quot;strange&quot; when someone deletes or adds to a list.<p>There is no problem in redrawing everything from state every frame. There is no problems in having &quot;half frame be old state&quot; - even at 30 fps it is not noticeable.<p>We use a separate update() and gui() path though. So all entities will get an update opportunity even if the gui is hidden. And state is kept in a config that is beautiful to use... Maybe the issues here comes from not having those parts.')
