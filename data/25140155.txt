You <i>have</i> to use the App Store to distribute mobile apps on iPhones and iPads, and if you want automatic updates, background updates or batch installations&#x2F;upgrades on Android, you <i>have</i> to use the Play Store.<p>These days, if you want to install an app whose developers didn&#x27;t pay the Apple tax, macOS will make the app appear radioactive, and as if it is either broken or malicious. Same goes for Android, where apps distributed outside of the Play Store invoke scary warnings, and are hindered when it comes to automatic updates, background updates, or batch installs.')
