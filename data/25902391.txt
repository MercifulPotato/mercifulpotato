Their connectivity and the possibility to exchange knowledge and experiences is what makes them so much more efficient than humans (at least in those tasks we automated already) - or when used as an interface - so efficient as an information management tool.<p>In order to reach a superintelligence level we need to solve the automation of gathering, evaluation and improvement of knowledge first.<p>And by automation, I don&#x27;t mean wikis or something you can find via google. Wikis and the web currently are built for humans, not machines. If we are able to automate the semantic knowledge behind it and transfer it to neural networks, we will have limitless capabilities.')
