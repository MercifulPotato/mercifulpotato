It is an important aspect of the American identity and our vision of success in this country, and so here we are, innovating around cars with technologies like self-driving rather than looking forwards to new potential paradigms of transportation.<p>This is just in regards to the average commuter, I&#x27;m sure that self-driving does have its place in like, moving 40&#x27; containers in low-density areas.')
