(For example, they once tried to bill me $300,000 for a tax year when my net income was just over $100,000, because of multiple clerical errors -- we had sold a house, and they had both erroneously tried to apply capital gains tax where it didn&#x27;t apply at all, and tried to tax us for the full sale price of the house as though we had bought it for $0 and flipped it. It took months of back and forth to fix the issue, despite everything having been clearly documented.)<p>Second, calculating tax liability is just the first step. Actually submitting tax returns electronically required a third party for a long time, and I believe it still does for all but the most straightforward returns. There&#x27;s absolutely no reason for that to be the case, other than the outsize influence of lobbying money.<p>That&#x27;s without getting into all the loopholes, dodges, and hand-waving that make it possible for someone like Trump to avoid paying taxes entirely most years, while those of us who they know can&#x27;t afford to lawyer up are the ones they try to collect from.')
