I was exposed to the music as a toddler. Totally forgot about it. At least so I thought...<p>I just clicked some audio samples and it all came rushing back, as if it all happened yesterday. I seriously hated those songs. Still do. I remember what I was thinking about it: the music tortiously drags it&#x27;s tempo; individual sounds resemble decay and disintegration. Everything is so slow, as if embedded in tar. Instrment players seem to be just out of hospital and pumping their last breaths into those trumpets. I can almost hear arthritis squeaking in player&#x27;s joints.<p>Those are the exact thoughts I had when I first encountered the music. I could easily be an 8 year old at the time. What a trip down memory lane!<p>of course the tables have turned and, I imagine, I&#x27;m coming off as the same grandpa to the newer generation')
