I&#x27;m trying to imagine what element or group of elements would be hard to do without. The elements related to carbon-based life of course (although hydrogen at least is not realistically scarce)--though I guess life doesn&#x27;t need to be carbon-based. There are the conductive metals--gold, silver, copper--although aluminum at least could fill in in a pinch. Silicon? Although you&#x27;d probably have be lacking semiconductors more broadly.<p>If you restrict the discussion to worlds that are basically human habitable, also any trace elements that humans need. (According to this [1], humans are known to need 25 elements to live so that would be a good place to start.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencelearn.org.nz&#x2F;resources&#x2F;1728-the-essential-elements" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencelearn.org.nz&#x2F;resources&#x2F;1728-the-essential...</a>')
