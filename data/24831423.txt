Velocity is the first derivative of position with respect to time, and it&#x27;s a vector in 3D space (technically 4D). If you change the orientation of that vector (direction change) that is always an acceleration even if the magnitude of the vector doesn&#x27;t change.<p>So when light goes thru a gravitational field it doesn&#x27;t change direction (EVEN though gravitational lensing is happening, from the perspective of an observer). If it did change direction that would be synonymous with an acceleration, and light never accelerates.')
