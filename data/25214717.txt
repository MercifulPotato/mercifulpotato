Breaking them out into separate components brings a level of visibility into the system. And it&#x27;s AWS&#x27;s whole business model.<p>But it does mean that, fundamentally, service X is available when and only when (WAOW?) services A, B, C, etc. are all available. Its uptime is no greater than min(uptime(A), uptime(B), etc)<p>I&#x27;m trying to rework the authentication for our application and integrate it with our parent company&#x27;s systems. As we talk to other teams, I see all these architecture diagrams where the solution to every problem is Yet Another Service, to where you&#x27;re running a real rube goldberg machine.')
