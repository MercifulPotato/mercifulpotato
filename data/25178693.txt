I am a better human because of it; kinder, more useful to society etc.<p>At the risk of judging you, are you sure you are <i>kinder</i>? You just wrote a paragraph about “the typical Indian” in a fairly condescending tone and how you get upset over trivial things like “Indian English” phrases.<p>It’s okay to not like the Indian lifestyle, not everyone has to, even if you are Indian.
