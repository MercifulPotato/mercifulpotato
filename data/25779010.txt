I don&#x27;t know how it didn&#x27;t click that out of all the CNS depressants I know, only the one (Rohypnol) isn&#x27;t found pleasant by people (within some dose range).  Turns out I was wrong.<p>I remembered years ago reading, and recognizing as BS, some policeman&#x27;s story about a bust of GHB dealers, implying there were no recreational uses, and that it must be intended for date-rape.  Yet somehow I still believed some TV scare report in high school that having Rohypnol without a prescription could only mean it was intended for date-rape.<p>On a side note, I did know of recreational chloroform use.  My dad is a retired anesthesiologist, and our family kind of adopted one of his closest work friends, a much older nurse anesthitist, as a surrogate third grandmother.  In the old days, after a long surgical case, she would often drive home pleasantly buzzed from second-hand chloroform inhalation.  In the old days, the nurse anesthetist would sit right over the patient with a stopwatch and an eye dropper full of chloroform, adding a few drops to gauze over the patient&#x27;s mouth every time the patient&#x27;s pulse got a bit fast.')
