Did you still have a cat residing in the house at the same time as the jackdaw stayed with you? If so, I’m curious to know what kind of relationship they might have had.<p>I’ve tried to rescue small birds (sparrows, robins, finches) that my cat has caught – but hasn’t killed – despite having two bells on his collar. I found that they either recovered quickly and were able to fly away after a couple of hours or else they died – more often than not. :(')
