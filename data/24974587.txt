Besides the 40pin header it also uses another 2x2 header behind the magjack, which is where it receives the input from the ethernet jack.<p>Oddly, this board spots a separate ethernet transformer which does support PoE, but there&#x27;s no circuity to tap that, and nowhere to add it.  Which begs for a modification, but seems like missed opportunity.')
