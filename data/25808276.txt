There are some pretty clear and correct ways to setup a secure server these days.<p>Using an OS such a RHEL gives some guarantees about auditing for vulns being done already for you. You don&#x27;t have to take on the responsibility for analyzing everything yourself. CentOS historically gives some of the same benefits.<p>What do you think Amazon uses internally for Amazon.com? They use a variant of RHEL. ( albeit a really old &quot;jankified&quot; version )<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting you run the server over home networking. ( which is against TOS by the way ) You can own your own server and place it in a good Colo facility who are already handling the power, routing, etc.<p>I previously wrote the management software for a major company that handles configuration and setup of all their data centers. I know a thing or two about what is necessary.<p>Redundant power and networking with monitoring of both is essential, and also common and easily available in a decent colo. You can of course use a bottom dollar colo that just throws some shit together, but you will, as you say, risk there being vulns in the stack outside your server.<p>That said, it isn&#x27;t hard either to setup your own data center from nothing. You need multi-phase power, redundancy, and a number of components that are somewhat costly for an individual, but there are reasonably affordable options these days. You can get 220 in the home if you pay for it. I&#x27;d recommend having a commercial location pre-setup with it though of course. Preferably you&#x27;d want your data center near a major internet hub and&#x2F;or with connections to multiple major internet providers...<p>And yes. I have guards from someone walking away with my equipment. I have a gun and I&#x27;m happy to shoot any intruder in the face with it. All my drives are encrypted as well and if there was a breakin they will auto-shutdown...<p>I own enterprise level tape backup equipment and hundreds of tapes. So yes: offsite backup that is encrypted. The keys are backed up and encrypted themselves.<p>You can go down the rabbit hole as far as you like. My setup is still more secure than Amazon and the like.')
