If you crank it up to 4Ghz it&#x27;s going to be as &quot;bad&quot; or even worse than a Ryzen CPU in terms of power consumption per core. There is no free lunch. Mobile chips simply run at a lower frequency and ARM SoCs usually have heterogenous cores.<p>&gt;but this is an architecture that the PC market needs to be scared of.<p>This just means you know nothing about processor performance or benchmarks. If it was that easy to increase performance by a factor of 3x why hasn&#x27;t AMD done so? Why did they only manage a 20% increase in IPC instead of your predicted 200%?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.anandtech.com&#x2F;doci&#x2F;14892&#x2F;a12-fvcurve_575px.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.anandtech.com&#x2F;doci&#x2F;14892&#x2F;a12-fvcurve_575px.pn...</a>')
