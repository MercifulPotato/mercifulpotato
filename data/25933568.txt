It is taking naturally forested land that is at risk of <i>deforestation</i> that would ostensibly then be used for a monoculture wood farming industry.<p>If this land was used for timber, it would reduce biodiversity in Georgia.  That would unquestionably be a bad outcome for the environment.  Deforestation and a reduction in biodiversity is a major problem the world faces, and it impacts much more than just the trees and plants - much of wildlife like animals, insects, and fish are losing their natural habitat and being driven extinct as a result of this practice.<p>You can hype up timber forestry tactics all you want, but what Ikea has done is a good thing for the world, no matter how disingenuous they might be due to their products consuming large amounts of timber for furniture.')
