What this says to me is that there is a lack of proper controls to ensure that the number of people signed in == the number of votes reported by a given precinct.<p>I&#x27;ve seen some videos emerge on social media with recount footage, it&#x27;s totally uncontrolled to say the least.  I find it hard to believe that most jurisdictions are providing an accurate count, the controls simply aren&#x27;t in place.')
