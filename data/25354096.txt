They submit to pandora or Spotify or wherever and it never makes it into the algorithms. It&#x27;s up to them to do all their own marketing. We&#x27;re influenced by survivorship bias and it&#x27;s easy to say &quot;they should just tour and play out and submit to music blogs!&quot; and it&#x27;s difficult to communicate just how hard it is to find <i>any</i> traction at all.')
