They are the only group for the last two decades, besides Blue Origin, that is trying to advance the technology of heavy lift rockets past what we had with the Saturn V. Just imagine what $30&#x2F;kg to orbit instead of $10000&#x2F;kg will open up. They have are half way there with booster recovery and now just need the size of StarShip and the recoverable second stage.<p>If a company is creating revolutionary technology, why is it an awful company? Under what metrics are you judging it by? Lots of people get &quot;burned out&quot; working at SpaceX, but others also thrive in the environment.')
