Welfare in some parts of the US may be minimal; for example, food stamps may be available but not enough to feed yourself every meal. Further, housing assistance may be non-existent or virtually so in the sense that many are homeless while waiting extended periods of time before they can utilize it, don’t qualify because their income is too low (it’s true, but how does that make sense?), or such housing is temporary.<p>Also, some of the “right” interpretations are rather optimistic or generous in their assessment. But fun read.')
