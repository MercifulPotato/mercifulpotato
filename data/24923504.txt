Anaconda helps to an extent, but it&#x27;s far from ideal especially compared to the default options for other languages.<p>The main problem I have with Python is its maintainability, especially when you have multiple developers working in the same code base. I would <i>never</i> choose a dynamically typed language again to build something that is going to be more than several thousand lines of code, especially because of how it cripples your IDE which is essential for helping junior developers understand the existing codebase.  Type hints help to an extent, but they&#x27;re just a small bandaid over an oozing sore.  Languages like Go are significantly better if you&#x27;re going to build large codebases that need to survive for a long period of time.')
