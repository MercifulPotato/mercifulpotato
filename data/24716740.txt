You choose A.<p><pre><code>    Probabilities:\n    p(A = Car) = 1&#x2F;3\n    p(not A = Car) = p(B or C = Car) = 2&#x2F;3\n</code></pre>\n2) Monty opens a door and shows you a goat. Let&#x27;s say he opens door B and gives you the choice to switch from door A.<p><pre><code>    Probabilities with B eliminated:\n    p(A = Car) = 1&#x2F;3\n    p(not A = Car) = p(C = Car) = 2&#x2F;3\n</code></pre>\n3) The probability of the car being behind door A remains unchanged at 1&#x2F;3, therefore the probability of the car being behind not A is also still 2&#x2F;3. Since door B has been eliminated, this means the probability that the car is behind door C _must_ be 2&#x2F;3! Therefore, we choose to switch from door A to door C.')
