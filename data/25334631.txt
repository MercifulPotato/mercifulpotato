So most of those &quot;productivity enhancements&quot; comes from hardware being so fast that you no longer have to care about things.<p>And no, a game engine like Unreal isn&#x27;t performant, it wastes a ton of ram and cpu on bookkeeping. It is a small fraction of a modern computer but back then you&#x27;d rather have all the resources instead of wasting a huge amount of them.')
