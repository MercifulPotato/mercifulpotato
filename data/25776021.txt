I&#x27;m saying never should have hosted POTUS in the first place. Further, no leader should be allowed to speak as a private individual.<p>If Twitter wants to feature POTUS, then let Twitter attend the daily presser along with all the other reporters and journalists.<p>Everyone is responsible for allowing this undemocratic violation of norms. Social medias are just the one that profited most.')
