Of course you&#x27;re still eating the currency conversion and bank handling fees for accepting those payments.<p>For us the pain of the 2.9% + 0.5% percent is not big enough to warrant even researching cheaper alternatives. If someone has hot tips for something that allows me to charge via Credit Card, accept payments in various currencies, and has an invoicing and subscription product built in I&#x27;m all ears!')
