Swiss&#x2F;EU bilateral agreements would allow me to work there easily, but every time I do some research it seems the (lack of) bureaucracy, compensation, and culture of innovation just pales in comparison to US tech hubs.<p>Here in the US, I can spin up an LLC by clicking a few buttons on one of the dozen or so online incorporation services for under $100. Cheaper if I wanted to do it myself. I can spin up little side-projects left and right. My day job is pretty run-of-the-mill for US tech standards, but pays more than I could ever dream of in anywhere in Europe (even if I take into account the value of better social services).<p>At this rate, I don&#x27;t see any sufficiently impactful changes happening in Europe to make it meaningfully competitive, but I really hope it does.')
