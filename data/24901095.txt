You don&#x27;t think &quot;talking about science&quot; is an important thing for family members to be able do do? You think &quot;science&quot; sounds like a narrow, nerdy sort of conversation that one wouldn&#x27;t need to have often? You don&#x27;t think that arguing every time the topic comes up could damage relations with people that I want to get on with? You don&#x27;t think that us mutually disrespecting each others positions could damage relations? I&#x27;m really at a loss for what goes on in your family; do enlighten us.')
