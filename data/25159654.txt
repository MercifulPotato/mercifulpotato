Ceph provides redundancy <i>between</i> servers, so if drive(s), servers, or even entire racks&#x2F;ToR switches die then things keep going. Ceph is generally for much larger scales (e.g., OpenStack, HPC) than ZFS, which is usually done on NFS or SMB servers.<p>Until relatively recently, Ceph was also only accessible at a block layer, so you&#x27;d have to put a file system on top of it (i.e, Ceph gave you a <i>&#x2F;dev&#x2F;sdX</i>), but somewhat recently CephFS has become&#x2F;declared &#x27;stable&#x27;.<p>Regardless, you still need three machines for quorum for Ceph. If you just want a file share, then it&#x27;s probably unnecessarily complex.')
