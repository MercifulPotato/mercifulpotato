The post-truth left is post-truth not because of lack of faith in epstemological institutions, but because of a different epistemology. You can&#x27;t fix that by a more honest press.<p>No, I think a more honest press (and other institutions) ceases to reward illegitimate left-wing viewpoints. They have to play the game to get the credibility (and credibility is power) which is exactly what we want. If you want credibility for your tech-gender-parity position, it no longer suffices to make blank slatist arguments because an honest epistemological institution will expose that as anti-science.<p>&gt; Like, a decade or three later. You have to be trustworthy for a while before people will trust you.<p>I think this might be true. I think it&#x27;s a lot harder to earn trust than it is to break it. On the other hand, I think we can stop the bleeding (i.e., stop creating new post-truth people) rather quickly and in time those others will slowly become more moderate and&#x2F;or more marginal and eventually (like all of us) die out such that our society moderates with time.')
