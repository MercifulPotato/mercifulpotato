The goal being to bring us out of the wild west method of governance (dozens of disparate databases) and into a more streamlined, user-friendly system.<p>I am wondering if any of you fine HN folk have gone through similar company-wide changes (either as a project manager or as an end-user), and if so:\n- What was your experience of the project?\n- What went well&#x2F;bad?\n- What would you have done differently?\n- Are there any ideas&#x2F;concepts you would steer away from completely?<p>Thanks in advance for any replies&#x2F;discussion.')
