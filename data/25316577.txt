You can have someone ejecting trolls and propaganda but not censoring legitimate speech, as long as it&#x27;s someone you trust. And, importantly, not everyone has to trust the same party -- if they start censoring something you think they shouldn&#x27;t then, unlike censorship by government or corporate monopolists, you can go and get it somewhere else.')
