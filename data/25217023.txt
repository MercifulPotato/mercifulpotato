When updates are streamed and applied sequentially, &quot;eventual&quot; is easily determined as the number of messages that the stream is behind. I&#x27;d say that this model is &quot;deterministically consistent&quot;, because we know at which point the replicas will all agree with each other without having to perform a full comparison.')
