MSFT says that about everything they release and users are still often left with the feeling that they are guinea pigs testing a very unfinished product.<p>&gt; For Visual Studio users, you need Visual Studio 16.8 or later to use .NET 5.0 on Windows and the latest version of Visual Studio for Mac) on macOS. The C# extension for Visual Studio Code already supports .NET 5.0 and C# 9.<p>Reading this makes me wonder who is still using Visual Studio. That IDE is so bad it&#x27;s beyond believe. .NET 5 is a standalone runtime which anyone can install. You can write C# in a text editor and build and run it from the command line. Why the hell do Windows developers need to install an entire new IDE in order to use the latest version of the .NET runtime? It&#x27;s ridiculous beyond belief.<p>Really shows that Visual Studio Code is the future. All you have to do is install the latest runtime and update the plugin so it shows you suggestions for all the latest language features. No need to install a new version of Visual Studio Code itself.<p>&gt; .NET 5.0 is the first release in our .NET unification journey.<p>This might cause confusion. .NET 5 is basically .NET Core 3.2  but has been renamed to .NET 5 so that .NET Framework 4.x users can finally get convinced to move to .NET Core. They just dropped the Core to make it look more appealing to them, but it&#x27;s still .NET Core.')
