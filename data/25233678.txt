But it did have its drawbacks.<p>But really, this experience is not far away if you&#x27;re looking for it. A raspberry pi kinda offers that. Maybe not the 500ms, but it boots in seconds to a CLI and it&#x27;s cheap enough to just leave running. Windows 10 is also really fast at booting (basically because it secretly just hibernates its kernel but it&#x27;s a smart and useful trick).')
