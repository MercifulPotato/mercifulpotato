In fact for Special Relativity he merely stated what must be true for the Michaelson-Morley experiment to fail to show any speed difference with respect to the ether.<p>Lorentz and other physicists had already derived a set of equations(called Lorentz transformations) that must be true given the experimental failure. But they considered it unthinkable that the speed of light could be constant in all inertial reference frames, so they thought those equations were wrong or that there was something they were missing.<p>The only thing Einstein did in that situation was come in and say &quot;hey what if that unthinkable thing were actually true?&quot;<p>Contrast this with Wolfram&#x27;s article, where he&#x27;s postulating the existence of an entire kind of physics without any experimental or phenomenological basis. The comparison is without any basis.')
