For the uninitiated, Mechatronics is a combination of Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Software&#x2F;Firmware to design &amp; analyze software-controlled electromechanical systems. Most of the students had been in industry for decades and even I was almost 10 years out of college by that point. The Feedback Controls instructor, a brand-new Mathematics PhD, was fond of answering questions with a bewildered look at the board and the question, &quot;well, isn&#x27;t it obvious?&quot; (probably not, if an engineer who hasn&#x27;t solved a differential equation in 30 years is asking you). He was obviously very bright, but could not teach the subject to save his life.<p>Thankfully, the guy we had teaching the labs was an engineer who had been building control systems his entire career and could answer the theory questions as well as the practical aspects, or no one would have passed that class!<p>sorry, needed to vent :-)')
