The PERM process is a bit outdated and requires you to advertise for the same position that a person is already hired for and has been working in, to prove that there isn&#x27;t another person who can take up the job. It is a flawed process because even though the process is to prove that the person is filling gaps in the labor market, it doesn&#x27;t fully capture that. Say you have 10000 infrastructure engineers in the market that are US citizens and there are 15000 job openings, if you advertise a job opening, you&#x27;ll always have candidates who are basically switching jobs and therefore according to the PERM requirements, you can&#x27;t hire foreign workers. But in reality you still need to fill 5000 jobs. So to compensate for that a lot of companies, follow the process which requires you put a job posting in print media and collect applications via mail, but don&#x27;t go the extra mile to post online. Because they already have the candidate working in their company, and they need to prove that they are worthy of the job. FB isn&#x27;t to blame here tbh, it&#x27;s the immigration laws that were drafted decades ago. I bet FB walks free of this one.')
