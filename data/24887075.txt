For one, the roles that an actor plays, and even the persona they have in public don&#x27;t necessarily match their private persona where their intelligence might be more evident.  For two, while luck and other personality factors surely play a significant role, it would make sense that IQ would be a differentiator amongst any group with similar characteristics.<p>So among good-looking talented actors&#x2F;actresses with similar demographics, I&#x27;d expect IQ to correlate at least somewhat with their success.  It seems odd to think otherwise.')
