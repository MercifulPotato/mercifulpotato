Item(by='fossuser', descendants=None, kids=[25512513, 25512308], score=None, time=1608672033, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25511327, text='Yeah - I don&#x27;t see how people can tell them to just give up.<p>Go scorched earth - what do you have to lose? Know the other guy is hostile and don&#x27;t trust them to do the right thing. Consider your options outside of that and talk it over with the other investor.<p>If you&#x27;re the technical cofounder here you&#x27;re probably in a stronger position to negotiate.<p>If you can get the other investor to see what&#x27;s happening here (your cofounder pushing you out one month before the cliff after you&#x27;ve helped to build things up) you may be able to get them on your side.<p>As I see it without knowing details:<p>- Either your contributions are real and your cofounder is a miserable person trying to screw you out of it and risking the company in order to do that.<p>- <i>Or</i> you haven&#x27;t done anything substantial and the cofounder wants you out. Even in this case it&#x27;s still wrong of them to do this one month before vesting (and the way they&#x27;re approaching it sounds dishonest, they should be direct).<p>If it&#x27;s truly the former I think getting the third investor to understand this is key, if the non-technical cofounder is risking the entire business at this stage they&#x27;re going to be bad going forward - you probably need to get rid of them.<p>If it&#x27;s the latter (which seems unlikely since the other cofounder is non-technical) you&#x27;ll still want to negotiate a reasonable exit, but it may be harder to do so (and you&#x27;ll probably need a lawyer).')
