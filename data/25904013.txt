Item(by='danaris', descendants=None, kids=[25929852], score=None, time=1611587572, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25902400, text='&gt; get Google IPs blacklisted (yes this happens,<p>This<p>&gt; there are no special breaks for Google).<p>and this are not the same thing. There are absolutely &quot;special breaks&quot; for Google, particularly (though not solely) since they are now the server of choice for a huge percentage of the email being sent and received, whether @gmail.com or on Gsuite accounts of various types.<p>So even if there were some kind of massive spam event, Google isn&#x27;t going to block emails from its own IP blocks or domains from reaching Gmail or Gsuite customers. And frankly, I would be shocked if any of the various DNS blocklists that people use for determining who&#x27;s a dirty spammer would actually put a Google IP block on there without massive and obvious changes in Googles mode of operation.<p>Meanwhile, us mere mortals, if we dare to try to set up our own mail server, can be listed in a blacklist because of a) something the previous owner of the IP address did, b) something someone else in the same class B block did, or c) something that was never expected before, but now because of escalation by spammers, it&#x27;s required without any documentation. And then the blacklist just doesn&#x27;t respond to requests for reconsideration or elaboration because obviously, we&#x27;re dirty spammers, and why should we be listened to?')
