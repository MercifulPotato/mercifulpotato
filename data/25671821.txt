Menny Even-Danan seems to be the sole developer (aside from some pull requests), and it looks like other stuff is keeping him busy latelyâ€”as in, in the past couple years at least.<p>I keep being perplexed when people reinvent software instead of joining forces (though I&#x27;m fine either way if the result is good). A better swipe-typing algorithm would be great, but even some smaller touches would make ASK much nicer: like, don&#x27;t add a space after an opening parenthesis when swiping. Not rocket science, but needs someone to dig in the app&#x27;s workings.')
