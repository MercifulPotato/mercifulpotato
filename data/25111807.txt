You use clocks and synchronize them. What relativity adds to the picture is the requirement for a common reference frame, which is surprising. It creates paradoxes because our intuitive notion of “at the same moment” does not include the reference frame, so there is a conflict between our intuitive understanding of past&#x2F;future (which does not change whether you are moving) and the relativistic description of past&#x2F;future (where two people can disagree about whether a particular event is int the past or the future).<p>Because of this disagreement, if you had FTL communication and wired it up so you could make a phone call to Andromeda, your phone call would arrive before or after the debate depending on your reference frame on Earth, and you could use it to send information backwards in time.')
