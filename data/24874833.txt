Parliamentary systems, and both American house of representatives suffer from this failure mode - it&#x27;s not particular unique to the American presidential election.<p>Finally, I would not defend the EC as a particularly good system, and certainly from a campaigner&#x27;s standpoint, its particularly complex to navigate. But from an individual voter&#x27;s standpoint, the mental model is simple. If you are in a swing state, you especially should vote. Parliamentary systems have concepts of &quot;crucial ridings&quot;, which are quite similar.')
