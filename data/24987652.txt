A sufficiently non-bad programmer could make do without.  But static typing also allows for some programming techniques that wouldn&#x27;t work without.<p>As a silly example, Haskell makes heavy use of overloading-by-return-type.  You just don&#x27;t the information about what return-type is expected available dynamically, it needs to be static.<p>There&#x27;s also lots of optimizations that are safe only when the compiler knows more about your code.  (Of course, a sufficiently non-bad programmer could write directly in the machine language of every processor she&#x27;s writing code for..)<p>In practice, typing helps me a lot with eg exhaustiveness checking for my pattern matches.<p>The type system that dialyzer exposes is pretty weak.  So not a good standard to measure all of typing against.')
