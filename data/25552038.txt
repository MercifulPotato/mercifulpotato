I&#x27;m happy with borgbackup, but I don&#x27;t know if it matches your bullet points.<p>Still, I&#x27;d be surprised if mainstream backup solutions corrupt your backups in case of sleep &#x2F; disconnect. That would be a pretty big bug. Borgbackup also handles resumes IIRC. Your third point is unclear, you&#x27;d have to try in practice. But if throughput * time awake &lt; size of compressed deduplicated data, you obviously cannot expect your backup to complete. I guess you just rephrased your second point.<p>For the last point, personally I think I&#x27;d take care of mobile hotspots &#x2F; slow networks with a script wrapper rather than expecting the backup software to handle this.')
