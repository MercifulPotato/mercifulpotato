Item(by='ChrisLomont', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609881867, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25650568, text='&gt;so Sci-Hub is paying the same as anyone else.<p>You seem to be missing the point:<p>Who is going to review for sci hub? Reviewers review for the journal the decide to - and that&#x27;s based on the quality of a journal. I will review for a good journal. I won&#x27;t for a bad one.<p>Who would review for sci hub? I wouldn&#x27;t, and I doubt many if any top researchers would either. Sci hub will accept the crappiest of stuff, so I (and pretty much anyone else doing solid reviews) would not bother.<p>&gt;Sci-Hub doesn&#x27;t host, it proxies<p>Did you check that or write it because you want to believe that?<p>Sci hub pulls a copy to sci hub using stolen credentials when you ask for a copy. For example, here [1] is one of my papers that sci hub has copied and serves from their site. (not sure how long they cache copies, but it&#x27;s not hard to see using chrome and viewing requests to tell where files come from). The paper even has a front page and watermarks added in 2016 from where it was downloaded from. So no, sci-hub didn&#x27;t just proxy to the journal.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zero.sci-hub.do&#x2F;5265&#x2F;2478517301ba71ba89a837647f1a133a&#x2F;lomont2002.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zero.sci-hub.do&#x2F;5265&#x2F;2478517301ba71ba89a837647f1a133...</a>')
