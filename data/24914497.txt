But none of the up-and-comming tools are classic first order logic + ZFC (Please don&#x27;t mention TLA+) and there&#x27;s a reason for that.<p>&gt; The importance of ZFC is that it ensures our common language reasoning isn&#x27;t incoherent (among other things). Once you&#x27;ve done that, you don&#x27;t need to do it again.<p>No you need formal proofs to check that there aren&#x27;t errors along the way. And lack of formal proofs slows down new weird stuff like the ABC conjecture proof candididate.<p>I don&#x27;t expect this to be solved now (tooling, as per above), but mathematicians should learn more category theory now as that works just fine pencil paper and brain. When the type theoretic tooling is ready they will be ready.')
