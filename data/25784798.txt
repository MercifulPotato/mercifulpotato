C and O have <i>roughly</i> the same atomic weight, and CO2 is about a third C (from the fuel). The fuel of course has a bunch of H but by mass that&#x27;s only a small fraction. So a given mass of fuel turns into roughly three times as much CO2. With petrol being a bit lighter than water (which is 1 kg&#x2F;l) the 2.3 kg CO2 per liter is right around the &quot;factor 3&quot; estimate.')
