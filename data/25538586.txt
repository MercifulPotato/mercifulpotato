Does anyone know if Google gives Pinterest preferential treatement in SEO rankings?<p>Edit: A few comments were asking what my queries were to generate search results where Pinterest dominates, so clarifying that a bit. I run a site that has a colour search engine for lipsticks and since Google is one of the dominant ways in which people land on my site (searching for things like &quot;nyx budapest lipstick dupes&quot;), I was studying various makeup related queries to see which sites ranked highest .<p>Edit2: Edited the title for clarity - I mean text search, not image search')
