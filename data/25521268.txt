My ignorance caveated, I&#x27;ll say with a grain of salt:<p>1. We have a shitty understanding of chronic MDMA toxicity in human beings. Rat and primate models of MDMA differ in the primarily damaged pathways (non-human primates it has a pronounced effect on serotonergic cells; in rats it has a pronounced effect on dopaminergic cells). It&#x27;s also a &quot;dirty&quot; drug, in that it hits a number of different receptor types - which means its downstream effects are going to be in a bunch of different pathways. And even those receptors are dirty - the serotonin 2A receptor that MDMA hits is involved in a <i>wide</i> variety of cellular functions.<p>Beyond that, we do know that a number of MDMA metabolites are directly capable of forming free radicals (such as quinone and thioester compounds), and oxidative damage is a serious problem in any cell tissue, but especially in brain, where cell replacement is generally too slow to matter. In rats, we&#x27;ve directly observed the production of compounds due to free radical exposure after MDMA injection, strongly suggesting that that is a mechanism of damage in the brain. (We also find that in rats that over-express copper superoxide dismutase, an antioxidant mechanism, there&#x27;s resistance to MDMA toxicity.)<p>MDMA has also been shown to induce neuronal apoptosis that is inhibited by serotonin2A blockage, but... serotonin2A has such a wide variety of effects, I won&#x27;t even guess as to what the direct pathway of that interaction is, much less how to block it.<p>ALA is a fine anti-oxidant. However, I wouldn&#x27;t put my eggs in that basket, for the following reasons:<p>1. Anti-oxidants mitigate the damage of oxidizers, the way that cops on the street mitigate street crime. Some of the cops are gonna do stuff you don&#x27;t like (we also depend on free radical mechanisms for destroying nascent cancer cells and bacteria - ALA doesn&#x27;t discriminate); some of the criminals are going to slip by anyway (oxidizing damage will continue to accrue, if slower).<p>2. ALA to my knowledge has been studied to the extent of &quot;we gave rats ALA and MDMA for two weeks, and the ALA group seemed to have less grossly visible brain damage.&quot; I expect diminished brain function long before we have significantly detectable anatomic changes. (There&#x27;s also a tiny crap study or two showing it didn&#x27;t have any protective benefit at all, but I tend not to lean on &#x27;tiny crap studies&#x27;.)<p>3. ALA as a protective mechanism relies on oxidation being the main mechanism of damage. It might be; we don&#x27;t know. If the main mechanism of damage is serotonin-pathway-driven apoptosis, or serotonin-pathway-driven neuronal structural change, or dopaminergic-pathway-etc. then ALA will not play a meaningful role in preventing long-term damage. It would just be hitting entirely the wrong mechanism.<p>Bottom-lining it: if a patient said &quot;I&#x27;m definitely going to do MDMA and you can&#x27;t talk me out of it, should I take ALA to try and mitigate the harm?&quot; I&#x27;d say yes, sure, it&#x27;s not likely to do meaningful harm if you&#x27;re not on it for years (or don&#x27;t have a disease that causes you to have an impaired oxidative immune function.) If a patient said, &quot;I&#x27;m curious about MDMA but only if I can do it safely, can I do it if I take it with ALA?&quot; my answer would have to be, &quot;There&#x27;s no good evidence that ALA is protective, and several mechanisms of damage besides the one that ALA acts on. If you&#x27;re not comfortable doing MDMA without ALA, I wouldn&#x27;t do it with ALA.&quot;<p>As to how bad the effects are:<p>No one really knows. My professional opinion is that most of the low-grade effects are likely to be behavioral&#x2F;psychiatric, and due to our generally poor ability to quantify and track psychiatric symptoms, and the social confounders that accompany drug use, we&#x27;re unlikely to have any good idea about what their adverse effects are. My most honest answer is a profession of ignorance.<p>My personal opinion is that, assuming someone is healthy and doesn&#x27;t have any particular underlying risk factor, almost none of these drugs are going to do meaningful neurological harm if done a couple of times. My bigger concern lies in (a) people with underlying psychiatric risk factors, (b) in combinations (alcohol + coke + etc.), and (c) non-neurological effects.<p>Opioids can absolutely kill you stone dead the first time you take them - but not from its neurotoxic effect. Given the spate of fentanyl being cut into the street drugs these days, and unregulated dosing, it&#x27;s the one drug I&#x27;d tell people to stay away from like their life depends on it. Though obviously if you&#x27;re taking a prescription pill one time at low dose, it&#x27;s a different story.')
