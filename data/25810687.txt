What real change is created by pithy think pieces in WaPo, NYT, substack etc? None. The readers are invested in the establishment so they&#x27;ll never offer more than the odd tish-tosh and go back to their lives. Take for example, established media discussions of climate change or Apple labor practices -the dear readers offer a witty condemnation in a comment but don&#x27;t actually change their habits.<p>edit: I can see why my comments earn dowvotes...HN readers think they are disruptors but in reality we are just the dweeb army slaving away to hold it all together')
