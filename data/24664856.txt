Maybe we look back at our youth with rose-coloured glasses, and maybe we look up to those older than us and fail to see how hard they worked to get where they are.  I remember that my first apartment was a dive; I just now looked it up and see that it has been completely renovated, is appointed like a luxury flat and is only 36% higher in real dollars.  That is not terrible.  A quick check on Zillow shows units available in my original price range not <i>that</i> far away, in a town which is far more desirable than it was decades ago.<p>Edit: ah, I see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24662058" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24662058</a> has the same graphs.  I think my commentary and own figures are interesting, so I will leave them.')
