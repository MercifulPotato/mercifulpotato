More specifically, notice-and-takedown is for user-submitted content that is illegal or tortious to <i>knowingly</i> distribute. Copyrighted content is the <i>main</i> offender here, but there are other categories, especially &quot;anti-circumvention&quot; tools illegal under other provisions of the DMCA.')
