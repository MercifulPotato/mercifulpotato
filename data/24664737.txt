Additionally, the increasingly bimodal distribution of incomes means that, while the median income may have increased, the consequences of falling out of a &quot;good&quot; career track can seem greater than they used to be. [1] For reference, 44% of Americans work in &#x27;low-wage jobs&#x27; with a median income of ~ $18,000. [2]<p>* <i>Increases in the cost of living that counteract income gains:</i> Rent, housing prices, (more-important-than-ever) higher education, healthcare &amp; childcare have all increased significantly over recent decades, which likely makes it difficult for many to feel as wealthy as one would suspect.<p>Considering circumstances like these helps me understand how many may feel much worse than real median income might suggest and makes it seem less strange that young people appear to be poorer than their parents were at the same age - living with their parents longer into adulthood, buying fewer homes, getting married later, having fewer children, etc...<p>I would also speculate that, in terms of perception alone, the rise of social media and increasing economic inequality (with specific regard to the research suggesting that individual well-being is more closely linked to low inequality than absolute levels of economic welfare) could negatively impact the average American&#x27;s perception of their quality of life.<p>1 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewsocialtrends.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;09&#x2F;trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewsocialtrends.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;09&#x2F;trends-in-income-...</a><p>2. - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-avenue&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;21&#x2F;low-wage-work-is-more-pervasive-than-you-think-and-there-arent-enough-good-jobs-to-go-around&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-avenue&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;21&#x2F;low-wag...</a>')
