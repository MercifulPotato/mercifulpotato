All the money but no respect earned, and his &quot;status&quot; ends at $10m house and whoever wants to use him for their goals. Hence the paranoid need to have FB stay on top, otherwise he&#x27;ll end up at the dumpster bin of history. Collect all the data, copy all the competitors.<p>Compare with Elon Musk who is also kinda asshole, but has a vision and charm.')
