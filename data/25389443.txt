Isn&#x27;t that the whole point?<p>There are good lessons to be learned from both the successes and failures of other startups. It&#x27;s worth taking some time to evaluate what others did right and wrong.<p>Most startup founders aren&#x27;t dumb. They know that other companies succeeded or failed due to a mix of their own decisions and uncontrollable luck. Occasionally you see founders get obsessive about cargo culting in the footsteps of some company they idolize, but it&#x27;s not really helpful. Most actual founders (not the wantrepreneurs) I know are reasonable about all of this.<p>What you&#x27;re seeing in all of these articles and websites dedicated to success or failure stories is journalism. The authors want traffic, first and foremost, so they editorialize and glorify in ways that appeal to mass audiences. Writing strictly for actual startup founders is an extremely competitive niche because there are so few founders and they&#x27;re all super busy.
