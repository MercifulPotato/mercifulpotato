I&#x27;ve seen fixed-wing drones, made of really cheap parts, just act like helicopters.  Hover, translate in arbitrary horizontal directions, VTOL, etc.  I dunno if they were &quot;flying backwards&quot;, but they did reverse flight direction.  I think it&#x27;s mostly just a matter of power-to-weigh ratio, which small aircraft have in spades.')
