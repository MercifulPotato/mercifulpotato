Our solution provides two main features:<p>1. Database workers run on AWS Spot Instances for cheap, scalable clusters.<p>2. Pseudo-masterless architecture where clients read&#x2F;write directly to the workers for true horizontal scaling + low latency (implemented in Golang).<p>In order to pull this off, we have also developed:<p><pre><code>  - automatic worker replacement with backfill through Kafka\n  - spot instance price and stability prediction for optimal instance selection and pre-emptive replacement\n  - connection pooling w&#x2F; pgbouncer\n  - zero downtime cluster scaling (adding&#x2F;removing workers, rebalancing table-shards - things Citus only includes in their Enterprise fork).\n</code></pre>\nWe would love to develop an Open Source service that others can use and contribute to if there is interest. Would love to answer any questions!')
