From what I can tell Brit Marling is the main common thread between that movie, The OA, The Sound of Her Voice.<p>These three I&#x27;ve seen personally are all good and have a lot of overlapping themes and premises, like mysterious charismatic figures in a slightly off kilter, ambiguously fantastical world convincing people to believe and follow them and their reality.<p>It&#x27;s almost comforting to know that The OA is a third or fourth shot at that kind of premise by Brit and her collaborators. Maybe that&#x27;s why it felt so beautiful and out of nowhere and perfectly formed.')
