And an unhandled exception crashes the program, which is often worse than an invalid value.<p>And it is slow when it has to check if the value is in the range after every arithmetic operation, so you can disable the range checking to make it faster.  But then you get values outside the range without an error<p>The language also assumes everything can be initialized to zero. It just calls &quot;memset&quot; on a allocated memory, so it can be initialized quickly. So you often get values that are zero whatever the range is<p>And you cannot even check for that, because  the compiler knows what values are valid. So if you want to check if the variable has a valid value and write (value &gt;= 1 and value &lt;= 5), the compiler knows it is supposed to be always true, and optimizes it away.')
