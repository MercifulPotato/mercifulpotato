Australian cars right now avg about 13.1 litres per 100km.  So you&#x27;re looking at ~$5.6 per 100km for fuel tax.<p>This tax is adding $2.5 tax per 100km for electric.<p>Right now, EVs are absolutely creating an regressive tax situation with regards to fuel.  Those who can afford to buy newer, efficient cars can usually save money on tax over those who can&#x27;t. For electric, it was worse - because they do tend to be more expensive to purchase up front, and they paid no fuel tax at all.<p>And frankly, infrastructure is expensive, and governments need to plan on continuing to maintain it.<p>That said - I think the only real answer here is a more thorough overhaul of how you tax road usage.  Perhaps it&#x27;s time to ditch the fuel excise tax entirely, and tax all drivers based on (vehicle weight * kms driven * some constant).<p>Encourage drivers to move to lighter vehicles which cause less wear and tear on the road, and drop the disparity between fuel and electric.  They both use the same tires.')
