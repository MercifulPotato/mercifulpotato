He&#x27;s also made some stupid comments re: covid.<p>SV political hostility towards technology companies and employees is frustrating. I wish the government was more aligned with helping these companies grow and things weren&#x27;t treated as if they were so zero-sum (when they&#x27;re not). I also wish the taxes weren&#x27;t so extreme (including state capital gains tax).<p>I wish there was more housing supply so cost of living wasn&#x27;t so high and the focus was on increasing supply rather than band-aids that provide short-term relief, but make things worse long-term (rent control, price controlled units).<p>The &quot;Fuck Elon Musk&quot; tweet from a politician is dumb and makes this kind of thing worse, why can&#x27;t people in government behave better than this?<p>If we could coordinate better we could do so much more. It&#x27;s just frustrating to me.')
