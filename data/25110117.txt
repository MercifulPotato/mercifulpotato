Item(by='znpy', descendants=None, kids=[25115045], score=None, time=1605522071, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25101853, text='that&#x27;s crude whataboutism.<p>going back to the original topic, apple hardware&#x2F;software, i&#x27;ve used apple hardware and software (company-issued macbook pro and iphone 7&#x2F;8).<p>The software is great as long as you want to stay within apple-defined boudaries. If you want to go outside that, it&#x27;s an experience similar if not worse than using gnu&#x2F;linux.<p>The hardware is great when the machine is brand new but decays very quickly, it&#x27;s not designed to be serviced  by either end-users or specialized users or specialized shops -- you&#x27;re supposed to return it to an apple store and pay an expensive price to basic maintenance. As an example,  cleaning up the fans from dust is very important in those machines but you have to buy special hardware to take off the screws, and in generally you risk breaking something. Keyboards failed spectacularly in last gen, and apple waited like two years before fixing it. Audio is great, until it breaks. My macbook pro (15&quot; top of the line) couldn&#x27;t sustain full-audio, and distorted audio after ~30 sec of full volume audio (imagine that during a conference call in a meeting with other people). The screen is great, but the glass panel retained ALL of the fingerprints and it was a PITA to clean, i had to buy special glass-cleaning liquids. WTF.<p>All the above issues appeared all shortly after the first year of life of the laptop. Call me an anti-apple fanatic, I don&#x27;t care, but I expected more from a 3500+â‚¬ machine.<p>At the new job i&#x27;ve been given a 13&quot; dell latitude 7390. It works flawlessly, it rarely skips a beat and it has none of the problems stated above. Fuck Apple.')
