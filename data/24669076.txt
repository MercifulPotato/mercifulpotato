It&#x27;s not a wrong answer; fats are broken down by beta-oxidation and the products are used in oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP - which is then used for energy.<p>Honestly the question itself seems opaque and intentionally vague to generate surprising results. It&#x27;s like asking a chemist &quot;What happens to bonds during IR spectroscopy?&quot; and then when they start talking about induced dipoles you say,&quot;WRONG! The bonds stretch!!&quot;')
