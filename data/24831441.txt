Pre-covid I constantly heard from school, that he was not paying attention, getting distracted. But since Covid, his output has been phenomenal - his reading&#x2F;math has improved, he does really well one on one, we have a nanny working with him,. And I&#x27;ve never seen him happier.\nI know homeschool would benefit him immensely in the long run from an intellectual standpoint, but am afraid that he will miss out on all the social aspects.')
