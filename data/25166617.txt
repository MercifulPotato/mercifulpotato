Only recently and I&#x27;m not sure exactly how in zoom you can do this too or so i&#x27;ve been told... but this really was the big feature in hangouts... also I must be an unusual person but I just keep my work email (gmail ) in a pinned tab always and it&#x27;s just an easy place to chat with co-workers and also place test phone calls while hacking on twilio... makes me sad this might be going away :)')
