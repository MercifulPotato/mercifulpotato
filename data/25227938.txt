I loved it, but with 68040 and 486, the writing was on the wall for everyone to see.<p>By the time of Pentium, the writing was on the wall, the floors, the windows, the ceiling, the windows.<p>Yes, 68060 held a candle against early Pentium but it was not intended as a Personal Computer CPU, more &quot;fast embedded&quot;.<p>The Amiga OS was great. No memory protection, but Win 3.1 had none, DOS had none, Win 95 had some but it somehow crashed relentlessly anyway. It took years for them to discover that it had a max uptime of 48 days because of a timer running out of bits.<p>AGA could and should have been incrementally upgraded with more modes, ever keeping backwards compatibility. (Like AGA did with the original chipset.) They could have sold Amigas on PCI boards, with a cheap 68000 to boot legacy Amiga OS until the transition was complete with emulation or whatever, and using the PC x86 for games code. So many possibilities, but R&amp;D was on a shoestring budget.<p>The &quot;game console like&quot; conformity was the strength and ultimately the downfall of the platform, but not because that&#x27;s bad inherently, but because the revisions stopped coming. The original PS2 was compatible with the PS1, and the original PS3 was compatible with the PS2.<p>The iPhone also shows the strength of vertical integration, Commodore had a great chess board opening but traded all its pieces for nothing, except in the end, pork for the CEO and board.')
