They break everything up by region and county, so they can monitor available beds, new cases, new hospitalizations, etc. They are doing contact tracing so as they change the rules I assume they are using that data to make sure the rules actually are affecting the places where people are getting infected. So far, the hospitals arenâ€™t getting overwhelmed so it looks like they are doing it right.')
