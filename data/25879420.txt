Item(by='caseyavila', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611373627, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25878649, text='Yes, as a high school student who just fools around with their computer during online class (Linux, Gentoo, compiling and all that), it cannot be understated how many of my classmates play video games, watch YouTube, and watch Twitch. Those really are the big 3. I personally had to overcome a YouTube and video game addiction to get to a point where I was spending my free time in a mindful way, so I definitely can relate to everyone else.<p>YouTube hadn&#x27;t really taken off until we were in middle school to early high school, so I couldn&#x27;t imagine what internet addictions may be like in the future, seeing as quite a few toddlers of today grow up watching it. I suppose it&#x27;s not too different to Television however.')
