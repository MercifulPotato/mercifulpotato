I learned about the trade-offs and that it was easy to write a database that out-performed RDBMSes in specific criteria. But I hadn&#x27;t thought of making them extensible.<p>I have a pet project I&#x27;m working on, which is a generi distributed system where each component is a microservice. It turns out there&#x27;s <i>lots</i> of these things built already, mainly by systems engineers for obscure things (Airflow, Rundeck, Stackstorm being some examples). I&#x27;ll probably think about how I can redesign my project with composeable databases in mind. I don&#x27;t expect I&#x27;ll ever have a working product, but it&#x27;ll be useful to think about this problem.')
