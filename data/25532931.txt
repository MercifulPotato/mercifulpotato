Research teams for medical or pharmaceutical ventures &quot;monetize&quot; health data (to develop e.g. drugs or tools) but they do it in an ethical way, through anonymized or aggregated data, following good practice guidelines, etc. And there is no wide polemics on these methods. Why would not Google&#x2F;Fitbit use the data in the same ethical ways?')
