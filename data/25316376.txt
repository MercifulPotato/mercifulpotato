I tried different ones over time but most fail at on-boarding. This was seamless and really easy. In about 2 minutes I successfully shared my project and followed known projects. This means this mvp <i>works</i> and it let me craving for more, I want to use this! I want issues and PR support to prove this can effectively work as a github replacement to me.<p>Now, the downside of this mvp is that there is no project discovery in the client itself. We need to go search for projects in a browser, in this page <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;seedling.radicle.xyz&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;seedling.radicle.xyz&#x2F;</a> which is a bit confusing. Considering the client itself is electron, it could at least, open this page for us somewhere. Or, we could at least have a less &quot;noisy&quot; seedling page focused on search and I would not even know it wasn&#x27;t part of the client itself.<p>Overall, awesome project. I really hope it will grow and add the missing essential features. If I could vote, with priority these would be:<p>- project discovery integrated in the client\n- issues support\n- pr support\n- multiple identities<p>Anyway, great job!')
