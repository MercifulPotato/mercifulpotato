There are many games I&#x27;d rather play on a big TV with a controller and home theater.<p>I used to have the gaming PC in the living room but then I couldn&#x27;t play k&#x2F;m games. I now have a very long HDMI cable and USB extender from my studio to the living room, but it&#x27;s a hassle to set it up every time I want to play.')
