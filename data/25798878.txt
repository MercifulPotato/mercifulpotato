These aren’t things that you can staple to Java. Java is more than syntax, it’s the semantics of the JVM and its object system, which should only be extended in a backwards-compatible way.<p>So I’m gonna say that the reason Go exists is <i>exactly because</i> the creators didn’t want to burn down Java and start over. It turns out that you can create a new language without burning <i>anything</i> down. There is also C# and the various nontrivial differences between C# and Java, like value types and type erasure in generics.<p>There are plenty of languages which exist side-by-side with Java in the JVM: Clojure, Kotlin, and Scala to name three. These all have their differences but they’re all designed specifically with the JVM in mind. Go isn’t.')
