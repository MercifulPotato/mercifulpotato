This is ridiculous.<p>Any silovik worth his salt would refuse to discuss such a hot topic over an open line. Also, some people noticed their talk is not even close to how two professionals both working in the kontora would speak. And how come &#x27;the spy&#x27; didn&#x27;t recognize his target&#x27;s voice and manner of speaking? How come he didn&#x27;t cross check &#x27;the assistant&#x27; with his boss?<p>Not to mention that Navalny having such information about FSB agents means he&#x27;s got some suspicious connections. Wouldn&#x27;t he go to jail for this when he&#x27;s back to Russia?')
