The notion I&#x27;ve gotten from them is that they support absolute free speech. Maybe they&#x27;re an exception. Maybe it&#x27;s an Eastern European thing. I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t support absolute free speech myself. I just took issue with the statement that it&#x27;s obvious that some speech needs to be censored, because I know some very educated intelligent people who disagree with it.')
