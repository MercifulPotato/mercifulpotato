What an empty comment.<p>That’s just your extremely uncharitable and incorrect insinuation of my comment. What I was saying was not about the user’s reaction to the feature but instead about the admiration of the company. It’s not impressive if Ford uses a wheel on their car because a wheel is old technology that others have already done well.')
