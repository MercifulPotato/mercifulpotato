I have different preferences (think HP Omen 15, Lenovo Legion 5) but those weren&#x27;t available at a good price until late summer (and really only when sales occurred). Anyone wanting QHD or 4K was out of luck last year. Wanting Ryzen but also wanting a 500-nit screen is not a great feeling.<p>I&#x27;m actually selling my HP Omen 15 to my brother because I discovered it uses PWM for brightness, and I have a very high sensitivity - if I turn brightness down from 100% I get a headache within an hour or two. (I mostly prefer 100% brightness but when on battery I&#x27;d like to turn it down.)<p>Fingers crossed 2021 is a big improvement from 2020 for Ryzen laptops.')
