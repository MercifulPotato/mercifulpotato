It&#x27;s usually self-evident by reading the words.<p>Twitter&#x27;s actions aren&#x27;t even self-consistent here. If these tweets were all innocuous, then why remove the trend? If they were primarily discussions of other people&#x27;s activity, rather than explicit calls for violence, then there was no good reason to do this.<p>Also, there&#x27;s nothing &quot;moving goal posts&quot; about asking people to at least try to substantiate what they post. The person I responded to didn&#x27;t even bother posting a link.')
