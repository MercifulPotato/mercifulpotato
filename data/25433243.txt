If I recall correctly, Twitter uses Redis as the store for user feeds. I wonder if this is a result of the recent deployment of Graviton2 instances for ElastiCache[1]. I&#x27;d think Twitter would be at a scale where such a managed solution wouldn&#x27;t be hugely valuable, but I thought this use of Graviton chips was really smart. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Amazon gave them a very good deal to lock in a big customer for that offering.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;about-aws&#x2F;whats-new&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;amazon-elasticache-now-supports-m6g-and-r6g-graviton2-based-instances&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;about-aws&#x2F;whats-new&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;amazon-el...</a>')
