I randomly place each ball into one of two boxes. I give you one box, and keep the other box for myself, then wave my magic wand and transport you 5,000 light years away.<p>You look inside your box and see a red ball. In that moment you learn that I have a blue ball in my box. You gained that information in an instant, about a box 5,000 light years away.<p>(This is an explanation I&#x27;ve heard. But I don&#x27;t personally know if it&#x27;s accurate.)')
