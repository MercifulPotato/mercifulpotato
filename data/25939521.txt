That’s incredible. It came out of the machine looking brand new.<p>I’m a little torn. Can we have repairable devices that are this stable and robust, and have such an incredible form factor?<p>Considering this phone will last me 4 or 5 years, it’s a good value and extremely dependable. I want more repairable things, I just don’t know how they’d make it happen in a way that keeps them competitive.<p>One shitty thing: my left AirPods Pro clicks and pops, and the only solution is a complete replacement. Apple is willing to replace them at no charge, but I can’t stand the waste. What will they do with them? Recycle and landfill? These things really are a repairability nightmare and I don’t think I can justify buying then again.<p>My personal experience has been very positive though. The need to repair is remarkably rare.')
