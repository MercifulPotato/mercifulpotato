Adults sort of fall into this pattern too, especially when they feel like they need to sleep more, and get too stressed out to sleep. Some of the most productive people and fastest learners know how to fall asleep as soon as they want to, and how to get enough rest.<p>Siestas too.<p>Besides sleep, there&#x27;s relaxation in general. Social media is probably the worst - it floods the brain with things, that aren&#x27;t all that relaxing, but some mistake it for relaxation because it&#x27;s mildly entertaining and unproductive. Everyone has a form of relaxation that&#x27;s refreshing for them, and a form that&#x27;s unhealthy and addictive. I relax well with Netflix, but many feel stressed out with it and binge on bad shows.<p>The better you rest, the more you enjoy life, reduce depression, and the harder you can push yourself.')
