What&#x27;s the point in these systems? Genuinely. Why would I ever need this? Just like a &quot;smart&quot; doorbell, fridge, meter. I would love for someone to be able to explain the benefits to me over the normal, cheap, completely working &quot;dump&quot; version. The only &quot;smart&quot; device I own is a TV and it is crap, worse thing I&#x27;ve ever bought.')
