All I can do is trust the vote counters, and at this point that is the very matter under dispute.  Someone in the know really should do an in depth write-up of why it is we can trust this election result.  As it is the third Peter Navarro report appears very suspicious and it is hard to believe there is absolutely no reason to doubt the election results.  On the contrary the election could very well have been the steal of the century.')
