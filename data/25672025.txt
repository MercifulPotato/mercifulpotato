Latency at the microsecond level is highly critical, and these machines don&#x27;t have any public facing interface.<p>This is obviously a niche case. But IMO, I can see similar calculus for other more mainstream use cases. I wouldn&#x27;t turn migrations=off on a public facing web server. But if you have a cluster that does ETL data processing, it&#x27;s probably CPU-bound and has very little externally exposed surface area. Arguably, even backend SQL servers can benefit, assuming the set of clients that directly access the dbase are tightly controlled and audited.')
