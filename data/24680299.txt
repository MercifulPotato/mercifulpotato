It reminds me of studies in confabulation in split-brains:<p>&gt;&gt; Some of the most famous examples of confabulation come &quot;split-brain&quot; patients, whose left and right brain hemispheres have been surgically disconnected for medical treatment. Neuroscientists have devised clever experiments in which information is provided to the right hemisphere (for instance, pictures of naked people), causing a change in behavior (embarrassed giggling). Split-brain individuals are then asked to explain their behavior verbally, which relies on the left hemisphere. Realizing that their body is laughing, but unaware of the nude images, the left hemisphere will confabulate an excuse for the body&#x27;s behavior (&quot;I keep laughing because you ask such funny questions, Doc!&quot;).[1]<p>People are driven by one part of their brain to consume and acquire pleasure&#x2F;status&#x2F;money and simultaneously convinced by another part of their brain to believe they are good, deserving, and entitled to everything they enjoy. I see this with all sorts of people who are caught doing something they know is wrong and immediately respond with &quot;well, everyone else does even worse...&quot; or &quot;yeah, but I do X, so it evens out...&quot;.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edge.org&#x2F;response-detail&#x2F;11513" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edge.org&#x2F;response-detail&#x2F;11513</a>')
