This is usually where government agencies like DOE leverage their capital investment programs because private business aren&#x27;t interested in paying for the R&amp;D to solve those kinds of big problems without a guaranteed success.<p>Solar is only becoming cheaper today because of the research and capital that was put into developing the technology, not because it&#x27;s inherently cleaner than coal. To your point, based purely on the market forces (i.e. excluding carbon taxes) coal is still a very viable option. And if the government is motivated to migrate businesses off of dirty energy resources, it also has a motivation to help develop alternatives that the market will accept.<p>Solyndra[0] was one example of a company that received government support to develop solar technology and became notorious for defrauding the government in the process.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Solyndra" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Solyndra</a>')
