Item(by='ogre_codes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610384673, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25729524, text='&gt; The idea &quot;I could do some bike work on my own, so bike work can&#x27;t be expensive&quot; has to die, simple as that. People can pop open a beer at home just fine, nobody expects bars to sell beer at a similar price.<p>In the town I used to live in, Performance bought out the only decent bike shop in town so I got into the habit of buying online because I could wrench better than the Performance mechanics. When I moved up to Oregon there are 5 good bike shops here in town and they all charge reasonable rates so I use them whenever possible.<p>I do still buy online and install parts myself, not to save a buck, but because it&#x27;s more convenient than taking my bike into the shop and leaving it there for a few days.')
