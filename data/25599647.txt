If you are not a highly skilled worker you are not going to get a share of the profit. That&#x27;s the general problem first world countries are facing, lack of demand for low skilled labor unless it is illegal immigrant labor because that is the only form of labor that is cheap enough to compete with foreign countries. You can either train everyone (very hard) or make sure there are enough low skilled jobs (government stimulus).')
