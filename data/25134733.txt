Item(by='kleiba', descendants=None, kids=[25136804, 25135127, 25136257, 25135031], score=None, time=1605691173, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25134006, text='Notice that we&#x27;re talking about <i>de-identified</i> patient data here. There is a utility&#x2F;privacy trade-off when using data containing private information: on the one hand, the patient&#x27;s personal information must absolutely be protected, on the other hand, many processes could benefit from the information in such a data collection even without the knowledge of which data point belongs to which individual.<p>If de-identification is done right, it would be a bit of a stretch to talk about &quot;surveillance&quot; because that&#x27;s the whole point of de-identification: remove any information from the records that allows a third-party to identify the underlying person from whom the data originated. Note especially that this includes <i>inference attacks</i>, i.e., not only should any occurrences of <i>names</i> be removed&#x2F;masked but also any information that would allow an <i>informed</i> attacker to re-infer that information, i.e., cross-link the patient data back to a specific person.<p>The big elephant in the room, however, is the &quot;If&quot; at the beginning of the previous paragraph. As far as I see it, the problem lies not in wanting to establish some functionality that <i>actually uses</i> the collected information but whether appropriate privacy prerequisites have been put in place prior to that.')
