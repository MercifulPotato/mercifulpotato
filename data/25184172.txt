I talked to someone at one and this has been the best year in a decade, and this was a small, independent store that also has a web presence. Guitar Center must have been pretty mismanaged leading up to this. It&#x27;s also been a rough decade for rock music--there just isn&#x27;t as much guitar music as there used to be.')
