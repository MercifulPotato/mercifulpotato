Adding a constructor and one line to startup.cs is a massive waste of time? Just how long does it take you?<p>&gt; It&#x27;s also something that if you&#x27;re not working regularly with it can be very mysterious and when it fails, fails at run-time, quite inscrutably sometimes.<p>If DI fails it’s usually just because you’ve forgotten to add that one line to the startup.cs, and the error you get will tell you that. Can you give me a concrete example of how DI is inscrutable?')
