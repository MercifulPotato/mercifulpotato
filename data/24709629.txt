I was saying I don&#x27;t recall this being a uniquely USB3 problem (unfortunately all I have is my memory to go on here that we had desense issues with USB+2.4Ghz when I worked on the Palm Pre &amp; Jawbone Jambox).<p>Given the report is 8 years old, I find it hard to believe this isn&#x27;t an active thing that&#x27;s designed around. Hell, you can buy USB3 WiFi dongles that do 2.4 Ghz. If this were a critical flaw that&#x27;s unsolvable such a device wouldn&#x27;t be possible to build. Even Table 4-2 indicates different mouse models have different performance characteristics, indicating not all 2.4Ghz devices are similarly sensitive to the problem.')
