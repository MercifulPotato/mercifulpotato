Lisp rose and fell with the initial tribe of AI.  Perl was the tribe of the system administrator and fell when they did.  Ruby rose and fell with the tribe of Rails.  Python is riding the tribe of numerics.<p>The language needs to at least be not actively hostile to the tribe, but after that it&#x27;s pretty irrelevant.')
