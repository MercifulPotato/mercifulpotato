Item(by='diydsp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606836012, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25254120, text='+1 for cooking for yourself.  It is time well-spent, especially if your partner is into it.  And it can save money and be much healthier than eating out!  Especially if you make a little extra and supplement other meals.<p>Also, eating out takes a lot of time... driving to a place, sitting there waiting for waiters to return a credit card, etc.  The alcohol is super marked-up.  You don&#x27;t know the ingredients of the food well, it&#x27;s usually loaded with sugar and fats.  I don&#x27;t mean never do it, but living that way is miserable.<p>And especially in the pandemic, eating out means tons of containers to deal with.  Even if you push just push everything in the trash, it&#x27;s still like a half a bag&#x27;s worth.  And if are a good doobie and wash the containers, recycle, save the leftovers, etc., it&#x27;s nearly as much time as if you made it yourself.  Again, not that you never should, but save it for special occasions if you wanna have a long, above-average healthspan.')
