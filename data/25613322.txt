If you buy a Dell UltraSharp you can expect that there will be no dead pixels. But that&#x27;s not because Dell has technology that completely prevents them, it&#x27;s because Dell has good QC. If you buy a cheap screen from a manufacturer that does less QC you might seldomly have stuck pixels. And of course there are the bottom-of-the-barrel suppliers that buy whatever other suppliers discard because of QC defects. There&#x27;s always someone who will buy a screen with a couple dead pixels if it&#x27;s half the price.<p>I don&#x27;t know where pine falls, I would guess they buy straight from the factory without extensive QC and might seldomly have stuck pixels.')
