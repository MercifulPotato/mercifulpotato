There&#x27;s still a strange hankering by case makers to try to make them &quot;edgy&quot; and a solid percentage are still competing to be the xtremiest PC equivalent of go-faster stripes on cars. However there is at least a new aesthetic where people are taking simpler and tidier case designs and then making them garish with LEDs, and I quite enjoy seeing some of their creations.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t bother, I go after sound-proofing in my builds instead, but my partner, who isn&#x27;t particularly into computers, is actually quite a fan of the RGB stuff so her computer will be notably more lary.')
