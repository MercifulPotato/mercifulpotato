Item(by='crazygringo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606840833, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25262460, text='I lived in Brazil for years (years ago) and the McD&#x27;s quarter pounders were certainly identical back then.<p>Maybe you have a &quot;bad&quot; McD&#x27;s by you... but their regular hamburgers are much, much smaller in diameter (and thinner). A quarter pounder burger comes to the edge of the bun. If they used a regular burger, it would be so small it would be invisible when served, you wouldn&#x27;t see it at all until biting in.<p>Legally, a quarter pounder is always 1&#x2F;4 lb <i>before</i> cooking. It&#x27;s always significantly less when served because of the water and fat it loses while cooking.<p>So if you think you&#x27;re getting a 0.2 lb burger cooked, it&#x27;s still a real quarter pounder. Their regular hamburger&#x2F;cheeseburger is <i>waaay</i> less than 0.2 lb. If you want a serious amount of meat, that&#x27;s what a double quarter pounder is for.')
