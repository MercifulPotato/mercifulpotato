Libertarians are mostly concerned with the former (e.g., minimising laws which stop their ability to do something) whereas modern liberalism takes a more balanced approach (for example, making racial discrimination illegal reduces someone&#x27;s freedom to be racist whilst improving another groups ability to partake in society without experiencing discrimination)')
