All the other parts will be open source, the engine, the WunderNode, CodeGen. We don&#x27;t want to be locked into a vendor ourselves. You can always not use our proprietary services. The core functionality described above will always work offline without using any of our cloud services. We will offer a dirt cheap cloud service where we run WunderNodes on the edge for you but if, for any reason, you don&#x27;t want to use this you&#x27;re free to host your own Nodes.  I&#x27;d love if you could contact me and we have a chat about your use case. I&#x27;d really like to get your take and build out the next steps as close to user expectations as it can get. I don&#x27;t want to build something that doesn&#x27;t work for the community.')
