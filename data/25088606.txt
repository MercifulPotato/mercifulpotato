I tried all sorts of elimination diets, raw foods, probiotics, etc.  Nothing worked.  I finally put him on a Rx dog food from purina with high fiber and a bunch of the &#x27;garbage&#x27; ingredients I spent years trying to avoid.  His digestive issues disappeared and he had some of the best years of his life.  He died close to 17 years old, which isn&#x27;t bad for a 42 pound dog.')
