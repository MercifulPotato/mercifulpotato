In particular, I&#x27;m trying to find a library that can generate patterns such as dots, stripes, etc (there was one on HN a few months ago which I bookmarked but haven&#x27;t been able to locate).  Also happy to take suggestions for libraries or code that&#x27;s roughly in that graphical vein e.g., dithering, parallax scrolling, other cool 2D effects, etc.')
