However I know that Don&#x27;t Starve Together and some other games really freak out. (I&#x27;ve been lucky enough not to see any crashes though)<p>What I have found is that running games under Wayland (via XWayland) makes a lot of games behave better. I don&#x27;t know exactly why this is but I suspect they are trying to manipulate a bunch of settings like fullscreen&#x2F;input grabbing&#x2F;display resolution which just get ignored by Wayland. So basically the extra restrictions of Wayland stop them from shooting themselves in the foot.<p>On the downside my NVIDIA GPU can&#x27;t be used on Wayland...')
