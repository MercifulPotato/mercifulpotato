And how you solve it with &quot;Bokeh&quot;? \nI agree that matplotlib&#x27;s functional interface is somewhat messy, but that is somewhat historical, and stems from wanting to mimic how matlab works. I personally find matplotlib&#x27;s OO interface both very powerful, and somewhat intuitive, once one gets a hang of it, hence I&#x27;m curious of specific cases where it fails for you.')
