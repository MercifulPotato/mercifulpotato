Standard Chartered, for example, uses it extensively to earn lots of money. Facebook uses it for spam filtering logic. Niche, perhaps, but painting it as purely for research is just incorrect.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s not going to be great if all you&#x27;re writing is integrations with various vendors using SOAP or just legacy or odd protocols. Those have libraries or code generators on the JVM&#x2F;.Net&#x2F;etc. platforms... not so much in Haskell. However, this has nothing to do with the language, it&#x27;s just a matter of people actually doing the work to support those things.<p>Everything else, though... you&#x27;re golden. It has a learning curve, but there&#x27;s a reason that Scala is moving ever closer to monads, adopting proper syntax for type classes, etc.')
