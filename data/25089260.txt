Unfortunately, this level of investment has not been sustained. Now the investment bubble is over, we&#x27;re reverting to the kind of nasty, brutish, and uncertain life that has been the normal state of affairs for much of history.<p>The rise of neoliberalism in the 1980s (under Reagan in the US; Thatcher in the UK; Mulroney in Canada; etc) and the disinvestment that followed made the stagnation in living standards--and increasing socioeconomic insecurity--for the median person inevitable.<p>I don&#x27;t see a way to turn things around, as the social disinvestment of the 1980s has eroded social ties to the point that no one is willing to pay for the kind of collective projects (infrastructure, education, a public commons) that would improve conditions for the median person. Far too many people find it comforting to blame the other for a declining society rather than understand that societal-level problems require societal-level solutions.')
