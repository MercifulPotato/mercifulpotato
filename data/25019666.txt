You&#x27;ll quickly notice the pay rates are <i>abysmal</i>. $7&#x2F;hr for a three.js developer. $250 (or lower, possibly as low s $30) to make a fully functional &amp; tested app on android+iphone (would normally take an entire dev team probably well over 1 or 2 weeks).<p>These are rates below minimum wage for highly technical skills.<p>This is even more true for hardware too but it&#x27;s hard to quantify, because e.g. you can&#x27;t just compare the price of buying capacitors wholesale from Shenzhen with the price of buying capacitors wholesale from Cleveland, because Cleveland doesn&#x27;t manufacture capacitors.<p>However, I do have some data (though it&#x27;s not the most sophisticatedly obtained). Sticking with capacitors as a benchmark, I was expecting there to be 0 US companies manufacturing capacitors, but apparently there are 7 [2]. In contrast, there are apparently 228 Chinese companies manufacturing capacitors [3].<p>All of this is just to say it&#x27;s pretty clear that globalization has moved these jobs overseas (and significantly dropped the market rate for those who remain local).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freelancer.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freelancer.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;</a> \n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.company-list.org&#x2F;capacitors_in_united_states.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.company-list.org&#x2F;capacitors_in_united_states.htm...</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.company-list.org&#x2F;capacitors_in_china.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.company-list.org&#x2F;capacitors_in_china.html</a>')
