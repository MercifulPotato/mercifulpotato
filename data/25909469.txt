Glasses are a racket.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for the quality&#x2F;durability of their frames, as I only used them to get some prescription lenses for my Valve Index so I can play in VR without wearing my glasses.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zennioptical.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zennioptical.com&#x2F;</a>')
