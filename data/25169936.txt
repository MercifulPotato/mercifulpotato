So get really good at hearing the letter e, then and only then worry about getting good at learning the letter a, etc.  Might have to listen to the same morse code many times to learn all the letters, but you&#x27;ll get it eventually.<p>Its an interesting note taking strategy in general; better to learn a subset very well then expand the subset over time.<p>The idea in the article of &quot;highlight without a highlighter&quot; is interesting.  You can see how some people need paper copies specifically because of their learning style, whereas people who don&#x27;t highlight do just fine with tablets and phone emails.  AFAIK interviewing processes do not find employees with matching culture fit, which is too bad as it would probably help quite a bit (imagine being the only guy on the team who needs paper copies of everything, or the only guy who can&#x27;t use search function on his phone because everyone else is using paper)')
