If the fractures had been another half inch to the right, I would have been paralyzed for life.<p>Indeed, I lost control over my bowel functions, and for a few agonizing days was unclear if I would ever get them back. I learned how to insert my own catheter to avoid the embarassment of having it done for me.<p>The following weeks were spent wheelchair-bound in a rehab facility, where each day brought surreal new challenges, but also small increments of progress. A year later, all bodily functions have been restored, with only minor limitations.<p>If you have also been struck by disaster, and narrowly escaped by sheer miracle, you will understand the intense gratitude and sense of purpose that one is filled with in such circumstances.<p>Gratitude for all the little things that were almost taken away forever - wiggling your toes, playing a sport, walking to the store, using the toilet unassisted. Gratitude for all the help, care, and healing from medical staff, without which life would be awful and pointless.<p>And a deep sense of purpose, as you realize how short and fragile that life is. It is a powerful reminder to learn, build, and grow while you still have the resources and opportunity.<p>I think about it less as time goes on, but sometimes I will see the ground rushing at me, or glimpse a flash of the life I almost had... and it keeps me on my toes.')
