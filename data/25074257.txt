Xe LP, which exists right now in integrated and discrete forms, is comparable to low-end discrete GPUs from Nvidia and AMD and AMD&#x27;s APUs. The most distinctive feature of the Xe LP variant is the emphasis on video encoding hardware.<p>The real question, though, is what sort of performance Xe HP&#x2F;HPG&#x2F;HPC will bring when they&#x27;re released. They don&#x27;t need to significantly outperform the competition (AMD has more than demonstrated in the past that superior GPU performance alone is not enough), they just need to be close enough with a good enough software story. Cuda and Nvidia&#x27;s driver stack are both reasonably nice and a pain in the ass to work with, so if Intel can (1) competently support major ML frameworks, (2) reasonably support porting from Cuda, and (3) maintain a competent OpenCL implementation that could be enough to be competitive. They&#x27;ll likely eat market share from AMD first, since the AMD software stack has more rough edges.')
