After that, you meet with them formally once every 1-4 weeks as a team to update the schedule, along with an informal, individual chat as needed for critical tasks and late dependencies.  It took a lot less time than the useless daily standup meetings I now attend.<p>Most of my experience with PMs was at smaller orgs with smaller teams.  Now that I work at a large valley company with layers of antagonistic management, I appreciate my former PMs more than ever.<p>It&#x27;s important to hire good PMs without huge egos or career aspirations.  Being a PM is kind of a shit job and it&#x27;s not about wielding power or authority over people.  You also need PMs who understand the uncertainty baked into software estimates, and can cope with unforeseen problems requiring schedule juggling.')
