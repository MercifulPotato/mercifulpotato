Or some boring socialist collective that nobody&#x27;s heard of, like that case that Dorsey <i>clearly</i> used just so he&#x27;d have the name of a left-leaning organization that Twitter had banned.<p>Another way to say this: I do believe in &quot;more speech&quot; as a way to fight &quot;bad speech,&quot; but if &quot;more speech&quot; does not include the freedom to read, understand, modify, and publish modifications of the recommendation algos that prime over a hundred million people then it&#x27;s a dangerously constrained and misleading debate.<p>Furthermore-- if we depend on the &quot;temporary&quot; solution of trusting the companies to do cherry-picked bans to appease hundreds of millions of users, the companies will use all their data, money, and connections to paint that as a long term solution and leverage it to their bigger fight against monopoly regulation.')
