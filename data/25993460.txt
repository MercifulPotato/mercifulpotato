I used to drink 5+ cups per day (especially workdays) while feeling fairly little effect from it.<p>Did you get a big boost when you first started with it that reduced as you developed tolerance with habitual use?<p>I&#x27;ve always been pretty careful with caffeine consumption in order to avoid tolerance, because I didn&#x27;t want to get into a state where all it did was boost me back to my &quot;normal&quot; (i.e. feeling crappy until I got my coffee, and having to use increasing amounts to get past my baseline).')
