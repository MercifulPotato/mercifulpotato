If I need to switch business processes, that is never the case and if I have to switch business processes, then stability of the service provider is critical.<p>&quot;Every small company in the world&quot; is not a market because there are too many unique needs...or rather it is end point not a starting point for building a company. The starting point is getting customers one by one.<p>Good luck.')
