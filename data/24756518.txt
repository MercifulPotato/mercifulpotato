If I run a forum for car enthusiasts, I should be able to curate the community and limit discussions on locomotives.<p>But what of the platforms that make my forum possible? The Cloudflares the protect from DDoS, the DigitalOceans that provide the servers, the ISPs that provide transit, the Facebooks that provide social media support?
