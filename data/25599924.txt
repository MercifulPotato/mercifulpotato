When they merged with another company, the lawyers tried to take ownership of it.<p>I pointed out that my contract was different to the standard contract and they had no claim.  They then came back saying that I had to assume any liability they might face for using it.  I demurred and said they were free to remove my code if they had any concerns.  They kept the code.<p>What I learned from this is that even if you trust the people and the organisation you work with, you have to protect your work.  The lawyers were just doing their job in the merger.')
