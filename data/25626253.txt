Beware of single-cause explanations of inherently complex problems.<p>I&#x27;ve designed and worked on systems with both OOP and functional-style code. Clojure is a tool that very much helps <i></i>minimize<i></i> technical debt. I think the minimal use of managed state in Clojure plays a crucial part.<p>Having done a good amount of looking through the Clojure language code itself, there&#x27;s very little (if any) technical debt there.')
