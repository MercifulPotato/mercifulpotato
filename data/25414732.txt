I owned that car for 6 years and for the whole time of ownership it always made me smile just thinking about going somewhere (well, expect for times when it was broken but it wasn&#x27;t often). Unfortunately I had to sell it because it started to fall apart and I bought a brand new car that&#x27;s practical, safe, reliable, but simply boring and now driving became a chore. I&#x27;m planning to buy a fun car once again as a second one and use it whenever I can because I miss the joy of driving sooooo much.')
