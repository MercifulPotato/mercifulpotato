For one thing GDP is a poor measure of the general increases of wealth. The US&#x27;s pivot to services isn&#x27;t represented in GDP since it only accurately measures physical production (Microsoft&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Facebook etc. aren&#x27;t accurately represented). The actual increases that wind up going into salaries (particularly at the top half) are heavily impacted by these intangible aspects of the economy (so if you isolated this report to just Mark Zuckerberg you&#x27;d see billions in wealth but no growth to account for it). At the lower end of the income spectrum, you&#x27;d miss the growth of surplus labor. Only 25% of people in the US have an undergraduate degree or higher, and of the people that don&#x27;t, labor participation is only around 49%. So seeing limited gains in the people who still have jobs isn&#x27;t that shocking. Whatever general idea of &quot;inequality&quot; this shallow report is meant to convey isn&#x27;t particularly instructive. Enough data is available to make more interesting analyses.<p>*edited for clarity')
