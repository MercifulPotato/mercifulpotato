Sure, he generously gave it away as well, but that was after he&#x27;d done the work to benefit _himself_.<p>Same with Larry Wall and Perl. He wrote the language he wanted, and shared it afterwards. He didn&#x27;t write it out of generosity (and to be fair, he is 100% the sort of person who might have).<p>I think the dual license strategy Larry chose for Perl really shines light on his motivations, &quot;use GPL if you want to, use the enormously more permissive Artistic License if you want to&quot;. He just wanted anybody who might find his software useful for any reason at all (including becoming insanely rich, if they could work out how to do so) to be able to use Perl.')
