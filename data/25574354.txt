It’s hypocrisy up and down the ideology.<p>Is privacy and anonymity important? Well yes it is! We don’t want draconian measures like universal background checks for gun sales. That would be an invasion of privacy. But wait, we can’t have people wearing masks, that increases <i>crime</i> by <i>liberals</i>! You can’t just walk down the street and be anonymous!<p>Is pollution important? Not when it comes to ensuring that <i>the economy</i> keeps going and that American business can operate. We need to get rid of the job-killing environmental regulations! We need more coal to help the miners in Pennsylvania and West Virginia! But wait! No no, masks are wasteful, that would harm the environment!<p>Conformity is okay too! Don’t speak any English? Get out of America! Don’t like saying <i>Merry Christmas?</i> Maybe try a different country. How dare you take Under God out of our pledge of <i>allegiance</i> or stop reciting it entirely! By the way, Trump is right about everything, full stop. BUT WAIT wearing a mask is conformity!!! That’s bad!!<p>The truth is that people like you don’t actually know why you don’t like masks. You can’t explain it because it doesn’t make any sense, it’s just something that your god-leader Trump doesn’t like because he doesn’t like the way he looks in a mirror when he’s wearing one.')
