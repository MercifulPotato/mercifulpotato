It’s hypocrisy up and down the ideology.<p>Is privacy and anonymity important? Well yes it is! We don’t want draconian measures like universal background checks for gun sales. That would be an invasion of privacy. But wait, we can’t have people wearing masks, that increases <i>crime</i> by <i>liberals</i>! You can’t just walk down the street and be anonymous!<p>Is pollution important? Not when it comes to ensuring that <i>the economy</i> keeps going and that American business can operate. We need to get rid of the job-killing environmental regulations! We need more coal to help the miners in Pennsylvania and West Virginia! Did you know that windmills cause cancer? But wait! No no, masks are wasteful, that would harm the environment!<p>Conformity is okay too! Don’t speak any English? Get out of America! Don’t like saying <i>Merry Christmas?</i> Maybe try a different country. How dare you take Under God out of our pledge of <i>allegiance</i> or stop reciting it entirely! By the way, Trump is right about everything, full stop. BUT WAIT wearing a mask is conformity!!! That’s bad!!<p>Rebellion? That’s really good! Let’s hang up a confederate flag and be proud of our rebellious nature. Only American patriots are able to rebel against the British Empire. Let’s literally make a Republican Party faction called the Tea Party, in honor of the <i>destruction of property</i> (riots) against our oppressors. We’ve got our second amendment to prevent against government oppression. BUT WAIT!! You can’t let Antifa or BLM or anyone anyone not-white rebel! Thin blue line, support our troops, blue lives matter. How dare anyone question our great police!<p>The truth is that people like you don’t actually know why you don’t like masks. You can’t explain it because it doesn’t make any sense, it’s literally just selfishness, paranoia, and meaningless contrarianism. Wearing a mask is supposed to be some kind of big deal compared to showing your ID with all of your personal information on it to buy a beer, or getting your nude body scanned at the airport, or letting your employer see your financial and criminal history. But no, it’s the piece of cloth over <i>temporarily</i> over your face that’s invasive.')
