Luckily they started on it before they even knew whether there would be a big payoff.  Otherwise we wouldn&#x27;t have either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine.<p>I&#x27;m generally against pharmaceutical companies charging ridiculous prices for their drugs, but we&#x27;ve benefited from the fact that they use this money to pursue risky research opportunities.  If the chance at a big payoff wasn&#x27;t there, big pharma might not have had this in the hopper.  Government funding alone probably can&#x27;t incentivize pharma to continue pursuing long-shot bets at their current level.  Now I have to think about which option I would prefer- cheaper prescriptions or a better chance at being prepared for catastrophic events.')
