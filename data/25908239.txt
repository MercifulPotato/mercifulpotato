With a high quality camera for see-through functionality. Used as a HUD for, well, anything. Reading web pages, Google Maps, Google Search and Assistant, notes, schedule, how to instructions, etc.<p>Definitely a very niche product (then again, so was Google Glass), but I would love to make one haha. Best thing is, anyone could build it using easily available components and software. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;relativty&#x2F;Relativty" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;relativty&#x2F;Relativty</a> was my inspiration, I see no reason why that wouldn&#x27;t work in non-3D on a single display.<p>Anyone have any thoughts?<p>(Also, if you want to build it, hire me, I would work on this 12hrs&#x2F;day for ramen money heh)')
