But some people trying all protein diets do report diarrhea. Doctors don&#x27;t generally refer to it as too much protein, though. They refer to the problem as too little fiber.<p>Also, some arctic explorers tried living on all meat, and suffered vitamin deficiencies such as scurvy. So, while meat is a complete protein, unless you are eating fresh liver meat from a fresh kill, you are going to need some source of vitamin C at the minimum.
