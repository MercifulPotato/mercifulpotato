Keep it in context about the particular situation at hand.<p>That said, in general, I think it can be frightening and traumatic to some people to see angry people destroying things. I know it would be for a kid seeing an angry drunk parent destroy their tablet they play games on, even if it&#x27;s just a machine. This isn&#x27;t the same as that, but just trying to say, we should try to understand that certain violent (or whatever you&#x27;d like to call destructive) actions will frighten some people.')
