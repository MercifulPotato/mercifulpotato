Item(by='davee5', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602866573, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24802408, text='&quot;Pilgrim at Tinker Creek&quot; is her signature book and for many (myself included) a spiritual experience to read.<p>&quot;The Writing Life&quot; is the best book about the process of creating that I have ever read, and I often suggest it to my design teams.  (Designers like to read books about design, but you don&#x27;t hire designers because they&#x27;re good at words. You want to read about creating?  Read books by writers.)<p>One of my favorite excerpts from The Writing Life:<p>&gt; A well-known writer got collared by a university student who asked, “Do you think I could be a writer?”\n“Well,&quot; the writer said, “I don’t know... Do you like sentences?&quot;\nThe writer could see the student’s amazement. Sentences? Do I like sentences? I am 20 years old and do I like sentences? If he had liked sentences, of course, he could begin, like a joyful painter I knew. I asked him how he came to be a painter. He said, “I liked the smell of the paint.&quot;')
