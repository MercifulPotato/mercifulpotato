Item(by='PaulDavisThe1st', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601999596, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24697971, text='&gt;There are a lot of angry young people in this generation who felt lied to about their job prospects, or careers. They were told the mark of an adult was someone who can move out of the parentâ€™s basement abd support yourself. Yet unless you can get an entry level job at least $60k a year in the US, you are already swimming against the current. A college degree is no guarantee of success.<p>I understand this anger, and I have 3 young people as my own kids who feel this to varying degrees.<p>But ...<p>Until about a year ago, the median household income in the USA was about $56k&#x2F;yr. That means that a substantial chunk of the country has &quot;moved out the parent&#x27;s basement and supports themselves&quot; on less than $60k&#x2F;yr.<p>The problem as I see it is that the basics of &quot;moving out of  the basement&quot; got confused with &quot;being able to live in the most expensive real estate markets in the world&quot;, presumably because they also just happen to be really cool places to live and have lots of economic opportunity. The conflation of these two is therefore understandable, and is a reflection of our failure as a nation and as a society to ensure the economic opportunity and high quality of living are widely distributed (in terms of both demographics and geography). Our culture has also lied to our young people about what life for most people looks like. Movies, shows, social media filled with impressions not just edited but only representative (!) of the lives of the most priviledged people in society. A massively expanded set of components of the concept of what &quot;middle class&quot; means.<p>The basics remain however: if you&#x27;re just starting out in your working career, then the most expensive real estate in the US is off-limits to you unless you&#x27;ve gone into a line of work with outsize income. That still leaves most of the country available and very-to-somewhat affordable, albeit with reduced opportunities for satisfying or very renumerative work. But also much better chances of a much larger garden in which to try out permaculture !')
