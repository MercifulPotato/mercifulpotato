You gotta have it.’ It’s “so what do you want to do mostly?” — no one knows.<p>That is what I believe the 90s curse really means — your evangelists are no longer as effective because they give potential customers an overwhelming amount of information that slows down, and sometimes prevents, a sale.<p>—- Your point is exactly right - Apple has decided to harvest the demand curve over making something undeniably great.<p>Edit: let me clarify, watch and homepod mini are currently in the category of &#x27;just get it&#x27; products. This is only a critique of the iPhone line.')
