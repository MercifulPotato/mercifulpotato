In fact, I&#x27;d argue it you had to reelect any one seat of power in the event of a failed impeachment, it should be the senate <i>above</i> the president or house.<p>I mean, it&#x27;s never going to happen due to constitutional constraints, but really the very existence of the senate is rather problematic, because it&#x27;s elections are so very different from those of the house+presidency; the votes are very much non-proportional.<p>And while non-proportionality is not in and of itself really all that bad - I mean, it&#x27;s bad in that it&#x27;s so <i>visibly</i> unfair that it slightly undermines the point of democracy (it makes it look a little hypocritical), but the actual impact of said unfairness (as opposed to perception thereof) isn&#x27;t really all that problematic; many things in the world aren&#x27;t 100% fair.<p>No, the real problem isn&#x27;t the non-proportionality, it&#x27;s the gridlock that arises from having so very different electoral systems. That gridlock exacerbates issues with partisanship, because it makes it attractive to play brinkmanship games; and of course gridlock isn&#x27;t harmless anyhow.  The system would be more stable if house, senate and presidency had similar elector biases; regardless of fairness.<p>Really though, parliamentary systems are in this regard simply better. Having the equivalent of the president serve at the mercy of parliament doesn&#x27;t make the job at all irrelevant (just look at other democracies), but it does put to bed nonsense like failed impeachments - because it&#x27;s not about crimes, even in the US; it&#x27;s simply about political support - and it should be clear whether the president has it, or not - and the current system is almost designed to turn it into a nasty political battle that&#x27;s simply divisive.<p>The only situation in which impeachment in the current system is <i>not</i> divisive is when house, senate <i>and</i> president are in the same parties hands - and hey, that&#x27;s basically a parliamentary system right there!')
