The app store may or may not choose to remove other apps, but it&#x27;s unlikely that it can be forced to just because they removed one particular app.<p>The difference is that Parler was conspicuous in promoting an obvious threat. It was aimed specifically at users who had already been kicked off other platforms for promoting misinformation which, if taken seriously, could only be seen as a call for violence. That same misinformation was being promoted at the highest levels. That&#x27;s a very clear line that nobody else has yet crossed.<p>That doesn&#x27;t resolve what to do about apps that have crossed some other lines and should probably come in for scrutiny. Probably by law enforcement -- the real problem here is that crimes have been ignored, and app stores don&#x27;t want to take the blame for it. The app stores also ignore it until it becomes un-ignorable -- a line that becomes clear only after threats of violence become acts of violence.<p>It won&#x27;t be resolved by a lawsuit that lacks standing. That can of worms will almost certainly be shut.')
