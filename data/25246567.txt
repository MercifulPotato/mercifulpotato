Contemplating it but a little hesitant since the expectation will be very high in a new job. (I am in 40&#x27;s) . Interestingly, last week one of my old friends called me all of a sudden. He is the co founder and CEO of a funded startup. He wanted to hire me without any interview. I dont think I will join. But gives some comfort. I thought there were no takers for 40+ guys.')
