By halting it completely they caused a panic which caused lots of people to sell.<p>Why didn&#x27;t they halt or restrict buying of any other stocks? Why only the meme stocks? It should have affected their financial responsibilities to the clearinghouse the same ways, no?<p>Why did they give no warning and explanation for what was about to come? The abruptness of it was obviously going to contribute to the panic.<p>The standard expiration date for meme stock options was the day after they halted buying. This caused their own customers holding those contracts to lose money. Why did they claim they were doing this &quot;to protect their customers&quot; when it was their customers who got screwed by this?')
