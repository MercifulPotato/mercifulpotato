Free speech in Germany (and, for that matter, most of Europe), does not exist.<p>There is a great article in The Atlantic about this, titled &quot;In Europe, Speech Is an Alienable Right&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;ideas&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;its-not-free-speech-criticize-muhammad-echr-ruled&#x2F;574174&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;ideas&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;its-not-fr...</a>.<p>The European Court of Human Rights ruled that:<p>&gt; <i>&gt; By accusing Muhammad of paedophilia, [E.S.] had merely sought to defame him, without providing evidence that his primary sexual interest in Aisha had been her not yet having reached puberty or that his other wives or concubines had been similarly young.

(Am I alone in finding the Austrian court’s reasoning offensive?</i><p>Just look at a map of blasphemy laws in Europe (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Blasphemy_law" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Blasphemy_law</a>). Germany is on par with Yemen, Oman, Turkey, Indonesia, Myanmar... This is not a good thing to have in common with those countries.<p>I maintain that the government should never hold the right of censure. It <i>is</i> a slippery slope. Given the ECHR rules, it&#x27;s quite possible criticism of Islam will be fully illegal in the next 10 years. This is dangerous.')
