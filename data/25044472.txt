Here an example: \nI never did real Emacs hacking, but I learned some Lisp\nstuff over the years, a bit of Clojure, Racket,\nand Common Lisp each. Now, I have a very experienced\nsenior coworker which was asking for help -\nthere was a feature which was just not working\nfor his flow, he had tried to configure it but\nwithout success. Now, I looked into the\nEmacs library code and that was a pleasant\nexperience, it is very transparent and readable\nand easy to modify, so that it was not difficult\nto adapt it to my coworkers&#x27;s needs.<p>The extensibility also means that, because there are\nmany many people hacking on Emacs, that it stays very\nup-to-date. For example, Magit which is, I\nthink, the best git front-end in existence. Or there is\nranger mode, (ranger is a console file manger). In this\nsense, Emacs is not &quot;antiquated&quot;, as the blog article\ninsinuates, but it is much more recent and modern than\nany IDE. Take, as an example, git support: It took\nVisual Studio about fifteen years to add git support,\nin part obviously because the vendor company did not\nthink supporting git was helpful to the companies\nobjectives. In comparison to that, Emacs picked up\nversion control options such as subversion or git\nalmost immediately. As a result, Visual Studio users\nwere left for fifteen years without support for the\nperhaps most important technical advance in\nprogramming. You may now argue, that the &quot;modern&quot; IDEs\nof course do have support for git, but there are surely\nother things which will be missing, just because it\ndoes not fit some companies narrative or marketing\nstrategy. Another brewing revolution is that\nprogramming culture is drifting away from C++ and Java,\nin parts even from OOP, which is not any more the best\noption for every case, and companies which are\ninvested in these &quot;technologies&quot; (uh, what a word),\nwill again try to stop the clock, in order to squeeze a\nbit more money out of it.')
