In more nefarious outcomes, it means a delayed software version release and, potentially, damaged UAV hardware at our test site.<p>For my previous project, merging bad code could have resulted in someone losing control of a fully drive by wire car in a closed parking lot or test track. That&#x27;s what big red buttons are for!<p>For my project before that, some of my code was involved in handling literally every single sensor and actuator on a rocket and the space capsule on top of it. A subtle bug that slipped through to production could have been rather serious indeed.')
