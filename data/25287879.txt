It seems unbelievable, and is possibly one of the most ridiculous things about this whole story.<p>Presumably as part of the update, this optional feature has become standard?<p>I&#x27;d also like to see a list of all the airlines that chose not to spec the additional sensor in their initial order of the aircraft. It probably says a lot about their safety culture.')
