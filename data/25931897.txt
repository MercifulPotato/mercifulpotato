The reason lawyers exist is that all contracts have ambiguity and require a human to review and consider. All contracts have circumstances that aren&#x27;t captured. Just ask the DAO folks.<p>Middlemen exist for a reason. Efficiency, conflict and ambiguity resolution, and so on.<p>Blockchains are only useful for things that are entirely captured within the blockchain. As soon as you interface the blockchain with the outside world you have to trust something to enter and capture that data accurately - garbage in, garbage out. Once you&#x27;re trusting someone, you don&#x27;t need a blockchain, just fire up and RDS instance and save everyone the headache.')
