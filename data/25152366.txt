I actually have a use-case for something like this. I&#x27;m re-partitioning my ZFS array, adding some space, and need to host all of the data for a few months while I get it all setup and tested, but the bandwidth cost at $5&#x2F;TB is prohibitive.<p>What&#x27;s the best place to do this? I&#x27;m using google drive, but they throttle your upload quite significantly. I can see right now I&#x27;m getting about ~150kB&#x2F;sec even though I have a 1GB upload speed.')
