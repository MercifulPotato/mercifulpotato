Canadians don&#x27;t use electric kettles either and they like their tea! When I lived in Canada everyone seemed to have a stovetop whistling kettle.<p>Looking at my Australian-designed Chinese-built UK kettle, it&#x27;s rated at &quot;2760-3000W&quot;, which is <i>far</i> more than can be drawn from a standard US 120V outlet.')
