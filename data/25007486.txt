After all, it&#x27;s your own digital world and you should feel you have total freedom to build it in whatever way suits you. Don&#x27;t feel you have to conform to the conventions on your own private space.<p>As for bouncing people: if the content comes from the right type of a person, I&#x27;m willing to jump through some hoops to explore what they have to say. Not everyone does, but to me, the content is its own reward for persistence. Unique, personal spaces that someone chose to share fascinate me, so I like to have a look around when I discover one, just to see what they are like.<p>Having this fully downloadable for offline use and interaction is also brilliant. I want to be able to work with everything I have even when offline for extended periods of time, so this is also an aspect I value for whatever solution I use.')
