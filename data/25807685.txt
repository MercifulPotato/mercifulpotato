The Hindi news media is strongly insulated from western media due to language differences. This affords them a certain independence and humility that the English wing seems to lack. Their fates are more directly coupled to India and its concerns. Eloquence and virtue signalling don&#x27;t matter as much. They NEED to have a better finger on the country&#x27;s pulse than English media. Lastly, the hindi and regional language press is distributed. There is no geographical power center and there are too many outlets. Thus, it cannot be controlled in entirety.<p>The Indian English news media is consumed by an incredibly small fraction of the population. Nepotism is rampant and tiny cliques determine your fate. While Hindi media affects politics, English media affects global outlook and economics. They wield a disportionate power for their size and this power is lent to them because the West reads these outlets.<p>This made it the one that was most important &amp; possible to control. The Indian English press rose in the era of Congress domination. These select few journalists, all owe their fates and meteoric rise to currying favor with the Gandhis and the bias shows. There is also a strong faux-left bias (Vox esque) but I would not blame them for it if they were transparent about it. Their 30 year track record on the Gandhi Family, Anything Hinduism related and Communists is proof of it. It is no surprise that Narendra Modi had a US visa ban, but terrorists and genociders from India and around the world never were.<p>These people live their lives out of Luthyens Delhi, completely out of touch with India. Their bad takes are never scrutinized, because the West and hyper-urban Indians have no idea what the rest of India looks like. Lastly, there is an offensive level of Elitism and need to associate with the Elites (NYT, WaPo, UN, Diplomats and the Glitterati) that is completely absent from Hindi media. This debacle epitomizes it.<p>Their opinions appear to be handed down from NYT and college campuses. They never bite the hand that feeds them and worst of all, they like to act smart while making lazy commentary.<p>Recently,I have been digging what ThePrint and Caravan magazine have been producing. Both are run on subscription models (yay) and take journalistic values seriously. Even when I disagree with them, I get something useful out of it.<p>TL;DR: Old Indian English Media is like MSNBC, Vox &amp; CNN, but shallower, more elitist and nepotistic.')
