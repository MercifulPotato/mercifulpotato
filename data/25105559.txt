Maybe Venus? Was it derived from DNA developed on the Moon?<p>What does make Earth just right for you to have developed in order to be aware, gain such knowledge, share such knowledge?<p>Untold eons of carefully controlled radiant energy emitted by our blessed Sun.<p>The Sun and its ilk are massive emitters of radiant energy. Light is a form of radiation. Heat is a form of radiation. The universe is full of lifeless rocks either burnt by the sun or left out in the cold. In fact, all the ones we know of exist in this state except this one.<p>I am not advocating some  “mystical radiation balance with nature” so much as pointing out that “life” (as we know it) is playing the long game on controlling radiant energy doses. When we muck about with that by playing our dumb little short game without consideration for the consequences we invite disaster upon ourselves. All of this discussion about global warming is pointless if we leave large swathes of the planet uninhabitable by humans.')
