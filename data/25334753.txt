There&#x27;s nothing about a unified memory architecture that requires the GPU and CPU to be on the same die, let alone requires the RAM to be in the same package as both processing units. (People may no longer remember that Silicon Graphics was using UMA in their workstations a quarter century ago!) I expect all their portables, and probably all the iMacs to be SoCs, but I&#x27;m not sure the Mac Pro -- and the iMac Pro, if it continues -- will follow that path.<p>&gt; We are back to TrashCan Mac Pro again... we would have reached the thermal ceiling again...<p>This is kind of drawing new lines to read between. :)<p>Apple almost certainly developed their current uber-expensive, trypophobia-triggering Mac Pro design <i>knowing</i> that they were also working on Apple Silicon processors. While it&#x27;s possible they intend that whole case design to be a one-time thing, it doesn&#x27;t seem likely to me -- and if that wasn&#x27;t the intent, then it&#x27;s also not likely they want to ship a teeny tiny Apple Silicon logic board in that huge case with the rest of the space going unused. I think they&#x27;re going to do their best to make an Apple Silicon-based Mac Pro that can be upgraded and expanded. (With all respect to Mark Gurman, I think that &quot;half-sized Mac Pro&quot; is going to be a different product entirely if it ships, with a different branding. Mac Mini Pro?)')
