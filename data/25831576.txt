Take that list in question:<p>- Taskmaster: Channel 4 (originally Dave. In fact before that it was a Edinburgh Fringe Festival show written by &quot;little&quot; Alex Horne)<p>- Would I Lie To You: BBC<p>- 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown: Channel 4 (interestingly it&#x27;s a spin off of &quot;8 out of 10 Cats&quot; which was C4&#x27;s sort of version of &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot; but C4 did an anniversary series of one off comedies one year, including bringing back &quot;15 to 1&quot; and a few other quiz shows from the channels early years. The &quot;8 out of 10 cats does countdown&quot; show was &quot;Countdown&quot; with the cast of &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats&quot; (hence the name) and proved so popular it became it&#x27;s own show).<p>As for the classics in that list. While most were BBC, it&#x27;s also fair to say most wouldn&#x27;t have been the same low budget as Taskmaster et al.')
