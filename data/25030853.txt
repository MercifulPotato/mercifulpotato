Instead I was able to get the population of the counties, so this is the number of votes divided by the population.&quot;<p>Isn&#x27;t this quite inaccurate? I think counties release registered voter numbers, so shouldn&#x27;t we be instead comparing registered turnout, as votes&#x2F;registered voters? (yes, some states do allow same-day registration, which might muck up numbers, but I still think its better than just going off population). But anyways, where do the population numbers come from? I imagine they&#x27;re from the last census, which was in 2010.<p>edit: yes, they are using the census yearly estimates. I suppose that&#x27;s as accurate as you can get, but its still not a true turnout statistic.')
