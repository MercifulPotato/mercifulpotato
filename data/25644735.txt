Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=[25646667], score=None, time=1609848835, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25644527, text='&gt; Analogies are simply tools to facilitate discussion, they can&#x27;t themselves say anything definitive about the underlying claim. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s useful to interpret them generously. If I came up with a flawed analogy for time dilation would that show that time dilation is nonsense?<p>That&#x27;s a bizarre attitude. Thought experiments were a major and important tool in developing the theory of relativity, precisely because they were taken seriously and done rigorously; contradictions weren&#x27;t waved away as &quot;just a tool to facilitate discussion&quot;.<p>&gt; I think a better approach on encountering a flawed analogy is to attempt to improve it, come up with a better one, or address the underlying claim directly, but saying &quot;this analogy is unclear to me the end&quot; isn&#x27;t going to get you very far in life.<p>On the contrary, being willing to call out nonsense has served me very well. There is no &quot;underlying claim&quot; here; the story is what&#x27;s meant to carry the claim, and if the story doesn&#x27;t work (and it doesn&#x27;t) the whole thing falls apart (and it does). It&#x27;s nonsense, top-to-bottom.')
