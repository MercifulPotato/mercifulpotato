It&#x27;s probably more power hungry, but I don&#x27;t think desktop PCs use inherently more power per instruction executed or whatever arcane metric we&#x27;d be measuring. Modern desktops can clock up and down just as quick as their more mobile counterparts, and due to proper cooling, the same chip you have in a laptop would be more efficient in a desktop enclosure - the cooler a chip is, the more efficient it can be - higher temperatures necessitate more power to move a charge across a conduit.')
