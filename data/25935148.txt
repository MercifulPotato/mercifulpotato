People like Shkreli make bad choices not because they like to be bad, but because they&#x27;re indifferent to the indirect consequences of their choices. I&#x27;m extremely skeptical that someone in a position like Shkreli was would be in any serious risk of losing access to essentials like food and shelter if they were to behave more ethically, so I think it&#x27;s important to set the standard that choosing a job like that when you have alternatives is wrong.<p>All that being said, I do agree with you that the primary problem by far is the exploitative structure that enables these people to exist in these positions, in the first place. If someone&#x27;s analysis of the situation ended at Shkreli, I&#x27;d encourage them to think deeper. However, I do strongly believe that we don&#x27;t have to choose between one or the other -- encouraging others to look down on those who choose to be a part of this system can have a significant influence by discouraging others from entering it, themselves. The more voices we have saying &quot;this is not something to aspire to,&quot; the more pressure we can build to effect meaningful systemic change.')
