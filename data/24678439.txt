And one of the modern tools for today’s firefighter MUST be clear-burning and control-burns.<p>But do modern folks know this? Noooo, it’s just a pearl-clutching, collective-gasp that their poorly-trained notion expect firefighters not to start fires and ONLY to stop fires.<p>Me think firefighting unit and forestry management needs to be a bit more cohesive either in principle or practice.')
