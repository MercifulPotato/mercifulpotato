I&#x27;ll be going, come hell or high water [and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be the only one]. If I get stopped by the police and turned back, I&#x27;ll just try another route.<p>A government that; sent millions of school kids back to classes, dispersed hundreds of thousands of students all over the country to start second waves in most of the university towns, bribed people to go out for meals in restaurants, opened pubs to allow crowds of drunks to mingle on the streets, allowed people to go on foreign holidays ---because all of those were somehow &quot;essential&quot;-- while, at the same time banning people from visiting dying relatives in hospital and preventing families from attending loved ones&#x27; funerals, has completely lost the moral authority to give me any instruction on where I can and can&#x27;t go and who I can or can&#x27;t visit.')
