(Easy in the &quot;for people on HN&quot; sense, not easy in the &quot;my mom would do this&quot; sense.) Only caveat is that you need to leave OBS running in the background doing its thing whenever you need your microphone.<p>(Instructions for Windows. The OBS stuff would be the same, you&#x27;ll just need to figure out your own solution for virtual audio devices.)<p>1. You&#x27;ll need a virtual audio device. So grab Virtual Audio Cable[1] or VB-Audio Cable[2]. Both have a free version that let you set up a single device.<p>2. In OBS, add your microphone as an &quot;Audio Input Capture&quot;. Right click on it, select Filters, and add a &quot;Noise Suppression&quot;. (For future playing, you may want to come back here and add a &quot;Noise Gate&quot; as well. Basically &quot;if the audio is too quiet, mute the input completely.)<p>3. Now go to File -&gt; Settings, Audio, and under &quot;Advanced&quot; select the virtual audio cable as your monitoring device. Hit OK.<p>4. In the Audio Mixer panel at the bottom middle of your window, select any of the gear icons and hit &quot;Advanced Audio Properties&quot;. In the row for your microphone input, change &quot;Audio Monitoring&quot; to &quot;Monitor and Output&quot;.<p>5. You should now be getting your de-noised&#x2F;gated&#x2F;etc microphone coming in to the virtual audio device. Now in your voice chat program, just change the microphone input to the virtual audio device.<p>I&#x27;ve got a relatively quiet workspace, but I still live with three people and two dogs so the ambient noise is there. This cuts most of my dog&#x27;s sounds (even if she&#x27;s playing and creating a ruckus), ambient noise from people upstairs, my keyboard, etc. I&#x27;m stuck in meetings a good chunk of my day so I try to avoid having to wear headphones (just gets tiresome), and the noise gating and some strategic microphone positioning works perfect for keeping the meeting audio from my speakers from feeding back in. (Along with having all the meeting audio running through a very aggressive compressor to normalize everyone&#x27;s volume into a very tight range.)<p>OBS also includes a virtual camera option, so I use that to crop out a tighter shot from my fairly wide angle camera so people can&#x27;t see as much of the mess around the room and do some colour adjustment because it&#x27;s a cheap camera and looks kinda garbage otherwise.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vac.muzychenko.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vac.muzychenko.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vb-audio.com&#x2F;Cable&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vb-audio.com&#x2F;Cable&#x2F;</a>')
