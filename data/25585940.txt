I received two debit cards in the mail earlier this Summer to a previous address, one for the one CO uses to distribute unemployment benefits, one for an Internet-only bank based out of CA. I think the fraudster got my info from CO&#x27;s voter registration record, which is public by default. The address on there hasn&#x27;t been updated.<p>I had to fight the CA bank over the course of several weeks before they would close my account, and only after I had filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Pro tip: do this for any financial disputes; financial firms will be very responsive to your issues.<p>I also called the bank CO uses to distribute unemployment benefits and they were much more amenable to my request to close the account.<p>For CO&#x27;s part, the only link they provided on the CO Dept of Labor&#x27;s site to report fraud (a Google form) had language to basically say that I am reporting myself as the fraudster and I would be subject to perjury in filing the report. For obvious reasons, I didn&#x27;t fill it out. (It took them months to change the form.) I then called their main phone number and the only way I could talk to anyone was to schedule a callback 2-3 months later.<p>Ended up freezing all of my credit bureau accounts.<p>BTW, I don&#x27;t place this fault entirely on CO. It was a hectic and uncertain time and they were trying to distribute funds into people&#x27;s hands as quickly as possible. I don&#x27;t expect them to be able to change such a complicated process overnight, or even months. It&#x27;s a clear example of fraudsters being well ahead of regulators.')
