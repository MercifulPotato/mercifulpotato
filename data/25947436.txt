It&#x27;s not so symmetric.<p>One side was selling short because they believed (not unreasonably) that GameStop&#x27;s core business is in trouble and is likely to go bankrupt (or at least more likely to lose value than gain it).<p>The other side was buying long not because they believed GameStop was likely to reinvent itself, but only because they noticed a lot of funds had sold it short and saw a short squeeze coming. They wouldn&#x27;t have bought at the current stock price if the other guys hadn&#x27;t sold short.')
