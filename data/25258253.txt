The Mini is still the only non-ridiculously priced &quot;desktop&quot; that Apple offers.<p>But I think the OP was referring to the stagnation of the general desktop space, not Apple&#x27;s lineup specifically. As in, there&#x27;s almost no reason to upgrade your 2015 iMac to a 2020 iMac. It&#x27;ll have nearly the same CPU performance and nearly the same day-to-day experience. See also all the PC gamers who have been holding on to Intel CPUs from half a decade ago because there was just no point to upgrading. A 5 year old 6700K is still basically competitive with a &quot;modern&quot; 10600K.')
