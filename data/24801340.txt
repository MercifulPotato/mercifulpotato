Best attitude to this stuff I have experienced:<p>You have 8 hours to do your work in. If you need more than that then you&#x27;re either slacking off or incompetent. If you&#x27;ve been given more than 8 hours work to do then that&#x27;s a scheduling problem you need to take up with your manager.<p>Everyone worked their arses off all day, and at 5pm the entire office went to the pub to socialise. Some only stayed for a short time then went home. Others stayed on for hours. But staying in the office after 5pm was not acceptable.<p>As a developer, it was great. Interruptions were always pertinent, because all the socialising happened in the pub. I could code in peace for ~8 hours, which tbh is about my limit anyway, after that my quality goes downhill fast. And then we all hung out together. Being a developer who can&#x27;t do the social thing in work hours with losing massive time to context switching wasn&#x27;t a social handicap, for once.')
