The online revolution is already happening. Many schools are moving to copy the model.<p>I&#x27;ve been in OMSCS for almost 5 years now. I can assuredly say that remote university education works incredibly well. Even better than in person in many respects. Not only that, but I truly believe it is vital to ensuring equal access to high quality education.<p>The current university system with 5% acceptance rates, 40k &#x2F; year college fees, is untenable and just exacerbates class division.
