Item(by='brennen', descendants=None, kids=[24924033], score=None, time=1603911640, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24921793, text='We recently conducted an extensive evaluation of CI options[0], concluding at the time that GitLab could meet our needs but didn&#x27;t make a whole lot of practical sense unless we also migrated to it for code review.  Other considerations (Gerrit user experience and sustainability, onboarding costs, a de facto migration of many projects from our Gerrit instance to GitHub, etc.) led us to re-evaluate whether a migration for code review would make sense, and that&#x27;s what the decision linked here addresses.<p>I am on the team that maintains our existing CI system[1] (Zuul, Jenkins, JJB), though I mostly work on other things.  While this system is certainly quite <i>powerful</i>, I would not personally describe it as easy.  We have a lot of work in front of us in migrating it to GitLab, but so far I&#x27;ve found the experience there quite a bit more pleasant than grepping through JJB definitions and the like.<p>At any rate, if you&#x27;re interested in how all of this pans out, we will as ever be doing the work in a very public fashion.<p>[0]. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mediawiki.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikimedia_Release_Engineering_Team&#x2F;CI_Futures_WG" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mediawiki.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikimedia_Release_Engineering...</a><p>[1]. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mediawiki.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Continuous_integration" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mediawiki.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Continuous_integration</a>')
