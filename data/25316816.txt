She is a wonderful person. She is also a horrible driver, a threat to herself and others by virtue of natural impairments (vision, reaction time, etc.)<p>Taking away her license would make all roads safer, but it would also obliterate her quality of life. The actual need for driverless cars, to me, is a means of retaining her freedom of movement with a far lower level of endangerment.')
