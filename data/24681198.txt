Think of all the HTTP servers that save IP addresses in log files, or all the mail servers that save user messages, IP addresses, and what not. Think of all the other kinds of software that save &quot;personal data&quot;. Now think of the way companies backup this data. Do you think most companies out there have the infrastructure to automatically pull all information about a specific user from all of these sources? No way!!<p>Sure, a company the size of Activision-Blizzard can maybe pull it of, but the little guy has no practical way to be compliant. Not until GDPR compliance becomes a standard in server applications and backup solutions, and when is that going to happen? This is a serious problem that a few people among the elite have thrown at society without understanding the consequences, or caring about them.<p>And if you don&#x27;t comply? Well, then this law is just another set of mines in the minefield.')
