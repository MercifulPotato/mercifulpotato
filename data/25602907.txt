It does not work very well, so aliasing is a defining characteristic of the Amiga sound. Aliasing adds high frequency content that compensates for the low sample rates required by memory limitations, and extra harmonic complexity that compensates for the low channel count. I think Amiga modules sound worse if played by something with good anti-aliasing filters.')
