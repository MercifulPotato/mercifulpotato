If a manager ever says anything about them, I ask them what they think of my actual performance.  Then when they say they are happy with my performance, I suggest that they are looking at the wrong metrics. The few times that has failed i flatly tell them that I will not do anything to game the metrics, and I&#x27;m just going to keep doing my job as best as I can.  So far that has always kept them busy until I got a promotion, switched companies, or the short sighted manager got fired.')
