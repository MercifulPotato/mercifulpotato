Had a couple E-series before but right as the pandemic started I grabbed a used i5 X270. Swapped in a 1080 IPS screen, an SSD, and eventually 16GB of RAM so I&#x27;m at about $500 for a machine that can do everything I _need_. Charges with IBM chargers or USB-C. Has enough ports. Can run macOS in VirtualBox and I&#x27;ve even built iOS apps on it. Handles light gaming. Matte screen. Cheap enough that I&#x27;m not paranoid about damaging it.<p>Yeah the used market prices crept up, probably due to families buying up laptops for online school students, but you can still catch bargains.<p>Unfortunately much past the X280&#x2F;T480 generation and you stop being able to upgrade things yourself. It&#x27;s like I see in the used Mac Mini market where there are a ton of otherwise useful machines from 2014 but they&#x27;re crippled with 4GB of non-upgradable RAM.')
