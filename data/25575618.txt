This is very compelling argument to me, but I&#x27;ve heard other compelling arguments on the other side. These arguments tend to go like this:<p>1. Big tech has gone unchecked for a long time and it&#x27;s up to government and regulators to reign them in when it comes to privacy, offering sustainable compensation models for gig workers, limiting an increasing wage gap, and other inequities.<p>2. The rise of big tech has outpaced the city&#x2F;area&#x27;s ability to offer services at low costs. No other industry has seen such a quick rise and it&#x27;s no wonder prices (including houses) have climbed so much.<p>I live in San Francisco, and have been disappointed, annoyed, and frustrated at many of the issues this article brings up, including high housing prices, homelessness, property crime, but it seems like an easy out to simply blame the government, or the tech industry exclusively. My guess is there&#x27;s plenty of blame to go around and the answer might be more nuanced than finding a single scapegoat. What are people&#x27;s thoughts?')
