You&#x27;re confusing the engineering with the need.<p>No I&#x27;m not. Every &quot;need&quot; can be formalized into a specification.<p>&gt;Sure, people wrap up stupid or simple ideas in layers of abstraction, usually because they want to sell consulting.<p>So?<p>&gt;But this article was more about looking beyond the boundaries of simple software development, needing to understand the context of where these systems operate.<p>And I&#x27;m saying this article is just listing examples and making analogies. It doesn&#x27;t formally define what a system is and it doesn&#x27;t talk about any ways to use this theory to optimize a system nor does it try to define what optimize is. It&#x27;s just one out of a million articles that tries to talk about &quot;design&quot; and create an analogy or metaphor out of it while teaching the reader absolutely nothing new.<p>&gt;Essentially, your argument is proving the early part of the article, where the author is comparing how some juniors are excellent &quot;engineers&quot; but can&#x27;t move up to higher levels of abstraction, vs others that might not deal well with individual details, but have a better understanding of how the systems they develop need to interact with the rest of the world.<p>Yeah, I didn&#x27;t care for his argument, he&#x27;s free to make that analogy. Think what you want on how I &quot;proved&quot; it... The meaning of the metaphor itself is irrelevant to my topic, it&#x27;s the fact that the metaphor exists and basically introduces nothing new to the concept of design that is my part of my complaint.')
