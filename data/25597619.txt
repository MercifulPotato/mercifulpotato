But if you absolutely need to use an HDMI dongle and need good quality screen recording you&#x27;re better off getting a higher end dongle.<p>For less than $20 getting 1080p MJPEG at 30fps from an HDMI source is pretty good. The camera itself is likely recording video to MJPEG at its best quality settings and h.264 otherwise.')
