People that live in one situation don&#x27;t realize that people live in the other and how different it makes life. I&#x27;ve lived across the US and it has been vastly different.<p>I grew up in Southern California where one time my car broke down and my 20 minute commute (mostly highway) turned into a 2hr bus ride while my car was in the shop. Once I was an hour late to work because the bus came and went before it was scheduled for that stop. I&#x27;ve lived in a rural town in the south where no public transportation even existed. There wasn&#x27;t even a way for most people to walk into town because there weren&#x27;t even sidewalks. A few people biked, but it was pretty well known that if you weren&#x27;t on a $5k bike riding in the nice area of town you had a DUI and were riding your kid&#x27;s bike to get to work. I would have had to walk along a highway (a 30 minute walk) just to get to the store (I saw people doing this too). I&#x27;ve been in the Bay and NYC where busses have to wait at stops and there is light rail. Now I live in a city where I rarely drive my car and using my bike is easier to get around. These situations are very different and frankly I don&#x27;t think people understand this.<p>The problem is that most of the US doesn&#x27;t have infrastructure to relieve people of the choice between driving and being safe because they have to maintain their job. In many places there aren&#x27;t even enough population density to make this economically feasible (aka profitable or net even). Someone was mentioning that technology can&#x27;t solve this problem, but frankly this seems like the exact problem autonomous vehicles solve. Light rail is great, but it isn&#x27;t a practical technology for most of the country.')
