It raises costs, changes treatment decisions, and has generally warped our system towards one focused on lucrative, worse-outcome behavior on the part of doctors and hospitals. Much of this related to the putting off of preventative or early treatment due to OOP costs; people gamble that their conditions won&#x27;t worsen so that they won&#x27;t be forced to go into debt for treatment (if they can even access credit).
