Our first impression was &quot;it is written in Rust, so it should be extremely fast. Let&#x27;s run a quick test against VictoriaMetrics&quot;. Test results were unexpected :)<p>Later we received reply from Paul Dix, InfluxData CTO, that InfluxDB IOx is at early stages of development, so it isn&#x27;t ready for production and performance comparisons. We&#x27;ll keep an eye on InfluxDB IOx development and will run more comprehensive benchmarks against VictoriaMetrics later.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.influxdata.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;announcing-influxdb-iox&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.influxdata.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;announcing-influxdb-iox&#x2F;</a>')
