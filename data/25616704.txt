Use it or not.<p>FB can &#x27;have it&#x27;s cake and eat it&#x27;.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with using learned user behaviours to place some ads. There are reasonably narrow contexts in which privacy really isn&#x27;t invaded, there&#x27;s no harm really.<p>Where it &#x27;gets bad&#x27; is when they follow you across the internet (like Google does ...), or when they use &#x27;nasty algs&#x27; for interactivity (I don&#x27;t think this is as bad as it seems).<p>Google is reading all your email and knows every search you ever made, I find that far more invasive.<p>FB has overstepped their bounds but there&#x27;s no reason the can&#x27;t go back in.<p>As far as &#x27;anti trust&#x27; - it makes very little difference that FB owns WhatsApp and Insta. Break them up - very little will change.<p>The &#x27;anti trust&#x27; issue is almost entirely with Google and Apple.<p>Google uses their search to promote their own products over others, rips off content for their search summaries, and uses Chrome and Android as a kind of &#x27;market dumping&#x27; to ensure Search success.<p>Apple&#x27;s &#x27;App Store Only&#x27; rule for content distribution is questionable.')
