I do outdoor activities and it&#x27;s crowded everywhere, as usual if not more... flying to Red Rocks to climb in a week or two ;)<p>The pandemic made me really grateful that I live in America, in fact... the freedoms and the culture of liberty \n is, most of the time, just an abstraction for someone as privileged and non-prominent as myself, but then you compare the way lockdowns are handled to my native Russia, with draconian and sometimes bizarre enforcement, as well as the stories from Europe, NZ, Australia, etc., and you realize how important both are. I feel the US, even the blue states, are very different in part because the officials realize the enforcement against individuals would cause massive backlash, and not hold up well in court if it came to that. Too bad they have businesses by the balls, so not everything is opened.')
