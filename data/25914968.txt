The EU budget is tiny.<p>The choice of matters discussed at EU level is sadly due to the agenda of national states, for the major part; in a lot of cases it’s actually what they don’t feel brave enough to touch but still think “something should be done about”, so the EU provides plausible deniability. If you feel this is not to your likes, complain to your MEPs <i>and</i> your national MPs.<p>Personally I think some issues won’t be solved until we have <i>more</i> European authority rather than less; a bit like the US ended up moving most powers to the federal government during its first 150 years.')
