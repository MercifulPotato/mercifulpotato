Or is it status in the owner&#x27;s eyes?<p>From another direction, how would an average citizen C of your country size up another person D who&#x27;s bought BMW? Would C actually think significantly better of D?<p>I went to a school where there was a large mix of wealth, some kids were extremely well off, multi-millionaire parents, and bought new (expensive and high quality) clothes. Quite a few others bought from charity shops (often of necessity like me). Not once in the years I was there did I ever hear any reference to clothes, or any measure of a person related to their clothing. It was all down to the person you were and I don&#x27;t imagine our school was any special in that.<p>Is status in the eyes of self, or others?')
