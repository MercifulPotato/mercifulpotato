My sister and her family are already considering it. I&#x27;m pretty skeptical about the whole thing, being single, nearing 30, and having lived in a city (Chicago proper) for the entirety of my life. It seems like a good move, financially, though I know two people who say they hate Florida (one from Tampa who couldn&#x27;t wait to leave) and I can only guess that it&#x27;s as terrible as you say. Should I suck it up and move anyway? I&#x27;m already somewhat socially withdrawn and it would be good to be near my parents in their old age.')
