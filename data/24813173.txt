Spotify has a premium model but even for premium users, there was no way to insert any kind of delay or temporary pause in a playlist. These tracks were frequently inserted into playlists to make up for Spotify&#x27;s lack of a basic feature -- that&#x27;s why it got so many streams in the first place. There wasn&#x27;t any kind of fraud from the Artist, Spotify just got salty because they realized a an album like this would mean they have to pay for a feature in their own software.')
