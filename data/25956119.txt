But, if they are wrong, it would likely be because of a handful of things.<p>*All the below are hypothetical scenarios, I have no specific reason to suspect any of them will or won&#x27;t happen. This is not financial advice. Trade at your own risk.<p>1) Hedge funds may have been buying GME alongside WSB. Once the shorts stop out, the funds will know before WSB does. And get out ahead of them. The size of the position suggests this is a possibility.<p>2) GME management will announce an equity offering. This is arguably the economically&#x2F;financially correct thing to do. And is also aligned with management&#x27;s incentives. With more shares in the market, the shorts would no longer be squeezed.<p>3) GME has become too volatile to easily manage counter-party risk via daily margin posting. This makes options and cash equities much harder to transact. Which is what we saw yday. This could limit the ability of non-professionals to access the market. Killing the squeeze.<p>4) Robinhood could face solvency (or the perception thereof) issues. This could cause a rush to close out accounts while people still can. Generally, even having to deny you have a liquidity problem is a bad sign.<p>5) Some truly massive player or a group of them (Citadel and Melvin are only middle size fish) will come in and crush the longs. Gamma works in both directions.<p>6) The index funds that currently hold the stock will make an exception to their usual rules and sell it because the market is so clearly dislocated. Or alternatively the providers could kick out GME. This would again significantly reduce the squeeze.<p>7) The regulators will set the stock to liquidation only. The exchanges have the power to do this. And this is the sort of situation that said powers are contemplated for.<p>So there&#x27;s quite a bit that could potentially go wrong. And so a good chance that the squeeze participants could lose their investments. Part of the problem is that it isn&#x27;t clear just how large the short positions really are at this point. While I have zero sympathy for the hedge funds on the other end of this trade, if you live by the sword you die by the sword, the regulators may decide this presents a systemic issue. In which case they&#x27;re going to shut it down.')
