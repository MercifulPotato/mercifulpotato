UK English is notoriously indirect and passive-aggressive. When someone in a meeting says &quot;I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s a good idea&quot; they often mean &quot;That suggestion is literally idiotic.&quot;<p>This reminds me of how in Singaporean English you may often have hawker centre or restaurant service people ask you something like &quot;You want a drink or not?&quot;<p>In US or UK English that might be perceived as rude, especially the &quot;or not&quot; part, but in Singaporean English it is not rude at all, and is in fact just imported from the Chinese &quot;要不要&quot; grammatical construct, which literally translates to &quot;want-don&#x27;t-want&quot; and is a polite way to ask if someone wants something. In Chinese it is probably the most neutral and polite way to ask the question because you present both options (&quot;want&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t want&quot;) on equal footing for the other side to choose, and that idea is carried over to English in Singapore.')
