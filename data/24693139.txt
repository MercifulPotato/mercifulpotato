Every DE is an afterthought? Just the fact you call them &quot;Linux GUIs&quot; makes me question how much you have even used any DE with Linux.<p>I spend no time writing system config files. Drivers are part of the kernel, so I also spend zero time on that. Brand-new laptop hardware sometimes takes a while to get support, but it is really easy to check before you buy.<p>It is perfectly OK to prefer a padded, walled garden. Just like it is OK to prefer a modular OSS Linux environment where everything is knowable. Nobody needs to be &quot;right&quot;, and nobody needs to bash the other with unsubstantiated claims.')
