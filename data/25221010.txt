Alice assumes only Bob&#x27;s (secure) smartphone can read the data. Bob assumes only Alice&#x27;s (secure) smartphone can read the data. They both got physical access to the smartphone, which lowers the attack surface at that moment. Alice&#x27;s laptop is in her house. As is Mallory.<p>My problem with above isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> this works; it is <i>how</i> it works. My problem is that Alice never temporary authorizes WhatsApp Web. My problem is that Bob doesn&#x27;t know about Alice&#x27;s 2nd device. These 2 issues are issues which can be addressed and raise the privacy of the data considerably. The gut reaction &quot;oh, its E2EE, so its secure.&quot; is dangerous, and untrue.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m aware you can make screenshots and print chats. You can also send temporary messages with Signal though. That&#x27;s <i>on top of E2EE</i>, because E2EE isn&#x27;t a panacea.')
