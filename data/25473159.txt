Of those 4, only The Tempest is top-drawer Shakespeare although, to be honest, The Winter&#x27;s Tale is the only one of the other three I&#x27;ve actually read&#x2F;seen performed.<p>The Tempest--which is one of my favorites--was one of his very last plays and certainly his last great one; it&#x27;s hard not to see the ending, e.g. the breaking of the staff, as symbolic in a way that his other play conclusions were not.<p>&gt;his most widely regarded plays<p>I guess I agree.
