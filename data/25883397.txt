I&#x27;m the most senior engineer on the team, so am often reached out to for information, and I had to start enforcing some protocols for getting my attention. I&#x27;ve sent this exact link to multiple members of my team in response to a &quot;Hi&quot;, because getting distracted by the message and then having to wait for the actual question was causing me significant stress. It&#x27;s worked, and I strongly recommend it. It was probably a bit impolite to do, but I had to enforce boundaries for my own sake.<p>Incidentally, I think doing so has also helped a ton with people asking if they could call me. If they first have to state their question via text, it lets me triage whether this is an issue that needs a call or not. That was a much more significant benefit, because a voice chat is an even bigger breaker of flow than waiting for the question after a &quot;hi&quot;.')
