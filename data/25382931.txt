Trust that we are all in it together and are better of participating in it.<p>When people start to perceive that others are taking advantage of them, unfairly, the social structure starts to crumble. Even if that advantage is then used to your benefit, the perception of it matters most.<p>In times past we’ve been “fixing” this by shaping the perception, manipulating people into believing that whatever way of government is used is good for them. Then silencing any doubters. In the 21 century its becoming  harder to do that outright, because information is so readily available, so they have resorted to reducing its signal to noise ratio (fake news etc).<p>In any case, perception is key. If “the rich” (they) are treated better than “us”, and <i>they are not supposed to</i>, then you start having cracks in the fabric of society.<p>The appeal for something like wealth tax is not that it would make it better for everyone in the long run, but rather it would be perceived as more fair and lead to less discontent. Weather thats a good trade is up for debate though, you could always hire more cops to “enforce the peace”')
