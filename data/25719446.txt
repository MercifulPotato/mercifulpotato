It would be best for everyone if Twitter stopped policing things themselves and moved to a community driven model, nothing should be deleted but if the “incites violence” (or certain others) tag is added by enough people those tweets get broadcast to nobody and you’d have to look on Trump’s or whoever’s page to see it. Yes the gaming of this system would itself have to be policed, however I think on average it would be better than what we have now.<p>In the end Twitter have the power to ban Trump from their platform the same way a bar owner can ban people who they don’t like. Just because everyone thinks and feels Twitter is a public forum does not make it one; it is private property like virtually everything on the Internet.')
