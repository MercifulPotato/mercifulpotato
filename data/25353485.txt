They are driving the quality of delivery across all carriers down by hiring out to bottom of the barrel delivery agents who must cut every corner possible in order to finish their deliveries on time.<p>Before AMZL, packages were delivered to the door of my apartment building. After AMZL started dropping packages in the lobby, in the parking garage, and outside the front door of the building, it was only a matter of time before UPS and FedEx started to follow suit. Now all packages end up dumped in piles in unsecure areas of the building. Around this time of year, I&#x27;m digging through 15-20 packages to find things addressed to me.<p>The building installed some package lockers, but the Amazon people usually avoid them because it takes time to put stuff in.<p>I am about to stop shopping on Amazon so that I can stop supporting what they&#x27;ve done to shipping over the last few years. It&#x27;s unfortunate that one bad actor can degrade the overall quality of its competitors.')
