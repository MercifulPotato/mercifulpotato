If retail tenants vacated and the mallsâ€™ landlords defaulted on their mortgages, MP stood to make a killing.<p>Why should it be legal to make billions of dollars in profit off of the failure of something? How does that make economic sense? These guys walk off with a huge bag of cash, a bunch of investors that were trying to invest positively get screwed, the mall dies, and all that money and economic opportunity vanishes. The economy objectively gets poorer in that area, and the ramifications are widespread as areas start to become &#x27;food deserts&#x27; and so forth.<p>Are we _really_ to believe that the era of the physical marketplace, the Third Location where you can take your family and kill a rainy day, is really dead? Does nobody want this at all, anymore?<p>Is it possible that we&#x27;d already let the malls decay into places people didn&#x27;t want to be, through lax enforcement of any kind of social discipline that would make it a welcoming space, and this is just the death rattle of the mall from the same problem that will ultimately kill the city itself?<p>Or is it possible that this is robber-baron capitalism, exploiting anything it can find for profit, lobbying and changing laws to make it easier to vampirically suck the remaining wealth out of troubled areas?')
