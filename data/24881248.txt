That sounds like a system that needs subverting or circumventing. Perhaps management from other Non-profit organizations with a less market-driven culture can prove more fertile ground.<p>Recruit a new CEO from somewhere like the EFF&#x27;s management. Find someone willing to take a relatively middle class salary of $150K with good benefits, but who will gleefully use their newfound authority in efforts for Internet Freedom.<p>The node.js monoculture in browsers actually scares me. The code from chromium inside firefox (not just widevine) actually scares me. The spyware and &quot;pocket&quot; inside firefox actually scares me.<p>Give me leadership worth trusting, and I&#x27;ll happily follow. Give me leadership that understands the bottom-up nature of FLOSS software leadership, and finds creative ways to encourage it, rather than gatekeep independent developers out.<p>Give me leadership that isnt just another goddamned Russian Nail Factory tale, using &quot;independence&quot; as <i>branding</i> while they take money to set our default search engine to an abusive content scraper.<p>How will they make money? The VPN service is popular. The notes application <i>was</i> nice.<p>The premium services were&#x2F;are legit nice - and I want to hear about them from... Not the browser itself, aside from an update-page.<p>A firefox-branded adblock option? That keeps 1-in-10 ads, but replaces them with &quot;thank you&quot; notes and links to tutorials? That takes proactive lead on maintaining the effort to block ads, and subvert anti-adblock measures? And canvas fingerprinting subversion? All in a single, user-friendly but deeply-customizeable addon? I&#x27;d pay money for that, especially if it comes with the mullvad&#x2F;wireguard VPN using a simplified frontend.<p>I&#x27;d love to see the firefox VPN have an experimental double-hop option (mullvad does this stable-ly already) where the entry-point is automatically securely-selected. And has a few white-noise features for use with wifi (and user-selectable on cell-data) to obifuscate against traffic correlation analysis.<p>There is <i>sooo</i> much potential in the firefox organization. But to see is squandered this way? Is heartbreaking.')
