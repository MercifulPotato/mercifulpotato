The RIAA notice at issue here was based on 1201, for <i>tools</i> used to circumvent copyright, and so it&#x27;s not necessary to disclose the works being violated.<p>From a formatting perspective, format is generally irrelevant to notices like this because the law does not state a particular format must be used.
