Most desirable single men and women are not online dating. My only brush with online dating was installing Tinder many years ago. The first girl it showed me wasn&#x27;t very attractive, but I wasn&#x27;t going to judge her (&quot;swipe&quot;), you know? Uninstalled it, felt like when you wander into one of those grimy &quot;meet-market&quot; bars. If you already turn down advances from average-looking people IRL, why would you create an account to do that online? I think attractive women feel the same, there are already enough real-world opportunities. None of the girls I&#x27;ve dated have even considered online dating.')
