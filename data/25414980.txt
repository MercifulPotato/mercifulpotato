There&#x27;s the oft-mentioned error handling, &quot;type&quot; system and modules.<p>However, more closely related to the OP, has anyone else struggled with the organization of even medium-sized systems?  Obviously some people manage, but I don&#x27;t know how.<p>I used to do Go a lot more than I do now, but I think I&#x27;ve narrowed it down to (a) it&#x27;s simplistic (boolean) visibility capabilities (b) lack of overloading and (c) lack of static functions.<p>Instead of `User::new()` and `Role::new()`, you end up with `newUserWithPassword` and `NewRole`. You can do a package per module - but that doesn&#x27;t solve the issue with overloading, and you can get into cyclical imports. You can solve overloading with a config objects, but now it feels like you&#x27;re back to over-abstracting.')
