He notes that Pascal uses ^, but it seems like @ might be a better choice:<p><pre><code>    int foo         &#x2F;&#x2F; an integer\n    int foo@        &#x2F;&#x2F; pointer to int\n    int foo[10]@    &#x2F;&#x2F; 10 pointers\n    int foo@[10]    &#x2F;&#x2F; pointer to array\n    int foo()[10]@  &#x2F;&#x2F; function that returns an array of 10 pointers\n</code></pre>\nIn my opinion, they <i>almost</i> fixed it and then punted.  As such, it&#x27;s just different, but not really better.')
