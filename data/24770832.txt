In the 1970s there was an average of 2.48 births per woman, and today it&#x27;s 1.77. My unsubstantiated opinion is that folks were willing to make do with less in the past, and again, city councils have forbidden building smaller buildings forcing the real costs up -- not through $&#x2F;sqft but rather mandatory minimum sqft if you will.')
