Because if it&#x27;s not rough, then it&#x27;s too obvious, and if it&#x27;s too obvious, there&#x27;s no real upside opportunity. You can plan for Chance III and prepare yourself for this.<p>Chance IV is black swan. It is the rarest of conditions where an eccentric hobby results in significant upside. You can&#x27;t plan for this, and if you do pursue an eccentric hobby you should do it out of pure personal interest rather than planning for a black swan upside opportunity.<p>I have a feeling Marc Andreesen would consider himself to be Chance II or Chance III. And I question if his &quot;luck&quot; can truly be attributable to Chance II but rather his ability to &quot;will&quot; his fortune into being by virtue of being in Chance III.')
