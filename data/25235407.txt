A year or two is when I notice people actually start adding significant value, and the really high value work when you get in tune with an organization&#x27;s DNA maybe still years later. Companies need veterans. If it seems like someone can&#x27;t even pretend to get invested, it&#x27;s a waste of time. Smart people who have a rap sheet of skills a mile long are cute, but I&#x27;ve personally found such peoples&#x27; dominant skill is marketing themselves...which I can&#x27;t blame them for, but I think articles like this are the result of people being burned by the &quot;mercenary&quot; mentality.')
