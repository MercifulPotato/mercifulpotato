The best an academically gifted public-school child can hope for is either the existence of a (free) after-school enrichment program run by a benevolent teacher, or to be bumped up a grade or two in their subject of talent (which typically only works in later grades, when students have more flexible schedules).<p>My own experience as a public school child was following the latter course (bumped up two years in math in high school), but that was only an option because (a) I was in one of the best public schools in the state, and (b) my mother was herself a teacher, and could navigate the system to fight to open that option to me.  But that only worked for one year â€“ before that, it logistically wasn&#x27;t an option (so teachers would just isolate me with a special workbook); after that, well, there were no higher-level math courses offered (so I just didn&#x27;t take math and instead dicked around in the AV club room for an hour each day).')
