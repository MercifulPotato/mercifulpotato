I&#x27;ve taken MDMA socially countless times and would have thought it entirely pointless to take alone, but my experiences taking it therapeutically - first with a sitter and then totally alone - have changed my view on this entirely.<p>I actually have very little interest in taking MDMA socially anymore. How I see it is that as unconscious material comes to the surface, you need to be present with it or it doesn&#x27;t really get processed. If you&#x27;re distracted by your awesome friends there is just less space and energy for that, and what happens is you end up bringing all this shit to the surface, NOT engaging with it, and then coming down and it&#x27;s still right up at the surface. This is in my experience why the hangovers suck so much. After a therapeutic session I feel drained but never hung over and depressed like I have after some social experiences.<p>Everyone is different of course but I say don&#x27;t knock it til you try it!')
