There have been viruses chronically infecting people for many years.  So, we could be looking at 30+ years of covid, unless it puts enough impetus on us to cure it, and perhaps more virii.<p>However, if not, perhaps we do treatments, to make survival rate high enough so no one worries, but is merely wary to get checked.  Or, perhaps we have 30 years where even if a single person gets it, the whole community needs to shut down for weeks, and people become suspicious and grow animus toward neighbors, being spiteful and lashing out more frequently, through rudeness or worse.\nOr, there&#x27;s Sweden&#x27;s route, which I&#x27;m kind of envious now.  I&#x27;m surprised I haven&#x27;t seen more countries jump in with both feet.\nWhat other options am I missing?  Or which of these would you strike?')
