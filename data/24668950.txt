Elephant Butte and Ruidoso were some of my most memorable camping trips as a young adult. The first time I drove solo for more than an hour was out of Alamogordo to visit a friend in Albuquerque; I never did forget how dramatic the scene transitioned entering the Valley of Fires close to sunset. A few years ago while accompanying my kid sibling to Palo Alto for freshman preview, we detour road tripped into Carlsbad to hike the caverns.
