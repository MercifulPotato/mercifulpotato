To me if seems that this is _exactly_ the market which will see their shares being eaten up by AirPod Maxes.<p>I highly doubt it. High-end audio is a niche market. Whoever was already willing to pony up &gt;$500 for a pair of cans, will likely ignore it. The reason for it is that audiophiles are looking for features that the AirPods Max do not have, e.g. neutral signatures, manually-only adjustable equalizers, and open back drivers. Who is going to plug this on a $2000 amplifier, and why? Doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>This product is set to compete with high-end <i>lifestyle</i> headphones, like the Beoplay H95. In that market, it will mostly be hugely successful. But the &quot;genuinely&quot; high-end audio market? Not a chance.')
