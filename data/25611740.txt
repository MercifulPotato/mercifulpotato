Compounded by the fact that there is little verifiable information due to heavy censorship, this makes any argument on the topic quite challenging.<p>After your top-level comment got downvoted I didn’t feel comfortable expressing my opinion: some might think I downvoted you and&#x2F;or others will mistake me for an astroturfer. Personally, I’ve upvoted it and I agree on general sentiment.')
