Whether somebody. Maybe something like the uniform commercial code, in the USA. That would be a nice contribution by some organization.<p>Even if only some sections are standardized and others not, that would be a comparative win.  Maybe an &quot;exceptions&#x2F;additions&quot; part.<p>Edit: also, there are some few sites I recall that summarized terms and&#x2F;or pointed out problematic parts, to help someone who cared but didn&#x27;t want to read them all.  I might be able to hunt up (a) link(s) if desired.<p>What I do currently is read them once, mentally note the date displayed, save them, and when they change, use a short script to make it easy to see differences (uses fmt to make lines to shorter first, and get sometimes fewer differences that way).  Sometimes I have pushed back and contacted the organization, or just not used them.  I wrote a bunch of complaints about this kind of thing, at my site -- it takes us further down the slippery slope of saying things we don&#x27;t mean to each other, habitually, which is sadly dishonest IMO.')
