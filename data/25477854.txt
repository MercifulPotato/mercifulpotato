Obviously there are many surgeries that are effective (repeating broken limbs, emergency surgeries, etc). Those surgeries having to do with pain relief are more nebulous.<p>My partner is a physical therapist, and in cases where it’s ineffective, it’s often because the patient is noncompliant or is doing it just to check off that “attempt” prior to surgery. A relative, as an example, goes to PT for all sorts of issues, but her real problems are psychological&#x2F;neurological (due to brain damage); no amount of PT will ever heal her mind or change her excessive perception of pain.')
