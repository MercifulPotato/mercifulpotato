I&#x27;m surprised about Cyprus considering Schmidt is from the US which is an odd choice since it&#x27;s usually Russians and Russian companies that launder their money through Cyprus.<p>Malta is much more popular among expat Brits and native English speakers and also (still) has a cleaner reputation compared to Cyprus.<p>Both jurisdictions fill a void that opened when Switzerland agreed to hand over data on US citizens to the USA. Technically Cyprus&#x2F;Malta too shares data but while the Swiss banking is a lot cleaner now than it was 20 years ago and certainly lot of things are now impossible that places like Nevada, New Mexico etc still allow.<p>Both Cyprus&#x2F;Malta have no shortage of crooks dressed as lawyers, accountants, notaries and bankers that will help him bypass the tax-men if he wants to but I strongly doubt that is the reason simply because he has better chances doing that at home. The US is now the biggest tax-haven in the world. It sounds more personal than this.<p>Maybe he is planning to do business with wealthy Russians (unlikely) maybe he watched Mama-Mia and is now obsessed with the idea of falling in love on a Greek island, or maybe he wants to live in a city that is politically divided as much as his home planet.
