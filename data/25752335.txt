Honestly I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s <i>bad</i>, I would argue that it&#x27;s among the best <i>G</i>UIs out there for routers. I would be surprised if it&#x27;s more common for MikroTik routers to be left in an insecure state that any other router, unless it&#x27;s only because people who work on routers tend to have been trained on Cisco or Juniper and that training just doesn&#x27;t translate very well to MikroTik. But I&#x27;m also not going to die on a hill of defending MikroTik&#x27;s configuration design choices, there&#x27;s a lot to be desired.')
