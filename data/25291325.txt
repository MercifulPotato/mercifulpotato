Item(by='rjkennedy98', descendants=None, kids=[25291514], score=None, time=1607015602, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25290712, text='&gt; When you dislike black people<p>I don&#x27;t personally dislike Black people (but thanks for accusing me), I&#x27;m just a realist and I think universal standards are absolutely critical to having a peaceful and successful country.<p>You mention facts, but if your group views any failure to meet universal standards whether they be academic merit standards, hate speech standards, crime standards, ect as white oppression facts don&#x27;t even matter.<p>This is why we have new rules so that Blacks get into college with drastically worse scores than everyone else. Now, your group is using your power to simply remove test scores all together as a standard since tests are racist. You lobby for hate speech rules so they don&#x27;t affect your group (as Facebook is being pressured to do). Eventually you start saying that statistics, truth, and virtue are actually parts of &quot;white culture&quot; that is oppressive itself (as the African American museum did (1)). Next phase we now entering in (which I fear), we simply deny that white people even exist as the AP has made a journalistic standard (3) and we say that objectivity itself isn&#x27;t real (2).<p>You call that &quot;justice&quot; I supposed, but it doesn&#x27;t matter because you assume it is done in good faith. I think its pretty obvious that it is not done in good faith and is extremely dangerous, but Black people as a rule view Black power as inherently benign, despite plenty of evidence of the contrary (South Africa and Zimbabwe where whites were forced to emigrate).<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thefederalist.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;15&#x2F;smithsonian-pushes-racist-material-claiming-white-culture-is-nuclear-family-self-reliance-being-polite&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thefederalist.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;15&#x2F;smithsonian-pushes-raci...</a>\n2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;23&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;objectivity-black-journalists-coronavirus.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;23&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;objectivity-black...</a>\n3. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;7e36c00c5af0436abc09e051261fff1f" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;7e36c00c5af0436abc09e051261fff1f</a>')
