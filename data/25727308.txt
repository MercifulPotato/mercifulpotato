I have some colleagues that insist on keeping their camera off, indeed it has a &quot;focus on business effect&quot;. I also have groups of people that all have their camera&#x27;s on, with WFH and lock down we see each others kids and each other emotions, it creates a much more personal bond which I highly appreciate. With the camera-on now being the default I even have a much better and relaxed relationship with my colleagues in the US (I&#x27;m in the Netherlands) I guess it&#x27;s what you want to get out of your digital forms of contact.')
