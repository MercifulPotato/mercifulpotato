And I doubt most of the people who think they are one, actually are.<p>I will try to avoid doing that myself, specially I will avoid implying I am one, but I think it&#x27;s possible to come up with a few criteria to help you &quot;judge&quot; the level of mastery one has in software engineering:<p>* can create a project from scratch without pondering forever about each and every choice, while picking reasonable choices that, together, approach optimality given the circumstances (notice that this depends mostly on the team&#x2F;company involved so there&#x27;s not one right universal answer).<p>* can break up the work in manageable pieces so that progress can be made (regardless of how many people actually work on the project) and measured easily. This is really hard and can only be done properly by a practitioner (meaning, no, your PM can&#x27;t do that for you).<p>* can establish a good base design that facilitates achievement of the project&#x27;s objectives (e.g. if performance-focused, then architecture might differ significantly from a more maintainability-focused one).<p>* knows to apply the right amount of testing&#x2F;automation (too much or too little can be damaging).<p>* can focus on the task at hand, avoiding unnecessary work (many great technical developers fail to do this due to their preference for harder challenges that may not be the right ones to address).<p>* can communicate well (because knowing it all but not being able to pass the knowledge on or convince others will cause most of your knowledge to become inaccessible).<p>Notice that to be able to effectively rate a person or team against each criterion is itself something subjective sometimes, so you won&#x27;t get a clear-cut answer no matter how you look at it... but I am sure that there are ways to use metrics for each one, though we all know the problem with metrics (people will game it), so yeah, it&#x27;s difficult to figure this out. Just make sure you don&#x27;t fall into the trap of judging people solely on subjective grounds though as our natural biases are quite crippling (see psychological studies about human bias) and will cause you to misjudge others, sometimes disastrously.')
