Item(by='redis_mlc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602651908, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24773195, text='I live in SF, and your post is bizarre:<p>- affordable housing - for who? with our confines - how?<p>Currently 60% of the $300 million in city &quot;homeless funds&quot; pay for subsidized apartments, presumably low-income residents.<p>- public transit - is relatively good (pre-corona.) SF Muni needs to retain senior transport engineers to prevent fiascos like buying the wrong length street cars, and how to side around non-operating cars. Otherwise the problem is that the workers (unionized) are allowed to call in sick 30% of the time, so an extra 30% has to be hired.<p>- green energy - don&#x27;t see how this is important compared to other issues. street cars are already electrified.')
