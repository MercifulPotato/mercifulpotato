I&#x27;m still working decks whose new cards ran out years ago. The presence and scheduling of new cards is a temporary condition with little long-term significance.<p>My new cards comment was to explain why it&#x27;s not 14x when you go on vacation.<p>&gt;I&#x27;ve seen curious comments like this in various past forum discussions on the topic of Anki vacation ideas.<p>&gt;A vacation is not a period of rest followed by double the amount of work to catch up.<p>&gt;A vacation is a pause in work, which delays all subsequent work by that much time.<p>This is simply cheating the SRS. Some SRS programs do allow you to do this, wanikani does it for instance, but it is quite literally cheating. Instead of seeing it after 30 days, you see it after 44, but the program pretends it&#x27;s only been 30. It&#x27;s not a good feature, besides to make people feel better about themselves.<p>&gt;I&#x27;ve seen curious comments like this in various past forum discussions on the topic of Anki vacation ideas.<p>It&#x27;s cheating. And in this case, the only person you are cheating, is yourself.')
