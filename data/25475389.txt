I was trying to make a new, purely anonymized identity. Went through an anonymized bitcoin VPN with TOR on top. Registered an email through Protonmail.<p>Pretty much no social media platform will accept Protonmail as an address without also having a phone number.<p>Got banned from Discord within 3 hours, literally all I&#x27;d done was send three friend requests and join one discord. My IP was rotating and I then needed to have 2-factor authentication (and protonmail wasn&#x27;t allowed, I needed that phone number).<p>So, I went out and bought a burner phone, cash, with a 1-year prepaid account. Got it setup over a wired proxy with all radios turned off. Now at least I had a Google account! (they also require a phone number)<p>And Discord proceeded to reject it, because I needed to have a &#x27;real&#x27; phone number from a major carrier.<p>I essentially needed to craft an entirely new identity if I wanted to be truly anonymous. It was eye-opening how invasive and pervasive the &#x27;track you down to a real identity&#x27; accounts have become.')
