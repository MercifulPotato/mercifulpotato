But he was compensated in hosting credits for the exact amount of down time for the 1 service that caused the issue. It took so long to resolve because it took support a while to figure out it was their service, not his site.<p>So then I jokingly responded with that being like going to a restaurant, getting massive food poisoning, almost dying, ending up with a $150,000 hospital bill and then the restaurant emails you with &quot;Dear valued customer, we&#x27;re sorry for the inconvenience and have decided to award you a $50 gift card for any of our restaurants, thanks!&quot;.<p>If your SLA agreement is only for precisely calculated credits, that&#x27;s not really going to help in the grand scheme of things.')
