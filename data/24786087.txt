In this case, you&#x27;re asking me to be charitable to a sexist article whose author does not justify their credentials beyond being a professor of philosophy; perhaps they are only accidentally sexist here?<p>If author justified his credentials with more titles, it would be better? If he was a biologist, his paper would stop being sexist in your opinion? Why does it matter?<p>As for the article itself, it isn&#x27;t sexist IMHO unless you believe that stating that the biological sex exists and in human case there are two sexes is sexist. If that&#x27;s so then the most biologists I&#x27;ve met are jest sexists and I should probably call the police and denounce them as petty criminals.<p>You&#x27;re right that author contradicts himself in the sentence &quot;The fact that no species has evolved more than two biological sexes is also a puzzle&quot;. It&#x27;s definitely a logical error on the author&#x27;s side and is plainly wrong, but it&#x27;s not the main point of the paper.')
