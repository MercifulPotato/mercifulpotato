Map 160 acres in as little as 15 minutes on your iPad while the drone flies, then locate areas of stress or damage and walk out to manually inspect. High resolution visual and thermal imagery lets you see issues quickly without walking thousands of acres, leading to faster and more accurate inspection.<p>I&#x27;m looking for a non-technical co-founder to bring this technology to market, primarily targeting agronomy co-ops, fertilizer, seed, and crop insurance businesses in the midwestern US. Individual crop consultants may be interested as well. If you can sell software to Agribusinesses, lets talk. devin [at] agmaps.us.')
