All we are doing is restoring the atmosphere changed by a devastating asteroid impact.  An atmosphere that plunges the earth into ice for 10s if not 100s of thousands of years periodically.  If we kept pumping out CO2 at present acceleration, it would take us 500 years to reach the levels preimpact.  We wont get there, we will likely run out or find other alternatives, but that time frame puts things into perspective.')
