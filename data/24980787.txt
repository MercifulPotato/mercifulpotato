I suppose they could open source their toolchain so anyone could stand up their own Dark framework on-premise and maybe they sell support and&#x2F;or a managed service and&#x2F;or &quot;enterprise features&quot; (whatever those are in this context)? Maybe these things will come sometime after the private-beta (perhaps they&#x27;re just getting a better feel for their product&#x27;s value proposition before committing to opening any particular piece of it up)?')
