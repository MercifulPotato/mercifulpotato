There&#x27;s actually quite a lot in the outer boroughs of New York (and of course one such mostly-freight track was converted in the High Line). It&#x27;s cheaper to upkeep, and actually possibly cheaper to buy (compared to cost of drilling), and of course gets built much faster. The problem is essentially noise. Light is also a concern but not quite as large.<p>I wonder if anyone is working on making these trains more silent. It seems hard but might be quite valuable.')
