If you go to Central Park, you&#x27;ll find that the density of people on an average day is far higher at (say) Harlem Meer than it is further south. There are simply more people who are sharing the same recreation space that is within X miles of the place they are living.<p>Central Park is actually a silly example, because it&#x27;s <i>far better</i> than most other parts of New York. Go to Fort Washington Park on an average sunny weekend, and the density of people is <i>dramatically</i> higher than Riverside Park, further south. And that&#x27;s just recreation...poorer people have less time for that than rich people do. Go to Flushing, and people are cheek-to-jowl at pretty much all times, even though there&#x27;s a big empty park right next door.')
