Item(by='1-more', descendants=None, kids=[25128034], score=None, time=1605638867, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25125989, text='&quot;We are engaged&quot; is passive though. Specifically its form is passive: be + past participle. But its meaning is more reflexive than anything else. I don&#x27;t know what the subject of that sentence would be in an active construction. Maybe &quot;We have engaged ourselves in a great…&quot; or possibly a bit more poetic &quot;Fate has engaged us in a…&quot;. But this really speaks to your original point that a passive _construction_ (not necessarily meaning) does not always hide information the reader needs.')
