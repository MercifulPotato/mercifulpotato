I think they did realize that what they were saying was public, but didn&#x27;t care too much - they just wanted to get a message to a specific person, and Twitter made the easiest way to do so to say it publicly.<p>As a result, a lot of such messages ended up being public, and while each of them was innocent, all of them taken together were saying a lot about that person. And the latter may have been an implication that the person didn&#x27;t realize.')
