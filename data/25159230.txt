Are you just saying that each floating-point value precisely represents a real number? Or are you saying that floating-point arithmetic is often exact? [0]<p>My own pedantic nitpick: the article states that <i>but BigDecimals are [exact]</i>. BigDecimal is only exact in the way floats are exact. BigDecimal has <i>arbitrary</i> precision, but is not able to precisely represent every real. There&#x27;s no way to come up with a system that would be capable of doing this. No matter how much memory you throw at BigDecimal, you can&#x27;t precisely represent pi.<p>[0] <i>Sterbenz Lemma</i>, on which there are surprisingly few good sources.
