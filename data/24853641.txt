I didn’t bother checking them out because they were mobile only. Other than that, nothing. No one I know has mentioned them to me even in discussion of such services and the people I’ve asked haven’t had a clue they existed. Maybe their content sucks. Maybe their choices and interface are garbage. But surely their terrible marketing was also a nail in the coffin?')
