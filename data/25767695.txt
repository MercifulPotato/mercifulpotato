Don&#x27;t let anybody tell you how to live your life. Do what works best.<p>&gt; 200 to 240 hours a month was pretty typical<p>It also seems very normal. I do 210 a month at least (without overtime). That&#x27;s not counting lunch hour during which I&#x27;m mostly still at my desk, and which would add another 20 hours a month.<p>&gt; (I doubt it&#x27;s out of real concern for my health, my workload hasn&#x27;t been reduced).<p>I don&#x27;t know your work or your boss, but it could be they expect you to manage yourself and are waiting to see how the work piles up before deciding what to do about it. If they complain it&#x27;s not getting done, just quote them. Less time = less work gets done.<p>Also see my other comment:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25767160" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25767160</a>')
