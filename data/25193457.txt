A more apt comparison would be the Tesla Semi.<p>While you&#x27;re at it... it might be worth completely re-thinking the problem in light of semi-autonomy.  E.g. if you&#x27;re going to have recharge periods, a fleet of 3x 8000-lb semi-autonomous robots might be preferable to a single 25,000 lb tractor (since labor is no longer a consideration).  This also has benefits for soil compaction.<p>YMMV.')
