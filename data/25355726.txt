Motive isn&#x27;t always clear, and quite often there are multiple parties with motives.<p>&gt;unless you&#x27;ve had some real exposure to IR and forensics as a practitioner.<p>I&#x27;ll bite on your argumentum ad verecundiam... who says I didn&#x27;t? ;)<p>But I agree, we&#x27;ll likely never see evidence or a post mortem, and are expected to believe what FireEye and&#x2F;or the FBI tells us.')
