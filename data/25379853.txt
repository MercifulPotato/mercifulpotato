If you like the walled garden, enjoy it.<p>Thing is, Apple and Google both offer the exact same benefits.  They approve what gets published, they listen to complaints, they control some aspects of how you are allowed to code for their platforms.  They lock you into their payment processor and they take a cut.<p>The difference is that if I want out of that comfy, protected walled garden, I have to do different things to get out.<p>On Android, I go to my security settings, enable third party sources, and then download alternative app store APKs from sites like Amazon and F-Droid.  The garden isn&#x27;t a jail.<p>On iOS, I either have to sideload software via my lighting cable in developer mode, or &quot;jailbreak&quot; (the garden is a jail) the operating system using third party hacks allowing me to install from new sources.<p>And sure, rooting Android or iOS is typically a hacky chore, but at least the Android rooting tool is published by Google.')
