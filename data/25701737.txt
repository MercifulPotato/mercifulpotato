I don&#x27;t have a specific goal&#x2F;target in mind while making it. I&#x27;ve written several game engines since the nineties, and this is my most recent version.<p>I have abandoned many of my older engines at some point to develop a new one, but with this engine I&#x27;ll try to keep developing it a lot further before making a new engine.')
