Item(by='strogonoff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602064171, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24706516, text='&gt; once men find &quot;their barber&quot;, they&#x27;re locked in for pretty much the rest of their life and become a regular customer every 2-3 weeks.<p>I’m curious whether it’s really specific to male population, and if so why…<p>That aside, and I can’t believe that this is where the thread took us, I empathise so much with this. Even in countries where I can converse easily with anybody it’s a struggle for me to trust someone with my hair, despite me presumably not really caring about it. Now living in countries where I don’t speak local languages and locals predominantly don’t speak any of mine (or do so with much difficulty) I haven’t gone to a barber in years—I pretty much gave up and just live with terrible hair. I guess if I ever find “my barber” I may be willing to travel far to get my haircut.')
