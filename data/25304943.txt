That said, the Java way was already for runnables to cancel themselves with some kind of volatile cancel bool so I expect that&#x27;s all we&#x27;ll get.<p>From the article: &gt;Clearly the intent is also to cancel the child thread. And this is exactly what happens.<p>I find this to be a bold choice. In C# you can detach children and such.  Should be interesting to see if this gets added later.')
