So yes, actively supporting him at this point is supporting an end to American democracy, pretty objectively. Linking the overthrow of the democratic order with terrorism, just after a mob entered the capitol and successfully interrupted the democratic order for multiple hours, doesn&#x27;t feel a huge leap.<p>Being conservative isn&#x27;t linked with terrorism. Being libertarian isn&#x27;t linked with terrorism. Supporting somebody who rejects democracy is linked with terrorism. It&#x27;s seems pretty clear cut to me.<p>[1] He said that a new administration will enter office but never that it does so rightfully based on a legitimate election.')
