I intentionally used &quot;may&quot; in that statement as using .innerHTML can be both effective and performant enough (and a lot simpler).<p>A couple possible problems off the top of my head:<p>1. CSS transitions won&#x27;t work if you re-render a complete chunk of HTML instead of toggling a class.<p>2. &lt;a&gt;, &lt;button&gt;, &lt;input&gt;, etc. may lose focus or even data on re-render (e.g. while filling out a form).<p>3. Text selection may be reset on re-render.<p>4. If you don&#x27;t use event delegation, event listeners may need to be reattached.<p>I agree that for raw display .innerHTML may be sufficient, but it&#x27;s surely not in general. That would make React almost irrelevant, by the way, which would be a huge surprise.')
