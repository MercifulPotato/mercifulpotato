Was the house destroyed? Are there photos of the burned property? If he was surrounded by family it seems he was the only one injured. Sometimes suspicious deaths are coveted up to avoid attention. I had a neighbor who was CEO of a large company. When he shot him self I heard the gun shot. I saw the clean up crew the next morning. The media reported his death as stroke as to not tarnish his reputation.')
