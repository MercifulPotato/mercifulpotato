What you&#x27;re saying is absurdly far away from reality.<p>Very few people say that things were better. It was a miserable time back then, and the life has drastically improved for the vast majority of the society.<p>When there was toilet paper delivered to the stores, it was a big deal. And by &quot;toilet paper&quot; I mean a gray, thin, one-layered, recycled one. It&#x27;s weird we didn&#x27;t switch to the asian water-bidet style then.<p>There was literally nothing available in the stores. Imagine your local supermarket, but with literal empty shelves, just vinegar on some of them.<p>There was even a joke about a guy who comes to a hardware store:\n- I&#x27;d like some screws\n- We don&#x27;t have screws\n- I&#x27;d like some nails then\n- We don&#x27;t have nails either\n- Well, what do you have?\n- Nothing.\n- Why don&#x27;t you close the store down then?\n- We don&#x27;t have the locks either.<p>This was a reality for dosens of millions of people back then. Saying that anyone misses that time, and that many people had it better is some kind of a sick fantasy.<p>Also, it wasn&#x27;t due to US politics (although it didn&#x27;t help). With the private enterprise being trashed, and people demotivated to do any sort of work (what for? &quot;If you sit, or you stand, 100z≈Ç payment is your right&quot; - another common joke), it was bound to collapse.<p>If anything, people in Poland saw West world as the one that was fighting to get us out of it all (and as a place of freedom and possibility).<p>And really - the crazy 90s after the communist rule fell, we saw a huge increase in the quality of life for almost everyone.')
