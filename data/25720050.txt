If you&#x27;ve done any windows coding in C it&#x27;s practically lingua franca. I think the int{size}_t stuff is way better, but a &quot;word&quot; is common slang, and a double word is like a dword because nobody wants to write that much<p>&gt; Also, the &quot;next and previous points xor&#x27;ed into a DWORD&quot; hack mentioned at the end? This isn&#x27;t duct tape programming. It&#x27;s absurdly context-dependent premature optimization<p>Man I&#x27;m writing code for an arduino right now and that kinda optimization isn&#x27;t rare for a machine with 2k of ram. It&#x27;s not absurd it&#x27;s useful to be able to do that. Sure don&#x27;t do it on your 4ghz intel or whatever but techniques like that are useful.')
