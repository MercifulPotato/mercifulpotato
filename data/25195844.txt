I can&#x27;t say too much but the AWS team confirmed it. But I appreciate how something like you describe could happen.<p>Layer 7 just means they are making ton of HTTP requests from lot of IPS however this is the nature of a web analytics.<p>&gt; we know that an IP visited one of the tens of thousands of websites Fathom runs on, but we don&#x27;t know which one.<p>How can the attackers know which websites have your analytics on? Crawling the web is super hard.<p>You should be able to get back which accounts are affected from your analytics call:<p><pre><code>    https:&#x2F;&#x2F;starman.fathomdns.com&#x2F;?p=%2F&amp;h=https%3A%2F%2Fusefathom.com&amp;r=&amp;sid=BIABKBRK&amp;res=1440x900\n</code></pre>\nIsn&#x27;t sid=BIABKBRK the account? The access log should store this `sid` allowing you to just block the account. (or ask them for ton of money if it&#x27;s a legitimate use :) )')
