Item(by='1vuio0pswjnm7', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609904026, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25649930, text='&quot;There&#x27;s a real gap in our understanding of capitalism and crime if it&#x27;s easier tom compensate shareholders of a toxic company than it is to compensate the direct victims of that toxic behaviour.&quot;<p>Fortunately, the Strauss paper^1 on which this Levine newsletter entry is based does not suggest it is easier.  Where did this idea come from.  Instead, the author found that non-SEC regulators and primary victims generally received greater recoveries than investors and their securities fraud class-action plaintiffs lawyers, where the class-action lawyers were piggybacking on investigations by non-SEC regulators and litigation by primary, non-shareholder victims.  (That is only based on available data; some primary victim settlements might be private.)<p>In this piggyback litigation the author reviewed, the vast majority of cases resulted were successful for both the primary victims (non-shareholders) and the securities fraud shareholder plaintiffs.  In other words, the non-shareholder victims <i>are</i> getting compensated, and they are getting larger payouts than shareholders in piggyback securities fraud class-actions.<p>There is no suggestion anywhere in the paper that it is easier to be compensated in securities fraud class-actions than in actions brought by non-SEC regulators or non-shareholder victims of the corporation&#x27;s conduct.  In general, class-action securities fraud complaints have a very low probability of surviving a motion to dismiss.  Rather, the paper suggests class-action securities fraud plaintiff&#x27;s lawyers can increase their odds by piggybacking on non-SEC investigations and litigation by non-shareholders who are victim&#x27;s of the corporation&#x27;s conduct.  That is not surprising.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;papers.ssrn.com&#x2F;sol3&#x2F;papers.cfm?abstract_id=3664132" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;papers.ssrn.com&#x2F;sol3&#x2F;papers.cfm?abstract_id=3664132</a><p>New title: Is Everything <i>Also</i> Securities Fraud?')
