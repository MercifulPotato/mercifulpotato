Where did this idea come from.  Instead, the author found that non-SEC regulators and primary victims generally received greater settlements than investors and their securities fraud class-action plaintiffs lawyers, where harm to non-shareholders was the basis for the complaint.  (That is only based on available data; some primary victim settlements might be private.)<p>The author focuses exclusively on these exmaples of piggyback litigation.  There is a non-SEC investigation and then securities fraud class-action plaintiffs lawyers pile on and ride the coattails.  Class-action lawyers love to ride the wave of public sentiment.  The vast majority of these cases in her analysis involved success for <i>both</i> the primary victims (non-shareholders) and the securities fraud shareholder plaintiffs.  In other words, the non-shareholder victims are getting compensated, and they are getting larger payouts than shareholders in piggyback securities fraud class-actions.<p>There is no suggestion anywhere in the paper that it is easier to be compensated in securities fraud class-actions than in actions brought by non-SEC regulators or non-shareholder victims of the corporation&#x27;s conduct.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;papers.ssrn.com&#x2F;sol3&#x2F;papers.cfm?abstract_id=3664132" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;papers.ssrn.com&#x2F;sol3&#x2F;papers.cfm?abstract_id=3664132</a><p>New title: Is Everything <i>Also</i> Securities Fraud?')
