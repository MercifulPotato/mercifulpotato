The bins are frequently full of contaminated and non-recyclable materials that the facility&#x27;s equipment is incapable of sorting back out. Since it&#x27;s all commingled in the collection truck, one person who&#x27;s sloppy about how they recycle can spoil not only their own recycling efforts, but those of their neighbors as well. In my own neighborhood, the recycle bins are frequently full of things like greasy pizza boxes, single-use paper cups, EPS, even yard waste and broken (particleboard) furniture.<p>Chicago&#x27;s current program is an illustrative example. After the city introduced it, the percentage of waste Chicagoans placed in the recycle bins roughly doubled, while the percentage of Chicago&#x27;s waste that actually gets recycled was halved.')
