We have just learned what an advantage CI is to software quality and developer productivity, expectations for both of which have been raised because of pervasive use of CI.<p>Many people wound up discovering&#x2F;learning that and raising expectations because Travis&#x27;s extraordinarily easy-to-use and reliable, and free for open source service, got them to try it out and discover the benefits. People had been <i>talking</i> about how everyone should be doing CI before travis, but I think travis played a major role in significantly increasingly how many people were actually doing CI (and thus learning that they didn&#x27;t want to do without it&#x27;s benefits), changing the way software is developed. Which is to the credit of those who developed the original travis service, for sure.<p>I think it really created a market, by offering something with very low barriers that &#x27;hooked&#x27; people. Now we&#x27;re hooked.')
