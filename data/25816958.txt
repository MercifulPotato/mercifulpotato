Lets build something', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hi,<p>As many of us know, Simple Bank is closing and we are being moved over to BBVA Compass.<p>The main primary reason I&#x27;m using Simple is for the &quot;simplicity&quot; of the envelope system. I enjoy the UI and think it&#x27;s one of the best user experiences.<p>I&#x27;ve built iOS apps and web apps before and because I&#x27;m losing something I absolutely love, I think I am going to rebuild this app myself.<p>The major difference is that this will be able to work with any bank account by using Plaid (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;plaid.com).<p>If you think about, the &quot;proof of concept&quot; and the storyboards are pretty much done since we just need to reference the Simple Bank app.<p>I&#x27;m writing this post because I would love to work with some people on this app!<p>If you are using Simple currently, or just want to work on a budgeting app for fun, reach out to me!<p>ethanbonin@gmail.com')
