She draws the line between trade on the one hand, that existed and flourished in Holland,Firenze and others parts of the world where capitalism nevertheless did not &quot;happen&quot; and the specific conditions that gave rise to a new mode of production in England well before anywhere else. It&#x27;s called &quot;the origin of capitalism&quot;.')
