Google decided out of the blue to mark our attachment S3 bucket as dangerous, because of one malicious file.<p>What&#x27;s most interesting is that the bucket is private, so the only way they could identify that there is something malicious at a URL is if someone downloads it using Chrome.  I&#x27;m assuming they make this decision based on some database of checksums.<p>To mitigate, we now operate a number of proxies in front of the bucket, so we can quickly replace any that get marked as dangerous.  We also now programmatically monitor presence of our domains in Google&#x27;s &quot;dangerous site&quot; database (they have APIs for this).<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enchant.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enchant.com</a> - software for better customer service')
