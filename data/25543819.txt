In fact, they usually involve me receiving some kind of money. Receiving money is the most valuable human experience, especially if I get it for free (the less work I do, the better). Brings tears of joy to my eyes.<p>The worst human experiences are related to spending money. Especially on overpriced depreciating assets and consumables. The worst is giving money to other people for free. Nothing makes me feel emptier.<p>Also, when central banks print units of my hard-earned currency and give it for free to other people (without my consent), that infuriates me. For me, it&#x27;s the human experiential equivalent of getting raped on a daily basis and everyone else cheering on the perpetrator.')
