We&#x27;ve also been able to confirm an ample amount of funding to get things off the ground.<p>We&#x27;re now hoping to talk to experienced game developers for feedback on our GDD, and ultimately to bring a dev onboard full time so that we can move forward with the project.<p>So far I&#x27;ve posted across a few relevant sub-reddits and other indie communities I&#x27;m in, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing some low hanging fruit.<p>My other ideas to explore tonight:<p>* ~~Post in game dev subreddits~~ Done<p>* Research and post on game dev forums<p>* Direct outreach to indie game devs with solid releases<p>* Attend a local game development meetup<p>Where should I be looking for quality game dev talent?<p>Thank you')
