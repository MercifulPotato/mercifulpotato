My most popular customization is a fingerprint ring. You can see some pictures of my website.<p>I spent a decent amount of time on the design software which uses fabric.js and three.js for design and visualization. The website is most a static site and uses google cloud run for the api.<p>Check it out, Iâ€™d love some feedback!')
