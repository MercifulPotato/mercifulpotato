I understand what you are trying to say but just because I have not met him doesn&#x27;t mean that I can&#x27;t criticize him.<p>His VC fund had LPs that lost money. I don&#x27;t think they really give a shit about &quot;welfare over profits&quot;. Once it&#x27;s a family office yeah sure preach about welfare over profits but remember he had a fiduciary responsibility to his LPs which he (likely) broke.<p>&quot;No more real discussion&quot;. This is what real discussion looks like. People LOVE chamath and I am explaining what I see is wrong about him.')
