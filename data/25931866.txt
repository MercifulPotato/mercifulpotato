Item(by='Kalium', descendants=None, kids=[25932549], score=None, time=1611772105, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25931004, text='&gt; There should be an economy of downcycling that allows for more affordable stuff, too. I just don&#x27;t think that IKEA is that.<p>You&#x27;re absolutely right! There often this. This is rarely anywhere near the IKEA price point, though. A dining room table for $200, however nice, would have eaten up two thirds of my furnishing budget. How does one manage chairs, a bedframe, and so on of good quality for $100?<p>It&#x27;s not been my experience that a person can do that by being willing to drive hundreds of miles and owning a car, but YMMV. IKEA lets you do this <i>reliably</i>, and offers delivery services.<p>When your answer to &quot;How do I furnish?&quot; is &quot;Do without until the perfect deal comes along&quot;, do you think it might be worth considering that your answer might not be great for everyone?')
