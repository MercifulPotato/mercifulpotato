Please upvote.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d choose to fly on a 737 Max over any other plane, personally. Because no other plane in operation has ever received the amount of scrutiny the Max has.<p>That is a logical fallacy. It received scrutiny because it&#x27;s misdesigned and miscertified. The corrections have not been done transparently. That doesn&#x27;t inspire me at all. The outsourced software could be a whole can of worms on its own.<p>&gt; Investigators believe both accidents were triggered by the failure of a single sensor.<p>Yes, because it was using a single sensor instead of 2 or 3 as expected for a life-critical system. The sensor was also external to the plane, subject to impact by birds and ladders. Facepalm.<p>&gt; Didn&#x27;t they actually blame the pilots initially?<p>Yes. I can speak about Indonesia, which I am very familiar with. Indonesia has a poor safety record, both because of pilot performance and maintenance issues, so calling out Indonesia aviation safety is not &quot;racist.&quot; The Indo NTSB ruled that pilots, maintenance and Boeing shared blame equally.<p>&gt; Quantas has not had a fatality since 1951 (Ryanair was founded in 1984); so that cannot possibly be true.<p>I think the layman opinion of an airline being &quot;safe&quot; if there&#x27;s no fatal accidents is silly, since it really depends on volume of flights, etc.<p>Qantas used nitrogen instead of supplemental oxygen on many flights, which would have resulted in many deaths in case of a depressurization. Also, QF32 (A380 uncontained engine failure) was a close one.<p>&gt; do you think Boeing would be able to survive<p>Yes, because it&#x27;s a defense contractor, is USA&#x27;s largest exporter and makes half the world&#x27;s airliners, which Airbus can&#x27;t build incrementally. Airline crashes do close airlines, though.<p>&gt; anyone got any details of what changes Boeing needs to make in order to fly a 737Max again ?<p>The complexity of v1 was too much to fix until v2. Also, nobody has talked about their outsourced flight control software yet. MCAS involves too many domains for many people to wrap their heads around (hardware, software, FARs, compliance, flight manual, training, aerodynamics, cost.)<p>&gt; The reason they were chasing fleet commonality is because it would massively reduce adoption costs for airlines by making expensive training for existing 737 pilots unnecessary.<p>Yes, but more specifically, Boeing promised Southwest $1 million per plane for pilot retraining. So a single Excel cell monitored by the executive suite drove the entire MCAS debacle. This story has not been fully told yet, although another accident will bring it to light.<p>Source: commercially-rated pilot, followed MCAS in detail. Predicted MCAS solution would take more than a year, and that v1 wasn&#x27;t it.')
