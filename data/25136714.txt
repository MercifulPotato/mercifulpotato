What these 1st semester economics majors forget is suddenly you&#x27;d have an influx of people seeking degrees. Employers know that so they&#x27;ll either A. Decrease wages, or B. Increase the requirements&#x2F;duties because of heavy competition.<p>Another thing, wiping out debt just doesn&#x27;t magically make jobs. People who make more than you but don&#x27;t have enough time to do something do. Somehow I fail to see how a few noisy self entitled afflueza stricken college kids who wanted a degree it bullshitology now deserve a kickback because they were dumb and didn&#x27;t make a right choice in life. While I agree with another commenter, banks should be able to feel the sting of the default as well as the federal gov&#x27;t in terms of backed student loans.<p>Not only would college degrees not be required for many jobs simply due to the lack of them in general, but students wouldn&#x27;t waste their time with nanny state experience of college anyway. Nor would they have absurd debt with a worthless degree. And colleges are just as complacent. They market this stuff to be &quot;rewarding&quot; and whatnot but lie through their teeth about the sheer economics about it.')
