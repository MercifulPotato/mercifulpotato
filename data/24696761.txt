That said, as a long-time bose user their products are deteriorating in obvious ways.  As a heavy traveller (pre-crisis) my first pair of quietcomfort headphones were fantastic. They were so far ahead of anything else I had ever owned that when in a jetlagged state a sadly left them behind when departing a plane I had no hesitation in immediately buying another. These lasted a quarter of the time I had the original pair before the pads became uncomfortable, split and I replaced them.  Still a pretty good pair of headphones but the second time the pads fell apart I decided that it was time to relegate these headphones to &quot;backup&quot; status and upgrade to wireless.<p>I decided to get a bose pair even though I had reservations. They were ok - the sound quality was not as good as either of the previous wired pairs, but I figured that was the price you pay for the convenience of bluetooth wireless. They worked well until like my first pair I left them on a plane.<p>OK no more bose - I bought a pair of Sennheisers. For the first month these were <i>fantastic</i> and half the cost of bose. I liked them so much when my wife wanted headphones I bought her an identical pair. Then one day they just decided they would no longer pair with my bluetooth devices.  No idea why, no way of fixing them and when I looked online lots of other people have had the same problem and end up sending them back to Sennheiser and getting a replacement pair.  I can&#x27;t be bothered to do this so I go back to bose.<p>My latest pair of bose QC headphones are <i>by far</i> the worst.  The audio quality is worse than any previous pair of bose headphones I&#x27;ve owned, and the microphone is so poorly placed that I&#x27;ve given up using them for calls - whenever I did this in the past I ended up spending half the call explaining to the other person that I didn&#x27;t need to speak up - I was already talking unreasonably loudly it was just that the microphone didn&#x27;t work properly.<p>Headphones seem to be going through the &quot;tornado&quot; phase right now where demand is soaring and quality is plummetting. The way for Bose to distinguish itself would be to go back to making good noise-cancelling headphones (which it used to do very well) but I think it is most likely they will follow the race to the bottom and get crushed by larger competitors.<p>As a long-time fan of Bose headphones at the moment I won&#x27;t be sad to see them disappear.')
