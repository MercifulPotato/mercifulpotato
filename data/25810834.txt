Spreading misinformation and disinformation has cost the U.S. nearly 400,000 lives and counting. That&#x27;s worse than the number of car deaths by an order of magnitude. Time for us to act accordingly.<p>Kara wants to blame Big Tech, but I don&#x27;t. I blame the jerks who abuse and misuse the tech for personal gain, and the idiots who are their willing followers. I loathe Facebook, but it wasn&#x27;t Zuckerberg inciting people to insurrection.<p>Big tech has been restrained, all things considered. Think about it. Can you imagine if the head of, say, Microsoft, Apple or Google was as mentally ill as Trump? Serious, serious damage could result.<p>You want to drive a car? You go take a test that shows you understand the law, and respect others on the road. You want to use a smartphone to share news about politics? You should have to take a test that shows you understand the law and respect others as well.')
