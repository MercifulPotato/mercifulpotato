The amount of help WebStorm, PyCharm, etc. give is honestly way too much to pass up and the kind of uniformity you can get from everyone using them is great, all out of the box.<p>I used to only use Vim and Emacs but there&#x27;s no question they&#x27;re much more incomplete tools for development. I don&#x27;t see why one would pass up JetBrains IDEs considering they have a passable Vim mode and for the languages they have plugins and&#x2F;or product lines for they&#x27;re just better.')
