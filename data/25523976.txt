However, either they do not scale or even when they do (newsql), they are 10x slower and handle less volume, etc.<p>The right way to use NoSQL is when you know your scaling model. LWT helps you to serialize important tables.<p>Scylla consistently makes improvements in operations, consistency and functionality, so more to come, see what we&#x27;ll announce at the summit next month')
