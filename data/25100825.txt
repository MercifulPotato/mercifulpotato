However, I&#x27;m unfamiliar with systems designed to isolate the <i>origin</i> of the fraud. It&#x27;s not hard trace a stolen card number to a dump of cards sold on the dark web, or the identity of a person using it after the theft, but it is quite hard to figure out how that person came into possession of the card. My subjective impression is that first-party theft + usage of stolen payment credentials is rare--they&#x27;re usually passed along (sold) to someone else.')
