I was only absent minded for a moment now they&#x27;re in school&quot;</i><p>If I could turn back time the only thing I&#x27;d change is to appreciate the grind more (all the boring mundane stuff including having my hands up to the elbows in diapers and shit). I would also project a more calm image to my partner and argue less about stuff about the child that anyway sorts itself out (traveling back in time I&#x27;d still be unable tochange their stress-level but I can change my reaction to them, but coincidentally that would also reduce their stress).<p>looking back: these times were the best times ever. my kids are grown up now and I&#x27;m proud of them. but those moments will never return. best is that I don&#x27;t even remember the hard parts. that is I only do if I actively think about it, but usually my focus is just on the good stuff. today all I got left is in my memories so I wish that I&#x27;ve had invested more in living in the moment. cherish the moment especially the bad ones even it friggin sucks most of the time and it seems it&#x27;ll never end ...')
