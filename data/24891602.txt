A large distributed compilation system was created in Google to handle the slow compilation. One reason is you never know if some #include is actually needed.<p>In Golang unused dependencies are a compile-time error. The generated object file includes type information for all related import dependencies in binary format. This speeds up the compilation significantly.')
