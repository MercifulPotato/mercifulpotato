It is common to hear &quot;Partial SPARQL 1.1 support&quot;... or &quot;Partial OWL compatibility&quot; or &quot;A variant of SKOS is supported&quot;.  While it is true that full ECMA6&#x2F;HTTP2&#x2F;IPv6&#x2F;SQL is also rarely provided by implementations, this doesn&#x27;t hinder their use in productive environments. I think it is rare to reach the parts of ECMAscript that aren&#x27;t implemented, or the corners of SQL that Postgres&#x2F;MariaDB don&#x27;t support. In many of the &quot;Semantic Web Stack&quot;, however, one quickly reaches a &quot;not implemented&quot; portion of the 500 page owl standard.')
