Some of it is moving to web but web is not really competitive in terms of performance and integration (lots of legacy COM&#x2F;ActiveX or closed source native libraries to integrate with). The only realistic alternative is using  WinForms (more dead than WPF) or Qt but then you have to hire C++ programmers.<p>It&#x27;s certainly perfomant enough (much faster than web) for complex apps like CAD - the actual editor&#x2F;renderer won&#x27;t be WPF of course but some custom OpenGL&#x2F;Direct3D code.')
