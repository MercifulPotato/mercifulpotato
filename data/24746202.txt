I&#x27;m saying that amp emulation using convolution is cheaper computationally, usually a lot more approachable and way more configurable. Ultimately people use this to make sound, so I&#x27;m commenting on the sound qualities that convolution affords which to me are good enough considering you&#x27;ve already gone digital to model something analog anyway.')
