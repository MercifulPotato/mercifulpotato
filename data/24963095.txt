Sometimes things are overestimated, and other times things are underestimated. However, when you sum them all together, the errors tend to cancel each other out.<p>I&#x27;ve found that upper management doesn&#x27;t care whether any given task actually takes 3 days when we estimate it at 3 days. They just want to see a schedule where each task is estimated to take X days. It communicates that you&#x27;ve really thought through the plan. Then, in terms of results, what they really care about is that we track to the date we committed to for the overall effort.<p>If a senior director is drilling down into a schedule and asking, &quot;Why is this 5-day task taking Bob 7 days to finish?&quot; that&#x27;s a strong signal that it&#x27;s time to change your management.')
