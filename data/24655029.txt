The most egregiously racist judges probably work in districts which they rarely encounter minorities.<p>2. Regions with large minority populations have to deal with much more crime in general, so may have lighter sentences for equally severe crimes.<p>3. Minorities are more likely to plead out and never go to trial, skewing sample size.<p>To be clear, I doubt that state judges are better than federal ones.  After all, criminal justice corruption in smaller towns in America is staggering.  Not too long ago, a judge was indicted for being bribed by the owners of a jail to hand down severe sentences to minority offenders.')
