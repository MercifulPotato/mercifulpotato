IBM selling computers to the Nazi regime in the 30s is often cited a poor political decision on their part.<p>I’m not saying society hasn’t gotten more partisan, but businesses have been doing politics as long as they have been so powerful that their behavior can affect other people significantly. Perhaps there is another reason for this appearance of increased political activity by businesses. Possible explanation include:<p>- Businesses are doing worse politics now then before.<p>- News outlets are better at covering when a business is doing politics.<p>- Public opinion has shifted in what constitutes as bad politics.<p>- Public opinion is better reflected through better journalism.<p>But regardless, I don’t buy it when you say that “people were OK about companies not being political a decade ago”. Ten years ago we were in the middle of the great recession, companies were getting unfounded government bailouts and rich CEOs were being payed massive bonuses despite this. The general public was <i>not</i> happy about this. Receiving government bailout in a middle of a recession is very much participating in politics, we would perceive as such today, and people did so a decade ago.')
