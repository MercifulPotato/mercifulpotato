Don&#x27;t know the details but now we have small amount of farmlands and forests.<p>Turns out, most urban people don&#x27;t fancy to work the land by themselves and those in the villages really suck at the organisation.<p>So my grandma is living in a town, she opted out to keep her land in a cooperative and simply receive some cash at the end of the year each year. Not much money but it&#x27;s free money from her standpoint.<p>My relatives that live in a village opted out to own and work the lands by themselves like most of the other villagers.<p>The result? Villagers fail to organize the crop production, if one year potatoes turn to be very profitable, next year everyone do potatoes and prices tank, someone does tobacco and makes the bank.<p>Cattle production also died out because they failed to integrate into a steady supply chain of a buyer. Companies would be collecting milk and some villagers don&#x27;t hesitate to add water and the companies stop coming. One year everyone is in milk the other year no more milk, everything becomes meat since some construction business gives more money in short term so they need to get rid of the livestock. Tough luck, the milk buying chocolate factory.<p>At the ends, most young people opted out to work in a EU country that pays very well during the season and stay jobless for the rest of the year. Those who managed to get good education completely moved out to the cities or even other countries so no one left to actually work their own farmlands with few exceptions of people who do speciality crops and work like beekeeping.  Most of the farmland got sold to large companies and those who couldn&#x27;t get good education become employees of the farms they once owned.<p>What I am trying to say is, it&#x27;s probably the way it is because the alternative is not viable.  These things need large scale companies, be  it private or governmental.')
