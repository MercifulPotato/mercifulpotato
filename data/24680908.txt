Item(by='curryst', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601834391, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24674652, text='&gt; Once you figure out how to really effectivity use it you can be productive and build out some huge websites and it&#x27;s fast as hell.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt that, but a site that is a) huge, and b) doesn&#x27;t require interactivity seems rather niche to me.  SSG&#x27;s really shine to me on small sites, and to some degree mid-sized ones.  Code documentation is a good example, where I made some new library at work and now I want to dump some nice documentation somewhere.  It&#x27;s only a few pages, all I need is a way to convert Markdown to HTML in a semi-pleasing format, and have the SSG handle creating an index or ToC sidebar so people can navigate.<p>Hugo sucks for this.  The templating language is Go&#x27;s, which I don&#x27;t care for much, and doesn&#x27;t seem to be very widely used outside of Hugo.  So now I have to learn a DSL just to use Hugo, which is unlikely to be useful for anything else, ever.<p>The templating language also seems to change constantly.  I feel like every time I update Hugo, I have to go find a new theme, because now I get 10,000 warnings that they&#x27;re going to redo the whole template API, and like 7 things my theme is doing aren&#x27;t compatible with their new API.  Of course, someone will say that I can build my own theme.  And you&#x27;re right!  If I want to go become an expert in this esoteric DSL so I can figure out how to iterate over pages to build my ToC. Plus now that I&#x27;m building a theme, part of me starts wondering if it wouldn&#x27;t be easier to just hand-write the HTML.<p>These NodeJS site generators are at least an order of magnitude easier to work with.  I get code completion, so I don&#x27;t have to try to remember all the various built-in and custom macros.  I get unit tests, so when I change something in my theme, I can test it.  I find that it&#x27;s easier to genericize things from tutorials as well.  If I want to add a navigation sidebar to all my pages, I just need a tutorial that shows me where I hook into the base page template (i.e. add a customizePageTemplate() call when you instantiate the renderer or something).  From there I can use code completion and docs to figure out what I have access to to do the things I want.  Again, that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a familiar domain.  If I want to do the same thing in Hugo, I pretty much need a tutorial specifically dedicated to customizing the base page templates.  Even if someone tells me where to customize it, I end up having issues because the things you can access inside Hugo depend on where you are in the rendering pipeline, and Hugo&#x27;s templating language doesn&#x27;t make it easy to tell what you have access to at the moment.<p>I do admire their speed, but I have had effectively no situations where I have a site that is both large enough to be worth learning the DSL, and simultaneously doesn&#x27;t require anything that Hugo makes difficult.')
