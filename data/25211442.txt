These are just different verticals, so what you need is somebody who decides to integrate them into a cohesive final product. For that, the integrator will need to base off intermediate implementations of each vertical (or have huge resources to reinvent the respective wheels from scratch...)<p>Like for example OpenVidu [0] offers a platform over which standards-based video-conference products can be written. It takes care of WebRTC stuff, STUN&#x2F;TURN&#x2F;ICE shenanigans, user permissions, recordings, etc. so you can focus on e.g. building native apps with your desired chat solution. And even then, it in turn delegates the low-level WebRTC media transmission to Kurento, of which (disclaimer) I&#x27;m the current developer and maintainer.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openvidu.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openvidu.io&#x2F;</a>')
