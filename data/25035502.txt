There&#x27;s a lot of proprietary software that&#x27;s</i><p><i>&gt; - high usage - high protection - high profit</i><p><i>&gt; What&#x27;s the argument that OSS software (which you could use for free indefinitely until you gain profitability) is somehow not capable of the same?</i><p>Software that meets those criteria also has an organization that spends quite a lot on sales and marketing. Stimulation of usage and extraction of revenue doesn&#x27;t happen on its own.<p>More explicitly, if an already-profitable organization can&#x27;t use the software without paying on day zero, quite a lot of effort has to be expended to get them to make the leap, hence the long enterprise sales cycle. You can do it with just marketing if you keep the purchase price low (ie. below what a department manager is allowed to spend using a corporate credit card).<p>Open source can circumvent this to an extent, but to do so it has to allow businesses to use the software for free, and convert a percentage of those users to paying <i>voluntarily</i>.<p>Whether the mechanism of conversion is consulting and customization services, hosting services, support services, dual licensing, an &#x27;enterprise&#x27; version with specific features, or something else is immaterial, they are never just paying for exactly what they were getting for free. The closest a business will come to that is employing developers to work on the open-source software, or at least allowing employees to work on the software during work hours.<p>The specific licensing-only approach you&#x27;re outlining will only work in a very narrow case: A new unprofitable company starts using the software for free, and starts paying once they cross over to profitability (at which point they might decide to switch to using something else, instead). Note that there are some very large VC-fueled companies that have yet to be profitable. Convincing an already profitable business to pay at the outset just can&#x27;t be done without the aforementioned marketing and sales.')
