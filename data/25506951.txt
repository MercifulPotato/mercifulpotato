This has always been a paradox in education: It thrives on freedom, yet freedom comes with the freedom to abuse it.<p>My view is that higher education comes with the flexibility to apply it towards your own use, which you have to decide. If that use is empty &quot;signaling,&quot; so be it. If you want a real education, it&#x27;s probably there for the taking.<p>Choosing a use for you would make education more paternalistic, and possibly not solve the problem of signaling anyway.<p>I did the same thing as you are doing, because I had a view of education that came from my family culture. Having no adult responsibilities and being taught higher math and physics for the same price as what my friends were paying for sociology and religion courses seemed like the <i>ultimate</i> cheat. What you learn will be of more lasting importance than your grades, and in any event, employers know the difference between the bird courses and the ones with real meat on the bones.')
