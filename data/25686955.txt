It seemed to be that they had evolved in ways that were deeply constrained by physics&#x2F;mechanical&#x2F;electrical engineering, and that there were all kinds of things about their design that was just unnecessary baggage from their crude history.<p>Two decades later, I understand how that evolutionary process actually instilled those designs with all kinds of subtle knowledge about process, intent, workflow, and even desire. It turns out that the precise placement of knobs, and even their diameter and resistance-to-motion, rather than being arbitrary nonsense derived from the catalog of available parts, rather precisely reflect what needs to be done.<p>Don&#x27;t be so quick to dismiss your physical form or the subtle wisdom that evolution can imbue.<p>There&#x27;s also the whole &quot;situated action&quot; sub-field of AI, which is centered around the idea that humans build themselves physical environments to embody and maintain knowledge in order to reduce computational load during decision making.')
