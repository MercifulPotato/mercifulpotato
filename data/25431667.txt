At the same time, I gained computational performance.<p>At some point, I was looking at the spectrum of the key sounds and I think that almost the entire signal is in the lower few kHz. It might be just my keyboard - not sure.<p>I still have the tool, so I can easily check if there is some high-frequency portion that I am missing.')
