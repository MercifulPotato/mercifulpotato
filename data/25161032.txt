We are social creatures. All of the joy has been taken out of routine daily activities. Putting on a mask at the supermarket entrance as if you&#x27;re about to enter some contaminated danger zone. Being unable to give a friendly smile to people as you pass them. I am 100% sure it&#x27;s affecting my mental health, and I can&#x27;t be the only one. In online discussion, these concerns get brushed aside as if they are the complaints of a spoiled child: &quot;stop being a Karen and put a damn mask on...&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not some science denier. It seems logical that a barrier over the mouth and nose must limit how far droplets can travel. As I understand it, empirical evidence also supports this (when the mask is worn by an infected person). There may be some (weak) evidence that masks also protect a non-infected wearer, despite this study.<p>But the size of the effect can&#x27;t be <i>that</i> big. Here in the UK mask compliance is high, yet we&#x27;re well into our second wave. So in the real world, masks can&#x27;t be doing all that much. (Or, most of the infections are happening in mask-free places such as between family members in the home).<p>So maybe I&#x27;m just another &quot;Karen&quot;, but I want more evidence that I&#x27;m enduring the costs of mask-wearing for a good reason.<p>In the meantime, I&#x27;ll keep wearing my mask because it seems to keep everyone else happy, but I&#x27;m continually disappointed by the lack of nuanced discussion about this.')
