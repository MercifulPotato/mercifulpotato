Combined with the immense cost of hoarding massive amounts of physical cash, there aren&#x27;t many options left.<p>While a corporate bond can go sour and a government bond may well be legally wiped out, a mortgage is at least collateralized with the property. Assuming that that the negative interest rate regime continues - which it most likely will - property prices will be driven up even further. Even if the mortgage goes into default, the repossessed property may end up being worth even more at that point.')
