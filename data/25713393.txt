DuckDuckGo, I think the climate is a more important issue and I figure at least Ecosia is based in the EU where they&#x27;re more likely to comply with the GDPR. 99% of my searches can be found by any engine and it&#x27;s trivial to add a shortcut to other engines, so I don&#x27;t base my default choice on search results (within reason of course).<p>That&#x27;s my reasoning around the two common issues anyway.')
