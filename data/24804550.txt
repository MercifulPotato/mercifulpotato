To my understanding, people had difficulty to understand one another when they came from another valley. That limited the utility and Castilian (aka Spanish) was often used which put pressure on the language. And what words do you learn then at school? And what do teachers learn? And what is used at the university?\nAnd all the media, in which form will it be?<p>Romansh didn&#x27;t standardise (or better said the standardisation didn&#x27;t took hold) and faces that difficulty.<p>I bet you&#x27;ll find a similar story in Irish Gaelic.')
