That could kill consumer PC&#x27;s entirely, which would be very bad for the future of Windows.<p>For this to happen Apple would have to fill in MANY, MANY niches, especially cheaper ones. Apple does not and will not fill those. Well, &quot;never say never&quot;, but I don&#x27;t expect them to sell a $400 laptop, all accessories included (so no sneaky $400 laptop with semi-mandatory accessories which bring the price to $700).')
