Not even using them for that long - perhaps just 2 or 3 hours total spread out across the working day at &quot;normal&quot; volume levels for meetings (not even music)<p>Cut out wearing QC35s for a day or two and the ringing goes away at night.<p>Do noise-cancelling headphones from the likes of Bose et all &quot;collapse&quot; the sound waves via interference so that the sound waves that do reach my ear are physically lesser, or is it just merely masking noise with anti-noise, and so now I get twice the noise energy pumped into my ears even if I cannot actually hear it as much?')
