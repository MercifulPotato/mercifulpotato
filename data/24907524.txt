Requiring some level of investigative work before publishing potential election-changing &quot;news&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem at all controversial to me.<p>Social media companies already have undue influence over our democracy. I think we&#x27;ve already seen the damage they can do when they take a hands-off approach. There is no action they can take (or not take) that will not have major political implications. Do nothing and misinformation spreads like wildfire, likely first by bad-faith actors then by good and bad-faith actors. But doing something is fraught. Yet, I advocate for trying something over keeping one&#x27;s hand off the till as we&#x27;re talking about the real world here, and it is marginalized and under-served communities that ultimately pay the price.')
