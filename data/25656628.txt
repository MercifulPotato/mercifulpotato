Has not been interested at all in programming after that.<p>Daughter did some scratch and some web programming and then got bored.<p>Lego Mindstorms - son built through the robots that were included and then got bored.<p>Hour of code (both) - did some basic exercises and then got bored.<p>Both love to build stuff in Minecraft and enjoy making quite elaborate machines there (elaborate in the context of Minecraft).<p>Both are doing fairly well in school. Programming just does not seem to be intrinsically interesting to them. And that&#x27;s just fine.<p>Basic language skills and math is far more important for professionals when they get to workforce rather than low level tinkering in the general context. If they don&#x27;t show inbuilt desire to program I don&#x27;t see any reason why I should push them there. I started programming only after turning 20 and have a pretty good career at it. If you love programming it&#x27;s never too late to start :)')
