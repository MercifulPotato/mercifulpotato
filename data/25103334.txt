This is known as dissent. If you are an American your country is founded on dissent.<p>That why I gave you the the Rothbard quote (not a conspiracy theorist btw but an Anarcho Capitalist) because it specifically talks about how dissenters are dismissed. You are doing exactly that. You should be very worried when large media organisations and news are talking about &quot;fact checking&quot; and &quot;stopping mis-information&quot;. What they are really saying is that they wish to silence dissenters.')
