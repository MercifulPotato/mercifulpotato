Honestly it is a bit creepy to me. I can understand saving special texts (especially for a short time period) but it seems weird to me that people want to save texts from a year ago that talk about what I had for breakfast. There&#x27;s something I&#x27;m not getting here, can someone enlighten me? Like I&#x27;ve never searched my texts for something that is more than a few weeks old. Any further back than that and I just directly ask the person (it is way faster).')
