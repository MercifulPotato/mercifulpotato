That&#x27;s a pretty rich. It&#x27;s only &#x27;tame&#x27; because of the police treated these (mostly white) protestors with kid gloves, and because the barricaded doors allowed a safe retreat of the congresspeople. Your portrayal of the shooting of a woman actively trying to smash into the floor of the senate with the senators and VPOTUS inside as equatable to police brutality is laughable. These people were trying (fruitlessly) to stage a violent subversion of democracy and openly threatened the highest elected officials in the nation.')
