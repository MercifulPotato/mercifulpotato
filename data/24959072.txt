Exelon considered building two new reactors in Texas in 2005, he says, when gas prices were $8&#x2F;MMBtu and were projected to rise to $13&#x2F;MMBtu. At that price, the project would have been viable with a CO2 tax of $25 per ton. “We’re sitting here trading 2019 gas at $2.90 per MMBtu,” he says; for new nuclear power to be competitive at that price, a CO2 tax “would be $300–$400.” Exelon currently is placing its bets instead on advances in energy storage and carbon sequestration technologies.')
