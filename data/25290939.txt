Worst-case scenario that winds up in landfills instead of being recycled.<p>It&#x27;s a problem even if it ends up in landfills. Plastics can leach chemicals into groundwater. My point is that the &quot;Asian countries are responsible for most of the world&#x27;s pollution&quot; narrative is simplistic and unhelpful. Most of the plastic in the oceans is indeed from Asian countries. But plastic concentrations are 4-20x higher on land than in the oceans. The United States has the highest tapwater contamination rate in the world (94%).<p>&gt; The problem in Asia is 100% domestic, with citizens and households and apartment buildings dumping their local plastic trash on the side of the road, burning it in backyards, dumping it in the river.<p>You&#x27;re of course correct to point out that this happens, but calling the problem 100% domestic is disingenuous.')
