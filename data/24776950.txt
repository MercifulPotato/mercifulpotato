I know that I&#x27;m very unlikely to start watching a show if I know that it never reaches a satisfying conclusion. This in turn might create some &quot;dead inventory&quot; for Netflix, shows that people are reluctant to start watching because they&#x27;re unfinished.<p>Although there&#x27;s cliffhanger and cliffhanger. Santa Clarita Diet for instance technically ends on a cliffhanger, but it&#x27;s a last minute event that&#x27;s supposed to introduce what they thought would be the next season. If you ignore the last scene basically every important plot thread up until that point is either wrapped up or at a status quo, so it&#x27;s not such a terrible place to end a show.<p>An other recent example is The Boys: while the show did get renewed for a third season the ending of season 2 could easily be a show final, you&#x27;d just have to get rid of the last couple of scenes introducing a cliffhanger for season 3.<p>Conversely you have shows that clearly couldn&#x27;t wrap their storyline in a satisfactory way before they were canceled. GLOW is unfortunately in this boat.')
