My only objection is that the rollout is way too slow, and the first step is only a baby step. What we have now is essential a 0day situation.<p>Unfortunately a lot of commenters completely misunderstand the proposal, as well as the attacks it is designed to mitigate. Here&#x27;s a good paper describing the issue, &quot;Attacking the internal network from the public Internet using a browser as a proxy&quot;:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forcepoint.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;resources&#x2F;files&#x2F;report-attacking-internal-network-en_0.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forcepoint.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;resources&#x2F;fil...</a><p>The &quot;HTTPS&quot; part of Google&#x27;s proposal is a bit of a red herring, as I said, only a baby step.
