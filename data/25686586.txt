That&#x27;s how Bittorrent works, and it&#x27;s very scalable and open. Emerging protocols can add privacy. Solid is another effort in this direction, where any third party could host your data. Finding ways back to that (since it&#x27;s more or less how things worked pre tech giants) offers a lot of solutions. The tech giants could even pivot (or be forced to pivot) to this approach, which is simply about being less captive on particular ecosystems. It&#x27;s not even the grand vision of rich interoperability that doesn&#x27;t depend on backroom deals, which is what we should be talking about now.')
