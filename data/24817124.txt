Or maybe you spent all day on it and haven&#x27;t found anything that&#x27;s quick to fix: You fix up a couple of small inefficiencies and speed up the feature by 2%. You write down your findings and at least now the team will know that optimising that feature will be a larger undertaking and should be estimated as such.<p>I have also done it for very edge case bugs where no one is really sure what the cause is and fixing it is not high priority. You might get lucky and work it&#x2F;fix it quickly; but if you don&#x27;t, then at least you&#x27;re not spending a week when the remaining 4 days could&#x27;ve been spent on something of higher priority.')
