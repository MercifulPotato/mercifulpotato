The idea would be to build the &quot;ship&quot; under ground, <i>in</i> a hilltop in the middle of nowhere. It would isolate the rooms from the outside sound (trees and wind and animals can still be noisy). Lowerdeck portholes would have large, LED lightboards shadowboxed behind them to draw stars streaking by (I know it&#x27;s not physically accurate, but it&#x27;s still part of the Star Trek visual). The &quot;bridge&quot; at the top of the hill could have an observation skylight&#x2F;porthole like the Enterprise has. On a clear night, you&#x27;d look up and out and see nothing but stars. There&#x27;d be at least one, large, CAVE VR system for a holodeck. We&#x27;d hire one of those bartenders who mixes dry ice into drinks. Maybe even setup a 3D food printer.')
