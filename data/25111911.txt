I bough some concrete repair spackle, they saw it in the cart and suggested all of the other tools I needed (degreasers, cleaning brooms, chisel, sandpaper) that I would need as well.  Which is extremely nice because the rest of their site sucks.  Amazon also seems to have a nice book recommendation system.<p>Just as a contrast to most of the targeted ads which are mostly a waste of time.')
