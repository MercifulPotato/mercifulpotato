That was not reflected in death counts 14 days later. I suggest waiting and seeing, there are other reasons why the number of cases may be skyrocketing, including broader access to testing. More testing will increase the denominator without increasing the numerator.<p>Keep in mind that giant spike in cases in July led to a <i>reduction</i> in COVID deaths in August and September according to the charts.<p>Case counts and death counts have been materially diverging for months now, because the early results were marred by adverse selection bias. With few tests available, testing was only done at the point of admission for critically ill patients, who naturally were the most likely to die of COVID. With broader availability of tests, the full picture starts to come into focus.<p>It&#x27;s worth paying attention of course, and not hand-waving the spike, but let&#x27;s not pre-judge yet. We&#x27;ll have to see what this spike means in the fullness of time.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wwwnc.cdc.gov&#x2F;eid&#x2F;article&#x2F;26&#x2F;6&#x2F;20-0320_article" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wwwnc.cdc.gov&#x2F;eid&#x2F;article&#x2F;26&#x2F;6&#x2F;20-0320_article</a>')
