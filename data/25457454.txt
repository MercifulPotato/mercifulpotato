French tends to have words that are pronounced the same but are written differently thanks to all the silent letters and combinations that are pronounced the same:<p>vers, verre, vert.<p>mer, m√®re, maire.<p>In writing you can usually do away with all the accents (many of them are grammatical or the strictly correct spelling but without changing the pronunciation and with little change of the &#x27;look&#x27; of the word) without problems.')
