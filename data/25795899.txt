It is constantly broken and basically entirely relies on a single browser engine controlled entirely by one of the largest organizations on the planet. It has well known security footguns at every turn.<p>It isn&#x27;t even unprecedented. Way back in the 90s Another World used a bytecode VM for portability between hardware platforms. It ran on a whole lot of them and had input, graphics, and sound. Before that Infocom used a VM for its text adventures that was ported to many platforms. P-Code existed before that. The modern web browser, and web code, is a jankier, significantly more complicated, design-by-intertia&#x2F;committee&#x2F;def-facto-monopoly hybrid monstrosity. It&#x27;s a document viewer with incoherent bits glued on until it kinda almost works like an application platform.<p>&gt; Think of all the layers of abstraction and code that is necessary to have millions of combinations of hardware + software all show the same thing!<p>Not that f&#x27;ing many if you didn&#x27;t engineer your VM like a blind monkey! Cross platform VMs <i>are not a new idea, at all</i>, and that&#x27;s essentially what the modern web is, only it&#x27;s the most Frankenstein version of that idea ever conceived.')
