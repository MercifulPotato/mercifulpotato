Most of the people I&#x27;ve seen get offended for trivial reasons are actually not a racial minority at all.<p>As I said, if a significant number of people are offended (or if a small number are offended for a good reason), we should probably change our language. But if it is a small number of people getting offended at a word used in a context where it has never been offensive, I don&#x27;t think we should accomodate them.')
