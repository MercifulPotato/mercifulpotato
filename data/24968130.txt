Back then, the issue was the lack of screens, so TV were used instead.<p>For educational purposes, the same problem exist today: however, kids will not have a space HDMI screen with a micro HDMI cable.<p>The replacement screen that most people have is different: it&#x27;s a smartphone, as there are more smartphones than TVs.<p>So a &quot;notch&quot; or receptacle on top on the keyboard, to secure a smartphone into place, would be helpful: the use case would be powering the 400 from the smartphone AC adapter (kids may not have a spare adapter matching the pi4 power requirements), plugging the phone into the 400 using a USB cable to keep the phone charged, use the phone as the screen - without it falling out and breaking, or hanging by a cable.<p>Android being finicky, you may not be able to have autodetection&#x2F;USB gadget mode, but a remote desktop solution would go a long way.<p>It is not possible at the moment, given the 400 power requirements, but newer&#x2F;more powerful AC adapters will eventually be more common.<p>This leaves the notch, which you may want to consider in the next revision')
