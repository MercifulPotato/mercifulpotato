Even if it&#x27;s not applicable for x64 due to different instruction set, it should still apply to other ARM vendor.<p>I&#x27;m referring to Anandtech article&#x27;s claim that they have a 8 wide decode (vs. zen 3&#x27;s 4), 600+ estimated ROB and 192KB instruction cache. Note I&#x27;m not a cpu expert but I know these are hugely different from other high performance chips out there.')
