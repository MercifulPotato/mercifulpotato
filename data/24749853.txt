Store heat from the reactor in a heat sink when solar is generating, use the heat to generate power when it isn&#x27;t. That handles the daily load variation and lets you trade half the required nuclear capacity for cheap solar.<p>It also means you have more turbines on site than the reactor needs on its own, so you can add a furnace burning whatever you like (hydrogen, biofuels, synthetic methane), and that handles the days when renewable output is below average.')
