You either make it easy for people to make their own content, sell them content they already want but in a better way, or be the only way they&#x27;re getting that content.  Apple didn&#x27;t try to invent a market for purchasing music when it didn&#x27;t already exist; they said &quot;hey, this is like buying CDs but easier and better.&quot;  Netflix said &quot;hey, all those shows you like? Come watch them at one place with no commercials, on demand.&quot;  Youtube Red&#x2F;Premium&#x2F;Plus&#x2F;Whatever the hell they&#x27;re calling it now is just paying for a better version of the same experience. Whoever invents and patents a way to put a sticker on the side of your head and make you feel like you&#x27;re having sex with a pornstar will make a billion selling it however they want.<p>Quibi picked the worst of every possibility. They weren&#x27;t freer than Youtube. They didn&#x27;t have the library of Netflix. They weren&#x27;t more convenient to watch than either of them.  Quibi would&#x27;ve worked great if it&#x27;d launched in 2007. Now, not so much.')
