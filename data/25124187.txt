I think it&#x27;s a good idea to create an ecosystem around the Proton brand but not at the expense of its major products. Mail and VPN are pretty good on desktop for my usage but Contacts, Calendar, and now Drive are in alpha mode missing the things that would get a lot of user to do a proper switch from its competitors. I wished they&#x27;d focus more on a few produtcs at the time and not launch dozens of them with the bare minimum of features and no mobile apps.<p>To their defense they did release a lot of things to help create that ecosystem (SSO, bridge, mail v4 beta) but I think the drive launch should have happened after having Mail and Calendar out of beta with proper apps.')
