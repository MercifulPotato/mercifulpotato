In 50 years time, it&#x27;s very unlikely <i>anything</i> &#x27;work&#x27; I have done will matter.<p>Leisure activities are only immoral if they hurt yourself or others.  If your activities lead you to become an overweight shut-in in poor health with few friends, sure.  You could make the argument they are immoral.<p>I think you can be a retired dabbler and dilettante and absolutely live a &#x27;good life&#x27;.  At the end of the day, all that matters is that we live lives true to ourselves and our relationships with others.  All of our accomplishments are dust in the wind, and will be forgotten.')
