I&#x27;ve been languishing as a developer for 8 years, and languishing in the existential crisis of what to do with myself for many months. This is literally all I&#x27;ve been thinking about today, after recently having been rejected after 6 interviews. I don&#x27;t know why I continued to pursue frontend&#x2F;SWE as a career despite being terminated from every position I&#x27;ve held in the industry and repeated burnouts. The pay increases every time, and I dodge questions about my former positions as much as possible, but of the last decade I really only have about 3.5 years (generously) of experience. If I think about it, there&#x27;s never really been any clear indication that I&#x27;d be good at the job, aside from being a capable programmer. It&#x27;s really sad, and I don&#x27;t really know how to pivot, because I don&#x27;t really know why I&#x27;m not suited to it, or why I would be to something else. When I got my last job, I joked to my family that hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to bank some of the salary before I get fired in 6 months. 6 months later, and now 8 months ago, I was. Now what? That&#x27;s a tough question to answer, but maybe just letting go of being a software engineer would give me the clarity to find out.')
