To convert them back into function-pointers like the Kotlin example above you really have to go out of your way by deep diving into inspect module. The result is a property-object which is not assignable to a int-variable, but type checking probably wouldn&#x27;t go this deep as inspect naturally is very dynamic in its nature.<p>My guess is Kotlin does this as a way of structural typing, if it walks like a int and talks like an int it is an int.')
