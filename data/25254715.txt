The joinery is usually custom built by necessity, often assisted with a mix of home-built or purchased jigs. The one exception are dowels, which are standard and very generalized. I think that the software analogy might be design patterns.<p>You can also think of lower-level components, like nails and glue, which even more general and standardized than something like a hinge, maybe these are like standard-library or builtins for a language?')
