Strict limitations often lead to a lot of creativity. The Arduboy is one I&#x27;ve used a lot.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Arduboy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Arduboy</a><p>And I guess I&#x27;ll share this here because I don&#x27;t know when else I&#x27;d ever be able to talk about it.<p>A few years ago I created a portable game console that consisted of two buttons (left and right) and a row of 9 LEDs (and an on off switch). It was powered by an Arduino Teensy and Lipo battery, letting it run for a pretty decent amount of time.<p>The idea is given the ultra minimal hardware, what&#x27;s the craziest games you can make with it?<p>I made a 3d &quot;&quot;&quot;ray tracer&quot;&quot; that would show your surroundings and walls using just the leds (flatland style). Left and right turned, and pushing both walked forward.<p>I also made a dungeon crawler with each LED being a specific indicator for the state of the world (I wanted to make overlays to help with ideas like this)<p>The best one imo was an ebook reader. I only simulated it due to code size constraints, but I made each LED blink out morse code for each letter in a book, and used left and right to scroll through it. I loaded Neuromancer in and it worked fine. Pretty ridiculous but one of the more interesting projects I&#x27;ve done! I should really look for that device....')
