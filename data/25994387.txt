The stated reason for this was the propensity for steam and ultrasonic humidifiers to over-humidify.  It&#x27;s entirely possible that the Honeywell is the easiest to clean and most quiet of this type of humidifier.<p>[edit]  Direct quotes from the Wirecutter post (emphasis added by me):<p>&gt; We recommend the Honeywell HCM-350 Germ Free Cool Mist Humidifier because it’s quieter, more durable, and easier to clean than any other <i>evaporative</i> humidifier we’ve tested, with a 1-gallon tank that will last all day.<p>&gt; ...In general, we prefer evaporative humidifiers because we find them less messy and less likely to over-humidify a space; however, you will need to replace the wicking filter on a semi-regular basis, and the fans might not be the best option for people who have pets or particularly dusty homes. The best one for you will be whichever one you’re actually willing to deal with and maintain.')
