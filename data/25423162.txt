(I&#x27;d really discourage using MapQuest&#x27;s web UI, mind you.)<p>If you had used anything but Google, you&#x27;d realize everyone else has these features too.<p>Bear in mind, Bing Maps powers a world-scale reproduction of the world for Flight Simulator... you thought that didn&#x27;t have 3D models of buildings?
