Not involving Commodore code as with OP, but in a tool that transforms XML. A niche use case uses code which fails to escape ampersands into proper entity references. I hope the development team responsoble for said tool can correct that issue ASAP, but it&#x27;s niche-ness gives me anxiety as they are currently moving full steam ahead on a product release. My bug is at least 5 years old - dwarfed by OP&#x27;s 32-year one.')
