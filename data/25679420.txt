An engineer who worked on the system? A manager? What law was broken? If you were in their position, how would you know you were breaking the law?<p>Diffuse responsibility is a real problem. &#x27;Teaching to the test&#x27; is a real problem. Normalizing risk is a real problem.<p>Blaming individuals is very satisfying, and it&#x27;s very easy to do with hindsight, but if you want large complex systems to work better, you have to get over individual blame. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s easy, and I&#x27;m not saying that we should stop looking for law-breakers, but I am saying that punishment will not lead to better outcomes in the absence of other positive actions.')
