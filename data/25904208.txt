Then yes, safety was about redundancies and failsafes. That is actually fairly easy: bring me a list of all components and I can come up with reasonable redundancy schemes for them.<p>Modern systems (including the operation of commercial airliners) are generally already built with reliable and redundant components. Safety problems tend to arise in <i>the interaction between subsystems</i>. That is a problem that can&#x27;t be redundancied away.<p><i>That</i> is also why it&#x27;s close to impossible to work out every conceivable problem, as you say. The number of components is comparatively small compared to the number of ways in which subsystems interact. Especially considering some of those subsystems are in fact humans.')
