To say the least, I can easily imagine it making things worse, where let&#x27;s say, all software has to be written in Java and get a rubber stamp by someone who hasn&#x27;t actually built anything for years, and then still nobody gets held accountable when security breaches happen. Meanwhile, a bunch of college dropouts build something that&#x27;s actually good using bulb, and then just have users sign away their rights in a contract instead of getting their software certified. And most of the world still runs on the Linux kernel which also had no interest in getting certified.<p>It&#x27;s a hard problem.')
