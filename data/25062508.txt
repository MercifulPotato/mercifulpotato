Paper ballots kept in small batches distributed among thousands of precincts that are counted by hand with opposition observers are hard to systematically rig. Bits in a cloud machine somewhere that lose all connection to your action are not.<p>They further handwave away the significance of stealing an election because catastrophic harm would only happen _sometimes_.')
