I&#x27;m not even clear he understands what node is, or what he would gain from being able to use it in the browser, when it can already run Javascript just fine as is.<p>No, Google should stop the show and bring node.js to <i>his</i> browser because he can&#x27;t be bothered to go to Google to look up what a PATH is.<p>I&#x27;m not saying programming can&#x27;t be much more user-friendly; it certainly can be and should. Heck, maybe Chrome would do well to ship with a lightweight IDE to edit code in outside of the console. But the author hasn&#x27;t listed a reason node.js has a place in Chrome natively, and is going on to claim they <i>should</i>. Talk about entitlement.')
