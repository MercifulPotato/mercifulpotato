The major US players, press, finance, industry were all open NAZI supporters. They financed Hitler and the industry to start the war against communism. Eg they gave them free oil patents, took over IG Farben, the chemical industry to produce the needed oil for the tanks to invade Russia. They gave them huge credit lines to overcome the desastrous WW1 reparation payments. They financed the military buildup.<p>All played well for western fascists until Japan sided with Germany to take over China, South East Asia and esp. Singapore. When Singapore was threatened, US changed sides. The US certainly never thought Russia will win over Germany. That was their nightmare scenario. Workers rights, socialism. This would have killed their idea of freedom of private contracts over civil rights. Workers would demand 10 hours workdays. Or even less. Workers demanding their rights couldn&#x27;t just be shot down, as in the Coal wars. Smaller companies threatening the big ones could not just be eliminated by the national guard and army, as in the Texas oil war, and the Railroad commission. The German NAZi system was the big goal of the US industry. A fancy &quot;democracy&quot;, well liked all over the world, with a bright film industry, and a beloved charismatic leader.')
