Here&#x27;s a set of images (just a landscape; not COVID-related) showing different focal lengths[0] in action that illustrates just how much so, taken from the same location.<p>I&#x27;m pretty confident it&#x27;s the same area in the Showa Kinen photos the more I look at them, but that just illustrates how unhelpful an example the chosen images actually were. The huge difference is focal length is effectively the same as shooting an entirely different scene. It&#x27;s not a good example, but it may have just been the only one the editor had available at the time.<p>0. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;capturetheatlas.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;understanding-focal-length-and-camera-zoom.jpg.webp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;capturetheatlas.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;under...</a>')
