Second, I have difficulty writing this exctly because of the last sentence, will do so anyway -<p>I taught myself to program in 1984, two years before finishing high school. That and being on the chess team pretty much killed my social life and any chance at carnal activities until I turned 21 (high school was followed by compulsory consription for 2 years). I struggled with that.<p>Today I note that impressing friends and strangers has become very big business. Influencers. Looked at one this morning on Instagram. This dude had muscles, gave thed impression of owning a Bently, a curvy girlfriend and a house in Majorca. No clue as to how he eant a living or obtained that wealth. Assuming those material posessions are his.<p>These things are the antithesis of what I went through, even though today I have the means to aquire everything from the Bently to the large-breatsed blonde in a house on the Costa Del Sol.<p>And yet that prospect fills me with dread because it&#x27;s vacuous. There&#x27;s no meaning or value behind it. Same goes for teaching someone something for the purpose of becoming popular or impressing others. Seriously please don&#x27;t take this as criticism. ANY time spent with kids is time well spent.<p>I guess where I&#x27;m going with all of this is that I hope to teach my 8y&#x2F;o boy to seek out meaningful, rewarding relationships and experiences that build him up. Without a need for others&#x27; approval. And I have vague ideas how I might do that but in a practical sense I&#x27;m at a loss and that scares me. And I would LOVE to teach him how to program but so far I&#x27;ve made no progress.<p>Part of being a dad I guess. Happily I&#x27;ve discovered that if I want a thing enough I find a way. Patience...')
