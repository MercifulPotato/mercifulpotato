Since the exodus of the Gulenists, the rumors are that Grey Wolves are back in town.<p>Whoever wins, it usually results of abusing their position for political and financial gains and we learn about what happened after the institution changes hands(For example, only after the battle between Erdogan and the Gulenists, evidence came into light of the police involvement of the assassination of an Armenian Journalist, probably intended as a political manipulation).<p>Germany should be very careful, having loyalty to an external charismatic leader and acting as an organisation within an organisation is unfortunately commonplace among Turks. They are not majority but tend to be the more passionate ones.')
