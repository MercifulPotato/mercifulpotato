I tried Defold for prototyping a game concept and was less than impressed.  It got in the way in a framework sense, and didnt seem to provide much bang for buck (ie it consume more hours of my time learning its perculiar ways of doing things than it probably have taken to roll my own).  Of course peoples mileage may vary.  I was expecting things like auto atlassing, batch processing on import, proper layer z-order (versus using a 3d style z value).  I recall the UI did weird stuff like sorting alphabetically, instead of by creation order or z-order.  The message passing thing was annoying.  I guess it was a bad choice for me.  I&#x27;m probably more productive with a library and tools approach, rather than &quot;opinionated&quot; engine.  It felt like someone was caught up in an architecture more suited to creating very large games and applied it here.  It felt like it was created by too many programmers working to a feature list, rather than creating a useful cohesive tool.')
