Someone, somewhere is going to be pushing them to try and maximize the use of this very expensive system they just installed. Politically, they&#x27;ll be very motivated by their superiors to say it&#x27;s super good.<p>And if you aren&#x27;t convinced that hospital admins or TSA or drivers using GPS deferring to computers aren&#x27;t examples of general human behavior, here&#x27;s some more:<p>* A machine learning algorithm detected you were in violation of copyright. Your content has been deleted&#x2F;moderated&#x2F;banned.<p>* A computer graded application process presents your scores to a human, who evaluates your employability, but largely just accepts whether the computer said, &quot;Hire&#x2F;No Hire&quot;.<p>* Ever been denied for a loan for something the computer says?<p>* Ever driven a self-driving car that does <i>most</i> of the work for you, but then you crash into people and things because you just generally trust it to do the right thing and stop paying attention?<p>* A police officer arrested an innocent man, and several people interrogated him based on a bad facial recognition algorithm.

And the closer it gets to good, the more humans will believe it is actually flawless. Humans in the loop absolutely will not fix the flaws with a system like this, as time and time again humans have shown a propensity towards doing the easy thing -- trust the computer.')
