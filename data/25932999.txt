From there you can build a lot of very cool and interesting (and sometimes useful!) stuff!<p>I also like messing with vibration motors with mine, in fact I hate using LED&#x27;s on them so I use that for Hello Worlds :)<p>I dislike tutorials (I&#x27;m a hacker at heart) but there are a lot (589) tutorials&#x2F;projects on the Arduino Robotics project site, a few thousand on the hackaday.io site, or on Hackster.io with a few thousand more!<p>There has never been a better and more beautiful time to get into electronics or robotics! Keep in mind if an idea requires a 3D printer (and you don&#x27;t have access to one), you can usually get by with some hot glue and craft sticks (tongue depressors), also have fun and find things around the house, I use a lot of random plastic containers to build shapes for fun DIY projects, and cardboard and duct tape is always fantastic. Don&#x27;t let anything stop you from building and having fun with it!')
