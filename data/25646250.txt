I take one caffeine pill in the morning and another at noon. It&#x27;s so much easier and cheaper than drinking coffee (less than $10 for an entire month), and unlike coffee or tea, it doesn&#x27;t stain my teeth! My sleep seems fine, since I don&#x27;t take any caffeine later in the day, but the dosage is still sufficient to maintain my &quot;addiction&quot; without withdrawal symptoms.<p>The only downside is the rare occasion when I forget to take caffeine at noon. This happened once a couple months ago, and it made me feel like complete crap, the equivalent of a bad hangover, until I took caffeine again. The experience reinforced my feeling that quitting &quot;cold turkey&quot; is never worth it. Who has a whole week, or even days to spare to be miserable and unproductive? Should I take a &quot;vacation&quot; for that?<p>Obviously it would have been preferable to not become addicted to caffeine in the first place. I blame graduate school for that. But given the fact that I am addicted, it seems to be a relatively harmless addiction compared to most others.<p>I think of caffeine now explicitly as addiction maintenance. I only take it on a schedule and don&#x27;t use it as an alertness aid. The latter is the dangerous path leading to increased dosages and diminishing returns. I just take a minimum regular dosage to avoid withdrawal symptoms.')
