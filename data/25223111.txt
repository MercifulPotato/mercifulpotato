It&#x27;s used quite a bit by programming language theorists and category theorists to prove their mathematical theorems in a real language. It&#x27;s not trendy or experimental, although some parts are one or both. There are about 5 ways to do everything in Haskell, but that&#x27;s not bad once you understand it. It&#x27;s not a language you can just pickup in a weekend and easily Google questions about, it&#x27;s generally used for applications that require some higher level of data and quality assurance, from a fully proven program using Coq to simply a program that&#x27;s easier to use equatorial reasoning on, like industrial processes or stream processing pipelines.<p>Erlang has been around about as long. It&#x27;s also not trendy, and it&#x27;s designed for telecommunications applications, where the extremely distributed actor model is great. Others might try to shoehorn it everywhere, mostly via elixir, but it&#x27;s a very reasonable language for many uses, like chat programs or distributed in memory stores.<p>You might want to understand something before you crap all over it, everything exists for a reason, try to figure out the reason.')
