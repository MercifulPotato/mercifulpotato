Half the point of FOSS is that you don&#x27;t have to keep track of licenses and compliance, as the periodic sob stories on HN&#x2F;Slashdot about &quot;Oh no, I got audited and wasn&#x27;t in compliance and had to pay.  I&#x27;m going to switch everything to FOSS; that&#x27;ll show them!&quot; show.')
