He experienced symptoms 36-48 hours after the injection that have him convinced that he got an active vaccine dose. He has (by my judgment not his words) altered his routines as a result. That seems a mechanism by which the blinding can be undone (though in this case, it would seem to work against computed vaccine efficacy rather than for it).')
