In few noncorrupt countries, the effect of 3G on government approval is actually positive.&quot;<p>So the internet is good for democracy even at the maxima?<p>Also censorship works well &quot;Government approval falls with the expansion of 3G only when there is no internet censorship.&quot;<p>Neither I believe to be true. Censorship allows management of the population and will work, but it&#x27;s hard, there should be some drop.<p>Anyway for corrupt governments without censorship I agree with the document and Starlink will sort it all out soon and bring in a few revolutions')
