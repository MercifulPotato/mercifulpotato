You’re the CTO, you are one of a small team of leaders with biggest stake in company, and supposed to be part of these discussions. Even before your official start day and especially day one.<p>So what was it? They knew this was likely to happen but didn’t tell you because they were afraid you’d back out? They are unethical, liars, untrustworthy, I quit.<p>They didn’t see this coming because the VP of Sales never flagged it as a risk? Ok, the Vp of Sales is either not being transparent or us incompetent, either way fire them, or I quit.<p>The execs at the top of a small startup need to be a team, brutally honest and transparent with each other. No hiding information, working together to solve problems.<p>Or I quit.')
