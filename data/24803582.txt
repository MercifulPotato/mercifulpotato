However, since Red is highly dynamic, compiler cannot preserve semantics across the whole language, so it keeps some parts for the interpreter to process at run-time. And sometimes that&#x27;s the only option, since code can be generated on-the-fly or pulled over the network: Red is homoiconic and has quite powerful meta-programming facilities on top of that.')
