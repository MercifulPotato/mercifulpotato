And donâ€™t know if Mmhmm would perform any better on it.<p>The new MacBook Air and Pro models with the M1 chip on the other hand I think from what I have heard make video encoding really fast. Would love to hear from anyone using OBS on one of these models, which machine you have and how OBS has been for you.')
