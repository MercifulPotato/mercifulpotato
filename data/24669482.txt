I do however think that this could also backfire. I entirely agree with the comment made on the PR by sylveon <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;digitalocean&#x2F;hacktoberfest&#x2F;pull&#x2F;596#issuecomment-702986348" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;digitalocean&#x2F;hacktoberfest&#x2F;pull&#x2F;596#issue...</a><p>I&#x27;m not a fan of this change because:<p>- It significantly reduces the pool of repos that you can PR to. I&#x27;ve contributed to repos which haven&#x27;t explicitly opted in to Hacktoberfest this year and in the past as well. Repos in which I am more comfortable contributing in than some random GitHub search result for the &quot;hacktoberfest&quot; tag. With this change, I am forced to look into those, or convince the maintainers to tag their repos.<p>- For intermediate or experienced programmers it voids the whole event because the vast majority of OSS projects won&#x27;t get involved.<p>- After the spam fest that this year was, people aren&#x27;t inclined to add the tag to their repos because it paints a target for spam over them.<p>- Maintainers can now gatekeep your contributions, so even if it&#x27;s something meaningful the maintainer can deny you a +1 PR for your work. It can be frustrating spending a non-insignificant amount of time to get the t-shirt the right way and then have that time nullified.<p>- It doesn&#x27;t address &quot;hello world&quot; spam repos. In fact, it encourages them because of the reduced amount of repos available to contribute to.')
