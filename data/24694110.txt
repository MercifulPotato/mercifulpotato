First time I used Zoom. This was yeeears before it became an issue that they don&#x27;t encrypt communications and I brought it up that I thought it was weird they&#x27;re relying on third-parties for something that felt... vague but also security related?<p>In order to suss out exactly what apprehensions I was having about their corporation (forgive me, I knew they were operated by Peter Thiel and this and all that but I was willing giving to give them a fair shake since I was a lot younger and a lot more naive), basically what I asked was a simple question, &quot;what exactly does Palantir do? Because I have read your marketing and releases and everything but I&#x27;d like to hear it straight from the horse&#x27;s mouth with an employee.&quot;<p>&quot;We leverage data.&quot;<p>Oh I see! Well it&#x27;s 12:00PM and I see we&#x27;re out of time, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me and looking forward to next steps.<p>I never hear back and spent the next few weeks horrified by the interaction.<p>Addendum: What got me the interview was the fact that I studied under one of the chief scientists behind PredPol. I understood how the technology worked and the basic logistics of how to implement it. Regardless of whether I believed in it, I knew how it worked. I think that&#x27;s what they were after.')
