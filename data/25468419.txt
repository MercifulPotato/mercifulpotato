Only towards the end of my formal education have I begun to learn the same thing. In many ways, I’m still biased towards just reading things —- partly because implementing something and running into issues I feel I’m not knowledgeable enough to solve&#x2F;failing really bugs me —- but I’m gradually learning that failure is just part of the learning process, and doesn’t imply I’m incapable of doing something.<p>I’m definitely going to try it out over the break! :)')
