You can tell that&#x27;s different because nobody <i>preemptively</i> censors defamation - it&#x27;s a suit brought after-the-fact and then argued.  Skipping it...<p>No.  If &quot;real danger Democracy can be lost&quot; is your measuring stick, then whatever &quot;Democracy&quot; you have in charge is free to defend itself against any speech that may fight it.  It&#x27;s <i>free license for the government to shoot down dissent</i> and not reasonable.<p>Think of it this way.  There is a lot of harmful speech which, in a perfect world, we could prevent.  But because power corrupts, we cannot afford to give out the power to prevent speech because it is too easily abused.  The benefit of preventing [harmful speech x] is not worth the cost of granting the government the power to jail you for speaking counter to what it believes is right.')
