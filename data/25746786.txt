The two points are visible at the same time if the derivative of the sphere&#x27;s surface and the side of the triangle between a point form a positive angle (the derivative intersects the triangle at a point other than the points).<p>So the question then becomes &quot;if the two points are poles, what does that mean&quot;; easy, if the two points are poles and they&#x27;re only visible if the surface derivative is within the triangle, the angle between the observer, the point and the other point must be 90°. This must hold for both points as the solution is symmetric. However, there is no well defined triangle that has two angles of 90° inside.<p>So the solution is &quot;doesn&#x27;t work&quot; (or possibly infinite distance).')
