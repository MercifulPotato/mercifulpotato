They became universities many years after the initial founding&#x2F;charter, but they didn&#x27;t start out as universities.<p>&gt; Perhaps one should ask: how can we create an educational (or other) institution which will last for 1000 years?<p>By allowing the institutions to adapt, grow and change with the times. Or maybe in certain instances, it&#x27;s simply better to shut things down and start anew.')
