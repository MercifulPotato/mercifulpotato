Perhaps in its use, but not the code.</i><p>Nobody but other devs cares about the simplicity of the code if the code works.<p>&gt;<i>The code and hosting requirements are, frankly, Frankenstein&#x27;s monster levels of frightening.</i><p>Huh? Wordpress&#x2F;PHP hosting requirements are the easiest to meet in the industry. Not to mention the most widely available...<p>&gt;<i>~~You have to~~ WP expect you to install it such that it can modify its install folders - all of them. Security-fucking-nightmare.</i><p>Yeah, so? It&#x27;s self-updatable. Use a dedicated user&#x2F;group.<p>&gt;<i>It falls apart under any kind of load, both because of unoptimized DB queries, and because of PHP.<p>Absolutely not &quot;because of PHP&quot;. If anything PHP is faster than both Ruby and Python, two other common choices.<p>&gt;</i>You have to put a cache in front of it to be able to handle getting on HN, let alone Reddit.*<p>That&#x27;s the case with most CMS, PHP or not.<p>&gt;<i>Arbitrary plugin installation, in a non-sandboxed environment (see prior point about an application-writable install).</i><p>It only happens if you chose to do it. Plugins don&#x27;t magically install by themselves.<p>So it&#x27;s not much different than any environment where you can download a jar, a python package, a ruby gem, etc and have them add functionality into the CMS.<p>&gt;<i>Need more be said?</i><p>More, no. Better, yes.')
