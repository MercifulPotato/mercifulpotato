Item(by='chrisweekly', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602681455, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24774899, text='Came here to post same.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;every-layout.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;every-layout.dev</a> is a game-changer. The free content is a goldmine, and having spent $100 for the complete set of reated materials (book, component generator, etc) I can say I&#x27;ve gotten easily 10x that value out of it, maybe more. Hands-down the best CSS-related resource I&#x27;ve encountered since starting my career in web dev in 1998 (ie, before CSS was created).')
