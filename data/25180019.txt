I think there&#x27;s some implied subtext &quot;that is actually fast enough for my needs&quot;.<p>He&#x27;s currently running a 32 core Ryzen desktop CPU, an upgrade he consciously chose over a lesser chip for its improved build speeds. He&#x27;s also lamented poor screen quality and resolutions before, and I imagine the PBP&#x27;s would not impress him.<p>The Air is notable because its processor can run build jobs (like compiling the Linux kernel) in stellar times. While the RK3399 has dual A72s and should be ... better than, say, the pinephone, I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;s closer to 2010~ish core 2 duos in performance.')
