In fact, any business critical service, such as GitHub and cloud hosting providers should have national or at least continental providers. Nobody would complain if China was to develop its own national electric grid or telecommunications infrastructure, because it seems obvious that these services shouldn’t be at the whim of a foreign nation. Guess what, cloud infrastructure powering million dollar businesses fall in the same category. The US has lost all trust to us, not just to Eastern nations but also in Europe we don’t want to expose ourselves unnecessarily anymore.')
