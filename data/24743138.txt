Preignition is when the fuel combusts before the cylinder is at the &quot;ready&quot; point in its cycle (wherever that is for your car, with variable timing and all that).<p>As others have said, your manual will tell you, but a good rule of thumb is if you don&#x27;t have a high performance vehicle or an engine with a turbo or supercharger, 87 should be fine.')
