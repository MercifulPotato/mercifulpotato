There are charities that do exactly what you claim they don&#x27;t do. For example, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.againstmalaria.com&#x2F;Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.againstmalaria.com&#x2F;Default.aspx</a> maps each donation to a specific bed net distribution, then gives you a status page (that you can share with others!), which tells you exactly what stage your distribution is at.<p>For example, I can see that one of my donations is currently in the manufacturing stage, one is on a boat travelling to the country, and one is being distributed to households right now.<p>After the distribution is complete, they&#x27;ll post pictures from that distribution, as well as conduct follow up surveys in a few months, to ensure effective use. All this information is shared with the donor directly.')
