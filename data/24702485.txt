Retrieving a gun doesn&#x27;t take 5 minutes.<p>Let <i>t</i> be the time at which the hogs arrive.<p>I can sprint from my basement to the top floor in a bit over 5 seconds.  I can find something in a closet in about 5 more seconds.  That&#x27;s about 12-13 seconds to having a gun in my hands, but let&#x27;s account for opening the gun safe and fumbling around for magazines.  The clock is now showing t+30.<p>Let&#x27;s now assume the gun isn&#x27;t loaded.  I&#x27;m probably a bit stressed by all of this, but almost anyone can load a magazine-fed rifle in 5 seconds.  t+35s.<p>Now I have two choices:<p>1. Open the bedroom window (~3s), take aim (~2s) and fire.  =&gt; t+40s<p>2. Sprint down to the ground floor (~3s), run out the back door (~2s), get into a shooting position (~3s), aim (~2s) and fire.  =&gt; t+45s<p>A conservative estimate has me shooting hogs in 45 seconds.  If I live in a place where this is a problem, I&#x27;m also likely to take steps to prepare.  I might keep the gun safe in a more accessible place (e.g. the garage).  I might store the firearm in the gun safe with a magazine already seated in the well.  I might keep my eyes open and notice the hogs at a distance, giving me the time to fetch a gun sans the frenzy.  In some parts of the world, it&#x27;s common to keep a rifle at hand when outside.<p>I don&#x27;t live in a part of the world where I have to deal with feral hogs, but this doesn&#x27;t strike me as a &quot;gratuitous excuse to shoot 30-50 feral hogs&quot;.  Nor does it strike me as diagnostic of unsafe firearm handling, as others have suggested.<p>-- \nEDIT\n--<p>The most worrying thing here is the idea of shooting in a place where little kids were running around&#x2F;playing just moments ago.  While this kind of situation <i>can</i> be handled safely, it&#x27;s also where dramatic accidents tend to happen.  A big problem with firearms handling is that it&#x27;s a perishable skill.  You forget.  You get rusty.')
