I found out from the developers of that application that they had been rejected from the App Store because their app used too much CPU power. Apparently you&#x27;re meant to just use the phone for decoration?<p>Google has some similarly nonsense policies (good luck finding a good adblocker on the Play Store), but at least it takes all of five seconds to circumvent that. Apple allowing competing app stores while still having complete control over the content available on them does very little to solve the problems that their monopoly causes.')
