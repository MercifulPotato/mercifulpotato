I used to love living in cities, now it just frustrates me and seems like an idiotic waste of money.  The whole idea of socializing in my head also feels like it&#x27;s no longer worth it since the barrier of entry is now higher than any time I can remember in my life - which as an introvert was already pretty high (why I lived in cities to lower this barrier a little bit).')
