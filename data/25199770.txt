I&#x27;d like to hear some evidence for that claim.&quot;<p>Here is a picture that seems, almost, to come from am alternate reality:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;black-panthers-gun-control-nra-support-mulford-act" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.history.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;black-panthers-gun-control-nra-...</a><p>&quot;Throughout the late 1960s, the militant black nationalist group used their understanding of the finer details of California’s gun laws to underscore their political statements about the subjugation of African-Americans. In 1967, 30 members of the Black Panthers protested on the steps of the California statehouse armed with .357 Magnums, 12-gauge shotguns and .45-caliber pistols and announced, “The time has come for black people to arm themselves.”&quot;<p>...<p>&quot;The display so frightened politicians—including California governor Ronald Reagan—that it helped to pass the Mulford Act, a state bill prohibiting the open carry of loaded firearms, along with an addendum prohibiting loaded firearms in the state Capitol. The 1967 bill took California down the path to having some of the strictest gun laws in America and helped jumpstart a surge of national gun control restrictions.&quot;')
