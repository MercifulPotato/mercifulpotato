It&#x27;s not that different, IMHO : ).<p>&gt; PG studied philosophy, often talking about it in a very positive light, so the claim that he doesn&#x27;t see value in humanities is -- apologies -- bogus.<p>True but with the Analytic &#x2F; Continental divide in philosophy you still get a lot of folks on the Analytic side of things who think that anything not quantifiable in the way that they are used to is bunk.<p>Also I&#x27;ll just throw out, in terms of impact, Baudrillard&#x27;s work kinda hits the nail on the head when it comes to the internet. You can&#x27;t quantify the impact of literature or more qualitative philosophy as easily, and, one can only know as time goes on.<p>I&#x27;m not the first to say this, obviously. Baudrillard&#x27;s quote seems scary-accurate of today:<p>“Today abstraction is no longer that of the map, the double, the mirror, or the concept. Simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being or substance. It is the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: A hyperreal. The territory no longer precedes the map, nor does it survive it. It is nevertheless the map that precedes the territory - precession of simulacra - that engenders the territory.”')
