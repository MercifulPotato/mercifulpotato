We decided to switch our standard size from 12 packs to 8 packs to better fit our customers consumption habits.<p>But on Amazon that meant creating new listings for new SKUs, abandoning hundreds of positive comments&#x2F;ratings on each 12 pack flavor SKU, which would crush sales for a while.<p>So instead we let inventory run out for each 12 pack SKU, then shipped replacement 8 pack SKUs, and renamed the SKUs from 12 packs to eight packs.<p>They still had some reviews praising them for having a dozen packs, which was weird but the ratings were still there.')
