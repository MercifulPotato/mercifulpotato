I would guess the number would be higher than most people would feel comfortable to admit. I certainly would, if the technical aspect of it sounds interesting &amp; challenging (and well paid) and if the opportunity was given when other opportunities are scarce.<p>The latter was the case of the local market when I graduated; the country of my residence had very low number of any robotics jobs, so most people I knew went in to traditional industries (or CS) anyway. Less than 20% of the classmate I knew is right now working in robotics. If any of them would&#x27;ve given the chance to work in what they studied (and found fun) they would probably take it even though it would include military application.')
