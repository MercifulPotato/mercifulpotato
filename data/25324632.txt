Wouldn&#x27;t this raise red flags at your existing workplace?<p>I’m not OP, but as I read it OP just makes a post saying e.g. “<i>my experience with #cryptocurrency and #blockchain combined with #ai on #iot devices has taught me...</i>” etc.<p>In other words, not a text that says “I’m looking for a job”, but just something that reveals areas of expertise.')
