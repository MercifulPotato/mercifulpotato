There&#x27;s no shortage of top tier Chinese designers across many fields where subjects tend to be more apolitical. In technical disciplines China is either climbing or on top of innovation &#x2F; research &#x2F; patent indexes normalized for quality i.e. not junk. The only thing China is stunted in is team sports. Which is perplexing, I guess too individualist.<p>&gt;That requires creativity, which is dependent on free speech.<p>Citation needed.

Censorship redirects where creativity goes, Chinese market likes their entertainment fine.<p>&gt;original and innovative<p>Those aren&#x27;t important priorities for military acquisition.

This was suspected at time of CIA China debacle, but recent confirmation solidified that Xi was the right choice. As for actual reforms, PLAN building more tonnage in new ships per year than entire region combined. Western thinktanks analyze Chinese military modernization to death.')
