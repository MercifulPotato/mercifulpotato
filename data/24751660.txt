That&#x27;s going to hurt.<p>But can you imagine the nightmare if you weren&#x27;t standing on the shoulders of Unity and trying to do it in your own custom engine? Especially on console? Unity is probably getting hardware before 99% of devs on some platforms, and they have resources that dwarf most dev teams when it comes to shaking out issues. It&#x27;d 10000x the nightmare to go it alone...<p>Like I said, it&#x27;s not just Unity, and it&#x27;s not like the game engines are even doing anything particularly brutal, they just treat major version releases with the weight they really ought to carry. You can upgrade, you just better have a damn good reason, and if you don&#x27;t have good testing procedure you&#x27;re going to suffer twice as much.<p>-<p>And honestly some of the pain is just out of their hands<p>I remember Wii U development was tied to a specific major release of Unity when N+1 came out due to their custom integrations. But Nintendo didn&#x27;t track that update, and gave no time frame for doing so for a hot minute. Unity 5 just ended up shipping out of beta with no Wii U support<p>I don&#x27;t know what a game planning on requiring Unity N+1 to ship would have done there, but I&#x27;m sure similar dependencies exist internally on other platforms that Unity has to manage.<p>They&#x27;ve essentially got multiple engines that all need to be landing changes together in sync, I don&#x27;t know why people are surprised that such an insane technical challenge requires you to treat major versions with some real weight...')
