Most of the Open Source projects are cross-platform because of  Mac Os X, not what Mac Os is now. \nI advocate for Linux as a platform with real control over computing and hope developers realizing that this is a chance for Linux to become desktop heaven. My main workflow is design-focused and if software like Affinity Design or Sketch was available today I will remove anything Apple-related from my job.<p>There is a lot of graphic design and video professionals that will jump the ship. We have Blender, and Resolve is working under Linux, but Inkscape and Gimp are not capable enough to replace Sketch&#x2F;Affinity&#x2F;Adobe Illustrator&#x2F;Photoshop.')
