The idea that women in the past never raised children is just absurd. Sure mothers were workers - my grandmother was. But she did all of her work with her daughters - teaching them to cook, sew, etc.<p>Spending time with children isn&#x27;t playing video games with your son. It&#x27;s hunting, playing sports, teaching, cooking, fighting, fixing things, fishing, etc. Raising a child isn&#x27;t all about having fun all day with toys.<p>&gt; Time surveys indicate that even working parents now spend at least twice as much time with their children now as in 1965 [1].<p>Which is obviously expected. For middle class people in the baby boomer era with large economic benefits, they spent more time with kids. The survey excluded those that wouldn&#x27;t be able to (e.g. poor people in poor countries.) Selection bias doesn&#x27;t really tell us anything at all.')
