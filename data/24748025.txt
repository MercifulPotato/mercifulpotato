Most of them come from Discover Weekly or Release Radar, but sometimes for other sources.<p>It&#x27;s an easy and interesting way to go back in time and see what I was listening to etc..<p>I have a &quot;house rule&quot; where I never remove any songs from them after the fact.  If I added it, then it stays.<p>At the end of the year, I try to pick 2 songs from each month to make a curated &quot;Best of &lt;Year&gt;&quot; and then compare that to the algorithmic one that Spotify sends me.<p>Anyways, it&#x27;s been a really fun thing and a reasonable substitute for DW&#x2F;RR archives.')
