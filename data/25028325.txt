That&#x27;s one bit of information.<p>You as the receiver derive the other relevant information from that.  A timestamp was not encoded and transmitted, a single bit (pulse) was transmitted from me to you.<p>That&#x27;s the thesis of the article I believe.  That single bit can &quot;carry&quot; a lot of additional information due to the context and understanding of the receiver.  Information that wasn&#x27;t actually transmitted in the message, but derived from it.')
