Until I read your comment right now, I didn’t understand the context of the album. When I checked the screen to see what I was listening to I first thought it was done in parody or in a mocking fashion or something. I had a mental note to go back and research it a bit more to figure out what it really was, and now I know. And I’m suddenly excited to go back and listen to the entire album. Thanks!')
