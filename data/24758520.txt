We know that all populations will eventually reach herd immunity – i.e.  the point at which the rate of new infections is stable – and that this can be assisted by (but is not dependent upon) a vaccine. Our goal should therefore be to minimize mortality and social harm until we reach herd immunity.</i>&quot;<p>Have we established that herd immunity is possible?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41577-020-00451-5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41577-020-00451-5</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-02400-7" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-02400-7</a><p>I cannot currently find the link on the (at least) one confirmed case of re-infection.<p>&quot;<i>Adopting measures to protect the vulnerable should be the central aim of public health responses to COVID-19. By way of example, nursing homes should use staff with acquired immunity and perform frequent PCR testing of other staff and all visitors. Staff rotation should be minimized. </i>Retired people living at home should have groceries and other essentials delivered to their home.* When possible, they should meet family members outside rather than inside. A comprehensive and detailed list of measures, including approaches to multi-generational households, can be implemented, and is well within the scope and capability of public health professionals.*&quot;<p>I would like to see this &quot;comprehensive and detailed list of measures&quot; before I make up my mind, but the suggestion for retired people does not sound exceptionally feasible. (There are over 50,000,000 people over the age of 65.)')
