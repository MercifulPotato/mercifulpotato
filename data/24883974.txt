This led to an issue that was probably fixed where if you set a repo to private, anyone who had a clone could guess commit hashes from their fork&#x27;s remote. Another interesting thing about git is that you can have 2 root commits (the Linux kernel has 4 root commits iirc).<p>Because of these 2 &quot;features&quot;, when I clone dmca and run `git pull some_ytdl_git_mirror master --allow-unrelated-histories`, I end up with a giant source tree that consists of both repos joined by a merge commit. Because no rebasing happened, no history was changed and it can be pushed without force permissions. Now that all the youtube-dl commits are in the same tree as the dmca repo, you can access them regardless of what fork you&#x27;ve cloned via `git fetch origin &lt;hash&gt;`.<p>I hope that makes sense?')
