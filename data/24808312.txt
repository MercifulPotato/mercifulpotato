There was a brief period during XP, I think, where this was the case. Irrespective of that, reboots are a fact of life if you have Windows installed, and allowing and choosing the best time for Windows to reboot is a part of having Windows installed.<p>Don&#x27;t use Windows if you can&#x27;t deal with the reboots. Use Mac or Linux.')
