I have the same model as you used (MB7220) but port 8080 appears to be closed (connection refused). In fact, nmap shows no ports except 80 are open. I guess a firmware update took that out.<p>Mine reports version 7220-5.7.1.15 in the admin console. I would be interested to know if anyone else is able to access it.<p>I use this modem for my internet service so unfortunately I can&#x27;t just take it apart to replicate this experiment!')
