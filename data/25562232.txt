A society that chooses to elevate meaningful accomplishment and value training people to pursue it is likely to be markedly different than the instant gratification culture we are currently swimming in.<p>edit: Whoops, factually wrong again, apparently! Perhaps this den of rationality that purports to follow the science and research will cite literature contrary to the overwhelming evidence that human interest derives from competence and acquired values. Maybe it&#x27;s actually from unicorn farts and kitten snuggles?')
