Absent a vaccine, about the same percentage of people will become sick, while a larger percentage is exposed but does not become sick. At some point, again minus a vaccine, few enough people will be left as potential replicating hosts, that the virus will not be replicating fast enough to maintain the country&#x27;s epidemic.\nCountries will differ by the breadth of the curve, but not the area under it (adjusted per-capita of course).\nOn the other hand, if you are one of the countries with a long curve, and an effective vaccine arrives before the end of it, you benefit.')
