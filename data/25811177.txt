Does she like the way I&#x27;m dressed?&quot;. I&#x27;m more concerned with what they&#x27;re <i>not</i> thinking, or rather the biases they may be unconsciously harboring about myself or others. Look at this [1], from a study on the relation of criminal sentences and attractiveness:<p>&gt;Physical Attractiveness had a significant influence on judges sentencing. The more unattractive the criminal, the higher the sentence. Or conversely, the more attractive the criminal, the lower the sentence. The results of three studies show a minimum increase of 119.25% and a maximum increase of 304.88%.<p>That&#x27;s pretty disturbing to me. It what other ways am I being treated and being <i>shaped</i> by the unconscious biases of others? Say Jim gets promoted into management and made leader of a project instead of me, because he&#x27;s a &quot;better fit&quot; for the role. For what reasons is he a &quot;better fit&quot;? Imagine if the unconscious mind could speak. It might say something like this:<p>&quot;Jim was made tribe leader because of his robust musculature. His square jaw arouses me to no end - such an indicator of higher testosterone, strength, and disease resistance will serve our offspring well. Broad-shouldered Jim can probably throw a spear hard enough to pierce fifty men. A warrior of his magnitude will surely lead us to victory against our ancestral foe, the Google tribe.&quot;<p>Okay, that&#x27;s fine, but what does that have to do with shipping a profitable software product?<p>&quot;Square. Jaw.&quot;<p>Completely absurd. We can never completely relieve ourselves of these kinds of biases, and of politics. But I believe we can mitigate it to a meaningful degree. We can have meaningful standards and metrics for evaluating people for certain roles. Horowitz talks about this kind of politics-mitigation in at least one chapter in his book, <i>The Hard Thing About Hard Things</i>.<p>[1] The Law Project. (2021, January 16). The Law Project.
