I ran mate for a while, but now I&#x27;ve just given up and run i3.<p>That said, Linux is almost for everyone now, at least if they get someone else to set it up for them.<p>The single biggest problem is that there is still not one document format to rule them all, and most people use PDF (can&#x27;t be edited) or Microsoft (can&#x27;t be rendered correctly and have limited support in other programs) formats.\nFor most things, openoffice or libreoffice can get the job done, but for things that need to actually look the same, or where one needs to fill out the &quot;formula&quot; it often falls short, and then we have to resort to a VM with Windows inside it..<p>Then there&#x27;s battery life, at least for EVERY laptop I&#x27;ve ever owned, or serviced, Linux requires a fair amount of tweaking, and then it (or some software running on it) still results in a worse-off battery life than a stock install of Windows.<p>That said, there are so many good things about Linux and the tools on it, that it&#x27;s definitely worth the shortcomings, it&#x27;s still the best OS for me.')
