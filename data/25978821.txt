The computer is very large by modern standards, filling the blue cabinets below. One cabinet holds the CPU while another holds 256 kilobytes of memory chips. This computer predates the microprocessor, so the CPU is built gate-by-gate from many boards of integrated circuits. The Model 145 weighed over a ton, cost $5 to 10 million (in current dollars), and was roughly as fast as an IBM PC (1981).&quot;')
