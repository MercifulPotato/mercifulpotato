If you share your finances with N people (family) or N companies (free-lancer&#x2F;consultant, etc), the path of least resistance to financial sanity is a well-maintained ledger. If you see this stuff coming in your future, your future self will thank your present self for getting started when things were easier to track.<p>It&#x27;s also a single source of truth for your entire financial existence. You can use it to track your asset allocation. Which some people in the bracket you describe care a lot about.<p>Of course, you can pay people to do all of this stuff for you. (Accountant, Investment Broker, etc). But there are well-documented costs to these solutions. Basically, you have to trust them a lot, and if you don&#x27;t speak their language you can&#x27;t verify their choices.<p>Edit: to be clear, I&#x27;m not saying that maintaining a ledger is the right choice for everyone. It&#x27;s a trade-off, like anything else, I just wanted to explicitly observe the variables that were at play in my decision. YMMV')
