I thought you were saying that you considered yourself privileged and were not happy about the prospect of increased competition or higher requirements due to candidates being added to the pool. I think now that you&#x27;ve clarified that you&#x27;re not saying this, though, but that asians are also marginalized?<p>&gt; Provide learning opportunities to the economically underprivileged before important events like college admissions.<p>I appreciate the sentiment here, I really do. It&#x27;s wonderful to think that with a little bit better education sprinkled in at the right time you can change an entire history of systemic oppression. Something like education is an opportunity that require a certain privilege to even take advantage of. What about when college isn&#x27;t even an option because you need a job to help put food on the table?<p>It&#x27;s one thing to tell your kids that they&#x27;re expected to work harder for the same success. From what I&#x27;ve heard directly from asian friends, that&#x27;s an asian cultural thing as well. In fact, you&#x27;re the first I&#x27;ve ever heard describe it as racism. Maybe I&#x27;m naive.<p>It&#x27;s another thing altogether for never have a chance of getting out regardless of opportunity unless that opportunity allows you to also take care of your family as you may have needed to otherwise. Maybe scholarships that also provide social safety nets for the families of children leaving for college instead of working to provide.<p>Now maybe that fits into your idea of not being affirmative action, since it&#x27;s clearly not a racial criteria, but I don&#x27;t think anyone will be surprised when this has disproportionate benefits for marginalized races.')
