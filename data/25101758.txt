Right before, he says:<p>&gt; When do we beat Mexico at the border?<p>Right after the part you quoted, he says:<p>&gt; But I speak to <i>border guards</i> and they <i>tell us what we&#x27;re getting.</i> And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They&#x27;re sending us not the right people.<p>The reference to what “border guards” are “telling him” makes quite clear he’s characterizing their descriptions of illegal border crossers. That is how Factcheck.org interpreted the statement (see above) as well.<p>There is a fair criticism of Trump here—most people who immigrate illegally are “good people” (other than the fact they broke the law in crossing the border). On the other side, there is a truth to his point. We have MS-13 operating in Northern Virginia now where I grew up. They don’t arise there organically.')
