I&#x27;m 25 years in and the worst abuse I&#x27;ve seen of this sort is uncompensated pager duty. I&#x27;ve never been pressured to check email, chat or whatever off duty. I&#x27;ve read of game devs having lots of crunch time which also falls under this category, but that&#x27;s about all I&#x27;ve heard of.<p>I&#x27;d guess we don&#x27;t get it as much as we are generally high-value, highly mobile employees so it wouldn&#x27;t pay to squeeze to hard. Or have I just had (mostly) good employers?')
