Item(by='user-the-name', descendants=None, kids=[25159603, 25159698], score=None, time=1605871786, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25159092, text='Named arguments is a HUGE thing for ergonomics. It makes code many times more readable, since it automatically documents intent much more clearly. The code linked here is nowhere near representative of regular Swift code.<p>As a very basic made-up example, the real value of named arguments is code like this:<p><pre><code>    FileManager.copy(path1, path2)\n</code></pre>\nWhat does that do? There is no way to tell which file is copied to which. In Swift, this is written as:<p><pre><code>    FileManager.copy(from: path1, to: path2)\n</code></pre>\nSuddenly, there is no need to look up the function to figure out what it does. It is perfectly clear.')
