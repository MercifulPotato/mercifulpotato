At IEDM 2019, the 5nm process was quoted to have 1.84x logic density improvement compared to 1.35x SRAM density improvement[1]<p>0.021um per cell [1] for TSMC N5 vs 0.027um per cell [0] for TSMC N7.<p>Even if Apple did everything right, they&#x27;d still be behind due to the limits of the process.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fuse.wikichip.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2408&#x2F;tsmc-7nm-hd-and-hp-cells-2nd-gen-7nm-and-the-snapdragon-855-dtco&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fuse.wikichip.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2408&#x2F;tsmc-7nm-hd-and-hp-cells...</a><p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;semiwiki.com&#x2F;semiconductor-manufacturers&#x2F;tsmc&#x2F;283487-tsmcs-5nm-0-021um2-sram-cell-using-euv-and-high-mobility-channel-with-write-assist-at-isscc2020&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;semiwiki.com&#x2F;semiconductor-manufacturers&#x2F;tsmc&#x2F;283487...</a>')
