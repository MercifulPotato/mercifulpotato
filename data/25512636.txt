But corporations are particularly immoral, and I feel that if anything, we should be vastly more comfortable executing companies than people.<p>I think personal accountability for CEOs and executives would help a lot. A CEO who knew an illegal business move might land them in jail would be much more hesitant to do it than a CEO that knew that move might cost investors some stock value.<p>But I also think a company&#x27;s behavior can be endemic and cultural, and that perhaps rather than trying to turn them around, we should just &quot;execute&quot; them. Shut down operations, auction off property to pay any debtors and assist employees with the transition elsewhere.<p>One of the things I think about with Big Tech is that they are incredibly overvalued on their &quot;too big to fail&quot; status... that and the current reality that their illegal gains won&#x27;t be meaningfully seized. If a company could be &quot;executed&quot; for it&#x27;s misdeeds, investors would need to be real about the value of &quot;rulebreaker&quot; type companies, and the additional risk they carry. We&#x27;d not be in the situation we are now, where the crimes of Google and it&#x27;s executives keep racking up... but so is it&#x27;s stock price.<p>I don&#x27;t buy the claim that we need to limit liability in order to foster innovation, because our limited regulation has led these companies to squander so much innovation, it&#x27;s insane. For every innovative thing one of these tech companies has done, it&#x27;s killed dozens or hundreds of startups that were doing something more innovative and not focused on circling the wagons around their core stock value.')
