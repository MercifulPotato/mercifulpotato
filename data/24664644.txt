They come as &quot;limited time offers&quot; all the time.  &quot;Deal of a lifetime&quot;, even.  It&#x27;s amazing - once in a lifetime offers come every six months.<p>Just because someone says it&#x27;s a once in a lifetime offer, it&#x27;s still the exact same offer.  The words &quot;once in a lifetime&quot; do not change the offer whatsoever.  If the answer is no, it shouldn&#x27;t become yes just because someone says &quot;once in a lifetime&quot;.')
