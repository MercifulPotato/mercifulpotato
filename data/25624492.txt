The first is low rate initial production, which the F35 passed some time ago. That milestone can be passed even if there is still operational testing that is not completed, but it only allows a limited number of units to be produced, and, as the name implies, the rate of production is slower to allow for changes based on results from testing. The second milestone is full rate production, which can&#x27;t be passed until all operational testing is completed. Once that is passed the full number of units can be produced.')
