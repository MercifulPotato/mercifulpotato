Only a small percent of HN posters are building a brand name. Twitter is much more real-name based and personal brand-building focussed.<p>Jumping in on a bandwagon to signal group membership in an in group can help brand-building.  Going against the in group is potentially fatal to your brand.  The risk&#x2F;reward balance does not favor genuine discussion of a controversial topic.<p>On HN most comments are up&#x2F;down voted based on their content.  The post authorship usually matters little.  There is little benefit for the author to announce support of a popular position and little risk for the author to express an unpopular one.  So discussion here can be more about substance and less about signaling.')
