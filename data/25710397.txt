Let&#x27;s look at it this way: some group believes the Big Social Media Companies are being politically biased in a way they disagree with, in part because of active moderation that reflects decisions by that company about what&#x27;s &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;incorrect&quot;. So they say &quot;hey we&#x27;re going to start a new social media platform that we don&#x27;t moderate.&quot; This gets used by violent extremists.<p>Then some other Big Tech companies tell this new company, predicated on unmoderated speech, to moderate their speech too or they will cut resources.<p>As others have noted, plenty of violent behavior has been organized on Twitter or Facebook, and it hasn&#x27;t received the same sort of punishment and ostracism. So why Parler? Because some groups on it are supportive of Trump? Because it&#x27;s the <i>US</i> government? It&#x27;s hard for me to take appeals to quashing violent behavior seriously when they&#x27;re so arbitrary in their application at some level.<p>At some level, it doesn&#x27;t matter to me, because there&#x27;s another argument, which is that the platforms should be very removed from the content on them, like a phone company. They could be promoting that, and instead they&#x27;re going hard in the other direction, which is to support heavy &quot;moderation&quot; by monopolies. I don&#x27;t want big business &quot;moderating&quot; speech, or having that much power to do so.<p>My political inclinations are very different from Trump or anything in these insurrections but I don&#x27;t like the way it&#x27;s headed, and I don&#x27;t see the gay wedding cakes as remotely the same.<p>If there were three wedding cake companies in the entire English-speaking world, and wedding cakes were a universal requirement for getting married, I might feel the same. In fact, in some ways I <i>do</i> feel the same, but I also would say maybe there should be a lot more wedding cake companies.')
