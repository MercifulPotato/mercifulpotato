I did use a qualifier.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t intend to reply further to any of this silliness. The number of people who feel the need to state <i>yet again</i> that I am wrong is really just crazy. It has no basis whatsoever in any real need to clarify what is true here. If that was what was going on, it would have stopped when I posted my comment saying &quot;Yeah, I covered that with this qualifier -- I realize supplements make sense for some people&quot; after the first three comments overlooked my qualifier to act like I am wrong and stupid.<p>But I am done arguing this. If people wish to add another twenty comments urgently and strenuously repeating the point that &quot;Due to some nitpick or other, you are so very, very wrong here!&quot; they can have at it. But I&#x27;m not replying further to this completely ridiculous thread.')
