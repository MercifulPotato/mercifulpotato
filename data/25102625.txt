They&#x27;re his projects after all, it&#x27;s up to him how to run them.<p><i>That said</i>, if a contribution of mine is ignored in a project (and a few have been), that usually becomes my last contribution to the project. Afterwards, I often choose to instead invest my efforts in other projects.<p>Ultimately, by Linus&#x27;s law, those projects that accept the most contributions and&#x2F;or foster the most active communication ought to raise to the top. I think that we simply can ignore back the projects that ignore contributions; they&#x27;re the ones who end up losing out, as far as I&#x27;ve seen anyway.')
