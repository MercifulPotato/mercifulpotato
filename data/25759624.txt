It should be relatively easy to record the go.mod&#x2F;package.json when these applications are built, and issue mass dependency bump &amp; rebuilds if some security issue comes up.<p>Really seems like the best of both worlds, and less work than trying to wrangle the entire set of node&#x2F;go deps &amp; a selection of versions into the Debian repos. I mean Debian apparently has ~160,000 packages, while npm alone has over 1,000,000!')
