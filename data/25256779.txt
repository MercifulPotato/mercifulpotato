I automatically clean those up after a few days.<p>I have no captcha because I don&#x27;t like them from a UX perspective. My assumption was that because of the double opt-in process I don&#x27;t need one.<p>But now as I get so many spam sign ups I&#x27;m wondering if I&#x27;m missing something. What&#x27;s the motivation from a spammers point of view? Do they check for security vulnerabilities this way? What kind of goal do they try to achieve?<p>The newsletter form is on the bottom of this page: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asylumsquare.com')
