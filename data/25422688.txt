Haskell is a good example.<p>It is true that you can always just use if statements, it&#x27;s more about the convenience and cleaner syntax.  You can also do destructuring with pattern matching.  Pattern matching is almost a requirement if you are going to use algebraic data types.<p>As Paul Graham says in Beating the Averages, you have to look at the other language from the perspective of knowing it.  Nobody can really explain it.  It&#x27;s just going to seem equivalent or weird syntax otherwise.')
