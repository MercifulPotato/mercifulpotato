Produced tarball releases have fewer build dependencies than those produced by competitors. &lt;- Was not aware of this. Let&#x27;s take his word for it.<p>I believe the intent is to say &quot;you need autotools to build the tarball, but the tarball doesn&#x27;t need autotools, just regular POSIX tools&quot;, which is a jab at systems like cmake where you need cmake to do the configuration at tarball time.<p>Except, well, the introduction of DVCSes like git has shifted a lot of software away from &quot;build from tarball&quot; to &quot;build from VCS checkout,&quot; so the value is rather lesser. Indeed, you can turn it around and claim that this is an antifeature: it takes more work to build a tarball and do VCS checkout than not.')
