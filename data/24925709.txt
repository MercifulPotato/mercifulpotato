In practice if you for example rent a VPS, you&#x27;ll be handed a &#x2F;64 for it by your service provider from their &#x2F;48.<p>I would personally treat any &#x2F;64 as the same. Depending on your local network setup the second half of the address could be anything and could change frequently. You might also get multiple addresses. Whereas getting a new &#x2F;64, or &#x2F;48, requires slightly more effort.<p>Of course there&#x27;s a risk you&#x27;ll block a &#x2F;64 and that takes out some whole company or whatever, but I&#x27;ve seen that happen to corporate proxies that got flagged as a source of spam as well so this is not an easy problem even without the 2^128 address space.')
