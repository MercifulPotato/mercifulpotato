So if X.0.0 was released then X.0.1, X.0.2 and so on were not allowed. Without these bug fix releases the community versions started seeing X.1.0, X.2.0 and so on which included additional enhancements&#x2F;features and weren&#x27;t merely bug fix releases. As a result, the stability that the community edition of the server was known to provide (previously), no longer existed.\nThis all boiled down to one thing - the sales team couldn&#x27;t convince customers that paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for the enterprise edition was a good thing when the community edition was equally good and well maintained, even if by volunteer community members.')
