Item(by='guscost', descendants=None, kids=[25668108], score=None, time=1610001933, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25667583, text='Was there to document and distribute some propaganda, we did not get very close to the militant action, but a few things to report:<p>- At least one flash-bang (probably) and one tear gas grenade (definitely) were used on the capitol steps.<p>- Their duty as police is to protect and serve, so shooting would have been a terrible idea. Evacuation is not difficult in an ultra-hard target like the capitol, and a <i>lot</i> of civilians had bags, some of which definitely contained firearms. I also heard some shouts about fetching guns from hotel rooms (we did not stay overnight in the city). A gun battle would have been catastrophic on both sides.')
