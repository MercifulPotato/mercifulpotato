It is well suited to undemanding tasks.<p>Most programming tasks are undemanding, and most programmers have limited skills, so it is a good match for a great deal of routine work. It fits in the same niche as Java, where Java&#x27;s OO apparatus imposes complications that are superfluous for simple applications, and an actual obstacle in most. So, a language that abandons all that is better in those applications.<p>Simple tools are not bad except when you need something more. So, my agreement was with the idea in mind of writing Pandoc in Go, which would be madness.')
