Incremental compilation across your whole system is something we should have nailed by now, I think. The best I&#x27;ve seen is something like openembedded, where you get per-package (but not per-file) dependency tracking across the whole system.<p>I was ever so slightly disappointed to see how manual the packaging is, with every .c file listed in each lua script. It looks quite maintenance-intensive. I was almost hoping for some kind of meta-build system which could parse automake etc. files and hoist the dependency graph into the main system build.')
