I put my notes in Pandoc Markdown and then convert to pdf on a pc. While the Neo2 has no GUI elements, I&#x27;m not convinced that it&#x27;s any better for distraction compared to an airgapped pc running Word&#x2F;OneNote. Curious if anyone has tried the latter(which I admit is getting harder to do as my newer computers don&#x27;t have removable wireless adapter).')
