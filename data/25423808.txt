If your tests require a live DB to run, they can&#x27;t be automated (or they can be automated, but failures won&#x27;t tell you much useful).<p>There&#x27;s a non-unit-test value of having good code coverage, too: being able to run any function independent of the rest of the app, with arbitrary inputs.  When you have a problem that&#x27;s difficult to reproduce in a controlled environment, it&#x27;s really useful to be able to run a function that&#x27;s normally ten function calls deep all by itself over and over again while trying to isolate a problem.  If you have to run the entire app to run any of it, that becomes impossible.')
