No. Vote with your dollars, don&#x27;t buy things that don&#x27;t do what you need them to. If some IoT device only uses DoH, you already know that before you buy it: don&#x27;t buy it. If an app only works with DoH, you already discovered that because you&#x27;re someone who reads and comments on HN, and so you&#x27;re guaranteed to check some app reviews before you buy into to: don&#x27;t use it. No one&#x27;s forcing you into this beyond your control.<p>Plus, right now we&#x27;re talking about a browser adding DoH, and not some shit Google or Apple browser that makes the decision for you and it&#x27;s final, but a fully configurable, user controlled, poweruser enabling browser that lets you modify its core behaviour without even having to recompile it yourself. You just open a tab and flip a boolean.<p>There is no problem.')
