Many dead people now could be alive had that been done (and mRNA candidates were apparently available extremely early on).<p>The Oxford vaccine is a more classical one so wasn&#x27;t available quite as early, but apparently the mRNA ones were developed in a very short space of time (weeks - months) and future development could cut that even further (and preemptive vaccines for potential pandemic-causing viruses could be kept in stock) - perhaps introducing a Bayesian triage pre-approval could be an important strategy in fighting viruses in the future?<p>In any case this and the mRNA vaccines are really tremendous achievements and somewhat restores my faith in humanity after a terrible year...')
