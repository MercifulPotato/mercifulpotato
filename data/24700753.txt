We had memory issues, stuck tasks and lost tasks (despite late ACK). It really requires a lot of fine tuning to get right. We started switching to AWS SQS four years ago and created a thin Django&#x2F;Python wrapper [0] for it. Now we handle tasks in the hundred of millions a day and I don&#x27;t want to think about how that would have turned out if we didn&#x27;t switch.<p>But honestly, people working on Celery in their free time (i think) so who am I to complain. I can see that monetary support would be necessary to make it better. But in my opinion the project just got too big and it will be difficult to fix all the underlying issues.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cuda-networks&#x2F;django-eb-sqs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cuda-networks&#x2F;django-eb-sqs</a>')
