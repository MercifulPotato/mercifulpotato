What really irks me though is not only how many people brought their phones but also how many actively posted and boasted about their participation on social media.<p>There is a social media site called &quot;Clapper&quot; that is kind of like TikTok but describes itself as a &quot;free-speech&quot; alternative. Naturally, it is pretty much filled to the brim with conservatives. When the capitol riot happened, hundreds of videos from the event appeared on Clapper. But Clapper acted quickly and seemingly took down all of the videos with geolocation data close to the event at that time. Now, almost nothing can be found there about it.<p>But the platform is still filled with conservatives who post videos of their laptop screens about the Q conspiracy and &quot;encouraging&quot; videos where they ensure each other that Biden is not yet president and it is not yet over. They seem very technologically illiterate and also very unconcerned about how easily they could get themselves fired for racist or conspiratory content, because they think that this &quot;platform&quot; unlike Twitter and Facebook is somehow on their side. They don&#x27;t realise that social media platforms cannot advertise when their content isn&#x27;t &quot;clean&quot; and thus act in their own interest when they ban this type of content, and not in the interest of some opposing party.<p>So honestly, I think this is just the beginning of such projects, because somehow the people who would do something as ridiculous as storming the capitol keep documenting their crimes and releasing the material themselves... they make it extremely easy for any political opponents.')
