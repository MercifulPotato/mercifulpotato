An example single person with no kids would have 12400 in federal income tax and 6k in social security&#x2F;Medicare taxes. They’d also pay the employee portion of their health insurance premium which can be anything from 0 to a couple hundred per month but is paid pretax.<p>The highest federal tax rate in the US is 37% and that’s only taxed on income over 518k.')
