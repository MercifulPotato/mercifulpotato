Item(by='ttt0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605575420, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25118607, text='&gt; Section 230 affords protections to HN - that doesn&#x27;t mean HN doesn&#x27;t moderate.<p>Sure it doesn&#x27;t, I brought 230 up because you&#x27;ve equated the ability to post content with endorsement of that content. And again, I&#x27;m not sure where do you got this &quot;censoring you is actually my freedom of speech&quot; thing from.<p>I already posted a wikipedia article proving that in fact yes, you can legally &quot;force speech&quot;. I&#x27;m not a lawyer, I don&#x27;t know the law, but it seems to me that we have all those politicians wasting time on nonsensical stuff like trying to ban E2E encryption, so why shouldn&#x27;t they for once do something useful and ensure that corporations cannot abuse their powers?')
