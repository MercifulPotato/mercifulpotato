Seriously.<p>I live in Fulton county.  My wife worked the polls. We&#x27;re engaged in the democratic process here.<p>This was audited to hell and back.  It was checked, and checked again.  It was checked by both parties.  It was checked by the courts.  It was checked by the governor, by the secretary of state, by the media, it was even checked by the fucking companies who made the ballot machines.<p>So when you say \n&gt; All they wanted were real audits of the election.<p>I hear - &quot;I won&#x27;t accept an answer that isn&#x27;t what I want&quot;.<p>So again, shut the fuck up.')
