Item(by='croissants', descendants=None, kids=[25528919], score=None, time=1608820959, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25527536, text='&gt; demi-god<p>I agree that Jordan was an amazing player, and I think he narrowly tops Lebron as the best of all time, but I also think Jordan benefited from a very precise moment in NBA history: the league&#x27;s media reach became truly global <i>and</i> the established media was still pretty much the only source of information about NBA players. No TMZ, no random phone videos from clubs, no social media. It was the perfect setup to convince a huge number of people that this dude was a demi-god. If Jordan played today, I think he&#x27;d face way more scrutiny of the gambler&#x2F;&quot;apolitical&quot;&#x2F;bully parts of his personality, and while he&#x27;d probably win plenty of MVPs, I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;d achieve the same iconic status.')
