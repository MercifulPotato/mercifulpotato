Some threshold for use?  Is the &quot;real&quot; public square no longer the public square?  If FB&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;etc, are the public square, then the government should own them, right?  Or does this mean private property can be a public square now and deserves protections because of it?<p>If I build the biggest coffee shop my small town has ever seen and it becomes ridiculously popular, is it the new public square and I&#x27;m no longer allowed to kick out people for being assholes?<p>This &quot;big website is popular so now we must treat it as public space&quot; is a take that I see kicked around but has lots of holes in it.<p>Frankly, it makes smells like bullshit.')
