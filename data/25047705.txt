Trump lied in almost every publicly uttered sentence. Why is the onus still on the media to disprove him? At some point you should not automatically trust an institution like the presidency anymore.<p>Back to the original question. NGO&#x27;s repeatedly say a single kg of meat costs 50.000 liters of water. That number in itself is not undisputed. If they don&#x27;t specify which meat and which country they&#x27;re referring to, they&#x27;re lying. Or misrepresenting facts at the least. If they use this argument in a region that has no shortage water, they&#x27;re abusing this fact to support a narrative. Etcetera.')
