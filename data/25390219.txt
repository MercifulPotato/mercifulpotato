In my case, were I to get allocation from my broker (I didn&#x27;t) I would be subject to a 15 day holding period. Presumably the institutional investors that got the lions share of the $68 allocation weren&#x27;t subject to this holding period? I read somewhere else that ABNB employees were allowed to sell 15% of their holdings at IPO? Perhaps that&#x27;s where another initial set of shares that hit the open market came from?')
