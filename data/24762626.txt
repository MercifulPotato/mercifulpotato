I run the AC PRO in my house and I only need one for relatively heavy use. Works great.)\n* Somewhere to run the Unifi controller. This is the web UI that you&#x27;d normally get built in on a consumer router. You can either set this up on a Raspberry Pi or similar device, or you can buy the Cloud Key. The Cloud Key can be used as a gateway for cloud management, but you absolutely _do not_ have to do that. You can treat it as a simple, embedded linux machine that runs the unifi controller software.<p>That&#x27;s it. Anything beyond that is optional.<p>For my setup, I also picked up a cheap PoE switch to power both the cloud key and my AP (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B07YHLR6V3&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B07YHLR6V3&#x2F;</a>), along with a cheap rack mount gigabit switch that all of my wired devices hang off of (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B003BU0EKW" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;B003BU0EKW</a>) and tossed it all into a network rack with all the niceties (patch panel, UPS, PDU, and a synology NAS). You definitely don&#x27;t need anything that elaborate though. The AP comes with a PoE injector, and the cloud key can be powered via a simple USB wall adapter (included, if I recall correctly).')
