I&#x27;m from Germany but regularly check CNN and Foxnews since a year. I&#x27;m astounded how Foxnews is strictly positive about Trump and CNN is so positive about Democrats and Biden. (More in-depth magazines are more open though)<p>But being realistic, at least until the upcoming election is over they&#x27;ve reached a point of no return. 4 more years of Trump would exclude U.S. from international foreign politics.')
