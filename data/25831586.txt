While our our public broadcaster, RTE, is far from perfect (and sometimes mediocre), they are financed &#x2F; run at arms length from government.\nThey often run expos√©s on government mess ups and criticise their actions. On a more practical level, who else is going to make quality non sensationalist content specific to Ireland? One of the downsides of being a small native English speaking country is the onslaught of American (and to a lesser degree British) content that drowns anything local. It also drowns out most European content as people are not used to subtitled or dubbed content.<p>Having spent plenty of time in the USA, I can&#x27;t fathom how a system with so many ads and skewed &quot;news&quot;  could be better. Why would you trust an unelected private corporation with no motivation or mandate for transparency more than a non profit org that is at least in theory answerable to the people? If nothing else it provides a common reference to reality that allows a real conversation to happen. The lack of this has proven in the last few months to be a real problem.<p>Most people don&#x27;t question paying for socialised defence, education,  roads etc... many services they may not use personally on a daily basis, because they understand the value of having a cohesive society as a whole.')
