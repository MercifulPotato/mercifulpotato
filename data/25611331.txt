Some minor nits, since you seem to be open to feedback here:\n1) Received (not Recieved)\n2) represents (not repersents)\n3) I have a random late night buddy because I sent <i>no</i> texts between 12 and 3am.\n4) The &quot;Good morning sunshine&quot; block tells me my first morning text was sent at 13:39 AM on average, which is not a real time (should be just 13:39 or 1:39 PM) and not in the morning--which further suggests you&#x27;re taking my overall average text time and not my average morning text time. This might be clearer as &quot;You sent your first text at&quot; (skipping &quot;morning&quot;).\n5) I got no days of the week data and no map data.<p>Once again, these are <i>minor</i> nits and didn&#x27;t detract from my enjoyment at all. Just thought you might appreciate the chance to fix some easy errors.')
