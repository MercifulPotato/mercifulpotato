Item(by='BoorishBears', descendants=None, kids=[25469570], score=None, time=1608308369, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25467353, text='I tend to shy away from opinion only review type comments on HN but I have to say...<p>&gt; It turns out it&#x27;s nothing like that, it&#x27;s more like a new Deus Ex game.<p>I expected this. It&#x27;s nothing like this at all.<p>The writing is atrocious. I do hope &quot;Ghost Off!&quot; becomes a mainstream piece of slang though.<p>The voice lines are horribly inconsistent in quality (there are lines where it&#x27;s clear the actor stumbled but the line wasn&#x27;t redone)<p>The enemies are brain dead (not just the teleporting cops, all of them)<p>The NPCs are hollow.<p>Almost none of the dialog decisions matter. In fact, most of the time the didn&#x27;t actually add a separate branch for your choice, it needs to loop back into whatever you didn&#x27;t choose... so your character says something completely different than what you chose<p>The story is generic and does not at all live up to the promise the setting had.<p>The customization is a joke. I saw that coming when all we had weeks from release was &quot;genitals and custom nails&quot;<p>The controls are surprisingly clunky for a modern game<p>The skill tree is embarrassingly overdone and clearly meant to artificially lengthen the &quot;content&quot; of the game...<p>The UI is terrible enough to be impressive. Because there&#x27;s just <i>so much of it</i> there&#x27;s just so much that could have easily been condensed, and instead they took the brute force approach. I <i>almost</i> feel bad for the programmers who worked on this, but they should have pushed back.<p>I could go on and on. I actually despise the fact that the bugs have taken center stage, because as someone who hasn&#x27;t had many, and who&#x27;s performance has been great, my hang ups go much <i>much</i> deeper than that.<p>This game will probably never fix the core shortcomings it has because they&#x27;re not bugs, they&#x27;re intentional defects and cuts that show a complete lack of focus during development.')
