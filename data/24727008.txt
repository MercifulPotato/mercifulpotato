Item(by='xrd', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602219906, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24726368, text='You are absolutely wrong that at the &quot;same protest in the same place every single night turns to violence 100 nights in a row.&quot;<p>The reason people like me showed up multiple times to these protests is because these issues matter and we Portlanders don&#x27;t want the narrative to be that our end goal was to be violent. I&#x27;ve got kids that are biracial who will be impacted by police brutality, I&#x27;ve got relatives that have been impacted, and I have friends who have dealt with the issues we are protesting.<p>What else should I do beyond peaceful protesting en masse? Did taking a knee for four years like Colin Kaepernik did result in substantial changes to the system?<p>You can suspect all you want. You could consider that perhaps those causing violence are attempting to brand these protests as something else. That&#x27;s not my intention nor the intention of the people I know who are there, nor the other people of Portland I know who support these protests.<p>And, that should not be my problem to fix.<p>You could consider that to be your problem of your perception or a problem of your understanding, and do something about that, like talk to the people protesting, instead of reading the &quot;news&quot; which, I dunno, could be slightly biased.<p>Have you engaged with people protesting and asked them: why are you there night after night? You know my answer now. Otherwise, you are getting your answers from people who aren&#x27;t there, or who might have an agenda different than mine.')
