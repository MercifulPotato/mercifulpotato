You do set-out a reasonable explanation for non-immediate data-dumps, but from the evidence I believe companies like Spotify and many others intentionally drag their feet and do the bare minimum, at least in-part, to discourage requests. Of course that also makes it bloody obvious too. More telling is the fact that they aren’t being transparent about it either. If they posted a simple statement explaining in-not-too-much-technical-detail why it takes so long that would be a start.')
