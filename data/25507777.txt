When I was in college, the professors knew that student organizations maintained these so they changed up their tests to account for it. The banks, then, only helped the students by guiding their studying (&quot;concepts x, y, and z will be in one of the first two tests, so know a, b, and c&quot;).<p>Despite these test banks, the only widespread cheating when I was in school was on homework, which usually screwed the students when it came time for the exams because they had no practice. They weeded themselves out this way.')
