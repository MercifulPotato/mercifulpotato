A few examples: 1) The UI is designed to induce in the user the feeling that <i>something</i> is happening, always - the graphs are not to scale, so small swings in price appear bigger than they really are. 2) The &quot;Top 10&quot; and community trends feed will trigger FOMO, and again will likely result in more day-trading.<p>In all, RH has too much &quot;clutter&quot; and noisy notifications for a buy and hold investor. Most platforms are now commission-free.')
