Recently, it was decided that any package containing a file in &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;share&#x2F;bash-completion&#x2F; should have a hard dependency on bash for installation.  This has lead to almost every possible user-facing program depending on bash, to the degree that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to use FreeBSD without also installing bash.  I wonder if they&#x27;re planning on switching the default &#x2F;bin&#x2F;sh in core.')
