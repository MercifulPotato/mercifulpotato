From the article this wasn&#x27;t a payment of cash to an official. It was a donation in kind to the police dept. I don&#x27;t know any more than is reported in the article but I will say that some years ago I was subject to a similar &quot;offer&quot;. Much smaller in scope, and the official wasn&#x27;t in law enforcement, but similar enough in essence. At the time I thought it a little weird but also assumed &quot;that must be how things work here&quot;. I passed because the cost wasn&#x27;t worth the benefit to me. I certainly did not think that I should go inform the police that this official had solicited a bribe.')
