Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602260941, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24731248, text='&gt; Whereas [1] says among job board postings, C++ is about as popular as JS, and Java is 1.7x more popular than JS.<p>I think it&#x27;s questionable whether job posting are more representative of working programmers. Arguably they&#x27;re less representative. Job postings are unfilled jobs, so technically they represent exactly zero programmers. And many job postings are never filled.<p>&gt; Perhaps the holders of StackOverflow accounts aren&#x27;t representative of the profession as a whole?<p>Agreed, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t think of a better source of data offhand.<p>&gt; I could certainly believe people who were programming professionally before SO existed, and who have decades of experience, would have gotten good at solving problems without asking for help.<p>I don&#x27;t agree with the assumptions here. As an experienced developer, I ask for help all the time. I&#x27;m not an expert on every possible subject, and anyway, tech changes. Also, not everyone on Stack Overflow is asking for help. Some have to be offering help, otherwise nobody would go there.')
