Current batteries used in cars top out at around 300 Wh&#x2F;kg. That&#x27;s 1.08 MJ&#x2F;kg. Gasoline has a specific energy of 46.4 MJ&#x2F;kg. Hydrogen has even higher specific energy, but with hydrogen you need a lot of weight for safety reasons. Hydrogen probably isn&#x27;t going to give you much note than gasoline in specific energy. That&#x27;s still 40 times better than batteries though.<p>As an aside, body fat has a specific energy of 38 MJ&#x2F;kg.')
