So much of the political conversation is centered around whether we should be paying the bottom rung of society $7.25 an hour or $15 an hour. Almost none of the discussion is about why $7.25 an hour in the US can buy so much less than other countries.<p>Why is it that $7.25 an hour would be a princely sum in Thailand or Costa Rica or the Czech Republic but is starvation wages in Tulsa or Jacksonville or Duluth? Most people think they know the answer to this question but it&#x27;s a facile half truth that&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t stand up to much empirical scrutiny. Digging into the real cause is something that hasn&#x27;t received enough economic attention because it gores the sacred bulls of both the left and the right.')
