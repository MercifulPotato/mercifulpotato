My mobile device was the last piece of tech that I owned that did not truly feel like I owned it. I&#x27;ve recently switched to an original Pixel running LineageOS. There are only a handful of pain points for me that make the switch difficult, most notably navigation. The feeling of actually having control of my device seems to be worth it so far.')
