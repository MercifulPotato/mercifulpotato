This might of been true in the long ago past, but solar has and is innovating and advancing way faster than nuclear. Solar is also on the order of 10x cheaper to build per kWh, 10x faster to build, safer, and doesn&#x27;t leave you with radioactive materials that you need to store safely for some 50-10,000&#x27;s years.')
