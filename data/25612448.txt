You will have to pay VAT at the customs office when you receive a package from UK. You will also usually pay flat rate fee for processing at customs office (to your postal service). This will affect all packages even gifts with low value (change in EU after 2020). Receiving small low value packages will be very inefficient (a 10 GBP package can have 10+ euro import duty plus fees).\nUK and EU only agreed on zero customs fee - which is small compared to VAT (usually around 20%).')
