A lab-leak doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean Covid-19 is some genetic monstrosity cooked up by the CCP. It includes the very real possibility that Chinese researchers gathering bat specimens for research and careless with their containment policy ended up being the source of the crossover into the human population. There isn&#x27;t any scientific evidence that makes it more or less likely that the virus was contracted by some bushmeat vendor contacting the wrong bat than a virologist contacting the wrong bat. There is however, lots of circumstantial evidence that the lab-leak theory should at the very least be as strongly considered as anything:<p>1. The closest virus to SARS-CoV-2 that has been found in wild bats was in a species hundreds of miles away from Wuhan, and is known to have been studied at the viroligy lab in Wuhan. Its the equivalent of a crossover event occuring down the road from the CDC in Atlanta, even though the closest thing to an animal reservoir we&#x27;ve found is native to Ohio.<p>2. Every alternative animal reservoir has been debunked. Initially there were theories about snakes, and most prominently, pangolins. But the scientific community has pretty thoroughly determined these are unlikely.<p>3. The lab in question raised alarms even prior to the pandemic and 2020. International inspectors wrote memos dating back years expressing concern with the level of cleanliness and standards at the lab.<p>4. The Chinese government has been extremely unhelpful, if not actively working to hinder, efforts to discover the source of the virus. They refused to allow WHO inspectors into the country in the early days of the pandamic, they systematically purged the wet market initially believed to be the source of the outbreak, over the protests of the scientific community as it would make it very difficult to trace potential reservoirs. And they to date have not let WHO teams into Wuhan to investigate. In fact, the WHO has been negotiating for a year and was supposed to have a team given access this week, only for China to balk at the last moment due to claims about visa processing.<p>Obviously this doesn&#x27;t amount to a smoking gun in any respect. There is still a substantial probability of no lab-leak. But there has been a tendency to dismiss the theory of a lab-leak in part because it&#x27;s been conflated with a genetically engineered conspiracy theory, and in part due to politics. I think the fact that populists like Trump insisting on associating the virus with the Chinese government has led to reflexive dismissals of a potential lab leak as conspiracy.')
