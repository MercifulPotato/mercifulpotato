If the ads don&#x27;t make as much money or have a more limited audience that&#x27;s fine.<p>Obviously the entirety of Google is structured so this isn&#x27;t the case, but in products I like better than Google products (Substack, Spotify, Apple) the focus is on paying customers. Ads, if they exist at all, are only on freemium versions of the product.')
