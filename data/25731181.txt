Item(by='Cthulhu_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610382486, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25730054, text='Well, AAA studios like Id Software open sourced their game &#x2F; engine as well, I think they have a policy of doing it X years after releasing the game.<p>They realize that 5-10 year old game engines are unlikely to be useful for current-day games, and that they earn money off of the game itself, its assets, storytelling, marketing, etc - not so much the code of the engine itself.<p>That said, while making the code open source, don&#x27;t stop offering the opportunity to send you money, e.g. by selling the game. Id also only open sources their engines, not the assets, so if you want to play an open source version of Doom, you need to buy the game itself as well.<p>similar to Open Transport Tycoon I guess.')
