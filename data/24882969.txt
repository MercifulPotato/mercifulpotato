Item(by='PragmaticPulp', descendants=None, kids=[24885434], score=None, time=1603586085, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24882750, text='&gt; If one percent of SONOS owners use the code<p>I&#x27;ve worked at companies that added APIs for enthusiasts to use for home automation and other projects. I can tell you from experience that the number of customers who use those APIs is far less than 1%. The number of people who might actually compile code and run it on their device, if given the chance, is vanishingly small.<p>The real problem, though, is that no matter how hard you try to tell your customers that customizations and custom integrations won&#x27;t be supported, your customer support channels will be flooded with obscure requests from these customers. As soon as something goes wrong, they want you to fix it. It doesn&#x27;t take long before they start taking to Amazon reviews to vent their frustrations.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter how many warnings you add, how many times you insist that aftermarket modifications won&#x27;t be supported, or how much you plead with the enthusiasts to take responsibility for their own modifications. A subset of the hackers will make things miserable for your support and RMA teams, and that&#x27;s enough to sink these initiatives.<p>Finally: Once you advertise an API or support for customer modifications, you&#x27;re on the hook for supporting it forever. Need to re-architect the software for some new features or upcoming products? If it breaks compatibility with customer hacks or integrations then prepare for some of the most vile, angry feedback you&#x27;ve ever received. The hacker community has zero tolerance for losing features or access, so once it&#x27;s out there you&#x27;d better be prepared to support if forever. This might not sound bad at first, but it doesn&#x27;t take long until you&#x27;re making choices between advancing the product line and not upsetting the &lt;0.1% of vocal customers who use the APIs&#x2F;integrations.')
