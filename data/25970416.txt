I got burned by AMD GPUs not resetting so switched to NVidia GPUs.<p>Didn&#x27;t have issues for almost a year.<p>Rule of the thumb for me is: AMD GPU for host, NVidia for guests. I use AMD GPUs for host because open source drivers are awesome and makes kernel&#x2F;version updating easy. NVidia for guests is no brainer since they don&#x27;t have PCIe reset issues. For motherboard, pick one that has good IOMMU groupings, usually x&lt;3|4|5&gt;70 for AM4 or x299 for Intel, or go Threadripper.')
