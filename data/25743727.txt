The liquidity is (or was, maybe) small enough that individual players can move the spot market in the direction they want in order to profit from a futures play. It doesn&#x27;t take that much (relative to traditional markets)--a year or two ago someone on Bitstamp sold 5000 coins, which was enough to cause a 30% dip&#x2F;flash crash.
