Many companies also push back against even GPLv2 in anything other than the Linux kernel, and as a result, more people use permissive licenses, even when those permissive licenses run counter to their goals. I&#x27;ve directly seen corporate decision-makers ask &quot;how can we prevent our competitors from using this to compete with us&quot; and yet still choose permissive licensing rather than copyleft, for no obvious or stated reason. That&#x27;s leaving aside many individual projects using permissive licensing; I wonder how many people doing so specifically <i>want</i> permissive licensing for a concrete reason, and how many just aren&#x27;t sure and so they pick what seems more prevalent&#x2F;&quot;acceptable&quot;?<p>In many contexts, GPL of any flavor is &quot;that thing that the Linux kernel and a few bits of low-level Linux userspace use, and everything else avoids&quot;. GPLv3 didn&#x27;t cause that; widespread corporate pushback against copyleft caused that.')
