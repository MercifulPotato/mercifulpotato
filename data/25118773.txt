Like I said on another comment, cappuccino works for breakfast because it&#x27;s sweet (mostly because of the milk), which pairs well with a &#x27;cornetto&#x27; (jam croissant). Personally I&#x27;m not a fan of milk and much prefer espresso, and I&#x27;m not lactose intolerant.<p>Lunch and dinner are salty food, and there&#x27;s no place for milky drinks. In fact, drinking milk in general is just a breakfast thing for most Italians - perhaps as an afternoon snack with some Nutella when you&#x27;re a kid.')
