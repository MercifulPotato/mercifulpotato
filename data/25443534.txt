Whether the pros of having banks outweigh the cons decentralised currencies, is yet to be determined. Personally, I still don&#x27;t believe they do.<p>Anyway, the usual bank transaction care should still apply, especially _because_ there is no central authority to reverse charges. Normally when I send money to anyone, I check it first by sending a small amount, then I get confirmation that it&#x27;s received, then I&#x27;ll send the rest.<p>I don&#x27;t know if such a precaution would have made sense in this scenario (as I don&#x27;t know enough about LINK or smart contracts for that matter), but it&#x27;s something that I take especially serious when transacting large amounts in crypto currencies.')
