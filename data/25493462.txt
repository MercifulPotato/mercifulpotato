I was setting the machine up and was new to Unix and the shell and deleted the contents of the root directory. Not the sub-folders just the files.<p>That doesn&#x27;t sound so bad right, there&#x27;s nothing important just in the root directory - except in those days that&#x27;s where the system kept the kernel binary! No problem, I&#x27;d learned how to do network file transfers the day before so I just copied the kernel across from another ELC and rebooted.<p>Phew!')
