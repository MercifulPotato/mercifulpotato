By either getting their certificate out of band (impractical), or trusting an intermediate.<p>Lets encrypt doesn&#x27;t make it any easier or harder to get an invalid certificate.<p>Now if the server wants me to authenticate, https has that built in. I can present my own client certificate, and if it&#x27;s signed by somewhere the server trusts, it knows who I am. But how would a random server authenticate who I am? I&#x27;d personally rather use certificates or ssh keys or similar than usernames and passwords, but that&#x27;s too complex for the average person.<p>Clearly I could have lost control over the key to my certificate, or the server could have lost theirs, there&#x27;s not much you can do about that, no matter what type of authentication system you use.')
