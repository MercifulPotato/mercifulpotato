I was the dev who was the most into logging so I got voluntold to be in charge of the Datadog rollout.  Told everyone it was not a good idea and presented cost estimates to why, we&#x27;re better off just keeping our own logs and using one of many open source projects that let you pull in logs and analyze them.  But all the cool kids were on Datadog, so onto it we went.<p>What killed us was the combo of the desire to really aggressive log on the staging-master and release-candidate environments (five envs total) and keep the logs for more than 7 days so the QA team could compare the logs from the current release candidate to the previous release candidates.  Between the volume of having all the services set at the info level and the desire to keep it more than 7 days, Datadog was &gt;30k a month.<p>Which at least finally got me permission to set up an open source log manager and switch everyone over to that.  Once the initial panic over the Datadog bill died down.')
