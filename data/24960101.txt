Seconds later from your timestamped link, John Oliver summarizes the point of his video, which your dismissal misses: &quot;not all weird-shaped districts are bad, and not all normal-shaped districts are good.&quot; Your reply neglects to consider different reasons why a district ends up having a weird shape.<p>Read more about why it makes no sense to glibly try to dunk on John Oliver with him being OK with this specific Black-Latino split, the &quot;earmuffs&quot; of Chicago&#x27;s 4th congressional district: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.changeil.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;why-chicagos-4th-congressional-district-those-earmuffs-are-about-fairness-and-not-gerrymandering&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.changeil.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;why-chicagos-4th-congressio...</a><p>From the article:<p>The [federal] court favored a Republican-sponsored map that created a super-majority Latino congressional district, the 4th, today known as the “earmuffs” district. That map also preserved three super-majority African-American congressional districts in the region.<p>The Republican map — and this is the heart of the matter — met necessary constitutional and legal criteria to provide “fairness to the voting rights of racial and language minorities,” as mandated by Section 2 of the Federal Voting Rights Act.<p>People with shared interests do not live in neatly squared areas. The 4th Congressional District was created to reflect that reality.<p>If the district had been shaped in that way for any reason other than to protect the shared interests of a minority group like Latinos, it probably could be considered an example of cynical, partisan gerrymandering. But, in this case, it gave a strong Latino community the chance to elect someone of their own choosing to Congress.')
