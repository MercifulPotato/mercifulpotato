And you&#x27;re working on it as you work on the rest of the &quot;building&quot; anyway.<p>The difficulty of working on lower abstraction layers doesn&#x27;t scale with the amount of higher layers. Unlike with buildings or bridges, there&#x27;s no gravity in software, no loads and stresses that need to be collected and routed through foundations and into the ground, or balanced out at the core. In software, you can <i>just</i> redo the foundation, and usually it only affects things immediately connected to it.<p>A set of analogies for software that are better than civil engineering:<p>- Assembling puzzles.<p>- Painting.<p>- Working on a car that&#x27;s been cut in half through the middle along its symmetry plane.<p>- Working on buildings and bridges as a Matrix Lord who lives in the 4th dimension.<p>All these examples share a crucial characteristic also shared by software: your view into it and construction work is being done in a dimension orthogonal to the dimension along which the artifact does its work. You can see and access (and modify, and replace) any part of it at any time.')
