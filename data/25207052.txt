It then dawns on them that this is because the Earth program was disturbed by an alien spaceship (which they were on) filled with advertising executives and telephone sanitisers crashing on Earth and forcing all of the local cavemen into extinction, meaning the program was thrown off course millions of years before he was born.<p>&quot;How many roads must a man walk down?&quot; is just a suggestion for the question that gets thrown out by the pan-galactic mice -- which (depending on the version of the story you read) they decide to use as a fake answer so they can get on the 5-D chat show circuit. It wasn&#x27;t the actual question.')
