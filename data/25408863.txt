Item(by='officehero', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607884488, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25407930, text='&gt; Taking on the responsibility of pushing back hard on poorly conceived new features is one of the important hidden skills of being an effective software developer.<p>example from my current project: 1. Inherit half finished large software with lots of features. 2. It contains bugs and is impossible to effectively maintain&#x2F;develop for the allocated manpower. 3. Management still wants all features. 4. Be brave and don&#x27;t work on anything except essentials until they&#x27;re sorted out. Lie to management if you have to e.g. that you found serious bugs that must be fixed (which is kind of true but they wouldn&#x27;t understand)')
