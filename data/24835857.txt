Per-request latency is OKish for users in the US, but my service makes dozens of subrequests to the same origin when loading pages (images, XHR calls). Without HTTP&#x2F;2, the user-experience for US customers would be abysmal and I&#x27;d be forced to reach for a CDN which has a PoP closer to them.')
