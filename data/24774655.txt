In fact I think it&#x27;s faster to use in daily usage due to the lack of animations and GUI candy than modern Windows.<p>Also, I have an Android device and have had them since the TMobile G1. Early models were hampered by RAM scarcity, and each Android release mentioned the smoother UI (it didn&#x27;t get great until 6.0 or 7.0?). But in general they were OK (apart from a dreadful Samsung tablet I bought) and the only thing that would &quot;bloat&quot; them is running too many apps concurrently (but then they were &quot;freeze dried&quot; until relaunch) or having too many services running, which recent Android has started to kill vehemently like iOS.<p>I agree with your Apple build quality support though - my MacBook Pro is 8 years old no problems, and I&#x27;m happy with the Air 2 I own that is still supported and useful at decent speeds 5+ years after I bought it.')
