The most strongly proclaimed message is that there&#x27;s a stolen election to be stopped. This is a very bold claim, and while I&#x27;m don&#x27;t disbelieve that there could be election fraud, (1) it&#x27;s not a square function: the magnitude of the fraud would need to be considered; and (2) some evidence for such a strong claim is needed.<p>Trump has had 3 years of actual governing to address things like stale voter registries where dead people, say for example, come out and vote in the order of 50,000 (a claim I have heard but can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s strength). To use that now is disingenuous. But then we&#x27;re just here guessing what Stop The Steal even means because noone is explaining it sufficiently.')
