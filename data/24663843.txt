(This posts edit-site also reloads the itself when clicking &quot;update&quot;, but updates the post itself too.)<p>edit2: Sry for possible confusion. I realize it says edit somewhere in the parent comment, but that is just because i had mostly finished writing the comment when looking up the article and adding the link (but before posting the post). I can&#x27;t really edit it.')
