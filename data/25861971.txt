Listen to the podcast linked, it was directed at Judeans.<p>I’m not saying that individuals shouldn’t be wary of holding wealth up as the most important thing as Jesus said you cannot serve God and mammon. But that’s a different thing entirely from “how do you get wealth to begin with”. One can become wealthy in an honest way and then be quite generous if he serves God instead of mammon.<p>Also not laying up treasures speaks to what one should do when they have money, not the system by which they got money. Coming from Galilee, I think he’d be more pro-free market since he railed against the politically connected who got their money through corruption.<p>Also there’s a time and a place to take care of the poor voluntarily, but don’t trust everyone whose says they care for the poor. You should donate to them out of your own heart, and be wary of centralized programs. Socialism is the Judas Iscariot view of economics: pretend to care for the poor and then line your own pockets.')
