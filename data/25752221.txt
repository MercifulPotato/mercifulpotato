Any private company, such as a restaurant, can throw you out for any reason outside of discriminating against a protected class.<p>What seems to be under attack here is the right of individual companies and people to decide who they wish to work with. Everyone who is criticizing big tech for choosing not to work with certain people is forgetting that that same principle can be applied to them. Do you want to be forced to work with companies you abhor?')
