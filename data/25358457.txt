Item(by='sleepysysadmin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607522269, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25350617, text='&gt;Gavin Long is probably the most clear cut example I&#x27;m aware of, but we know others like Arcan Cetin were TYT subscribers and some of suspected he was politically motivated. Elliot Roger was also a TYT fan, although I see no connection there.<p>Being a fan is necessarily a TYT made me do it.<p>&gt;I know what you mean. Personally I think his views on Trump are reasonable, although the way he talks about Trump sometimes makes me feel he&#x27;s too emotionally invested in the subject. I wish his rants about Trump had more facts and less ad hominems, there are others who make a much better case against Trump than Sam.<p>I think it&#x27;s not reasonable. He will say Trump is a racist but then he gets asked what makes him think he&#x27;s a racist. &quot;He just knows&quot; he cant actually give an example. Meanwhile after he bought maralago he opened it up to non-whites. Literally the opposite of a racist. Sam then says, &quot;He did that for business reasons.&quot;<p>Or you look at covid timelines. February Trump shutdown flights from China. You could still go to the usa you just needed to reroute. From which he was called a racist and xenophobic. We even had Canadian leaders call him xenophobic.<p>On February 3, at a time when the US and Australia had excluded foreigners who travelled from China, Hajdu denounced &quot;the spread of misinformation and fear across Canadian society&quot; and called on the opposition to &quot;not sensationalize the risk to Canadians&quot;,[15][16] while Tam endorsed the position by the World Health Organization, which &quot;advises against any kind of travel and trade restrictions, saying that they are inappropriate and could actually cause more harm than good in terms of our global effort to contain&quot; the disease.[15]<p>But then in the very next sentence &quot;Trump is one of those guys who wants to shutdown the border and build a wall but he wouldnt shut it down for covid because economy.&quot;<p>But you cant call him xenophobic for shutting down and then also give him shit for not shutting down more.<p>&gt;It&#x27;s the same in the UK. We have to be quite carefully about what we say publicly online because if someone gets offended about our opinions (regardless if we intended offence) we can be arrested for a hate crime. I remember when people used to talk about how crazy it was that the Chinese government censor the internet and arrest people for having the wrong opinions, but this has become fairly normal in the UK today.<p>Here in Canada we have comedians who made dark jokes over a decade ago being found guilty of &#x27;inciting hatred&#x27;<p>You have the left wing labelling every right-wing politician as &#x27;racists&#x27; not because they are racists but because that&#x27;s how you silence your political opponents.')
