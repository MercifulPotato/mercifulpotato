There&#x27;s a problem and you have a limited amount of money to spend fixing it.  Every dollar you spend by not flying is a dollar you can&#x27;t spend on something else.<p>I understand the appeal of &quot;We have to do something and this is something so let&#x27;s do it&quot; but that never works in practice.<p>what if flying people around in produces 10 Trillion dollars a year in value.  That money can be used to build a 1,000 solar farms that will will reduce the amount of CO2 twice as much as just stopping all those flights?<p>Or what if the politics of stopping people from flying are mind mindbogglingly toxic.  They&#x27;ll vote for and support people who will happily build coal plant upon coal plant just so that they can keep flying.  But for that they&#x27;d happily pay the taxes and&#x2F;or pay the capital to build a million wind turbines.<p>Look, I realize this is just a dumb thread.  It won&#x27;t change a mind one jot but maybe someone here will make an argument that - pro or con - will make the end result come about or not come about a bit faster.')
