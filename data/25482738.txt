Item(by='roenxi', descendants=None, kids=[25485700, 25484840], score=None, time=1608424319, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25482109, text='&gt; Work makes a mockery of freedom<p>Being embedded in a flimsy sack of meat controlled largely by deterministic chemicals makes a mockery of freedom. And yet here we are, embodied. Makes a mockery of fairness too.<p>That paragraph is taking a stand against large organised bodies, without taking a sufficiently nuanced opinion on what &#x27;freedom&#x27; means. If we take part in a larger body than ourselves, we lose a bit of ourselves (quite a lot, really) to the larger body. That is forced upon us by the inescapable fact that individual humans are delicate and feeble, so there need to be a lot of us to get things done. It is impossible to gain freedom from that.<p>We don&#x27;t get sewerage systems, international trade or defence forces by people acting individually. The only point of contention is whether joining specific groups is mandatory or not (eg, opting out of the control of a state bureaucrat is largely impossible). Even the most hardened individualist has to admit a company gets a lot more done than an individual.')
