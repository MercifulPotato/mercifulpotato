But still, so many thoughts are running in my mind.<p>Put simply, I had notes of my favorite quotes that stick with me throughout the day or push me back to the track when I&#x27;m down. Now, I have the same notes on this website and sharing that with you.<p>And the timing felt just right. A start of a new month aka the last month of the year that made a killing with us. You guys could use some of my notes to stay motivated.<p>I do plan to shuffle the top appearing ones and update it as I come across good ones. You can bookmark and check again if you need some external motivation.<p>That&#x27;s it for me for now. Let&#x27;s end with a quote.<p>The real motivation is you and you alone.\nâ€” Dinakar')
