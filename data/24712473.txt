This group has good working conditions on the whole. Personally when I have been frustrated with corporate work-life, it is usually for reasons that unionization would make worse (office politics, byzantine procedures, unproductive coworkers).<p>Using the second, narrower definition above, tech workers are paid well and we get to sit in comfortable chairs in air-conditioned offices all day long. I mean, if you work for a startup company it will probably lose money and yet you are paid, sometimes handsomely. It&#x27;s not as if management is exploiting you if you keep getting paid while the startup is steadily going bankrupt.<p>Maybe I&#x27;ve just been lucky, but I have felt fairly treated by management. If management is not trying to fleece workers, why add the process of a union?')
