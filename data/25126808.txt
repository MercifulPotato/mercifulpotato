Zombies. Deserted cities. Rotting corpses on sidewalks. Visible, palpable nauseating death.<p>This pandemic is nothing like those movies. I know of not a single pop culture depiction that looks anything like what we have now, except maybe the movie Contagion. And that&#x27;s really a stretch.<p>So a lot of people have a problem when they see dire predictions and statistics that bear no relationship to what their own five senses are telling them.<p>There&#x27;s also the problem of previous pandemics that sounded the alarm, but amounted to little in the US. SARS-CoV-1 and the Swine Flu.<p>All of this leaves the US with a population primed to expect a very unrealistic kind of pandemic, and already skeptical from previous false alarms. Throw in a president who not only sympathizes with the &quot;hoax&quot; perspective, but actively encourages it, and it should maybe not be surprising that we are where we are.')
