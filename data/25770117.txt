Verbosity is good imo, languages are read more than written and Erlang is too terse for me. I love Erlang conceptually and I love that Elixir made it accessible to me because I otherwise would have just avoided the Erlang ecosystem all together and would have gone with Go, the thought of which makes me shudder because I am not a fan there. I can completely understand it being bittersweet and not that I knowingly represent a majority but I suspect many people think the same way I do in regards to writing in Erlang. To me terse != elegant and I find Elixir goes the mile for me there in what I do find elegant.')
