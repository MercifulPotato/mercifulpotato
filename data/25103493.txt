In the Netherlands there is a monument [1] at a location where the Germans executed members of the resistance. The monument consists of a brick wall with the following text on it:<p><i>Een volk dat voor tirannen zwicht, zal meer dan lijf en goed verliezen, dan dooft het licht...</i><p>This loosely translates to<p><i>People who yield to tyrants will not just lose their lives and goods, they will lose their soul...</i><p>Giving in to the cancel mob is not an option since that only makes them stronger. Assuming that you&#x27;re convinced your ideas are just as valid as those espoused by the mob, just different, I see no reason for people to shut up in the name of <i>keeping the peace</i>. Speak your mind, enter discussions with those who are not of like mind. If you are met by nothing but shouted epithets, slurs and attempts to silence you consider this: if the shouters really were convinced they were on the right path they would not need to shout. They would meet your opinions with arguments of their own, they would speak as they are spoken to.<p>Don&#x27;t let yourself be silenced.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nl.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;H.M._van_Randwijk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nl.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;H.M._van_Randwijk</a>')
