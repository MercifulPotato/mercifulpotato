Item(by='agalunar', descendants=None, kids=[24986984], score=None, time=1604472390, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24986522, text='What&#x27;s unfortunate is that Massachusetts already has good right-to-repair laws; the only thing this ballot measure changes is that car data must be accessible <i>wirelessly,</i> which frankly I think is a terrible idea. (The idea of cars needing firmware updates is ludicrous to me, but I realize that opinion may not be shared by many people.) I agree, however, that the messaging of the measure&#x27;s opponents was just plain bad.<p>Edit: in re existing laws, see the 2012 ballot measure, which required that independent repair facilities have access to the same vehicle diagnostic and repair information available to manufacturers&#x27; dealers and authorized repair facilities.')
