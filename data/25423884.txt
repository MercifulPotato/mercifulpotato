For decades, there have been watches (including those with many features, like calculators, stopwatches, timers, and alarms) whose batteries lasted years. Moving to a watch that has to be charged every day or two seems like a big step down in this regard.<p>Mobile phones are completely different. Since their introduction, they have never had good battery life. The most fully-featured phones have always had batteries that lasted much less than a week. It is true that there are now feature phones that can last a long time, but these are essentially a different product than smartphones.<p>The fact that the OP does not want to charge his watch every night or two does not mean he is unwilling to charge anything that frequently. It just means that when it comes to watches, long battery life is a core feature.')
