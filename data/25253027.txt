This accent, Received Pronunciation, is an artificial creation. It was created fairly recently, too. It is used to designate social status. The only proper British accent is the multitude of variations that comes from different parts of Britain, and such accents originate from different ancient tribes.<p>Personally speaking, I prefer the colourful multitude of accents, rich in history and personality - in every country for that matter - rather than a dull, standardised, grey and &#x27;proper&#x27; single accent to which people wish to conform so as to elevate themselves in others&#x27; esteem.')
