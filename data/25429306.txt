It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s merely acquired (through exposure aka experience). You have zero duty and responsibility to hone anything.<p>&gt;You have a gift<p>Yeah, the gift of being human. The one thing that helps you more than anything else because being human lets you acquire everything else.<p>&gt;to squander it in a misguided attempt at humility or fear of trying is the worst sin you could commit.<p>There is no such sin.

The vast majority of animals never reach adulthood.<p>&gt;Stop listening to what other people have to say about where you should go and what you should do; their reasons are either selfish or fearful. Only you are sufficient judge of what is your true potential, and that only comes through the continuous experience of discovery and trying.<p>That&#x27;s an argument to stop listening to you because you are a burden to me.
