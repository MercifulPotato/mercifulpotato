It happens with services you directly pay for like ridesharing and food delivery as well. The cost of fraud becomes another cost for a service provider and prices for all users need to be raised to offset losses from fraud.<p>For smaller businesses without the brain power to combat fraud, their margins will be greatly hurt by fraud, making it harder to compete.<p>I&#x27;m in favor of what Apple is doing myself, but it&#x27;s definitely a legitimate unintended consequence of this measure.<p>What would be useful is if Apple became the gatekeeper for tracking fraud and companies could report ephemeral identifiers for fraud that only Apple can de-anonymize and then Apple provides fraud scores for ephemeral identifiers on account signup.')
