I think you need to have a sincere interest in your product to keep working on it. At least this is what I feel about my own projects.<p>If I do something that has a (hidden, often even to myself) motivation to make money or promote my other products, I tend to quickly abandon it. On the other hand if I work on something that I like, I keep doing it for years without making any money at all.<p>I run a small site that lists projects made by indie devs who share their revenue and I see that the ones who succeed have been working on their products often for years. And they like their products. It&#x27;s interesting for them. Otherwise they couldn&#x27;t have done this for a long periods of time without a big revenue. This big revenue usually comes later. And you can feel it from the product too if the maker has put their soul into it.')
