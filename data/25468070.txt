The author of the original post on reddit mentions feeling as if escaping prison so there&#x27;s something to handcuffs after all<p>&gt;Oh, you&#x27;re going to fire me if I don&#x27;t do xyz, go ahead because I don&#x27;t need the job.<p>That is only true when you have accumulate something and are ready to do your thing. Till then one is willing to put up with plenty of BS. But it&#x27;s true, fat checks offer this alternative of exit. However, they are also keeping one from getting a more sane alternative because they pay isn&#x27;t as good. There are still decent companies and jobs out there that you can run into if you&#x27;re willing not to cash in fat checks.')
