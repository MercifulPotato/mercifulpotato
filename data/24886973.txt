Item(by='hnlmorg', descendants=None, kids=[24887360], score=None, time=1603639578, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24886818, text='&gt; <i>Not true at all, most YouTube videos are offered as plain webm files.</i><p>It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve written a video streaming scraper but it used to be quite common for a file to be served over HTTP but that file was a small &quot;shortcut&quot; type file to an RTMP stream. So a webm file wasn&#x27;t the content itself but instead a pointer to where to stream the content from.<p>I&#x27;d imagine the same would still be true for YouTube since, like most other video streaming services, YouTube can adaptively switch bitrate depending on the bandwidth available to the end user. That seamless switching can&#x27;t be done with a HTTP GET of a singular video file but it can happen effectively with a chunked streaming protocol.<p>&gt; <i>Also, keep in mind that recording TV&#x27;s is legal.</i><p>Yes but with caveats, depending on the country.<p>Though it is worth noting the only reason America and UK law is so relaxed regarding VCR usage is because corporations making video recorders were taken to court by film studios and won their case. So once again it comes down to presenting a legal argument rather than a technical one.')
