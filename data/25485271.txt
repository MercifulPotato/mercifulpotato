Needed something for my dad&#x27;s AMD K6-2-333 system, with 64MB ram and a 4GB HDD. Windows 95 was not that useable anymore and XP obviously not an option for that system. Thus the second Ubuntu release with IceWM it was, and when I later changed my own system to Linux I stuck to IceWM, since it worked great  (and I already had learnt how to configure it).')
