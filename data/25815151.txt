Kind of like MMORPG &quot;guilds&quot; - deeper than a company, and more voluntary than a nation. Slate Star Codex&#x27;s Archipelago concept might also be of interest here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;06&#x2F;07&#x2F;archipelago-and-atomic-communitarianism&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;06&#x2F;07&#x2F;archipelago-and-atomic...</a><p>If this ever does happen, how might in-group favoritism and out-group hostility change on average? I think people voluntarily self-organizing based on their preferences and principles is definitely preferable to something arbitrary foisted upon you at birth, and of course tribalism will always exist in almost any situation, but there are some interesting trade-offs to think about here.<p>What are the odds a hypothetical future without nationalism leads to a form of tribalism that&#x27;s riskier than nationalistic tribalism? People may feel a deeper identity connection to something they&#x27;ve actively joined for philosophical and sociological reasons, rather than due to their GPS coordinates or what their parents believe. There could be something like (cold or hot) religious wars, except with a ton of different religions forming and changing all the time, and based on differing principles and practices instead of differing supernatural beliefs.')
