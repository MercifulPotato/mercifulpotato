Although this is being justified with references to phishing (which may well be the case) it&#x27;s also an issue for spambots that need to sign in to a Google account in order to e.g. post spam links to YouTube comments.<p>If you think about it, you&#x27;ll quickly end up in a briar patch of confusion over what exactly the definition of a &quot;browser&quot; is. Google have attempted to provide a definition here which is better than most, but it&#x27;s basically a subtractive definition. A browser is a thing that supports &quot;modern web standards&quot; whilst not supporting automation features. OK. What about extensions?<p>The intent is to ensure that only <i>people</i> can sign in when they understand which site they&#x27;re on. If anyone can define any program as a browser you can&#x27;t enforce that and would have to allow unlimited automation of web sites. That is too hard to do, purely server side content analysis algorithms don&#x27;t get you far enough, hence CAPTCHAs and now this JavaScript based enforcement.')
