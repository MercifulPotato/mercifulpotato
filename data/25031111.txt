For me, the person I think is most like that is Piotr Wozniak [1]. He&#x27;s basically mastered everything: physiology, happiness, learning, creativity, communication. He&#x27;s done it generally with global optima not local optima meaning he sacrifices things most people normally wouldn&#x27;t (e.g. has no phone, only does barefoot running). Fortunately he has lots of writing on his lifestyle so I think I have a chance after a decade or two of approaching him but man, if he didn&#x27;t exist there would be so many things I&#x27;d take for granted as unsolvable (enjoying exercise, being consistently happy every day, managing stress).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supermemo.guru&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Piotr_Wozniak" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supermemo.guru&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Piotr_Wozniak</a>')
