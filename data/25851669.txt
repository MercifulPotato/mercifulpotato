If I have a project and need application logging at scale and I pay AWS for managed elasticsearch, obviously that’s providing me value - that’s why I’m paying for it.<p>For lack of a better word you seem to have this marxist&#x2F;communist mentality where you view voluntary free market transactions as somehow not being an example of mutual benefit (the underlying principle of free trade). Isn’t it self-evident that when I buy an iphone or buy food at the grocery store, that I am gaining value?<p>—-<p>BTW, you seem to also ironically confuse the concept of monopoly with the concept of free market competition. Being a good competitor, like AWS Elasticsearch, is not a monopoly. Indeed it is Elastic who is trying to change their license in order to monopolize this market.')
