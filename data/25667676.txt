If a non-technical user needs to edit text content alone (no structural or design change, just plain text content), is there any tool that can help them to edit the page content via browser? may be an extension&#x2F;plugin that at least captures the delta changes so that it can be sent to some backend API? The goal is to enable non-tech users to make simple changes to web page content and receive those changes in the backend.')
