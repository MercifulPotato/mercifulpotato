Is it equivalent to the British &#x27;lorry&#x27;, or does it include pickup trucks? I&#x27;m Australian, and for me &#x27;truck&#x27; means &#x27;lorry&#x27;, pickups are a kind of ute, utes are a kind of car, and so trucks and cars are clearly distinct. (QED!) There seems to be endless room for cross-cultural ambiguity here though.')
