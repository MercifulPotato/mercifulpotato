Simple enough to take report that to whoever in the school handles discipline: Usually, the same person that would get involved with other sorts of skipping class. I don&#x27;t really see the issue: It can&#x27;t be that many kids doing it every class and having teachers and staff monitor halls, if you have well-funded schools, shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.<p>I&#x27;m opposed to locked bathroom doors as well: Again, all it takes is one teacher saying, &quot;no&quot;, and suddenly, the same student is out of luck.<p>Or we could be more lenient on students and not worry so much about attendance so long as they hand in their work and get decent enough grades.')
