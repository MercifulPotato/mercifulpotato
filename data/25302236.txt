Instead of hiring a million agents to record what the population is doing, you hire one programmer to automate that data collection process.<p>Totally different? Yes, but it shows that scale can affect whether something is OK to do or not, at least for some (I accept that people watching the streets can be useful, but also have my doubts about doing that at scale, whether by cameras or by hiring a million agents)<p>With both cameras and copy-pasting web content, there’s the issue what you do with the data. If, for example, I start scraping all the articles on a newspaper’s web site, publish them on a web site, adding my own ads, most people would think that shouldn’t be legal.<p>If you agree, we’re now haggling over the price (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quoteinvestigator.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;03&#x2F;07&#x2F;haggling&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quoteinvestigator.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;03&#x2F;07&#x2F;haggling&#x2F;</a>).
