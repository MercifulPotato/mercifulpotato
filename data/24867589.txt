If I enter such words in Google Translate most of them are correctly translated to English and French. Granted, splitting a word into its compound parts (= several existing words with maybe an &quot;s&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, or &quot;en&quot; between them for easier pronunciation) is easier than having a base word + inflection + changes for pronunciation, but it shouldn&#x27;t be impossible for an AI to do this. I do think you&#x27;ll probably need custom rules or extra information per language, corresponding roughly to some grammatical rules or patterns.')
