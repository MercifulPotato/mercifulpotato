They didn&#x27;t round up the whole country and put us in prison (!?). The rules we had were:<p>- Stay home. The only allowed reasons to leave our homes were essential supplies (eg visiting the supermarket), caring for family, going to work (if you couldn&#x27;t work from home) or exercise (eg going for a walk). Or if you needed medical care.<p>- Unless we had a really good reason, we had to stay within a 5km radius of home at all times, and couldn&#x27;t leave home for more than 1hr each day. We also had an 8pm curfew - though I&#x27;m still not sure what that was for.<p>- No visitors unless they&#x27;re an intimate partner<p>- Masks mandatory any time you left your home. On the spot fines from police if they catch you outside without a mask.<p>Basically everything indoors was closed - no gyms, takeout only at restaurants, etc. Supermarkets had security guards to make sure nobody entered without a mask on, and they had complimentary hand sanitizer at the entrance.<p>That strategy was enough to go from 700&#x2F;day down to 0&#x2F;day in a couple months. Those months were awful, but just about everything has opened up again now since we&#x27;ve been sitting at 0 local infections in the whole country for the last few weeks. We only broke our streak today - a hotel quarantine worker was infected in Perth. The city has immediately locked down to make sure it doesn&#x27;t spread.<p>If the whole world followed the same strategy, covid would be gone already and international travel could have resumed months ago.')
