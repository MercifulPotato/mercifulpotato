Is &quot;you have to have a spouse with a traditional job&quot; really what you imagine &quot;the way Uber was originally envisioned?&quot;<p>That seems to be sorta missing the point.  People don&#x27;t want &quot;Uber to BE a full-time job&quot;, they just want it to be possible for it to replace one.<p>&gt; I still think we need a third class of employment, but thatâ€™s not what was on the table here.<p>Really what this is proof of is that employer benefits are a fundamentally broken idea.  Employers will always, ALWAYS find ways to cheat their way around providing them when they can.  Regulation will always be catching up.<p>Back in 2009, I thought the hippies were crazy to be staking so much on their failed quest for a public option in the ACA.  Now?
