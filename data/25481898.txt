When there&#x27;s a game like that coming out soon, I just know it&#x27;s going to run like shit on console and everyone&#x27;s going to complain. This was true when Crysis came out in 2007: all the PC gamers upgraded their graphics cards to play it, and the guys on Xbox360 just had to put up with a blurry mess running at 20fps. Same thing happened with Just Cause 3 in 2015. A bunch of others, too.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to say that it&#x27;s okay; if you sell the game on a certain console, one would hope that it&#x27;d run well there. I just think it&#x27;s <i>entirely predictable</i> which games are going to have this problem (it&#x27;s the ones that got the PC gamers to buy new graphics cards so it would even run), and then I&#x27;ll hop online and everyone&#x27;s talking like it took them by surprise.')
