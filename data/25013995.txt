It’s good to see OKRs but they are quite tricky to get right. I am still learning myself.<p>The problem I see with your objectives are they are a bit subjective. What is a “a better writer?”. Maybe “a more persuasive writer” or “a more prolific writer”.<p>The key results should then measure the objective but try not be tied to how you do it. If you are not tied to the how then you can get creative with solutions, apply paretos 80-20 and more.<p>For example if you measure calmness by “I reduce the number of times I get angry over minor things by 50%” and then let’s say you keep a simple tally journal to measure your score. you can then try different solutions.<p>You are not stuck to meditation. You could try counselling, anger management, avoiding situations that make you angry, working on relationships or drinking less coffee. You could try to see which of these makes the most impact on the key result.<p>Source: been doing okrs seriously at work for 4 months.<p>Good luck!')
