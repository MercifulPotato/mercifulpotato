I guess.<p>Using 1% of those (presumably from the more-often-reproduced subset) for this challenge seems reasonable? Note that the structures have to remain secret up until the challenge, and presumably all those teams uncovering the structures don&#x27;t want to have to wait up to 2 years every time to actually make their results public.')
