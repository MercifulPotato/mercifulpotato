To date, I seriously cannot find a person with a better mastery of the English diction.<p>I&#x27;ve emulated a lot of his writing style in my own since I was 17 and the structure therein (syntactic format and punctuation) but I fail to come close to even 1&#x2F;10 of his prose.<p>Some may call it a run-on sentence format, but all he is doing is elucidating a well thought out idea as best as possible in the written word.<p>On topic:<p>I&#x27;ve seen this interview countless times, and read his entire bibliography and most of his essays, there are still a few I still haven&#x27;t gotten to. And his last point is actually very relevant as it was when it was written, perhaps more so now.<p>I recently watched a podcast between 2 comics, who argued if the rise of Q-anon and the actual mobilization of the disenfranchised rust belt male cohort was a result of the lack of sports on TV in the onset of COVID.The largest followers of these events and <i>tailgate culture</i> are these very same demographics. Thinking about it further it may also coincide that the lack of satisfaction in the presence, over saturation really, is what made them resort to alcoholism, opioid abuse and eventually overdose&#x2F;suicide. Prior to this was the tea party movement, and that was quelled rather easily by contrast. There was often a snarky remark in so called <i>Libertarian</i> circles online in early Spring when most sports started in the US that went like: &#x27;Well, the Revolution has been postponed for yet another year.&#x27;<p>It was enough to make you think and really made me think back to the Savage&#x27;s inability to integrate in the Society in Brave New World where every need was supposedly satisfied. It may also explain why so many countries were so quick to re-introduce sports as soon as they could in direct disregard for the supposed severity of COVID: a necessary evil as it were. Football hooliganism around the World is a very effective strategy to create internal conflict and to distract those who would otherwise resort to violence against the State in most instances: often lower class, poor, working-class males.<p>The sport may differ but the comparison in tact is not without merit, and these things can be traced back to Rome (the US&#x27; only real analogue) with bread and circus being a commonly funded thing by the aristocracy to keep the plebs in line despite all the massive warfare, murder and corruption in just about every phase of the rise of the Roman Republic to the fall of the Roman Empire.<p>I asked if we were already in the early stages of Brave New World when an article about the sperm shortage was unable to  meet the demand of single mothers wanting COVID babies?<p>It is with these things in mind that you begin to realize that the parallels are very stark if you care to analyze them.')
