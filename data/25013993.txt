My opinions in this regard aren&#x27;t concrete. I guess it is kinda hard&#x2F;pointless to argue against anecdotal evidence. If I were to rephrase everything in my post as a question, I guess it would be: &quot;How would you deal with a mentally ill homeless man who breaks into vacant houses, sometimes sets them on fire, and starts building &#x27;art&#x27; around the neighborhood that people view as vandalism?&quot;<p>If that is too specific of a question, we live in different worlds. Which is fine. But OP&#x27;ll probably live in a similar one soonish.<p>Another question I would ask, is who all is involved in this decision to move to an underprovided city? Is it just you, as the sole provider? As in, no family? How long are you willing to live there? People can, and do, live in these neighborhoods for decades at a time...<p>But: How willing&#x2F;capable are the people you love of withstanding an attack? I don&#x27;t mean an attack against you ideologically, I mean physically. Can you live the rest of your life in a normal way, after you&#x27;ve been told to lie down next to the vehicle being stolen, with the full knowledge that you are a point on that vehicle&#x27;s path of escape? Knowing they could run you over in an instant, if they felt like it. Knowing that wasn&#x27;t you that experienced that, but your daughter or son?<p>Are you still then okay with sacrificing your own interests, and your families, for the benefit of the city?<p>Edit: Agh, this just turned into more anecdotal stuff. Oh well, I guess don&#x27;t have much else to add. Either way, good luck OP.')
