From there it is a small step to full nuclear war and the deaths of billions of humans.<p>Perhaps the &quot;optimistic&quot; scenarios are ones in which the hundreds of millions of humans that die are located far away from any nuclear armed countries, or at least those countries aren&#x27;t destabilised by the economic and migration consequences of those deaths.  I can, unfortunately, imagine militaries being routinely used this century for wiping out the remaining civilian populations of failed states.')
