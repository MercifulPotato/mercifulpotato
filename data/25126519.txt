I&#x27;m not here fishing for tech support, but this is a real thing I&#x27;m encountering and I don&#x27;t know that expressing disbelief feels productive?<p>The point I&#x27;m trying to express is that giving a cert to your webserver is often only the first step in a relatively complicated process of securing all you assets. I wish browser makers would ask about blocking insecure connections instead of doing it by default.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in the kind of thing I mean see below:<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>So, for example - I&#x27;m running a quart server on hypercorn for a side project. Just giving nginx the certs will not, for reasons I don&#x27;t understand, allow a wss:&#x2F;&#x2F; connection to successfully connect (returns a 400). The developer conversation around this[1] suggests giving the certs to the application server. I can confirm that this works, but again I don&#x27;t understand why.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;pgjones&#x2F;quart&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;319" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;pgjones&#x2F;quart&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;319</a>')
