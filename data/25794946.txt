Item(by='908B64B197', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610738078, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25791201, text='&gt; Dropbox had &#x27;detected&#x27; that employees at our company were using Dropbox and it would be unfortunate if their stored files were no longer available and it would be in our best interest to sign up for a business account or we might legally be in breach of some terms of service.<p>That&#x27;s such a dumb sales tactic. Having users inside a company without any contracts with the company means that there are probably evangelists for the product working there but management won&#x27;t buy. Time to give a free trial of the pro-enterprise-moneymaker version and hope that someone decide it&#x27;s worth it.')
