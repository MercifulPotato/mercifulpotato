Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=[25150429], score=None, time=1605777953, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25146248, text='I think there are two issues here:<p>1) breck seems to not understand what the whole thing is actually about.  It&#x27;s about one party with a contractual obligation to pay another party some money every time the first party sells a book.  Even if copyright law disappeared tomorrow, that contractual obligation would still exist.  Sure, it might be harder for Disney to sell those books if copyright didn&#x27;t exist and people could copy them for free, but that wouldn&#x27;t remove their royalty obligation, as that&#x27;s a contractual obligation that does not rely on copyright to function.<p>2) breck&#x27;s attitude toward IP law is just... tiresome and annoying, I guess?  Most people here likely either don&#x27;t agree with it, or are sympathetic to it, but believe breck&#x27;s ideal world is just generally unworkable from a practical perspective.  Personally I find that kind of anti-IP thinking to be naive, and people who push it in the way breck is doing just come off as kinda trollish.<p>breck is of course absolutely right that copyright law -- like <i>all</i> our laws -- is enforced at the point of a gun.  But... so what?  That&#x27;s how laws work.<p>&gt; <i>From this, breck reasons that if ADF has a contract with Disney that, to make any sense at all, requires that copyright be enforced...</i><p>Just to call this out specifically: no, that&#x27;s completely incorrect.  Even if there was no copyright law, Disney&#x27;s contract with Foster would still be in full effect.<p>But ok, let&#x27;s admit that contract would have been absurd from day one, because in a no-copyright world, both Disney (well, at that time, George Lucas) and Foster would know that they&#x27;d never be able to sell any more than a few copies that would then be freely copied and distributed.  So they&#x27;d make like $12 and that would be it.  So some <i>other</i> arrangement would have been made up front.  Perhaps LucasFilm would have made up a contract with Foster that says they would be Foster&#x27;s patron, and would pay him some monthly or yearly stipend, for some specified number of years, as a reward for writing the book.  Or whatever.  And then let&#x27;s say Disney later buys LucasFilm while the contract is still paying out.  Disney is still contractually obligated to continue paying, but they decide they don&#x27;t feel like it, and don&#x27;t pay.<p>And <i>this</i> bit is what the original article is about.  It has nothing to do with copyright; it&#x27;s about a giant corporation refusing to honor its contractual obligations when those obligations are to regular people who don&#x27;t have the resources to fight them.  Coming here and dropping a low effort &quot;I have no sympathy&quot; comment is a waste of our time and shows a lack of empathy, justified with an argument (against IP law) that is unrelated to Foster&#x27;s woes or Disney&#x27;s obligations.')
