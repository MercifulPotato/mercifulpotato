I agree my phrasing is muddying the waters, I should have been more precise.<p>On another note, it&#x27;s interesting to me that I keep seeing the LeCun debate come up here again and again as an example of her being a bad-faith debater, given that it technically doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with this Google debate.<p>Whether we agree with her on the substance, I feel like it strengthens my point that she badly damaged her perception amongst the ML&#x2F;AI crowd, and their willingness to give her the benefit of the doubt in the way she chose to debate LeCun.')
