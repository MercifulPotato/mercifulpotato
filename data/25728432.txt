You can model pretty much every factor of it, individually, but you can&#x27;t model the whole matrix because some parameters are random and wide (earthquakes, pandemics, etc) and some you cannot account for (were you were born and from whom, what education you get and where, who you can befriend, how your brain works, etc etc).<p>I think one has to differentiate between &quot;complex&quot; and &quot;complicated&quot;. Complex stuff requires Big Brains. Business is not complex, all its processes are simple and fairly well-understood; but it <i>is</i> complicated by the interaction of so many factors.')
