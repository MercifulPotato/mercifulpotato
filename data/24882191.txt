Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603576090, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24880205, text='&gt; Any observers still unclear on what the walls of text might be designed to do...<p>Knowing(!) what the walls of text are &quot;designed to do&quot; requires ESP abilities (are you suggesting these exist, and you possess them?), and is also inconsistent with what they are <i>actually</i> designed to do (I know, because unlike you, I happen to have direct access to my mind) - a more accurate motivation was arrived at (and confirmed by me) by one <i>exceptionally</i> skilled thinker if you care to read the thread.<p>&gt; ...should note that anyone not in favor of letting Qanon run amok <i>is required to produce incontrovertible evidence of every single assertion they make, held to an impossible standard if anyone is being dishonest</i><p>Observers should &quot;note&quot; this &quot;fact&quot;?  Well, it&#x27;s your claim, not mine.  Not only have I not claimed this, I do not believe or agree with it - I consider this idea incredibly unrealistic, to the point of categorizing it under silly.<p>&gt; ...while on the other side, statements like &#x27;it&#x27;s mostly &quot;the left&quot; doing the censorship these days&#x27; can be dropped without any supporting evidence at all.<p>&quot;While on the other side&quot; sounds like you&#x27;re referring to me.  Have I made any such claim about the left?  Why are you speaking as if I have?  Is that an honest mistake, or are you perhaps using deceit to implant invalid invalid ideas into the minds of other readers?  This is actually the essence of my very complaint: the implanting of ideas <i>that are not supported by evidence</i> into vulnerable minds of other people - which ironically, is the very thing QAnon and conspiracy theorists do!<p>&gt; For all the appeals to objectivity, the sea-lioning[0] is very much one-sided.<p>I find it very interesting (and ironic&#x2F;hypocritical - see my other comment in the thread on this) that the collective brainpower of HN is not able to come up with a single argument that does not consist of rhetoric like this (individual sentence, and overall comment).  I also find it interesting that when I point this out, it is only responded to with more rhetoric.<p>&gt; <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wondermark.com&#x2F;1k62&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wondermark.com&#x2F;1k62&#x2F;</a><p>I notice the author has posted some interesting followup errata comments on that comic:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wondermark.com&#x2F;2014-errata&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wondermark.com&#x2F;2014-errata&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; It has been suggested that the couple in this comic, and the woman in particular, are bigots for making a pejorative statement about a species of animal, and then refusing to justify their statements. It has been further suggested that they be read as overly privileged, because they are dressed fancily, have a house, a motor-car, etc. This is, I suppose, a valid read of the comic, if taken as written.<p>&gt; But often, in satire such as this, elements are employed to stand in for other, different objects or concepts. Using animals for this purpose has the effect of allowing <i>the point (which usually is about behavior)</i> to stand unencumbered by the connotations that might be suggested if a person is portrayed in that role — because all people are members of some social group or other, even if said group identity is not germane to the point being made.<p>&gt; <i>Such is the case with this comic. The sea lion character is not meant to represent actual sea lions, or any actual animal. It is meant as a metaphorical stand-in for human beings that display certain behaviors. Since behaviors are the result of choice, I would assert that the woman’s objection to sea lions — which, if the metaphor is understood, is read as actually an objection to human beings who exhibit certain behaviors — is not analogous to a prejudice based on race, species, or other immutable characteristics.</i><p>&gt; My apologies if the use of a metaphorical sea lion in this strip, rather than a human being making conscious choices about their own behavior, was in any way confusing.<p>As you can see, the point of the comic is about <i>behaviors</i>: &quot;Since behaviors <i>are the result of choice</i>, I would assert that the woman’s objection to sea lions — which, if the metaphor is understood, is read as actually <i>an objection to human beings who exhibit certain behaviors</i>&quot;.<p>So in the context of this thread, the behavior that can be observed is people <i>choosing</i> to broadcast specific ideas [1] for which they do not have evidence, and are unwilling to defend with anything other than rhetoric.  An overly imaginative person might also pick up a whiffs of things like intellectual superiority (the ironic kind), groupthink, peer pressure, tyranny of the majority, chilling effect, Overton Window enforcement, etc.  Luckily, I am not such a person, I am simply making that observation.<p>Although, I do take exception with: &quot;Since behaviors are the result of choice...&quot;.  If one studies psychology and neuroscience, it becomes not so clear how much <i>choice</i> or free will people have when it comes to what they believe.  At times, some beliefs seem to be (so they say) intertwined with the very identity of the person who holds them, and consequently, these beliefs can be very stubbornly held (within the subconscious mind) and if not formed via a logical process, cannot be dispelled with logic (and are often not defended by logic,or cannot be).  Probably the most famous example of this type of belief is religion, which can come in many forms.<p>[1] ...which can affect belief formation in other people&#x27;s minds, which can then infect other minds, rinse&#x2F;repeat - this &quot;virality of ideas&quot; phenomenon can be more easily recognized by observing QAnon type subcultures rather than subtler instances like this thread.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=case+study+propagation+of+memes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=case+study+propagation+of+me...</a>')
