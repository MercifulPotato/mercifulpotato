I said it &quot;reduces the opinion surface&quot;. If some other formatter becomes popular, debating between it and Prettier is still way preferable over arguing over single versus double quote? Space around params? Opening brace at end of line or new line? Should if statements always have brackets? Should else statements start on a new line? Template strings or concatenation?
