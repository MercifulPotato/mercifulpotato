It applies to other services such as post office and city trash where either laws (private express statutes) prohibit competition for the sake of making the public service more profitable, or where taxes force the customer to &quot;buy&quot; the public trash pickup, making even the best-run private enterprise unable to compete.<p>It is technically quite trivial to clone the basic functionality of Twitter and run a competing service. This has been done semi-sucessfully with Gab (not endorsing that community, but it is a good example), for example. People choose social media services based on their perceived value, social prestige, etc. There&#x27;s no equivalent to &quot;I have to use Twitter because they own the lines to the house&#x2F;they have the only 5G coverage in my area&#x2F;they are the only company licensed by my city.&quot; Twitter is not the only physically possible way to publish short messages to the world (unless the ISPs ruin that now that net neutrality is gone).')
