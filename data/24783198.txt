First person I showed your site to said &quot;Why didn&#x27;t I think of that?!&quot;, which is always a great sign.<p>If you can compete with or beat most other earphones for battery time, you&#x27;re already set. Unless you can identify some low hanging fruit, I wouldn&#x27;t invest much more time into power management because getting Apple-like power management without degrading the connection and user experience is really hard. The two work against each other unless you&#x27;ve got the resources to run large tests to compare changes and perturb towards a solution.<p>I&#x27;d recommend focusing on sourcing. The manufacturers who make cells for Apple and auto manufacturers bin their output just like other silicon fabs and only give Apple&#x2F;automotive customers the best cells (selling the rest to less discerning clients making consumer electronics, ecigs, etc.). On the extreme, I&#x27;ve seen batches of 18650s from the same manufacturer vary from 2Ah to 3.5Ah depending on what quality of Samsung cells they got. You could probably eek out 10-30% more life that way, but it&#x27;s hard to predict the final outcome during R&amp;D.')
