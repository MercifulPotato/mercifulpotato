Shops sometimes say &quot;Non-commissioned salesperson&quot; to try to diffuse that belief, but I&#x27;m skeptical.<p>I wonder if for major purchases, there&#x27;d be a market equivalent to the &quot;independent fee-based investment advisor.&quot;  Basically unbundle the service experience brick-and-mortar traditionally provided and let people buy it seperately.  You&#x27;d pay a modest service charge up front and discuss with them what your needs are, and then they find you the right product and the cheapest&#x2F;most reliable place to buy it.  It comes with a service guarantee-- if you buy through their recommendation, they are responsible for negotiating warranty&#x2F;service hassles.<p>I could see spending a $20 fee to know I completely slam-dunked a $500 purchase, especially if they can regularly yield outcomes like &quot;Our huge network of merchant data found you the bike&#x2F;appliance&#x2F;etc. you wanted at some tiny brick-and-mortar in Baltimore and it comes out $50 cheaper delivered than any retailer you&#x27;d consider locally.&quot;  Brick-and-mortar retailers don&#x27;t have to try to maintain an expensive sales and customer-service experience and convert to rack-em-high-sell-em-cheap warehouses, and no-service-required customers can skip the consultancy and go directly to them and still get a decent price.<p>They &quot;advisor&quot; service would have to be explicitly independent and no-kickbacks for this to work... so I suspect what would happen is that it would build trust for a few years, then start undermining it by taking incentives to steer business.')
