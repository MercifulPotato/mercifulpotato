Not sure which crime fits the facts though (sedition, attempted murder, etc.) That will depend on actual facts, which is why we have trials, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t think it is reasonable to think that everyone on the Capitol grounds had that same ill intent. More likely that the organized minority instigated the crowd and used them as cover for their shameful and ridiculous efforts.<p>Needless to say, the predominent narrative seems to be that anyone in the crowd was an &quot;insurrectionist&quot;. That goes too far IMHO.')
