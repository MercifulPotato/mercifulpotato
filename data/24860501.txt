Logical though that may be, I had no idea.<p>It&#x27;s not as if I even have a complicated custom theme in my .emacs - I have a couple of lines, but mainly I just don&#x27;t change the colours from their defaults any more. I care a great deal about what my editor looks like, but it turns out that the default colours - black text, white background, pleasantly dark font-lock colours - are perfect for me already. (I waste my time on fonts instead)')
