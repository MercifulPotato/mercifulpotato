Item(by='bayindirh', descendants=None, kids=[25003206], score=None, time=1604617447, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25002844, text='Firefox and Thunderbird are not <i>wild</i> applications in terms of dependencies. They&#x27;re happy to work with whatever libraries you have on the system. I&#x27;m not sure Firefox 82 requires significantly newer versions of the libraries required by Firefox 68. It&#x27;s same for Thunderbird.<p>In that case you have two choices. You can either use a PPA or just download the .tar.gz release and expand to a folder under your home folder. I did the second one a lot. In our system room we have a computer which runs CentOS 6  and used for mundane tasks. When I have to work there and have some extra time, I just get the latest Firefox release and untar under my home folder, and continue using that.<p>I&#x27;ll have to go there tomorrow and will try Firefox 82 just for fun.<p>Canonical pushes its users a lot and, I always hear the same thing: &quot;It&#x27;s <i>just</i> one package&quot;, It&#x27;s well explained. No, just no. When I apt-get something, I expect an apt package. Not a silent install of snapd and and a snap, and a lot of under the hood tweaking to hide what they&#x27;re doing.<p>If it&#x27;s a universe package and it is <i>not supported at all</i>, why they&#x27;re declaring it as a play pen and doing their testing on that? It&#x27;s not supported, OK but, it&#x27;s not declared for testing.<p>The problem with Snap is not the idea. It&#x27;s centralization, it&#x27;s trying to dominate the space, it&#x27;s the silent pushing-forward and portraying it as the only way. No, it&#x27;s not.<p>A lot of companies are pushing a lot of ideas because they like it internally and, they push it harder when they experience pressure because, they see themselves the only people with the <i>right opinions</i> and it benefits them to dominate the space.<p>I already don&#x27;t like Canonical because of a lot of things but, they&#x27;re becoming the thing they wanted to dethrone. The bugzilla&#x27;s #1 bug was Microsoft&#x27;s domination and they&#x27;re just trying to their tactics and, integrating to anything they were against, <i>because money</i>.<p>With their every action, I move one step further away from them.')
