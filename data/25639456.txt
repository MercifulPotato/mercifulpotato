FBI agent gets a tip that someone said something that triggered an alarm at this address, but with zero other context. Agent proceeds to play Bad Cop and interrogate the subject.<p>What seems stupid to me is why wouldn&#x27;t you at least do some due diligence on the address? Are they really hitting so many houses in a day they can&#x27;t be bothered to figure out who lives there, and are their snooping tools so poor they only get a single point of data &quot;Possible bogey at this address.&quot; Real good way to get someone shot IMO. The reason for a visit and the context around it should be much more front-and-center. Like, from their perspective either this was completely innocent, in which case you don&#x27;t need Mr. Bad Cop in the first place, or you&#x27;re walking into a house with a bunch of would-be domestic terrorists, in which case you&#x27;re going to need a lot more than two plain-clothes officers with guns.<p>Now what seems alarming to me is the idea that Zoom is automatically SWATting people, just like they used to say about the phone lines. If I say I&#x27;m going to &quot;bomb the capitol&quot; on a zoom call am I going to get a visit from Mr. Bad Cop?')
