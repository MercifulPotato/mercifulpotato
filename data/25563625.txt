I have recently released my first game in the app store. It is a simple game, and so this is probably the 3rd rewrite of it.<p>The second rewrite was when I finally had an apple device, so I thought &quot;I will do everything the apple way&quot; - I used Swift and SpriteKit, and tried to do everything exactly how I thought the Apple people would like.<p>I then dropped that laptop, and was told it would cost more than the price of the laptop to repair, so I decided to do another rewrite - this time, using my linux laptop.<p>The experience of writing it in plain documented C, and using libSDL2 for most of the IO was far superior. Writing my own physics engine instead of using the SpriteKit one made the actual gameplay better (because it meant I could easily fudge physics a bit to make it more fun).<p>Only at the very end of the project did I then go through the painful process of making it happy with xcode, happy to build for iOS, and then finally happy with the Apple review process (including hacking my SDL build to remove bluetooth peripheral support so I didn&#x27;t need to request unwanted permissions).<p>I now have an M1 Macbook Air, and I&#x27;ve briefly looked again at doing things the &quot;apple way&quot; (e.g. swiftui) and I&#x27;m coming to a similar conclusion.')
