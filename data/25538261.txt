Those people who consume these wildlife animals are the rich and the powerful –a small minority.”<p>Thanks for that, I viewed that some time ago and found it very informative. I am not sure I&#x27;d agree it plays a big economical role, rather it became an alternative outlet for some producers but mostly it appears to be a luxury item for the rich and thus entirely viable for China to ban.<p>I&#x27;d have a lot more sympathy if poor people ate such animals to survive (as with a lot of &#x27;bush meat&#x27; in Africa) however that isn&#x27;t the case.<p>China have no excuse for not closing these, at all. Traditional Chinese &#x27;medicine&#x27; where they grind down very many animal parts in extremely unclean environments is another big flashpoint.<p>The risk is at the species-extinction level yet the actions by the world and the coverage by journalists is so low. Astonishes me.')
