Identifying oneself as a source to a journalist is a critical and important part of being a whistleblower.  The Intercept could never have published anything without some authentication of where it came from.  You think you can just mail some documents anonymously and papers will run with it?<p>I mean, <i>maybe</i> you could argue that in the case of specific kinds of documents that are self-authenticating, I guess.
