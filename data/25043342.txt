I never thought of myself as a pizza fundamentalist. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d find a pizza hill to die on. But I also never thought anything like &quot;Detroit&quot; pizza existed. I can deal with the shape: Sicilian pizza has been a thing for a long time, and let&#x27;s face it: Chicago deep dish is standing on the should of a giant when it <i>improved</i> on the thickness of Sicilian.<p>But cheese all the way to the edge, and browned crispy? That&#x27;s almost too much. But not quite: It&#x27;s the <i>type</i> of cheese. I don&#x27;t see mozzarella in that link you posted, I don&#x27;t even see the lesser trinity of 3 cheeses. I see something called &quot;brick&quot; cheese. That&#x27;s just a bridge too far.<p>I won&#x27;t be the one to push the button on this and trigger the fallout that comes with it, Detroit has enough problems as it is. But you need to hope the true pizza extremists don&#x27;t hear about this. Maybe delete the post, or at least put a &#x2F;s sarcasm flag on the end. Also at the beginning, and in the middle. Maybe one after each word.<p>Also Detroit pizza looks awesome and I want some right now.')
