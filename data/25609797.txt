If they don&#x27;t build very effective antibodies, they shouldn&#x27;t be putting much selective pressure on the virus, because if they did, they&#x27;d be more effective in the first place.<p>I suppose it depends on how exactly &quot;effective&quot; plays out here, as well as how easy it is for the virus to mutate significantly but stay as contagious as it is, but if we get unlucky it seems like just a question of time for it to get bad. Given Jan-Mar 2019, I have little faith that the US would ever be in a position to fully eradicate even a small remaining bit, and it would instead fester and mutate in this scenario until exploding again.<p>Maybe multiple vaccines mitigates this a bit...')
