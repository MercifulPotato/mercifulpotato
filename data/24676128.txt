I&#x27;ve seen so many cases where YAML schemas turn into a quasi-DSL, because the developer thought that it was more important to have a clean <i>looking</i> configuration than one that is easy to edit. The result is that things like indentation get really weird, because the developer didn&#x27;t optimize for having a sane underlying model.<p>A great comparison for this is CircleCI&#x27;s config syntax and that used by GitHub Actions. The Circle format is extremely error prone; about half the time when I&#x27;m modifying a Circle config, I&#x27;ll end up pushing a broken config, even though the YAML syntax itself is valid. With the GitHub Actions format, I almost never screw it up. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a coincidence that if you convert a Circle configuration to JSON, it looks twisted and bizarre, whereas if you do the same with a GHA config, it looks perfectly ordinary and sensible.<p>If you think of YAML as &quot;a prettier version of JSON&quot;, and design as if your users will work primarily with JSON, you can do fine with it. If you think of it as a medium for building your own configuration language, you&#x27;ll make something awful. The problem is that any human friendly format is going to inherently encourage the latter.')
