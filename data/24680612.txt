I think we can agree that psychedelics <i>do weird things</i> (you may have not a whole bunch of first hand experience, and I can report from tons of reading that the variety and nature of first hand experiences is <i>highly variable</i>).<p>You have noticed (directly &amp;&#x2F;or read anecdotes &amp; &quot;beliefs&quot; of users) some sample of the results (a subset of all user experiences, which is a subset of all the experiences that are possible in the space), and logically formed some sort of a conclusion about what psychedelics do&#x2F;offer.  I am speaking of that which is beyond - the far more rare experiences of people who have used them very deliberately as a tool (practices &amp; results you are not aware of), and then also that which lies beyond anyone&#x27;s experiences thus far.  Might there be something important within these spaces (think from the perspective of a Venn Diagram), of which you have no information, but does in fact exist (or, could exist)?')
