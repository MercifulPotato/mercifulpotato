When it really boils down, GraphQL is just REST with types and the capability of performing multiple requests in one. Much like React is a way of creating component types from HTML elements.\nGraphQL takes a bit more work to get setup and running, but it&#x27;s soo worth it in the end if you value typing. One of the most impressive parts of GQL that REST isn&#x27;t capable of having, is the vast tooling ecosystem enabled by a standardly typed data transfer model, the fact that anyone can write a library that can automatically hook into your model is incredibly powerful.<p>I find most people who have negative opinions on GraphQL simply haven&#x27;t taken the dive yet to fully understand it, and they typically overthink what it actually does. In my opinion, if you&#x27;re writing a progressive web&#x2F;mobile app with relational data, you should hands down be using GraphQL.')
