I&#x27;ve owned a bunch of digital Leica gear, and I&#x27;ll flatly say that the M lenses produce some of the best images you&#x27;ll see from a raw optical pipeline. A 50mm APO Summicron is an exceptional lens for its optical characteristics; same goes for most of their &#x27;cron  and &#x27;lux models.<p>By contrast, Leica&#x27;s digital M bodies have always been at least a generation behind... at their time of release. The way you deal with this is correct exposure discipline, such that there&#x27;s less to deal with in post. Newer M bodies have gotten much better, however.<p>The Q is a really interesting line, since I assume it&#x27;s a collaborative project between Panasonic, Tower Jazz, and Leica. Frankly, the images for both the Q and Q2 are outstanding, and I&#x27;d throw down another $5k for a 50mm Q2. If you seriously think an X100V can compete with a Q2 for full pipeline imaging (capture to print), you&#x27;re nuts. I&#x27;ve personally seen large prints come out of my Epson P800 from an XE-3 + 23&#x2F;1.4 and my Q2 and the noise reduction artifacts inherent to the X-trans filter are noticeable on paper. If all you&#x27;re doing is posting to IG or Flickr, Fuji is amazing for the money.')
