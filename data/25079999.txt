I don&#x27;t know German enough to find this specific law, but I do know that by default copyright associations have a presumption to copyrights over certain media (like GEMA&#x27;s case in music, which is used on YouTube around 2010, and Google was found guilty of that and therefore Google pays royalties to GEMA).')
