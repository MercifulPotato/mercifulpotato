So picture some, however oversimplified, code which \nsearches a customer&#x27;s orders, \ndetermines which is a phone product id, remembering they sell other stuff which we would not want to update in flight order details on,  \nthen updates the embedded customer address on the order.<p>I would like to hear some original thoughts on why this is so difficult that a human is doing this work instead.<p>Obviously maintaining a different behaviour for a class of product ids is painful and not beautiful code to look at, but it is the real world.')
