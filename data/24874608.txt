I used to study french art history there. You could start in the 16th century and walk through tons of corridors (Like it literally would take you days to do the whole thing and it’s really exhausting touring a museum for hours and days on end) to follow the progression of history. It all told a story - the church very involved in the beginning, the to the rococo with les fetes galantes and artists like Watteau. Then you finish up with paintings that are so big they start at the floor and end two stories up on the ceiling, with artists like Jacques Luis david [1]. After, you can cross the river to the d’orsay to continue the history tour.<p>As far as labeling things, well, they have audio tours in tons of languages. Also, if you are familiar with history and philosophy, you should be able to figure out what’s going on in each painting.<p>At face value you decide if you like art. If you want the deeper appreciation, that takes a lot of knowledge!!!<p>By the way, yes, the Rodin museum is awesome. Tons of statues and rose gardens. You might know rodin’s sculpture, le penseur [2] or his other work, origin of the world [3] Across the street from the Rodin museum is la defense which has nepolean’s tomb - a total site to see.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jacques-Louis_David" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jacques-Louis_David</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fr.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Le_Penseur" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fr.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Le_Penseur</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;platform&#x2F;amp&#x2F;2015&#x2F;3&#x2F;6&#x2F;8160721&#x2F;facebook-censorship-vagina-painting-france-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;platform&#x2F;amp&#x2F;2...</a>')
