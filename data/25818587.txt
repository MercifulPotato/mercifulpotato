Here is a bit of backdrop.<p>We started Instil after finding out that many classes have gone live after the lockdowns began. It seemed to us that the live classes are here to stay and we should make our move to adapt to the changing paradigm.<p>We wanted to not just build a software solution, but also a community platform with a gallery.
