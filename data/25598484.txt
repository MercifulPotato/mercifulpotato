I mean this doesn&#x27;t require any explanation.<p>The point of trying out new products like VPN, relays SHOULD be to find alternative funding for Firefox&#x27;s development. Also what makes you think it is only Google who can fund Firefox? This is a pretty shallow (and lazy) reasoning, pardon my language.<p>I&#x27;m suggesting we disband Mozilla as it is the core problem with Firefox. Clean browser from scratch or not, we need a chromium alternative.<p>Direct question that cannot be answered at one go.
