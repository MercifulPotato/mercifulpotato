Product reviews must be about the product in the listing, and you didn&#x27;t actually receive it so you can&#x27;t reasonably review it.<p>Product reviews are not seller-specific so fulfillment issues cannot be described there as they do not apply to all sellers. Seller issues can be posted in seller feedback, instead, which affects seller rating.<p>IOW, the product reviews must be something that the manufacturer did well&#x2F;poorly and thus apply to all buyers, regardless of who is the seller.')
