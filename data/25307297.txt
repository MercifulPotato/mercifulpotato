But if one think about it a little, what is your investment? It is time, isn&#x27;t it? So why every reading guide I&#x27;ve read talks about how to spend even more time on each book increasing investment, instead of how to read from book just the most valuable key points in no time?<p>To be fair, the author of this guide mentions this. One should ask himself &quot;why I&#x27;m reading&quot; and to choose right approach. The guide even quotes Naval Ravikant:<p><i>&gt; As Naval Ravikant points out on the Farnam Street podcast, most books have the one point to make and itâ€™s fine to fast-forward and skip and skim and do all these other sinful things.</i><p>But there are no information how to do it. It is just like the situation described at the beginning of this guide: we tell you that you should learn, but we don&#x27;t expect us to tell you how you should learn.')
