A single bit-flip in a JPEG image can totally ruin it. And you won&#x27;t notice without opening it, because the thumbnail is unaffected. When you finally notice, the corruption has possibly spread to backups already.<p>For servers that is especially important, because data will reside cached in memory for days or even weeks. Also ECC is often the last line of defense against Rowhammer.')
