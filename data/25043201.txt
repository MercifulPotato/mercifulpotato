It was also built as a client&#x2F;server desktop application. Not really a good choice in my opinion. Sure there were no offline PWA at the time, but by contrast if your SAP backend dies all the local applications in a hospital e.g. writing the release report also dies.<p>Needless to say given it&#x27;s immense complexity it was also impossible to use this monstrosity elsewhere.<p>But replacing it with Cerner in a $16bn project is just sad.')
