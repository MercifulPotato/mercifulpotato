Don’t ask us to deploy troops, it’s not like Americans are going to actually storm their own Capitol.”<p>And then after the quarter, “OK, Americans didn’t storm the Inauguration, but are you <i>sure</i> that’s because you so-called mitigated the risk with 20K troops?  All this money, no attack, maybe we should spend that money on teachers instead of troops.”<p>In this space, lack of negative outcomes breeds contempt for the mitigation.  (Hmmm...)<p>Interestingly, in the <i>very long</i> long run, that might even be right, as better education on civics is solving the problem at the left, earlier in the production line.<p>So now you have a new problem, which is to convince those deciders not close to the problem and disinterested in openly admitting gaps, that they need to both spend on the 20K troops now, <i>and</i> double down on teachers for a payoff 10 years from now, so that <i>after</i> that they don’t have to spend on the troops... best luck.')
