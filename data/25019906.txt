A long time ago. This started big a while ago and has had ever-weakening aftershocks... Oklahoma City, Waco, Charlottesville.<p>Now we’re at the stage of a flash Trump caravan maybe provoking a fender-bender and baseless lawsuits from a couple of NY goons.<p>It’s done.<p>The quicker people realize this the better. (They won’t realize it quickly, unfortunately. The champions of “conservative” right now are a porno-appearing, self-bragging pussy-grabber, and a bizarrely diminished former NY mayor who now unsuccessfully promotes conspiracy theories and is a punchline in a Borat movie.)')
