In fact, most package managers don&#x27;t really provide any guarantees at all; almost all of them support something like preinst.sh and postinst.sh scripts which can basically do anything. It&#x27;s the package <i>maintainers</i> that are supposed to provide the guarantees you describe. Of course, they&#x27;re only human, and their incentives might not line up with yours.<p>And if you stray outside the official channels, as most users must at least some of the time, then you&#x27;re back to all-bets-are-off. Fetching and installing packages from a channel hosted by some third party really is no better from a security standpoint than running a (signed) shell script from that same party.<p>EDIT: I should add that there may be some new, advanced package management systems that do actually provide strong guarantees, like only putting files in certain directories, never setting the setuid&#x2F;setgid bits on executable files, or perhaps ensuring that all files from a package are owned by a user:group associated with that package (the Linux From Scratch docs describe a package management scheme like that, it&#x27;s worth checking out). I&#x27;m referring here to the majority of popular package managers, e.g. dpkg, which will run arbitrary code during installation.')
