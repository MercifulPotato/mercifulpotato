I would think instead that this low performance is <i>deliberate</i> because it locally optimizes Facebooks KPIs.<p>My understanding is that Facebook has a lot of data on the elasticity of ad buyers. If Facebook were to have even more precise algorithms, then they would likely charge even more money for impressions and clicks. Presumably buyers may be reticent to pay even higher prices.<p>Alternatively more precise targeting would highly bias the money people spend toward larger companies that can afford better keywords.')
