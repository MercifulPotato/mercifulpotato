I could see that if you used a shared space or laundromat but in those situations you aren&#x27;t paying the power bill.  Laundry is set it and forget it.<p>It is regressive but at least in CA the reason is to discourage use because demand exceeds grid capacity and results in rolling blackouts.

Solar and battery are incentivized so many homes use zero power during peak times or backfeed power onto the grid.')
