I recently was fed up with the price of a beverage at the local overpriced Albertson&#x27;s, $3 per tiny can.  Decided to order a case on big A instead, to save some money.<p>Guess what, same price per can plus exorbitant shipping cost on Amzn.  Came out to ~$5 a can and I had to buy 4 or 12 at a time.  It just didn&#x27;t make sense.  I left a polite review that said as much, and it was rejected.  :D')
