I’m always hesitant to have the line inspected in the UK because there’s every chance OpenReach will come around and balls it up further.<p>I’ve been doing this manually for the past couple of years without any negative effects that I’ve seen. I’d say it tends to happen maybe once every two to three months, which makes me think it’s more likely an issue further up the chain.
