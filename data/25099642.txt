I worked with for years on the Go team, from the early days.<p>But ken was at Google a long time before the Go project started. (The Go project was not developed in Google&#x27;s monorepo and was not subject to Google&#x27;s readabiliy process, as is the case for many Google projects.)  What ken was referring to was indeed the C++ Readability process (which doesn&#x27;t stop anyone committing code, just requires a review from a person with the &#x27;readability&#x27; certification before committing; as mentioned upthread). I know this from talking to him about it, specifically.<p>I can&#x27;t offer you any more proof other than the fact that I was a witness. If you don&#x27;t believe that, then I&#x27;m sorry? Not sure what else to tell you.<p>FWIW your conduct in this thread is extremely obnoxious. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find a way to debate that, too, but please consider that I have no vested interest in telling you this other than hoping you might better learn how your conduct is perceived by others.')
