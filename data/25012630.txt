Didn&#x27;t even realize they were a Greyhound brand! I&#x27;m not a very finnicky public transit user and while not fancy, the buses I was on were usually pretty clean and spacious. I do wish Americans were more willing to utilize buses, as often times they are a very economic way of getting around (both for the individual, the environment and congestion on the roads).<p>There is a very similar style bus service in Europe called FlixBus that I have fond (nostalgic) memories of as an <i>incredibly</i> cheap way to get around Europe.  Was it fun trying to sleep on a cramped 12 hour bus ride? No. But you can&#x27;t beat getting from Bratislava to Zagreb for only 20 euro!')
