It doesn&#x27;t really matter whether you&#x27;re paying them $20 directly, or whether you&#x27;re generating $20 of ad revenue - either way, you&#x27;re worth $20 to them.<p>Of course, you are quite right to point out that Google&#x27;s business model does incentivize behavior that isn&#x27;t what their users would want.  But the same is true of Apple - their business model strongly incentivizes them to create lock-in to the platform.  Whether this bothers you more or less than Google&#x27;s need to mine your data is I guess a matter of personal preference.')
