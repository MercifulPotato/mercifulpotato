Any features or issues end up being proxied through these nontechnical resources.\nThis is why you will hear devs complain loudly about the parasitic product department (or equivalent layer above them) that always just seem to be\n&gt; getting in the way<p>However, because developers often don&#x27;t actually want to interface with customers and just want to build cool tech, and charming socialites are very glad to act as that interface, this usually works. As a secondary effect they (non-intentionally) obfuscate the inner workings of the company from the devs who would otherwise (as the GP points out) realise how much they are being (ab)used and turn the screws on the upper management.')
