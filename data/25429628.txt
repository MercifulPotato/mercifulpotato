You&#x27;re asking the candidate to guess what kind of answer you&#x27;re looking for.<p>Possible answers, all valid, all tell you absolutely nothing<p>* I&#x27;d change nothing, it works &quot;AS A PHONE&#x27; just fine. There are better things to to work on<p>* I&#x27;d attach it to the side of a rocket so you could use it as a handle. I&#x27;d much rather ride a rocket than use the phone<p>* I&#x27;d double the speakers and mic and offset them at 45 degrees so two people could hug cheeks while talking to the same person<p>* I&#x27;d give it a display, add a computer, and have it pocket size and it would annoy you all day long with notifications and distract you from getting anything done. People would stop using it as a phone and mostly only write text messages to each other which would be way less efficient than voice. Oh wait, you said &quot;improve&quot;.  Yea, ok, bad suggestion')
