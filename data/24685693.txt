The researchers found that 71% of infected individuals did not infect any of their contacts, while a mere 8% of infected individuals accounted for 60% of new infections -- providing evidence for so-called &#x27;superspreaders&#x27;. Regarding children, the researchers found that &#x27;These patterns of enhanced transmission risk in similar-age pairs were strongest among children ages 0-14 years and among adults ages ≥65 years&#x27;, \nand that they &#x27;identif[ied] high prevalence of infection among children who were contacts of cases around their own age&#x27; -- something that was also true in adults.<p>The overall case-to-fatality ratio was between 0.05% at ages 5-17 years to 16.6% at ages ≥85 years.')
