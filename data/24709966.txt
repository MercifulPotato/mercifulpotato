How do you handle dishes where you&#x27;re frying something, but then need to add some vinegar, a tomato base, or a cup of water to boil into the pan after frying? I use my cast iron at the moment because these dishes start with a lot of frying and then go straight in the oven near the end, but they&#x27;re pretty hard on the seasoning in the pan. I&#x27;ve been thinking the stainless pan might be good for these so it can still go in the oven and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the vinegar destroying my seasoning.')
