But that&#x27;s not the same as doing it in all the analyses that are claimed to show wealth inequality. Not all sources define &quot;inflation&quot; the way the CPI does.<p>Also, even in the CPI, they don&#x27;t do &quot;hedonic adjustments&quot;, which is what you are describing, for all goods. For example, I mentioned cars and computers; the only adjustments made for those items are &quot;cost based adjustments&quot;. And many items don&#x27;t even get those.<p>Then there&#x27;s the question of whether the methodology they are using for making &quot;hedonic adjustments&quot; where they are making them actually captures what it claims to capture, which is, to say the least, not something everyone agrees on.')
