Every tech can be used for the right and the wrong. The fact something is used in a bad way should not prevent us from building the tech so we can reap the benefits of the good uses it can offer.<p>One example for a decentralized web benefit that I see promising: wouldn&#x27;t it be just amazing if you had something like Facebook, but all the posts were not owned by Facebook? Just think of the possibilities to use your own UI, have your own recommendation algorithm etc... This can be amazing. I deeply want something like.
