But you pain a one sided story.<p>So basically problematic usage has gone down. But regular legalized decriminalized recreational usage has gone up. So I picture it like coffee. More addicts everywhere but it&#x27;s legal. Replace coffee with heroin and it&#x27;s pretty much the same picture.<p>Is it better to live in a society where everyone does a cup of heroin in the morning and it&#x27;s totally normal and no one is dysfunctional or is it better to have the heroin relegated to a few violent problematic users?<p>It makes sense. You decriminalize a crime you get less crimes. Maybe changing perspectives is the solution but then again maybe not.')
