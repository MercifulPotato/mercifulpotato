Yet, when put in context, it can end up looking less serious than other health problems that are much more familiar to us. That&#x27;s surprising and thus newsworthy.<p>This is something critical thinkers have been flagging up all year: the numbers are low. They&#x27;re especially low compared to predictions but they&#x27;re low in an absolute sense as well, usually below a host of other regular killers. Many of the headline stats disguise this fact, like the oft quoted &quot;COVID deaths&quot; number that is picking up a lot of people who died of old age because doctors aren&#x27;t allowed to write that anymore. On death certificates every death must have a cause because if there&#x27;s a cause it can be fixed. This is an interesting health care industry mentality, that nobody ever dies because everyone dies, instead they died for a fixable reason, but beyond the philosophical questions that poses it also leads to this problem whereby people see the numbers and assume every &quot;COVID death&quot; could have been prevented.<p>The &quot;it&#x27;s just a flu&quot; meme comes about because the numbers of excess deaths are in most places so low that this is a pretty reasonable comparison. In America it looks like that isn&#x27;t the case, but there&#x27;s some suggestion now that there has been a pretty steady ~1.2% y&#x2F;o&#x2F;y increase in deaths for many years now, so we&#x27;d expect an &quot;excess death&quot; in the USA of 1.2% anyway. This is unlike in most countries where death rates have been falling, which is why it yields a confused picture.')
