Of course Protonmail encrypts it, but passphrases are supposed to be an additional layer of security, not the only one. If Protonmail has a data breach, is compelled to surrender your keys or turns out to be untrustworthy, your messages are only as secure as your password.<p>- You cannot control when a web app is updated or verify that everyone else got the same update. So Protonmail – or an attacker  that took control of their systems – could give you an update that gives them your unencrypted keys. That may be mostly a theoretical issue because few people do that with their local software either. Still, I&#x27;d trust the Debian&#x2F;Ubuntu repositories more.<p>- Web apps have additional attack surfaces compared to local software. Malicious browser extensions can&#x27;t access the data of local software, nor is local software suspectible to things like XHR attacks.')
