Bitcoin&#x27;s security is ultimately underpinned by each node being able to independently validate the chainstate.  If nodes couldn&#x27;t be guaranteed to receive all blocks on the best fork -- a task fulfilled not by miners, but by the continued availability of non-mining nodes that store and relay blocks -- then not only would miners be unable to build a high-quality chain (since they would have a hard time receiving each other&#x27;s blocks), but also it would be much easier to eclipse nodes and&#x2F;or feed them a valid but lower-quality chain that they would be unable to determine is the globally-best chain.<p>Also, block validity includes more than just proof-of-work. \n Each node ultimately decides which block it accepts or rejects.  The protocol defines the minimum criteria for a block to be valid, but each node may independently apply additional criteria that must be met.  If all nodes decide to reject a protocol-valid block that a miner produces, then the block will be orphaned -- it won&#x27;t matter how many descendant blocks get built on it, because the rest of the network will ignore them all.  In fact, this is the mechanism by which a user-activated soft fork works [1].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.bitcoin.it&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Softfork" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.bitcoin.it&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Softfork</a>')
