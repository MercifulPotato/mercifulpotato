It&#x27;s the context. A world cup game (on of the best in recent decades at that), an Argentina x England after a war which precipitated massive change in Argentina, the whole atmosphere around that match. Then the hand of god, then that goal. It will be a legend remembered for centuries to come, in the memory and folklore of Argentinians especially, and of football lovers everywhere.')
