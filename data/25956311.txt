Mine was frozen for well over a year with about three grand in it, no explanation, no apology. I only got it back in the end by involving the financial ombudsman via a website [1] specifically set up to help people who Monzo have scammed, because there are literally tens of thousands of them. Even then, no apology, no explanation - just an email one day telling me they were closing my account but at least giving me the option to transfer my own money out.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;programmes&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2qS0HM6nBkcPMx0W8t7fqVJ&#x2F;monzo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;programmes&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2qS0HM6nBkcPMx0W8t...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.resolver.co.uk&#x2F;freeadvice&#x2F;companies&#x2F;monzo-complaints&#x2F;services?territory_id=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.resolver.co.uk&#x2F;freeadvice&#x2F;companies&#x2F;monzo-compla...</a>')
