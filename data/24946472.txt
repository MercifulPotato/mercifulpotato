Which is quite complex and I cannot fully wrap my head around it. But here&#x27;s my take nonetheless.<p>In this case, placing the &quot;I think&quot; would make it a belief. This could also make a statement an opinion, but from what I understand, beliefs have a non-zero chance of being proven or disproven, whereas opinions cannot be proven.<p>&quot;I think gentleman11 is nice username&quot; is a bit different than &quot;I think gentleman11 is a man&quot;. Something being &quot;nice&quot; is a bit harder to prove, and possibly impossible without additional context. Thus, it is an opinion. Someone being an man, cheater, alcoholic, etc have the ability to be proven, so it&#x27;s not as much an opinion as a belief.<p>I&#x27;m not a linguist, but I&#x27;d be interested in what language specialists have to say on this.')
