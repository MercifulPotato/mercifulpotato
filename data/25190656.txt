The article is still worth reading if you want to learn about the &quot;Debt Jubilee&quot; concept they are advocating.<p>I&#x27;ve read many articles lately encouraging Joe Biden to unilaterally cancel student debt. This one says &quot;any American President, should they desire, can make every penny of federal student debt disappear without consulting Congress&quot;. And it&#x27;s clear most of these articles utilize a &quot;Just Do It&quot; kind of attitude that completely ignores the real and legitimate concerns many citizens like I have about the fairness and practicality of just forgiving (by making the government pay it instead) billions of dollars of voluntarily taken loans.')
