The why may have something to do with performance peaks attracting more attention for a sport (I would have expected at least a niche for upper body strength events for women and flexibility for men) but that could also be a chicken and egg thing with culture.<p>There certainly is sexist baggage involving women  being considered more &quot;ornamental&quot; though.')
