On Linux, this is mostly due to optional features which can be easily disabled. The optional features are all related to supporting rare and unusual system configurations and do not affect normal operation. Note that cross compilation with Linux as the target does not support dynamic linking, so all Go Linux binaries compiled on a non-Linux OS will be statically linked.<p>Regardless of how we scope it, Go is still the only mainstream language capable of producing statically linked Linux binaries without libc while still allowing full use of the standard library.')
