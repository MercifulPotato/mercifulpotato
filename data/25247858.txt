One of the modules involved wraps entt which is a template-heavy C++ library and not many languages can actually wrap with just a cdecl-y ffi layer.<p>Re: borrow checking: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nim-lang.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;manual_experimental.html#view-types" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nim-lang.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;manual_experimental.html#view-type...</a> It&#x27;s still pretty early and also IME the mix of arc (which is determinstic) with manually managed memory (esp. through some data structure that manages entity data like entt) has been pretty nice.')
