Kind of old and likely to be replaced soon.<p>LUMIX G100? New, but video record limit and bad autofocus.<p>Sony ZV1? Good autofocus, but no interchangeable lens and smaller sensor<p>It’s really hard to find something that is clearly the best choice.<p>Edit: just saw your response to the other comment, thanks')
