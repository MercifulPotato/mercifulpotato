In all my four decades in tech, code bitrots in the the web front-end environment faster than any other I&#x27;ve yet seen.   The Javascript language in particular (and its ecosystem) remains a baroque Gormenghast of curiosities built on an ancient sewer where nightmare beasts still roam, and everyone&#x27;s holed up in the throne room hoping a few trusted paladins will somehow decontaminate the rest.<p>&gt; How do we get out of this?<p>Personally, I try to use as little JS as possible.  CSS is in better shape and handles a ton of page-level behaviours, HTTP&#x2F;2 has done wonders for round-trip responsiveness, such that server-rendered HTML still holds the productivity crown for building out MVPs and SaaS application interfaces and the like.<p>When I absolutely must write JS, I&#x27;ll tend towards typescript these days, and minimise dependencies to the point where I hopefully have no node_modules&#x2F; or bundler at all.')
