I&#x27;m not saying those views are reasonable, but they are easier to contemplate if you swim in a sea of right-wing viewpoints, some of which actually make some sense. Read Fox News, The Federalist, etc., hangout on r&#x2F;Conservative, follow the YouTube right-wing rabbit-hole a ways, and you will be really pissed off but probably have a better sense for how people can get sucked into that kind of worldview. My experience is that it takes constant effort to avoid capture by the &quot;default&quot; left-leaning viewpoint that comes through most mainstream news sources. I live in a place where I am exposed to the Trump viewpoint only rarely, and I found myself aghast at some friends who said they were thinking about voting for Trump. But when they explained their reasons for it, it was clear we weighed the importance of things differently, but their reasoning made a lot of sense. But my initial reaction had been outright rejection, like an immune system fighting an invader.')
