I&#x27;d argue this is not really Slack&#x27;s competition as Slack would&#x27;ve been a non-starter for many of these companies to begin with.<p>Teams however definitely didn&#x27;t win the small business&#x2F;startup game where tools are actually chosen based on functionality (and where end-users have a say in which tools to use) and Microsoft&#x27;s market-penetration is lower or non-existent (so the bundling of Teams with Office 365 has no effect). In these cases, Slack wins by a large margin on functionality and performance alone considering how bad Teams is.')
