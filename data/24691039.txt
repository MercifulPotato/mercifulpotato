I do not have a 1% or 0.0001% chance of experiencing failure any given message. I have 0.0001% chance of experiencing failure, unless I&#x27;m currently in a tunnel, or my ISP breaks something again, or [insert dozen other infrequent client-side failure modes], at which point my failure rate briefly hits 100%, and I&#x27;d very much appreciate if the UI didn&#x27;t lie to me about it.')
