Item(by='alisonatwork', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608091291, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25437545, text='I think you&#x27;re right that it&#x27;s a good idea to avoid using the terms introvert and extrovert.<p>In my original post I was perhaps falling a bit for a stereotype that introverts are also misanthropic. A more accurate description for me would be that I generally feel more at peace when I am picking my own path through life and don&#x27;t have any close or intimate relationships interfering with that. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s social events per se that bring me stress, it&#x27;s more the sense that I am obliged or expected to perform that causes me anxiety.<p>What&#x27;s still an interesting question for me is whether the sorts of negative health effects that - according to the article - are correlated with loneliness also happen to people who make a conscious choice to live more independent lifestyles. Is it physical isolation that causes these problems, or does it also happen to people who do superficially socialize in public but generally do so alone? Or are neither of these things a problem, only loneliness is a problem?')
