Item(by='anderspitman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610480288, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25752013, text='&gt; With all the CVEs we see every month due to what can be only called design flaws in C, I have a hard time saying that C did fine for last 30 years.<p>We can argue endlessly about which metrics of success are most important.<p>Zig looks cool. I&#x27;ve seen it mentioned a few times over the years. Looks like manual memory management is the default, yeah? That&#x27;s important IMO if you&#x27;re really trying to replace C. Rust is great but I just can&#x27;t iterate fast enough (yet). Does Zig offer an optional GC?<p>EDIT: Also I never said Go is a good C replacement. But I&#x27;m finding it useful for some of those tasks and suspect it will be less useful for them down the road.')
