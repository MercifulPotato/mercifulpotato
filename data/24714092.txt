Meanwhile harmless communities get banned simply because reddit doesn&#x27;t like them. Meanwhile there are other subreddits that get a pass for the same content on the opposite side of the political spectrum. The worst part is, hardly any alternatives have a community as large as it and is just as good.<p>Voat or ruqqus? Not unless you wanna listen to how the jews control the media. Mastodon? It&#x27;s a weird real time twitter hybrid that is like the tower of babel of social media. Facebook is extraordinarily lame now. All people do is post memes they see online elsewhere. 4chan? It is not user friendly at all.<p>I just want a place like old reddit again. Back when articles linked were legitimately decent, it wasn&#x27;t just memes, and &quot;kicks&quot; or &quot;bans&quot; were just a cadre of people that disagreed via downvote.<p>I personally blame the normies. Part of the great thing about the internet is the fact that you can say things you wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable in real life. Not just mean things but personal beliefs of political ones. Now these people who foster a community of thin skinned people who are agast people genuinely awful as though that was never a fact to begin with.')
