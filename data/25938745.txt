I didn&#x27;t see enough variety of examples, specifically animations or even game AI.<p>Uncanny valleys was quite common in games and 3d back in the day. 3d modeling anatomy, like faces, bodies, etc., required a lot of training to pull off properly, otherwise you ended up with the uncanny valley. Now with motion capture, and 3d scanning (plus  other tech of course) games and movies are basically humans acting, and there is almost no uncanny valley.<p>The video touches on part of what causes it, but the real cause is just attempting to recreate a human face REALISTICALLLY. Doing so in 3d was hard, and the industry avoided uncanny valleys in commercial content because of great artists, but software doesn&#x27;t have the limitations of hardware. Recreating humans in hardware will take way more than a great artist, if it is ever possible. Chances are we will avoid the uncanny valley all-together, and just make smart robots that have that simplified cartoon look to them.')
