The spring is loaded through some mechanism in the axle, which seems to be some sort of fixed axle that loads the spring through weight.  As it rotates, the mechanism which forces the spring closed through downward gravitational force ceases to apply, allowing the fixed axle to unload that spring into the unfixed axle, which propels the wheel.<p>It’s no more than a rotational gas spring. The same principle that lets you open and close the hood or trunk of your car with ease. At least that’s how I’m understanding it...')
