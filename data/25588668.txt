There is some evidence that there is a degree of immunity to COVID-19 in areas that had SARS-outbreaks. It would therefore be plausible that an initial COVID-19 outbreak in Southern China, the epicenter of SARS1, could have gone unnoticed.<p>The actual animals sold at the market would then be irrelevant, but there&#x27;s a narrative that &quot;animal cruelty and human encroachment are to blame for COVID&quot; that is being pushed here.')
