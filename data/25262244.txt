Frequent branches and latency for memory operations can make it difficult to keep a wide core fully utilized. Moreover, wider cores generally cannot clock as high. That’s why Intel and AMD have chosen to pursue narrower cores that can clock near 5 GHz.<p>The maximum ILP that can be extracted from code can be increased with better branch prediction accuracy, larger out of order window size, and more accurate memory disambiguation: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cse.uaa.alaska.edu&#x2F;~afkjm&#x2F;cs448&#x2F;handouts&#x2F;ILP-limitations.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cse.uaa.alaska.edu&#x2F;~afkjm&#x2F;cs448&#x2F;handouts&#x2F;ILP-limi...</a>. The M1 appears to have made significant advances in all three areas, in order for it to be able to keep such a wide core utilized.')
