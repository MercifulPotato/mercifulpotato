You get energy from fat, sugar and proteins. Healthy human can and should eat all three, but I really dont understand why specifically amount of low-fatness of some cereal box would be advantage.<p>Dietary fiber is a huge part of nutrition and you&#x27;re ignoring it in your above analysis. In particular, dietary fiber allows you to feel full without consuming ludicrous amounts of calories.<p>A high-fiber, low-sugar, low-fat cereal provides &quot;stomach filler&quot;, so to speak. It makes you feel full, it provides vitamins, minerals, and fiber (important nutrients to live).<p>The psychology of a full stomach has a huge effect on whether or not someone is going to overeat later in the day. If you eat high-calorie foods like lard (_unprocessed_ fat from pork belly), you&#x27;re simply not going to have as full of a stomach as someone who was filling up on fibers (even if those fibers are &quot;ultraprocessed&quot;).')
