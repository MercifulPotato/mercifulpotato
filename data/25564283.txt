A problem would be you then need a lift to carry everything to the top floor and an expensive structure to support it. You also have local wind and weather conditions to deal with at altitude.<p>Alternatively, you could use a ground-based slingshot to vertically propel gliders, an approach that is already used in the military and for some long distance UAV testing. However, the wing-based UAV vs. rotor-based UAV physics are very different. Landing an elevated glider with a clear path  to its target is one thing, maneuvering between trees and power lines in a complex environment without rotors is quite another.<p>Then you need to look at a &#x27;convertible&#x27; UAV with both features... undoubtedly this raises the cost, reduces the carrying capacity, and is already being pursued.<p>Finally, you could zoom out and re-evaluate the business case. Why not use a network of local dispatch points (handover points to ground-based UAVs or vans) to reduce the distance to the consumer and with the smaller geographic scope negotiate private airspace access on locally agreeable terms. I believe this is the future for general consumption (food, regular deliveries within small package weight&#x2F;dimension limits).')
