I think that this is reasonable but somewhat on the low side.<p>My family of 3 spends around 100 to 130 Euros per week on groceries. We don&#x27;t really are trying to save on groceries and usually buy what we want. We eat not much meat and usually cook fresh instead of using convenience food. We try to buy medium to high quality, local and seasonal food.\nSo it&#x27;s a tad more than 150€ per person but not that much.')
