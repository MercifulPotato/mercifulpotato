Insects are pretty small — to get one to splatter on your windshield, the surrounding air needs to be under rather high acceleration so that the insect hits the windshield instead of following the air’s streamlines around your car.  This condition isn’t great for  aerodynamic drag.  Newer cars try harder to be efficient, which reduces their tendency to splatter insects in their paths.')
