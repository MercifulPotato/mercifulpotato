For example, Williamson County, TN (Nashville suburbs) is one of the 10 highest-income counties in the entire country. The Dallas, Atlanta, Chicago, and Denver suburbs are also very affluent.<p>Wikipedia&#x27;s collected some of the recent per-county census data here, although that isn&#x27;t a perfect metric since states vary a lot in county size: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_highest-income_counties_in_the_United_States" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_highest-income_countie...</a><p>In general there&#x27;s a good&#x2F;bad outcomes split within (almost?) every major American city between the affluent and the poor neighborhoods.
