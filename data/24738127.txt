That&#x27;s a big part of free enterprise.<p>Well it would need a legal justification if the alternative is that Apple would be penalized under anti-trust regulation for using its market share to hurt consumers for its own benefit.  Even &quot;free enterprise&quot; operates within a legal framework.<p>&gt; In practice, complicated laws with lots of reach usually work in favour of the party that can afford more and better lawyers.<p>I mean this is an incredibly defeatist and cynical view.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not overly optimistic that things will change based on the way laws have been applied in the last few decades, but the fact that people see laws as primarily a tool for the powerful - and don&#x27;t even have an expectation for legal enforcement to operate on behalf of the consumer - seems to me to be a large part of the reason the US is looking more and more like a failed state.')
