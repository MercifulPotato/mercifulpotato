This is extremely useful because one pattern I use frequently is element that has a lot of different modifiers like isSelected or isDeleted, in css you need to define classes for each, but here you just don&#x27;t return some styles if the prop is not set. You also get full typechecking with typescript for all components, their props and theme. You also get autoprefixer out-of-the-box, and as a bonus if you ever wanted to lazy-load parts of your app, the styles for it should tree-shake correctly without any modifications, unlike traditional css.')
