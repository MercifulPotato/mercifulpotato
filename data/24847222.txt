Open Source software is written in Poland with all the usual open source licences and it works so I&#x27;m sure at least in practice it&#x27;s not a problem.<p>But &quot;in practice&quot; is hardly sufficient :P<p>&gt; A lot of it is thanks to the fact that suing people is much less common here, so it never gets challanged. Also the person who lost the case pays the costs here unlike in the US so that&#x27;s a deterrent.<p>I&#x27;m a European too, and live in a very non-litiguous country, so I have no problem understanding the mindset of not suing over everything. But it still seems really weird for a country&#x27;s copyright system to <i>rely</i> on this (sane) behavior.<p>&gt; I think they&#x27;d have to prove that the way it&#x27;s used harms them. It&#x27;s not enough to say &quot;I don&#x27;t like it&quot;. But again IANAL.<p>So if a Polish resident contributes an original photograph to a Wikipedia article under CC-BY-SA-3.0, and I (or a Polish entity) use that photograph under the terms of the CC-BY-SA-3.0 in a way that &quot;harms&quot; the copyright holder, he can sue me (or the Polish entity in question) under Polish law? This seems absolutely insane to me, and surely can&#x27;t be the case!<p>This sounds a lot like the license that Berkeley SPICE was under a long time ago [1], whereby it was essentially open source, but specifically the South African police were not allowed to use it. This kind of stuff – even when well-intended – causes massive headaches.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;perens.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;09&#x2F;23&#x2F;sorry-ms-ehmke-the-hippocratic-license-cant-work&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;perens.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;09&#x2F;23&#x2F;sorry-ms-ehmke-the-hippocratic...</a>')
