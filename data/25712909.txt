Patreon is big for a reason: people actually use it.<p>I&#x27;d rather donate to the content creators I want to see thrive than be bombarded with ads for things I don&#x27;t want anyway.<p>The peertube devs refuse to incorporate monetization beyond donations, but they DO have a plugin system. It&#x27;s not beyond imagination for someone (person or group) to add something like &quot;paid scrobbling&quot; where people add e.g 5â‚¬ on their account and then it&#x27;s divided depending on certain criteria. That criteria could be for example:<p>- always give 50% to my subscriptions<p>- give the rest to creators of videos that I have watched which:<p><pre><code>  * have these tags\n\n  * are longer than 5 minutes\n\n  * and that I have watched at least 50% or 5 minutes of, which ever comes first\n</code></pre>\nAll of these would be opt-in or course to reduce the likelihood of uploaders artificially lengthening or shortening their videos (those magic 10 minutes on youtube), or trying to discover common user settings and tailoring their videos to fit those settings.<p>Tada. No ads, user-defined distribution of resources, yada yada.')
