Serverless takes a lot of work to learn and get good at. The benefit is negligible - no more than deploying a &quot;serverless&quot; thing to an existing web server we use for cross-cuting concerns like exception handling, logging and communication. 10 seconds of automated configuration management, another 10 to deploy. The Change Approval Board meeting to rubber stamp the deployment takes longer.<p>The breathless hype machine has and always will be just that - hype. Someone&#x27;s &quot;new, improved, OMG I found this you must use it now&quot; perspective is a pattern that&#x27;s older than Gartner&#x27;s hype cycle (which in itself has no basis in fact). It works well in the startup world, but has virtually no place in a business-critical environment, let alone healthcare, defence, telcos or similar.<p>Little wonder it&#x27;s adoption has stalled.')
