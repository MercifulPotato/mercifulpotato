We&#x27;re worse off without it.<p>I do realize that AOC&#x27;s green new deal was unanimously voted against; not a single democrat voted in favour of AOC&#x27;s legislation.<p>I&#x27;m surprised by your statement. That the rejection of nuclear power is the most disappointing point. Nuclear power has been shut down by Environmentalists. To me this is consistent with AOC&#x27;s stance as well as most environmentalists.<p>Personally the more disappointing things in the green new deal were banning heavy machinery in farming and banning of airplanes and all boats. Which is a reasonable position as an environmentalist as those emit very large quantities of carbon. Which was interesting because the Democrat Senators for Hawaii asked her about this exile. AOC responded that Hawaii would have to make short term sacrifices for climate change. Afterall without fossil fuels, how do people get to Hawaii.<p>Other&#x27;s inquired why the green new deal had so many provisions for universal health care, universal basic income, and housing. They weren&#x27;t exactly to do with anything about climate change. However, that&#x27;s the point. This has nothing to do with climate change.')
