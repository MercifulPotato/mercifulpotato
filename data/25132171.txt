I understand it is an open question though.<p>Though I do empathize with the addictiveness of productivity systems. As mentioned, it disguises itself as a form of productivity and can be easy to get carried away.<p>I think ultimately it comes down to how one implements their GTD system; I use it to offload stuff I don&#x27;t want to worry about remembering (including outlines for projects), and am careful to limit my view to only what&#x27;s currently on my plate. This allows me more time for &#x27;deep work&#x27;, but this work however is extremely unstructured, and I&#x27;ve come to learn that&#x27;s a feature and breaking it down into a GTD style checklist is not at all effective for me. I think that&#x27;s why it may be hard to come up with an equivalent system for deep work; it just doesn&#x27;t lend itself as well to a GTD style approach, so perhaps my criticisms above were misguided.')
