And, then if you add the fact that this one-level-above is also just a matter of faith and there is no evidence even of that, then the whole thing crumbles.<p>In other words, whether or not there is a God or Gods, has no bearing on me and my life and me and my life&#x27;s decisions are not going to be bound by that.<p>Whether that is atheism, or being agnostic, or something else can be left undefined. It&#x27;s more like, I don&#x27;t care. It is simply that my life&#x27;s decisions are not going to be in any way influenced by whether or not God or Gods exist, whatever the right word for that is.<p>BTW, the Hindu cosmology [0] does delve into such philosophical things, and perhaps my Hindu upbringing has something to do with my beliefs wherein asking such questions and pondering over them is allowed.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hindu_cosmology" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hindu_cosmology</a>')
