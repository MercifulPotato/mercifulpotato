Well below the expected ~2.5% of the population currently expected to be infected, and well within a range which makes it likely that a significant proportion are false positives. All of these people will have been legally required to isolate for two weeks, many likely unable to work.<p>The problem with mass testing is that the false positive rate is far closer to the actual incidence.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk-england-merseyside-54966607" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk-england-merseyside-54966607</a>')
