This is not what I am looking for.<p>Every now and then, I read answers from Ex-Google Engineers on questions like &quot;How is it like to be out of Google? What do you miss in the industry?&quot;. Often they say &quot;the quality of source code&quot;.<p>I am curious: What is that special to the source code inside Google? What makes them &quot;high quality&quot;?\nIs it a well-commented code base? That people with less context get a grasp of what the piece of code is doing? Is it a strict following of company-wide coding guidelines? Is it the tooling around that supports the maintenance of the quality?<p>I am curious to hear answers from people who have experienced the code inside Google. And maybe have concrete examples?<p>Thanks all.')
