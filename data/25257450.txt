Just like the D register has to be dealt with on a 6809.<p>My own personal way to resolve this has always been to determine whether or not a given register specification, that can be addressed somehow, brings new information not contain in any other register specification, to the table.<p>Fact is, CPU designers do all kinds of crazy things with registers. They overlap, they may be indirect, like not directly addressable, but still there as consideration for the programmer.<p>Think about something like the REP instruction found on some CPUs. There&#x27;s a little circuit it keeps track of account, and some rules, and account may be a register that may or may not be directly addressable any other way.<p>My general take on this article is, &quot;wow, that&#x27;s a lot of registers!&quot;<p>We can all quibble about what the quantity of a lot is, and it&#x27;s all good fun, and I don&#x27;t think it means anything really.')
