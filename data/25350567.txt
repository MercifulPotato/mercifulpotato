While debugging may require self-direction and creativity, it can hardly need more than that needed to come up with a working program, starting from nothing more than a goal.<p>The more interesting question is how is it possible to teach someone programming (or digital circuit design) <i>without</i> instilling an ability to debug? If classes are churning out programmers who cannot debug, can their graduates really be called programmers?')
