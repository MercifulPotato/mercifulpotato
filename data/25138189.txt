Video out on USB-C is not limited to 1080p, cameras are not using MIPI CSI but parallel interface, not sure how to interpret meaning of 4 channels in the codec (it&#x27;s a stereo codec, so mostof the paths have 2 channels, L&#x2F;R and number of inputs&#x2F;outputs is way larger - in the range of 20 or so), also it&#x27;s not limited to 48kHz, but to to 192kHz.')
