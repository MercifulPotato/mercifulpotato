Citizens of a democracy and state of law will, of course, trust an official letter from a public government body and believe what it says. What’s the big surprise here? “If we send a letter with fake info but make it look like it was sent by the provincial wildlife dept, people will believe what it says. Hahaha what a bunch of idiots these citizens”<p>Especially that the wildlife department has so little incentive to lie when you think about it: what are they selling? I would have trusted that the letter contains true information myself without really questioning it.<p>It’s concerning this happened at all, but I don’t see the value of this “experiment”.')
