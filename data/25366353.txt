Not in the US, unless their lawyers find a nice way to make a prosecutor go e.g. for some fancy computer espionage charges (see Aaron Schwartz for example), but companies in the past had regimes in their bag and made people go to prison or vanish entirely, or perform forced labor for them.<p>Can they seize your assets? Not directly, but try getting sued by the legal department of a mega corp and see what you have left when it&#x27;s all over. The end result is the same.<p>As somebody else pointed out, we already had companies that effectively acted as unelected governments in the past, like the East India Company. They used to execute people.')
