This would not be unheard of, if you&#x27;ve ever bought the expensive milks that come in a glass bottle you will get money if you bring the container back to the store (at least where I live). Also things like kegs and propane containers operate this way.<p>The problem is that this system at scale would require a widely accepted standard of &quot;container&quot;, otherwise people would just accumulate an endless number of different containers for different restaurants so nothing ends up being reused.')
