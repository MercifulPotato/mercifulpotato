But at some point the sims have to change lanes to get into the correct one to turn, unfortunately they wait until the last possible moment to switch, causing huge traffic issues. On top of that the sims still prefer a single lane even if you do the lane mathematics. A 6 lane freeway, splitting to a 2 lane and 4 lane doesn&#x27;t help when the sims still insist on using 1 of those 2 and 4 lanes.')
