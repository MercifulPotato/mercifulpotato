It&#x27;s just a GitHub repo at gocardless&#x2F;logging that has an exhaustive list of logging keys, with an explanation of what they should contain.<p>This has the benefit of encouraging consistent logging practices over many teams, as well as improving the chance your logs will get indexed correctly. If the field type doesn&#x27;t match, we won&#x27;t index that field but it will appear in the _log field, where you can do a full text search as a fallback if you really needed to find your log.<p>It&#x27;s not perfect though, and I still hate the dynamic type assignment.')
