I was considering a Nest security system a few years ago, and wasn&#x27;t sure whether it was a plus or a minus that they&#x27;re part of Google. I guess now it&#x27;s shown to be a minus. It&#x27;s nice that they&#x27;re offering support, but buying Nest Secure means you&#x27;re buying into the ecosystem and this is a big proclamation that the ecosystem is not growing.')
