It&#x27;s a statement about the asymptotic growth of a function which you <i>can</i> apply to a worst case.<p>You&#x27;d be better off using &quot;the worst case grows as at most&quot;. The distinction is important as you are ignoring two crucial things: the non-asymptotic behaviour and the coefficient of the asymptotic behaviour.')
