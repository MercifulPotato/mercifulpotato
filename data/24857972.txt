Item(by='2ion', descendants=None, kids=[24858150], score=None, time=1603374644, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24857446, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t like Windows, but its UI is not that bad, come on.<p>I don&#x27;t know. I am very OK with Win7 but I tried installing Win10 the other week on a VM in the intent to let it superseed my Linux on the desktop.<p>The 125% scaling of UI made fonts blurry on my monitor and text inconsistently sized. The &quot;dark&quot; theme lets core apps like Explorer flicker in white then turn dark, like slow Android apps. There are mini ad programs in the start menu. I don&#x27;t even know where you&#x27;re supposed to configure settings anymore without search; the control panel vs fancy settings apps vs msc snapins (which are the only parts that still work reliably)?<p>Their UI is worse than KDE or GNOME now. I had 3rd party applications working perfectly fine which I guess is the point but Windows10 UI is no marvel.<p>This is a problem because Win7 used to just work, discretely.<p>What&#x27;s left is for me to experiment with group policy settings and suchlike (at least my edition permits it) in the hopes of getting my issues fixed. Probably have to throw in a ton of third-party &quot;Windows 10 fix&quot; powershell libraries to clean things up.<p>I got the Win10 Enterprise license through my company. I would never pay money for this OS, privately.')
