The actual application of strategic bombing has <i>consistently</i> failed to live up to those expectations, with the atomic bombings of Japan being the only example people give of countries capitulating due to strategic bombing, and even then it&#x27;s still debatable what factors induced it to surrender.<p>It should also be pointed out that people saying great power wars will be swift and decisive is usually followed by a great power war that is exactly the opposite of swift and decisive.')
