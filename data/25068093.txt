I started using it because of the ability to upload my existing collection. Any song that matches their catalog used their catalog instead. The problem was that when the song in their catalog was removed due to licensing reasons, I&#x27;d lose the song too. It would be gone from any playlists too. And Google won&#x27;t notify about these removals (because of course that would make them look bad, it&#x27;s better if the user just doesn&#x27;t notice).<p>I&#x27;m not buying into any Google-managed service.
