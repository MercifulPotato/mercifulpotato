It&#x27;s not usually a problem because people will teach you how to avoid most of it on any introductory text (usually, it&#x27;s not hard), but if no care is taken, it will happen.<p>To go into another timeless paradigm, logical programming is famous for unexpected exponential execution times. It&#x27;s rare that those get past tests, but it&#x27;s something that developers are constantly having to fix (this or ensuring the type system detects determinism). SQL has a much milder version or this with underspecified joins.<p>Getting ride of time makes a lot of things easier, but is not trouble-free.')
