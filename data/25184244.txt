Without that, it&#x27;s tough to commit to a flat price for browsing before I enter.\n2) I can&#x27;t see how this happens one store at a time.  As long as there are traditional retail locations nearby, ones that let customers browse for free, customers will gravitate there.  Can this business model succeed only once traditional brick and mortar retail has disappeared?')
