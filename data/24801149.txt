Item(by='yorwba', descendants=None, kids=[24801212], score=None, time=1602858791, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24800798, text='&gt; have users manually upload midi with a proper score attached to some store or community repo with user reviews. It&#x27;s less satisfying as a solution, but it means all it takes is one motivated user for everyone to enjoy the score.<p>Musescore already has such a collection of sheet music <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;musescore.com&#x2F;hub&#x2F;piano" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;musescore.com&#x2F;hub&#x2F;piano</a> so it&#x27;d also be possible to allow users to import from there, going from sheet music to midi instead of trying to reverse the process.')
