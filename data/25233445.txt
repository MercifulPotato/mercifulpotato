Item(by='mettamage', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606519041, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25229291, text='&gt; it is guaranteed that they will not do good work if they do not give a shit.<p>While I do see amazing merit in that statement, from an experiential and rational standpoint I disagree with it. Though, believing this won&#x27;t harm the company too much as it is a very action-oriented statement and leads to a bias of action. That doesn&#x27;t make it true though.<p>I&#x27;ve seen plenty of people doing good work when they don&#x27;t give a shit. It&#x27;s more rare than doing bad work, which is more common.<p>Really, the <i>only</i> thing I haven&#x27;t seen is that people become so desperate or passionate (or both) that they become very lateral&#x2F;creative in their solutions. That&#x27;s the only thing I haven&#x27;t seen &quot;not giving a shit&quot; people do. I&#x27;ve seen this time and time again. And it&#x27;s quite simple why: people that don&#x27;t give a shit don&#x27;t become desperate or passionate about the things they don&#x27;t give a shit about. So they never go into that lateral&#x2F;creative mode. Perhaps the only exception is highly lateral&#x2F;creative people that do it by default.<p>The thing is, creative&#x2F;lateral problem-solving is not always needed and sometimes even counter productive. At my current job, I&#x27;ve noticed that me giving a shit is actually putting me into harms way, because I become creative and want to meddle with too many things. Whereas, when I shut up and not give a shit, do what I told and think a bit with them for the future, that seems to work a lot better for them.<p>Obviously, that&#x27;s just anecdata and companies are diverse. But the author mentions this like it is a rule and as a rule (heh!) the majority of things are most likely never to exist as a rule! You make a general sweeping statement, it takes one counter example to shaken it.')
