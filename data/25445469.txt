Wouldn&#x27;t it be enough to have 30% marketshare again? Or even 10% would be enough to consider Firefox a serious competitor.<p>Somewhere along the line we got this idea that if you&#x27;re not #1 you&#x27;ve failed. You don&#x27;t need to crush every single competitor into oblivion to be successful, you just need to succeed at what you set out to do, and in Firefox&#x27;s case, isn&#x27;t that just to build a good browser?<p>The only way to beat Chrome, is the same way Firefox beat IE: Someone else will have to do it.')
