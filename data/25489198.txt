(Other factors as well). But that still requires people to mix about with each other. Things like eating in fully enclosed &quot;outdoor&quot; tents instead of true outdoor settings, family get togethers like Thanksgiving, etc. If people weren&#x27;t going out &amp; seeing each other, the virus wouldn&#x27;t just appear in closed social networks.<p>You&#x27;re also ignoring the Summer spike that occured as precautions were relaxed, at the same time that it gradually began making its way off of the coasts and into land-locked states, especially those that were generally skeptical of taking precautions to begin with, so decreases &amp; spikes are not solely attributable to seasonal factors.')
