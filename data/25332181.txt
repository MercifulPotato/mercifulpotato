Sure, the Bloomberg audience are not computer geeks, but still.<p><i>&quot;If they live up to expectations, they will significantly outpace the performance of the latest machines running Intel chips, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the plans arenâ€™t yet public.&quot;</i><p>It&#x27;s not entirely obvious that &quot;the latest machines running Intel chips&quot; here probably refers only to the latest <i>Macs</i> running Intel chips. We already know that the M1&#x2F;Firestorm beats Intel handily in single thread, so this just means they&#x27;ll use enough cores to beat the 28 core Xeon-W in their current Mac Pro. This is of course completely uninteresting, since 1) they&#x27;ve long announced they&#x27;ll be Intel-free by 2022 and 2) they&#x27;re not going to release new Macs any <i>slower</i> than the current Intels.<p>Going by Geekbench they need probably a 16 to 20 Firestorm CPU to beat the current Xeon W-3275M Mac Pro. A 32 Firestorm CPU would completely obliterate it. To make a statement, they&#x27;ll probably do just that.<p>The more interesting question to me is if they&#x27;re going to go for the absolute performance crown, currently the AMD EPYC 7H12, a 64 core Zen2 CPU which benches around 60k in Geekbench5 (vs 19k for the 28-core Mac Pro). By mid-2021, that that will be probably a 64 core Zen3 EPYC at around 72k \n(+20% IPC vs Zen2). Apple can probably match that with a 48 Firestorm CPU. A 32 core CPU won&#x27;t do it, even with a generous IPC increase next year.')
