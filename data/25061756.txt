Don&#x27;t have all the answers.  :-)<p>The appealing part for me was not reinventing the wheel for each application.  Auth is hard to do well.  Here&#x27;s what I do know (to save you a search or two):\n- You definitely still want an application-level DB for you to have app-level features like showing friends&#x2F;leaderboards&#x2F;forum user names, etc.  \n- Any decent auth system lets you skin the login forms however you want.<p>My guess about local dev is you skip the auth entirely and just force-feed the decoded JWT into the application.  You can setup oauth2 using a hosts file to work properly, but it&#x27;s a lot of work just to get to the decoded JWT to feed your app.  YMMV.<p>Glad you found it interesting!')
