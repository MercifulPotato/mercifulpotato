As soon as it became acceptable it would be adopted swiftly in many domains.<p>Until then, fully encrypted memory will help prevent a lot of future attacks like Spectre, Meltdown, Heartbleed, and ShellShock. Intel and AMD both seem dedicated to implementing this.<p>ECC memory would need to become universal to prevent RowHammer style vulnerabilities. Would love to see that take off, and included as a mandatory part of a future DDR6.
