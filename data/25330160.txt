Sure, CA is blue on a national map in national elections but it’s a very reddish purple for any smaller statewide analysis.<p>So I&#x27;ll cheerfully admit a near total ignorance about Californian politics, but I see a 29:11 and 61:18 Democrat majority in what looks like the state parliament [0]. The wiki link also mentions &quot;The Democratic Party currently holds veto-proof supermajorities in both houses of the California State Legislature.&quot;. I didn&#x27;t actually think it was possible to see such majorities in an large, healthy, wealthy democracy, but obviously I&#x27;ve reassessed that now.<p>Intransigent minorities can do a lot, but it seems like it would be a real challenge to push back past against that sort of majority. California is going to be a pretty fair representation of what would happen if the Democrats gained a 60% across board majority in US federal politics.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;California_State_Legislature" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;California_State_Legislature</a>')
