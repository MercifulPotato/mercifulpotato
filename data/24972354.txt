They offer an EBS equivalent.<p>But if you need to persist transactions you still need to replicate and persist state yourself. Or can I mount an OVH virtual drive that I know will survive across VM migrations?<p>&gt; I&#x27;ll grant that the US regions are operated by a different corporate entity and a different web interface, and that is annoying.<p>Why? Do they at least support the same API? Can OVH actually scale on demand?')
