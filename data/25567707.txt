The other thing to remember is that we have a poor understanding of how it spreads. I don&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s airborne, but that there isn&#x27;t much evidence to suggest vaccinating the elderly and first responders is the best way to stop the spread. It&#x27;s not an unreasonable choice, but there&#x27;s a lot we failed to understand going into the winter.')
