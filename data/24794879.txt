What would people do then?<p>Equal time laws don&#x27;t apply to twitter any more than they do to your blog. There is nothing stopping them from acts of outright censorship for any purpose they choose.<p>The nature of social networks is that some platforms will have more users and exponentially more value than others, so it seems like there isn&#x27;t choice in the market. We as a society have to decide if &quot;having the most users&quot; is equivalent to the physical infrastructure connections that currently designate utilities and monopolies.<p>Having to tolerate political censorship is an obvious tradeoff. But if we go full Section 230, we could wind up with a situation where US companies are hobbled and replaced by foreign competitors. Or where American companies stop improving their service because they enjoy the advantages of a utility&#x2F;monopoly.<p>It&#x27;s actually a new and difficult social question that requires a lot of thought. I think I know what side I&#x27;m on.')
