Something with supper nodes for those of us who want faster and more complex queries. html, with some minor upgrades, again seems good enough.<p>DRM is a silly idea, we should forget about it. Just write free works until the audience is impressed enough to donate to current effort.<p>And finally some simple to use aggregation formula so that authors can learn what we want to read about.<p>No more middle men.')
