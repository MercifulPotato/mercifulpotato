Every ontology gets a free miracle, you can&#x27;t reduce everything in terms of something else, either you&#x27;ll never stop or you&#x27;ll get into circular reasoning. You get to choose your ontological primitive. A &quot;particle&quot; or &quot;consciousness&quot; do not have different woo-factor. But by choosing consciousness as a primitive you can explain much more of what we observe in nature (and as a nice side effect, there might be positive existential implications with such a worldview).')
