I believe in all of that. But my own reality is this: I seem to have a very high activation threshold around most of things. For some, this means I&#x27;m unable to maintain steady, casual pace. By the time I work up enough energy to move past the potential barrier, the scheduled time is up and I should go do something else. In these cases, I naturally fall back to the pattern of working up the energy and then going non-stop. It tends to make the activation barrier even higher, but over time it seems to integrate to more actual progress.<p>(On that note, being a husband and a father, forcing me to keep a semblance of regular schedule, made this difficult for me.)<p>&gt; <i>The only exception to this might be short little events, like sure if you have an exam, a bit of stress and a last all out effort can help. If you&#x27;re competing in some athletic event similarly. But for most other life goals, I&#x27;m not so sure.</i><p>I wish I knew how to reach that state, instead of having this natural tendency of turning things into &quot;short little events&quot;.')
