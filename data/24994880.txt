(Nor for that matter, would my faith be falsifiable; that is, I wouldn&#x27;t cease to be a creationist if later research showed that there was in fact no such hardwired capability.) But I do think it&#x27;s a good thing for unbelievers to ponder. Even more so: Why is there anything at all?<p>Thank you for your kind response.')
