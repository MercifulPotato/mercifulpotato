Item(by='raphlinus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607834352, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25403497, text='I&#x27;ve put some thought into this question, and there&#x27;s some flexibility - it&#x27;s possible to take the basic ideas and put more work into compatibility to work on even more hardware, but that&#x27;s a cost&#x2F;tradeoff curve, and affects overall system complexity and especially the difficulty of extending the imaging model.<p>My current target is a GPU that can do compute shaders, and also has descriptor indexing. That includes DX12, Metal 2.0, and most desktop Vulkan. It leaves out DX11 and OpenGL. Mobile is complicated; I don&#x27;t expect it to work on most legacy Android devices.<p>The need for descriptor indexing can be worked around, which I think in practice brings Android with Vulkan back in the fold, and it&#x27;s possible DX11.<p>It&#x27;s more a function of API and driver than actual hardware, except for very old and low-spec stuff. I suspect that Raspberry Pi up to 3 is off the table without massive work, but that Vulkan drivers on the 4 will catch up. (I have a Raspberri Pi 4 and intend to use it as a compatibility target, along with a Pine64)<p>I hope that clarifies the situation. GPU compute was not mainstream at all (aside from CUDA, which has been around a while) and until quite recently, targeting it would seriously limit an app. I do think that&#x27;s changing, even on inexpensive hardware.')
