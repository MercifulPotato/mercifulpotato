Even a lot of modern, triple-A games have weird HUD layouts on ultrawide monitors because they have to be re-hard-coded for that aspect ratio. So if they haven&#x27;t, you just get the layout they&#x27;re hardcoded to for widescreen monitors.<p>Have you ever seen any UI on the web that approaches the complexity of game UIs? I haven&#x27;t [1]. Anywhere there&#x27;s such complexity on the web, you get lots and lots of hardcoded values: from hardcoded media breakpoints to entirely different layouts for different resolutions and screen sizes.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t have time to read more than the first part of your reply right now; maybe I will later.<p>Now worries, I got carried away a bit. As Stephen King calls it, &quot;diarrhoea of the word processor&quot; :)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;dmitriid&#x2F;status&#x2F;1309777901483634689" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;dmitriid&#x2F;status&#x2F;1309777901483634689</a>')
