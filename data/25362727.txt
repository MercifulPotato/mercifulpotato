That question is &quot;If you have a tool that can influence millions any way you choose to influence them, what role should the state play in regulating that tool?&quot;<p>With things like, say, nuclear weapons. It seems really easy to say &quot;I don&#x27;t want just anyone in the country to be able to go out and buy a nuclear weapon and possibly put their entire city at risk of annihilation if they decide to set it off!&quot; And in many conversations we get to that perspective because the &quot;innocent&quot; bystanders who would be killed by this act have no way to realistically protect themselves from that threat. Thus we accept that the state, which has community support to protect the community, is given the right to say who can and who cannot &quot;own&quot; a nuclear weapon. It isn&#x27;t even all that controversial in the <i>general</i> public even though there will always be people who take the position that the 2nd amendment &quot;right to bear arms&quot; does not exclude any &quot;arms&quot; it&#x27;s a blanket right. And yet for <i>most</i> people, keeping nuclear weapons out of the hands of just any individual seems a reasonable limitation.<p>But what about media? We have seen first hand the destructive effects of coordinated campaigns of disinformation. In the hands of a skilled operator, millions of individuals can be manipulated into actions that they would not have contemplated. Whether it is for giving power to criminals, or killing themselves and their children by drinking cyanide laced Kool-aid.<p>When it becomes possible for a small group to do great harm to a much larger &quot;innocent&quot; group, what is the right action to take? What consensus does the community come to which supports governance for everyone versus rights for the individual?<p>I believe it to be a much more complex question than simply &quot;censorship&quot; &#x2F; &quot;no censorship&quot; and letting individuals protect themselves from these sorts of operators. Just as I believe it is unreasonable for individuals to be held responsible for protecting themselves from one of their neighbors possibly setting off a nuclear weapon, or spraying them with a machine gun.<p>From what I have read, in the US the sense of &quot;justice&quot; is tied to the perpetrators of an act of harm being suitably punished for that act. And I certainly feel harmed by the egregious disinformation that has made my relationship with my parents much more difficult. But how do I get justice for that harm? I really don&#x27;t have a good sense of the right and just answer here.')
