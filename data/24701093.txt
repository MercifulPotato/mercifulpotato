You&#x27;re effectively appealing to nationalism and&#x2F;or racism - we can&#x27;t let &#x27;those people&#x27; beat us. It&#x27;s ugly, and if you have to stoop to that, is it really worth winning? It&#x27;s no good living forever if you can&#x27;t live with yourself.<p>I don’t think anyone’s complaining about the price due to nationalism or racism... they just want to be able to afford insulin to keep themselves alive like they’d be able to in other countries.')
