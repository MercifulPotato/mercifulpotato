Certainly using Typescript judiciously is good. My fear is of the Frankenstein, which fundamentally slows down the flexibility and speed of frontend development (which is paramount, since the UI you build today looks dated and old within 6 months).<p>Type checking has existed for quite some time. Those languages and developers have created some of the most static UIs you can think of. Those desktop apps got stuck, they don’t innovate or adapt. I think it has partly to do with how rigid and sedimented their tools and languages got.<p>I deal with it every day. We look at a Java enterprise app built, and go, yeah this has to be refreshed. That language has type checking. What are we replicating here? We throw that stuff away like it’s a joke, so I wonder if we aren’t wasting our time with some of this stuff.<p>Type checking defies the utter success of Python, Ruby, PHP and JavaScript in building the entire modern web. We moved quickly and accurately due to these languages (it’s not a coincidence that they are all interpreted). I don’t want us to forget that. If you guys want to add something that helps, sure, but if you guys want to add stuff that adds little value\nthat slows stuff down, it will prove out the same way it happened before. We’re just going to throw it away when the seasons change.')
