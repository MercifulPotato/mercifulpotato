Banking is not a free market. So can we put this nonsense\nto sleep already? And since you don&#x27;t seem to be too interested in the free market\nargument anyway, let me respond to the rest of your comment, including the other one.<p>I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re aware of it, but your falling empire, the almighty America, is not\nthe only country in the world. The censorship tactics that are deployed right now on the\nhalf of the population of the country that famously has the most free speech in the world,\nwill be used against the people in other countries too. The willingness of the\ncorporations to work with authoritarian governments, the obvious example being China, is\nnot exactly a secret. These people hold no moral convictions, they use slave labor for\nGod&#x27;s sake, just so you can mindlessly consume more useless crap like a new iPhone every\nyear or God knows how many pairs of Nike shoes, as they pander to you with rainbow flags\nand raised fists.<p>People who are in the front lines against such governments, some of whom you might show\n&quot;support&quot; to regularly on your favourite social media website, are also being persecuted\nfor the same reasons - calls for violence and terrorism. The people from my country were\nhailed as heroes after the WWII by the Western world. But today, in some places in the\nworld, people who are doing the same thing and fighting for the same causes that we\ndid are labeled as terrorists. People might belive one thing today and the complete\nopposite tomorrow. Which is whatever suits the people at the media industry and their\nemployers at the time.<p>And the bottomline is that you yourself might find yourself on the receiving end of the\nthings you think are so great in the near future. The following weeks are not about the\nleft vs the right. Or antiterrorism vs terrorism. Or morality vs lack thereof. Or however\nyou want to frame it to feel good about yourself. It&#x27;s about escalation or de-escalation.\nThe right completely lost and the left had the upperhand. But for some reason, either\nstupidity or on purpose, they&#x27;ve chose to go about it in the worst possible way. Get\npetty, overblow the Capitol shitshow and seek revenge on the right. You might not even\nagree with that framing, but this is how the right perceives it. And that means\nescalation. Nothing might happen because of it or everything might happen. But the point\nis that you&#x27;ve turned the victory of the left into an uncertain future, that no one knows\nwhat holds.<p>Sorry for getting carried away, I know this is not a place for my bullshit, but this is\nbasically the only place where I can voice my meaningless opinions that no one cares about.')
