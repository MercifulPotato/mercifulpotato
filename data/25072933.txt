Pipenv advertised itself as solving all problems, but once someone tries it in practice, they realize that it introduces a new problem: every little interaction takes literally 30 minutes for any non-toy project. I’ve heard mixed things about poetry, but I wouldn’t be surprised in the least of it failed to behave as advertised just because this has been my experience with every package manager I’ve tried to use. And it’s embarrassing when every other language has a package manager that <i>just works</i>.<p>EDIT: It was probably misleading to characterize Pipenv as advertising itself as solving all problems; it’s probably more correct to say that it’s significant weaknesses weren’t advertised and thus one has to invest considerably before discovering them for oneself.')
