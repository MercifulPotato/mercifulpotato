A lot of things may seem &quot;obvious&quot; but depending who&#x27;s at the helm, other stuff gets prioritized.<p>I remember, way back when, in college, when I would try to listen to music while my machine was torrenting a movie on the same HDD, the playback of the song would get totally borked because the queuing scheme of the linux I&#x2F;O scheduler at that time could not cope with this(it was tuned for server operations) even though both Windows and MacOS could handle this scenario without a sweat since like forever.<p>IIRC BFQ scheduler finally addressed this later but I&#x27;m not 100% sure on this info.')
