I often have to help out cli-power users that have hopelessly destroyed their branch and do the equivalent of 12 operations with a few clicks and drag and drops. My job isn&#x27;t to play with &#x2F; debug git issues, it&#x27;s to deliver customer value.<p>I use cli for pretty much everything else. I don&#x27;t get the fetishization of the cli, it&#x27;s just another interface. For source control operations are much easier to grok as visual operations and I advise all new developers to start with a client like gitkraken and delve into the cli if they really need it (in most cases they don&#x27;t).')
