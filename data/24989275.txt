I am not sure if it is just consumer behaviour differences or energy source differences and I am sure there will be multiple factors depending on the country and regions but these outlier countries are effectively emitting anywhere between 50% to 300% more emissions than any other population on Earth.<p>The main issue here is population size:<p>Luxembourg : 600k<p>Qatar: 2.897M<p>Saudi Arabia: 34.997M<p>Canada: 37.885M<p>US: 331.669M<p>If you stop thinking per capita and actually take into account total population, you quickly realize that all other nations on Earth are dependent on US market carbon correction in order to avoid environmental collapse. Far more than any other foreign policy ineptitude from the current adminsistration it&#x27;s the environmental inaction and downright resistance of US lobby driven policy that scares everyone else around the world.<p>We are still on track for an inevitable major environmental collapse but it could still be vastly mitigated, <i>if</i> US politicians and citizens would get with the program.')
