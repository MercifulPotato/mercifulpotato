It&#x27;s been done before for other cloud-y respond-y things (we did it on Project riff, Google have done it for Cloud Run), so I am aware it&#x27;s possible. The nice part is that you won&#x27;t need to build all the buildpacks yourself -- just the small set that adds your specialisations.<p>Feel free to email me.')
