For example, netfilter allows you to filter packets based on the user, group, or pid of the process.<p>I found this page [2] quite helpful, and especially the packet flow diagram contained within it.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linux.com&#x2F;training-tutorials&#x2F;using-selinux-and-iptables-together&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linux.com&#x2F;training-tutorials&#x2F;using-selinux-and-i...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.booleanworld.com&#x2F;depth-guide-iptables-linux-firewall&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.booleanworld.com&#x2F;depth-guide-iptables-linux-fire...</a>')
