In the US we used to have this at the town, state and federal level. And these “governments” wouldn’t just work with one company, but a many companies.<p>The way they worked is people would vote for representatives that help make decisions that were in the interests of people, and this would reign in the power of extremely large and powerful companies.<p>In some parts of Europe they still have these.<p>Unfortunately in the US companies were foolishly permitted to both purchase the voting power of representatives and directly influence the will of the people to render the government virtually useless (though still a useful distraction for the people)')
