The only soul who was there with Voldemort when the locket was planted, happens also to be magically bound to Harry and have obligation to obey Harry&#x27;s every command.<p>Need to impersonate someone? Just pick a hair off your cloak for the potion.<p>Don&#x27;t know where the next horcrux is? Immediate vision from Voldemort&#x27;s mind to help you.<p>A character who has crucial information is killed? Well no, instead of using a spell like any other time, Voldemort decides to leave Snape to slowly die giving him just enough time to share his memories with Harry.<p>Need to check if your mortal enemy is really dead? Don&#x27;t verify yourself but send the only person in the group who has any incentive to lie to you about it. (And you&#x27;re supposed to be able to magically tell when people are lying by the way).<p>The way to destroy a horcrux is hidden in a place accessible only to those who speak parseltongue? Nope, Ron can just guess his way into an ability that was previously established to be hereditary or transfered through magic.<p>I could go on... the point isn&#x27;t any single one of these, it&#x27;s more about how they accumulate throughout the book.')
