This inherently gives the show some latitude.<p>But, say, <i>Three&#x27;s Company</i> was based on the premise that this guy was pretending to be gay in order to justify living with two women because they all were pretty poor and he couldn&#x27;t find another place. That&#x27;s pretty constraining as to what you can do with the plot line.<p>It means that any episode that was at the beginning holding out hope that one of the characters would suddenly start making more money and be able to afford to move or something was an episode where the viewer could confidently predict that this would fall through because if it didn&#x27;t you no longer had a show with the premise that some guy needs to pretend he&#x27;s gay in order to have an affordable housing situation where he lives platonically with two women.<p>What&#x27;s funny there is the tension of, no, they aren&#x27;t having a threesome. No, he&#x27;s not sleeping with either of the women. No, he&#x27;s not really gay, but most people would never believe he&#x27;s honest to god just living with two women to split the rent if he weren&#x27;t pretending to be gay.<p>It&#x27;s funny because it casts some light on a lot of serious social issues in a way that&#x27;s socially acceptable to poke fun at, but it&#x27;s extremely contrived and you can&#x27;t otherwise try to address those kinds of topics. They are too hot button.<p>So you can&#x27;t do it humorously without an extremely contrived situation and you can&#x27;t do it in earnest without it being terrible drama.<p>Humor is one of the ways society processes hot button topics and works through them without it turning into terrible real life conflict.')
