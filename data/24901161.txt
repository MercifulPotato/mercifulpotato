Item(by='mattgreenrocks', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603745041, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24900808, text='&gt; I find that when I ask about whether finding such a role is realistic in chat rooms or forums about devops work the responses range from confused to derisive.<p>That&#x27;s interesting. Conflicts of values like those can be deep and hard to reconcile. It becomes a sort of paper cut you can&#x27;t quite get away from, because everyone&#x27;s too invested in perpetuating the status quo.<p>I have to imagine there are companies that care about that, however. (There have to be those that aren&#x27;t magnets for the hyper-competitive, too.)<p>&gt; Did you find the crowd that resonated with your sentiments through contributions to open source?<p>A bit. I had a nice side quest through OSS, where I learned a lot about shipping, customers (e.g. users), and using it as a way to try out other domains&#x2F;technologies. Ultimately, it was more something to help me pivot than a place to stay, mostly because I need to make money. But I am grateful for those that build those communities.')
