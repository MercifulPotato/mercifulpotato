There is good military history that is widely respected by the community. The problem is that there are a lot of very old academics who refuse to acknowledge new ideas and methods, leading to a lot of continued publication of bad work.<p>It isn&#x27;t military historians being free from conventions that trap other historians. The available analysis methods of modern history are very wide and there isn&#x27;t a trend trapping the field. If anybody is stubborn and stuck in conventions, it is the aging group of military historians who refuse to integrate new ideas.')
