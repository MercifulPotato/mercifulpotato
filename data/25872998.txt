I think we are just stupid and crazy.<p>Biodegradable plastic has been a thing for over half a century yet the\nwhole planet is choking on discarded plastic.  Where&#x27;s the sane reason for that?<p>Cars!<p>Cars aren&#x27;t sane, we had to convince ourselves that they were though a\ndeliberate campaign of domestic propaganda![1]   Cars kill hella people\n(I don&#x27;t have stats for the rest of the world but more Americans have\nbeen killed by cars than have died in all the wars we&#x27;ve fought!)  And\nthat&#x27;s just the people that get hit.  There&#x27;s air pollution (car exhaust is\na deadly poison) and tires are constantly wearing down and giving off\nvulcanized rubber particles.  I won&#x27;t deny their convenience, but you&#x27;ll\nnever convince we they&#x27;re <i>sane</i>.<p>Or my old pet peeve: refrigerators.  They open like cabinets instead of\nlike drawers.  The cold air goes out, the warm air goes in, and you get\nto pay for the energy to cool it off.  Why not make them like a chest of\ndrawers?<p>Sanity?  I think not.<p>[1] &quot;The Real Reason Jaywalking Is A Crime&quot; (Adam Ruins Everything)\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vxopfjXkArM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vxopfjXkArM</a>)<p>Replying here to the other fella:<p>&gt; The vaneless ion generator is &gt;5x less efficient.<p>C&#x27;mon, less efficient by what metrics?  Total cost over the lifetime of the structure, including maintenance?  Killing eagles?<p>In re: Molten Salt reactors there&#x27;s a old page[1] about Molten Salt tech in general that talks about reactors towards the end:<p>&gt; The second MSR was a civilian power plant prototype, the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE)7. Hugely successful, it was ignored by the US Atomic Energy Commission (US AEC), which had decided to favor the Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor (LMFBR). The Director of ORNL, Dr. Alvin Weinberg, pushed for the MSR, but was fired for his efforts 8.<p>&gt; 8. Pages 198 - 200, &quot;The First Nuclear Era : The Life and Times of a Technological Fixer&quot;, by Alvin Martin Weinberg (1994).<p>I&#x27;ve read a longer history of Molten Salt reactors that described the events referenced in the above quote.  Evidently both kinds of reactor showed promise early on (MS and LMFB) but for bureaucratic reasons the one was passed over for the other.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20040602210408&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;home.earthlink.net&#x2F;~bhoglund&#x2F;whatsMoltenSal.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20040602210408&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;home.earth...</a>')
