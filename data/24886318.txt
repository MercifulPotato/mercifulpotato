The one I use is fast.<p>&gt; And if you don&#x27;t like the window decorations (say, they take up too much screen space) your choices are suck it up, or if you&#x27;re lucky and willing to spend a bunch of time reconfigure every different toolkit your apps use.<p>No, there are protocols to negotiate whether an app has server side decoration or not and the compositor has the last say.<p>&gt; basic stuff that worked fine on X11 doesn&#x27;t work on wayland in the name of &quot;security&quot;<p>On only the core Wayland protocols you&#x27;re absolutely correct, you can&#x27;t even implement desktop shells with those. This means there must be extensions and there are 3 different classes: KDE, GNOME, wlroots, with tools for and incompatibility between each. The wlroots extensions are designed to be accepted into the standard and for wider Wayland acceptance they probably should be.<p>Screen sharing is still a particular issue that we are starting to see solved with the advent of Pipewire.<p>Wayland desktops are definitely usable. I&#x27;ve been happy with a wlroots based one (Wayfire) for a few months and KDE before that (from what I see GNOME has been perfect for a while).<p>One of the last standing real issues I&#x27;m facing is kerfuffle with Nvidia drivers, especially the ones paired with Intel GPUs, but I think (surprisingly) Nvidia are actually working on fixing that.')
