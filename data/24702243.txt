They correspond to JavaScript events and are sometimes the only way to click a button.<p>If you want Vimium-style behaviour where these elements are not hinted you can just do `:bind f hint -J`.<p>We also have a Vimium-style theme which you can access with `:colours shydactyl`. The theme could do with some polishing if anyone&#x27;s interested.')
