My bad that I didn&#x27;t thoroughly read the related work section (which does mention KidSim). I think I was also misled because the &quot;when&quot; section of the rule is based on the pattern, but its &quot;do&quot; section is <i>not</i> the output pattern but the instruction list for each actor matched in the pattern. In the other words it can potentially do much more than pattern rewriting (note that PuzzleScript also extends on this, so it is evident that this mechanism has a strong limitation).')
