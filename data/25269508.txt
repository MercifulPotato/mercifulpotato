(Kudos, too, to several commenters here, particularly @afton wrt domain expertise. This is so easy to mess up, especially buying for kids&#x2F;teens.)<p>But - tangential, I realise - what about asking <i>why</i> we buy Christmas (or holiday) gifts, and especially with a scattergun approach: buy for everyone you know (family, friends, colleagues - driven in some cases by fear that they might have got you something but you haven&#x27;t got them anything - it gets ridiculous), just because, er, xmas? (Comment here about power and gifts by @blueyes gave me pause for uneasy thought - genuine thanks for that.)<p>I spent quite a few years in places where Christmas wasn&#x27;t a thing. In a couple of places, Eid was the big celebration, and the emphasis seemed to me to be on hospitality, a lot of food, loads of get-togethers, but not so much on presents. I sort of miss that - and miss the emphasis on charity in the run-up to Eid during Ramadan.<p>Perhaps we have lost something. I&#x27;m a fan of the poet Louis MacNeice. Here&#x27;s an amateur animation to illustrate his section of Autumn Journal which starts, &quot; A week to Christmas&quot;[1], which I voiced quite a few years ago.
