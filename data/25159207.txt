Every other serif monospace I know of is a slab serif. Triplicate’s variable stroke thickness is also exceedingly rare in monospaced fonts; almost everyone goes for uniform stroke thickness, as is customary with sans-serif fonts but anathema for true serif fonts (though slab serifs could be either). Variable stroke thickness can be a bit iffy on low-resolution displays, but so long as you keep the size up or use a high-resolution display, I find it very pleasant. I’ve been using Triplicate everywhere for the last few years, including on my website.<p>(Also note on that page, since people are talking about ligatures a lot in this thread: “No, there are no programming ligatures in Triplicate, and there never will be.” with a link to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;practicaltypography.com&#x2F;ligatures-in-programming-fonts-hell-no.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;practicaltypography.com&#x2F;ligatures-in-programming-fon...</a>, which can be distilled to the quote “ligatures in programming fonts are a terrible idea”. I agree.)<p>Pragmata Pro and Operator are two other well-regarded and popular commercial monospaced fonts that are missing from this list.')
