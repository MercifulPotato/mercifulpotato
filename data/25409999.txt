One is for serving up the UI you see when you&#x27;re debugging (I think there&#x27;s one instance of this container per debugging session, but don&#x27;t quote me on that), and the other ingests rr recordings into the database. A presentation they gave a while back stated that for the cloud version they send all recordings to 36-core AWS instances with 144 GB of ram, that it often takes as much as an hour to process a single recording, and that it can generate a 100GB database. Hopefully most recordings are simpler and quicker than that, but I don&#x27;t think this is something I&#x27;ll be running on my laptop in the next few years.')
