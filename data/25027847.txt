There are also temporary markets and mobile ones that keep moving from zip code to zip code.<p>To this day, vegetable vendors and flower sellers go door to door with their goods bringing mini shops on vans and bicycles to customers doorstep. So hyperpersonalisation can also work the other way around for small vendors whose only tech is the palm sized smart phone. A version of online ordering.<p>This might seem unnecessary and cumbersome for us who are used to amazon prime and prime now, but the markets in India are hyper localized.')
