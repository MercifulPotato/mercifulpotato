As such the perception of what is extreme right was similarly shifted and what was once considered extreme right is mainstream.  This is similarly to the idea behind the paradox of tolerance.<p>I suggest that if Trump has not lied enough, grifted enough, broken enough laws, or is not incompetent enough to dissuade people from voting for him then the country has gone too far down the path of tribal politics.  Obama was a moderate Republican president by the standards of the 1970s and there are large numbers of Republicans who consider him extreme left.<p>When we shift the center too far to one side of the spectrum then this causes too many people to become unbalanced in their views as they look to the center as their guide.  In my opinion this is what is happening in the United States.')
