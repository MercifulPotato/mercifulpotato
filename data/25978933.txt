[...] You could have marriage and children with or without romantic love. It was an extra some people had the luck to have.<p>I&#x27;d even say that the „mandatory romantic love” might do more harm than good for quite a few people. Women fall in love with abuse&#x2F;violent men and stay together with them because they let their feelings decide. Loverboy ploys. Catfishing and other scams. Losing a fortune in a divorce after a rushed marriage.<p>If falling in love was seen seen as an optional bonus for an already healthy relationship instead of the current „all you need is love”&#x2F; Disney - ideal, a lot of harm would be prevented. After all, it&#x27;s just a biochemical reaction to ensure that genes are passed on. Romeo and Juliet was supposed to be a book about the perils of romantic love, not about idealising it.')
