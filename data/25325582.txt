Item(by='oalae5niMiel7qu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607280514, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25321139, text='Clojure is oriented towards functional programming, hence no loops, but because it&#x27;s also a thin abstraction over the JVM, it doesn&#x27;t provide tail-call elimination, so you can&#x27;t write traditional functional code the way you would in SML or Scheme. Instead, you have to use the clumsy &quot;recur&quot; construct to work around the JVM&#x27;s limitations.<p>It&#x27;s also less consistent than proper Lisps. For example, it&#x27;s possible to produce a Java OverflowException using Clojure math operators. Some operations will gracefully upgrade to bignums, but others don&#x27;t.')
