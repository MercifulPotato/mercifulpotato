I have had to do that, say with certain rarely-used financial situations. Though not banks, who are very accommodating in my experience (even the notoriously evil ones).<p>First class mail is working internationally, by the way, to almost every country. Unless they&#x27;re in Yemen or something perhaps. Keep in mind we were comparing the dangers of corporations to governments. So being in a developing country during a pandemic when there&#x27;s a communications breakdown with the US also presumably means you can&#x27;t access a US consulate either. So you&#x27;d have the exact same difficulty if it was a govt agency you needed to deal with instead of Google&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Microsoft.')
