This effectively turns Privacy Badger for the majority of users into another block list.<p>Fingerprinting vs ad tracking protection has been an ongoing war. The natural escalation to tracking protection is to fingerprint even harder. I&#x27;d expect most power users who like to configure their extensions and blocking lists to be suprised how much information thst provides to differentiate them.

Solutions like Firefox containers requires you to be extremely thoughtful in your site usage and don&#x27;t protect from more advanced fingerprinting techniques (that for example cloudflare employs).
