Two reasonable people can look at the same problem with the same facts, make reasonable guesses on what the best course is, and yet reach two completely different, <i>reasonable</i> approaches to the problem. Otherwise, we would have already decided which programming language is the best one.<p>Some situations are more clear cut than others, and I agree that we need to separate facts from opinion better. But for situations as complex as the present and future of a country there might very well not be a &quot;right&quot; way.<p>&quot;Reality&quot; is not a point of view, but we only experience it through the lens of our personal experiences. No one experiences &quot;true&quot; reality.')
