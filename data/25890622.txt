Item(by='sneak', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611480506, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25890585, text='You seem to be conflating the DMCA,  which regulates copying of copyrighted material, and the CFAA, which criminalizes unauthorized access.<p>I don&#x27;t think there is any case law related to &quot;which client was used&quot; applications of the CFAA.<p>I can&#x27;t really imagine any reasonable circumstance where someone would be authorized with one client and unauthorized with another. It&#x27;s not really a reasonable position; if you offer a free network service on the internet, and anyone is authorized to use it, I don&#x27;t know of any legal basis for gating that authorization on &quot;user of your software&quot;.<p>Perhaps some internet-clueless judge will one day disagree, but that&#x27;s not how the mores and norms of the internet work today.  Signal doesn&#x27;t get to declare me a criminal if I write my own client software to talk to the Signal API servers (or use some other open source software I found), regardless of Moxie&#x27;s squeaking.  Either your service is public and open to everyone, or it isn&#x27;t.')
