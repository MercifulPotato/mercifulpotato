For example, FB&#x27;s Messenger app still doesn&#x27;t have message search, even though the desktop version does. Why?!<p>[Note 1] However, Discord&#x27;s message search seems to be quite finicky when it comes to searching links. For example, if someone posts a link with &quot;www.twitter.com&#x2F;user&quot;, it wouldn&#x27;t show up with a &quot;twitter.com&#x2F;user&quot; search, but it would show up for &quot;twitter.com&quot; or &quot;www.twitter.com&#x2F;user&quot;. Room for improvement.')
