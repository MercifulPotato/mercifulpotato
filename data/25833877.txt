We address cases where the data cannot be fit into a single machine.<p>&gt; Can this be run outside kubernetes or is it meant to be part of a big set of infra?<p>Yes, vineyard can run outside of kubernetes, but it would be a bit complicated to setup on many machines as a cluster.<p>Devops your vineyard cluster on kubernetes could leverage the ability of Kubernetes. We already have integrated with helm and there&#x27;s a vineyard-operator in our roadmap.')
