I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to not run into a single one during my 100+ hours so far and I&#x27;ve been trying to do every quest. I worry that these things keep getting said without people actually experiencing them. I have several friends playing on PS4 without the reported crashes. Not saying you haven&#x27;t, I just don&#x27;t have any direct knowledge of the issues that have been reported and when it is, it&#x27;s very hand-wavy.')
