You really can&#x27;t show much more from the act itself.<p>For example I authored and maintain megatools, a tool to download&#x2F;upload from mega.nz that many people probably use to download the same kind of content that&#x27;s being the issue with youtube-dl. I have no way of knowing.<p>I haven&#x27;t used megatools myself in about 4 years, aside from quick testing prior to release&#x2F;update. And I never really used mega.nz that much even before. I just wanted to learn a bit about cryptography, and return back to C programming after a few years of just doing PHP&#x2F;JS, and writing a first mega.nz third-party client was an interesting opportunity at the time. Yet the tool is somewhat popular, and distributed as one of mega clients in various Linux distros.<p>It&#x27;s ridiculous to assume intent from some test cases. The only intent I can extrapolate from the actions of authors is  that they like to code, fix bugs in other people&#x27;s code, and want to ease their maintenance burden by having tests. The rest is just speculation.')
