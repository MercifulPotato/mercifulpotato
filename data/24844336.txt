And that&#x27;s not just Forms apps. You could build a TCP server on it. You could build embeddable COM components, embed a Web Browser, do Distributed Transactions, make a System tray app, connect to any database that you choose, Web Apps, etc. It had a great interop story with COM&#x2F;C++ code (which allowed you to do embed stuff like, say Telephony, with just a few lines of code).<p>There&#x27;s truly a market for a reincarnation of VB. I don&#x27;t think Retool would be that, because the capabilities will never align. VB is much &quot;lower level&quot; relatively, and that was its strength.<p>[1]: As long as you stuck to Windows, which was the case in the 90s.')
