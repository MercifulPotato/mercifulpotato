Something is different this time. It was not good. I hope it won&#x27;t happen again.<p>The moderators on this site do great work, and I&#x27;m sure this caught them by surprise and they did their best. I hope a controversy like the one that happened with WSB and Robin Hood in the past few days will not be able to take over this site to such an extent again.')
