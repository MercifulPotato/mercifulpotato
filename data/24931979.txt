They&#x27;ve seen it coming, but have largely squandered the opportunity.<p>Most hospitals store their data and run systems on-prem and are hyper-allergic to anything cloud based. They often have sloppy if extant back-up policies, and I&#x27;ve never heard of a hospital practicing a restore from backups. They also all seem to have terrible policies around passwords that cause most of their staff to iterate passwords every few months by simply incrementing a number at the end. You&#x27;re also quite likely to find passwords on post it notes under half the keyboards in a given facility.<p>Security certifications are kind of a joke and mostly conducted by lawyers and compliance officers who have no technical background, let-alone info sec training.<p>TL;DR this has been a ticking time bomb for a decade and everyone involved knew it.')
