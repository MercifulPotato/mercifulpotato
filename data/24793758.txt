In this case they may fight, but it will be for &quot;reasonable&quot; settlements (whatever they decide that is, but probably based on similar human caused accidents)<p>My guess is they think one of the two are the case for everything by now, so the other possibilities don&#x27;t need to be listed.<p>Of course the above is my guess.
