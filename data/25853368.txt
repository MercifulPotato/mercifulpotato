Both are honestly extremely impressive, though the latter is much farther along technologically in part because the scale of impact is greater and factories allow for larger capital expenditure since it&#x27;s so much lower on a per product basis. That said, what I am talking about doesn&#x27;t necessarily have anything to do with the quality of the end product.<p>&gt;If you&#x27;re retrofitting a kitchen designed for humans, systems like what White Castle is experimenting with might make sense<p>That&#x27;s what they&#x27;re doing. Sure, if you build all new buildings and kitchens it may make less sense but as a lower capital cost shift it totally fits.<p>&gt;BTW, automated restaurants are not new; look up &#x27;automat&#x27;.<p>Automating production is new. Automating service is not. Again, huge difference operationally.')
