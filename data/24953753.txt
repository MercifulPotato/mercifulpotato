During a fast, fat and other tissues are broken down by catabolic reactions to accomplish this. Knowing this, I am willing to entertain the idea that abstaining from water for a period of time can be beneficial, or perhaps I should say at least not harmful, because there are mechanisms in the body that synthesize water. Obviously, a sufficiently long period of time without water would be harmful.<p>I haven&#x27;t done the math to figure out how much water this is, and so I do not know how sufficient it is to keep minimally hydrated during a water-fast. I&#x27;m just saying that the thought of abstaining from water during a fast isn&#x27;t necessarily as dangerous as it sounds, because your body can and does produce it&#x27;s own water as a by-product of energy metabolism.')
