Though it was announced with tons of media hype and attention, this project seemed doomed to fail from the outset. Amazon, JP Morgan, BH may be giants in their own industries, but they&#x27;re relative outsiders to the healthcare industry. We aren&#x27;t used to seeing Amazon flop like this, so when it was announced, I think people expected that it would succeed. I think they&#x27;re finding the limits of their long term strategy. Ultimately, Amazon is a supply chain, logistics, and tech company. JP Morgan Chase is an investment bank and services co, and BH is a holding company. IMO if they&#x27;re really keen on upending the healthcare industry, they&#x27;d need to involve an industry player like Kaiser, who have existing infrastructure stood up and tons of relevant expertise.')
