They lobbied hard for the 25Mbps broadband definition so that they can use the old copper plant. 25&#x2F;3 is pretty easy to do with bonded DSL and they have plenty of pairs.  I would not expect them to do a log of new build, most likely some fiber to a hut perhaps and then bDSL from there to the customer.  Even doing it that way they will need subsidies for that to be profitable at the $30 price point.  Cost to build in rural is a lot less than urban but there are more customers in urban, so rural needs government support for anyone to do it profitably.')
