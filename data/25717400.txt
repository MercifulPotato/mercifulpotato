When you see those banner ads on wikis for donations, that&#x27;s who you&#x27;re donating to.<p>However, the Foundation is very hands-off about the <i>content</i> of wikis, which tend to run on &quot;consensus&quot;[0] with the editing-community for that wiki. That establishes the policies for the wiki, and often influences the technical decision-making for specific wikis. Also, the Foundation writes mediawiki extensions for a bunch of non-core behavior, but the individual wiki communities take a strong hand in whether they&#x27;re enabled for that wiki. It&#x27;s why the WYSIWYG editing environment (VisualEditor) is so inconsistently available between wikis, for instance.<p>Some wiki communities have a fairly fraught relationship with the Foundation, generally if they feel like they&#x27;re being pushed into things. There have been controversies about things like the Foundation banning abusive users project-wide, or Foundation employees editing wikis from their staff-affiliated accounts. It&#x27;s generally very inside-baseball though, and if you&#x27;re outside the community it&#x27;s hard to hear about.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Consensus" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Consensus</a>')
