I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s factually correct, because I&#x27;m trying to make nothing but a demonstration that an idée reçue, that ML systems are only based due to their data, is incorrect.<p>That&#x27;s reasonable. I may have taken the initial text in the wrong context. Thanks for clarifying.<p>To expand on my prior comment of &quot;Fuck x group&quot;, perhaps the tone of prior tweets by Timnit Gebru short-cut me mentally, namely this one: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;timnitGebru&#x2F;status&#x2F;1274809418475950080" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;timnitGebru&#x2F;status&#x2F;1274809418475950080</a><p>&gt; Even amidst of world wide protests people don’t hear our voices and try to learn from us, they assume they’re experts in everything.
