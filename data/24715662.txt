Those that were already on the edge and either unable or unwilling to adapt, or were not able to make their new processes profitable have gone under.<p>e:<p>Also, lets not forget that Victoria (Melbourne) had a broadly similar situation. They were unlucky in that their hotel quarantine process was poorly managed and there wasn&#x27;t a strict adherance to quarantine protocols.
