I had to go through training and one of the courses was about bribery.<p>It was an absurd experience. The training material kept repeating that I absolutely could not bribe a non-US official. However, in my country ALL officials are non-US and bribery is also illegal so what were they trying to tell me with this &quot;non-US&quot; criterion?<p>The message I got from training course is that bribery is bad (I knew that), bribery is illegal (I knew that) but it&#x27;s okay if I bribe a US official (really?).')
