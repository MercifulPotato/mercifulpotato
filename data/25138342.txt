It&#x27;s a choice to live in a city that lets landlords dictate which buildings can be built. Atlanta and other cities are unconstrained for new housing development.<p>SF policies are a tax on its non-homeowner residents.<p>You shouldn&#x27;t be entitled to a differential just because your city doesn&#x27;t build new housing fast enough. That has no bearing on the work your employees perform.')
