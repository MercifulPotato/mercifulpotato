Item(by='harry8', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610745709, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25792764, text='I can&#x27;t help anyone who thinks that is Betsy Reed, in response to a question about publishing the article elsewhere saying &quot;yes, go ahead and do that&quot; I don&#x27;t see holding that view as embarrassing and genuinely can&#x27;t see how it could be. Do you really, honestly see it like that?<p>The story has been discredited right up to the point of the emails. Nobody I&#x27;m aware of has said they are fake. Not even the Bidens. That makes them interesting concerning a presidential candidate and his response to shady dealing in his own immediate family based on his political profile. That makes them interesting if you are a Democrat. That makes them interesting if you think Biden is a great candidate and the possible person to be President.<p>If you really want Trump gone at all costs you might want to suppress it. That&#x27;s a huge cost.<p>You don&#x27;t have to trust Rudy Giuliani and i don&#x27;t as far as i can drop kick him. Does anyone? The &quot;it&#x27;s the Russians&quot; as a source also lacks evidence.<p>Where the hell is the laptop from? How did it happen? No clue. Why isn&#x27;t that being followed with some vigor? It&#x27;s strange that it isn&#x27;t, no?<p>I sure won&#x27;t be hitching my wagon to the honesty and integrity of Hunter Biden. The emails don&#x27;t detract at all from the stench.<p>There&#x27;s still a belief that we got Trump because Russians and Wikileaks and not because some run of the mill Democrat party corruption came to light and was widely reported on. There&#x27;s still a belief that reporting on that  Hilary Democrat corruption was doing the work of Russia. You either decide that it&#x27;s your job to report on corruption every single time it comes to light regardless of who or you don&#x27;t. Washington corruption is endemic. Perhaps we can agree on that.<p>&quot;Inappropriate&quot; I&#x27;d agree with. We clearly see that very differently. I want Glenn being inappropriate regarding the powerful. I&#x27;d like it if more journalists were inappropriateb when it comes to highlighting corruption.')
