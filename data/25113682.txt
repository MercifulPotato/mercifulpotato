I didn&#x27;t expect that from HN. I am sorry but they&#x27;re not a credible sources either.<p>The current crisis ongoing between Nepal and India is the starting point of all this. If you follow the timeline, it was after the Nepal suddenly woke up after 30 years and started laying claims on territory which was agreed to be part of India.  The current sitting govt. is highly biased for the communist, to the extent that somehow the Chinese Envoy has &#x27;special&#x27; meetings with PM and internal handling. It&#x27;s a known fact. There is strategic shift since the new PM who is has communist leaning was sworn in, since day one. Whilst, India shared Open border with Nepal during all this time, Nepal was like a brother, we had everything to share with them.<p>It is due due to foreign interference from Chinese side these chain of events started taking place. In Past Indian Govt. was very hesitant about border clashes but now it seems like they have had enough of the bullying.<p>Are you really denying the expansionism by China? If you only care about hyperlink to so called &#x27;International Credible News Sources they&#x27;re not free from Foreign interference either.<p>There are issues in past even with Sri-Lanka, The Chinese side has occupied an entire port by debt trap policy. The Thread posed by Chinese Expansionism is real.<p>&gt; but instead there are disputes between Nepal and India.<p>There are 2 disputes of minor region. There is no Denial of change in behavior from nepal&#x27;s side, how come after decades Free trade, Open Borders, where Nepal citizen could literally get their bags and visit any city in India, decide to show their back? that too all of sudden? never in history there was a crisis like this.<p>Look at the larger picture, China has highest number of territorial disputes , South China Sea, Indian Border Dispute, I wonder how world has forgotten Take over of Tibet. Even Taiwan, Mongolia, Australia, Japan, They internally suppressing millions of Uighurs Muslims voices, and not to forget Hong Kong. They&#x27;re debt trapping poor nations - in the name of investment they bring everything from China sounds fair enough until even the laborers are from China, its a fishy business, to an extent where they had dock yards and port in their name... It doesn&#x27;t take a genius to figure out where the way leads, China&#x27;s been bully for more than a decade now.')
