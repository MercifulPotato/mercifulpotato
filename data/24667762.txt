I was taking a class on algorithm design and Big-O notation and ended up reading through the sorting algorithms page on wikipedia[1] and then wandering off the garden path investigating a few.<p>There are several amusing ways that standard algorithmic analysis has been subverted with creative solutions (i.e. if you subscribe to the many-worlds theory then bogosort is always O(1) for at least one universe - you just need to discard the incorrect universes) but beadsort stood out as a really fun way to turn the problem on its head - the fact that it appears to be inspired from misusing an abacus just makes it even better.<p>It&#x27;s a great example of why having people who can think outside of the box can be a good asset - approaching problems from unexpected directions can yield valuable and novel solutions.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sorting_algorithm#Comparison_of_algorithms" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sorting_algorithm#Comparison_o...</a>')
