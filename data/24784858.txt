You&#x27;re aware of its presence, which to some degree, inoculates you from its effects. Whenever you see any news, you ask yourself: &quot;What actors might be trying to influence me to believe this, and why?&quot; and I assert the average person does not offer that level of introspection when consuming content.<p>The solution is media blackouts for a period of N days to weeks before elections. It&#x27;s what other democracies do. But, during critical periods of time, we temporarily restrict speech. That&#x27;s how you handle it. Is it a perfect solution, no, but it offers some benefit with not too much restriction.')
