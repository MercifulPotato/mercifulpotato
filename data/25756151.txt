He&#x27;s serious until there&#x27;s observed push back, then, &quot;Hey, it was just a joke&quot;. But sure, there&#x27;s a chance he&#x27;s just talking shit.

At this point, I think it&#x27;s now more important than ever to utterly shut down (in debate and rhetoric form) anyone who thinks extreme viewpoint behavior of any flavor is acceptable. If it doesn&#x27;t end, I think we&#x27;re just going to see unending ping ponging of more extremism.')
