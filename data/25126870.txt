On the right-wing side of things, conspiracy theories are easier to buy into thanks to how prevalent social media has become. COVID-19 is viewed as a hoax because the belief is that the left-wing or china developed the virus to essentially break down America and push in a socialist&#x2F;communist regime. These theories are similar with stuff like global warming as well. So expect to see a lot of push back from the right wing in these areas.<p>As a society, we have made a very big mistake by turning this issue into political one. For example, by criticizing Trump on his COVID-19 plan, you are basically encouraging his base to resist whatever needs to be done (wear masks). We are better off not criticizing and instead focus on educating instead. Unfortunately, our society has become so divided on both ends of the spectrum that I don&#x27;t see it ever happening.<p>Also stuff like social media censorship is pushing people into &quot;echo chamber&quot; platforms where anyone with a dissenting view is banned. The people who are banned from left-wing social media or silenced simply leave to go to platforms that only allow right-wing narratives.')
