Since this was very CPU-intensive we opted for Crystal instead of the usual Ruby that was used for almost everything else there. When I left it was churning away at ~500 images per second (over many cores, obv).<p>Development was pretty smooth and it was pretty easy to get new people onboarded since it look so much like Ruby. Some caveats though:<p>- If you want every last bit of performance, type signatures are very needed. Otherwise the compiler will still have to determine at runtime if the argument to a function is a uint32 or a uint64 for example.<p>- Library support is definitely lacking compared to Ruby. For example, AWS has an official SDK for Ruby with support for everything you can think of. Crystal has a 3rd party library with support for a few services. It&#x27;s just not comparable.')
