Simon is trying to understand how neural nets do what they do. Simon was the second author on the seminal Google AI SimCLR paper. We also cover &quot;Do Wide and Deep Networks learn the same things?&quot;, &quot;Whats in a Loss function for Image Classification?&quot;, and &quot;Big Self-supervised models are strong semi-supervised learners&quot;. Simon used to be a neuroscientist and also gives us the story of his unique journey into ML.\nWe cover a lot of ground on contrastive self-supervised representation learning, and augmentations in particular. Simon has also done fascinating work on analysing the evolution of representations in NNs.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1EqJyMy0LnE')
