But it&#x27;s too harsh to say <i>every</i> character is a stereotype or that <i>none</i> of his characters were ever human.<p>Take one of the protagonists of <i>Count Zero</i>, Marly Krushkhova, <i>&quot;the disgraced former operator of a tiny Paris gallery&quot;</i>, who hunts down the maker of the Joseph Cornell-like boxes.  She&#x27;s completely human, and I can&#x27;t think of any stereotype she would fit in to.')
