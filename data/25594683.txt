Life isn&#x27;t a precise mathematical concept, but a family of related concepts.<p>Self-replication is almost essential, but it&#x27;s not hard to imagine a future AI that is highly dynamic, intelligent, etc, but does not create copies of itself.<p>Metabolism is pretty universal. I&#x27;d define it as a process that consumes free energy. Arguably viruses don&#x27;t satisfy this definition. Computers do satisfy it. Most probably don&#x27;t consider the sun to be alive though, despite it consuming vast amounts of free energy.<p>Minimizing internal entropy is an interesting one because it&#x27;s not objective, it requires a model to define entropy. Something can look to us to be high and increasing entropy because we&#x27;re using the wrong model to understand it. Viruses are static though, so they are definitely not decreasing internal entropy.')
