However, you can absolutely do this just ternary numbers.  You loose the ability to encode 3^n states (and are stuck w&#x2F; just 2^n), but the middle state can then be repurposed to indicate if the computation is complete (or not) as of yet.<p>I basically used this sort of design in a dual-rail logic framework which had 4 line-states per &quot;data&quot; line pair, two of which were real data bits, a third indicated unknown vs. unknown, and the fourth was unused.<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;core.ac.uk&#x2F;download&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;82751815.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;core.ac.uk&#x2F;download&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;82751815.pdf</a>, but beware that even though it doesn&#x27;t look at all like ternary numbers in use, it absolute is.')
