We could just point them to oncogenes then - genes that are a bit &quot;broken&quot; normally, so they don&#x27;t get expressed or don&#x27;t make a viable protein but a mutation can &quot;fix&quot; them so that they can perform their &quot;normal&quot; function. Unfortunately, that normal function causes cancer.')
