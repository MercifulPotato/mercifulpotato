This is why Einstein became so famous in his lifetime: not just because he had some elegant theories, but because he had theories that unambiguously matched the experimental evidence (and even offered new predictions) in ways the previous scientific consensus could not. And even though a few skeptics tried to resist his ideas, the scientific consensus worked in exactly the ways we&#x27;d expect it to as the evidence came in.<p>I have no idea what the situation is with current theories on the motion of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. I&#x27;m guessing you also have an incomplete picture of the evidence, but you&#x27;ve got an alternative pet theory that explains some inconsistencies in the consensus theory. I&#x27;m also guessing your theory isn&#x27;t a slam dunk, i.e., that there&#x27;s good evidence against it and&#x2F;or there&#x27;s a distinct lack of evidence in favor of it. But I strongly suspect you&#x27;re not going to present me with all of the negative evidence for your own theory in an HN comment: I would have to get the impressions of other people in the field in order to actually get a fair evaluation of the evidence. That&#x27;s what scientific consensus is supposed to offer, and as imperfect as it is, it usually works better than trusting the opinions of a single enthusiast.')
