Society can tolerate any kind of speech, because they&#x27;re words.<p>This is false; there is no metaphysical difference between &quot;speech&quot; and &quot;action&quot;; I&#x27;d check out the work of Fred Schauer or more recently Susan Brison on this point. There are many examples (see citation) of speech having the ability to directly harm without any other action, from psychological harms to contextual harms. Indeed, in many segregationist policies, it wasn&#x27;t the segregation that made it ugly, it was the effects of the contents of the law which provided denigration through authority.<p>&quot;Sticks and stones can break my bones but words will never hurt me&quot; is empirically untenable[0], and like actions, speech can cause negative involuntary reactions. It also seems unfair to place the burden of &quot;hardening&quot; one&#x27;s ability to feel this pain on the people whom the words are targeted at.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;susanbrison.com&#x2F;files&#x2F;B.16.-speech_harm_and_the_mindbody_problem_in_first_amendment_jurisprudence.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;susanbrison.com&#x2F;files&#x2F;B.16.-speech_harm_and_the_mindb...</a>')
