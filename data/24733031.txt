You can read it here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;investors.chromadex.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;news-details&#x2F;2020&#x2F;ChromaDex-Announces-Study-Results-Showing-Nutritional-Protocol-Including-Nicotinamide-Riboside-Plus-Standard-of-Care-Reduces-Recovery-Time-in-COVID-19-Patients-by-Nearly-30&#x2F;default.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;investors.chromadex.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;news-details&#x2F;2020&#x2F;Chrom...</a><p>It shows that Nicotinamide-Riboside (sold as TruNiagen) with a couple of common vitamins reduced time to recovery by about 30%. This is about the same result as the much touted remdesivir.<p>But while remdesivir is a very serious and expensive drug with serious side effects that has to be administered in a hospital setting under the oversight of a physician, TruNiagen is sold as an over the counter anti-ageing supplement, costs about $1.30 for a daily dose and there are no known adverse side effects (AFAIK, and according to the label).<p>Of course the two things aren&#x27;t exclusive, you can take both remdesivir and truniagen. Furthermore, the truniagen study was a phase 2 study with 100 patients with mild to moderate symptoms, while remdesivir has been studied for a lot more patients and more seriously ill patients too. (There was no mortality data on the truniagen study, it seems that everyone survived.)<p>Nevertheless, 100 patients is plenty to make the study statistically significant. And considering how low the cost of actually taking truniagen is, I think this study is really important and really positive news in the fight against covid.<p>Again, it is criminal that the media is ignoring it. Truniagen is made by a small company with negligible advertising budget, while other Covid drugs and vaccines are made by massive pharma companies that regularly spend enormous amounts of money on mass media advertising. So perhaps this has something to do with this.')
