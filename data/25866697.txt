I helped with parts of the blog post to try to explain some of the nuance about how things are set up with Elasticsearch as an &quot;upstream&quot;.<p>The 9 PRs were only to demonstrate working in the &quot;upstream first&quot; practice, and aren&#x27;t exhaustive. It also doesn&#x27;t cover the additional work in the Apache Lucene project that benefits Elasticsearch as well, which is where larger code investments are being made (since that&#x27;s the right place for them to live, for much of what&#x27;s being built).')
