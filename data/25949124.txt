Item(by='just_for_you', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611867625, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25947798, text='To my knowledge, I see most JPEG images encode their height in an &quot;APP1&quot; EXIF segment, and in their SOF1 segment (which is basically just a basic-info segment for the core JPEG bitstream). It&#x27;s also possible to store the size in an APP1 XMP section, but that&#x27;s mostly non-essential metadata for interchange purposes, and I usually don&#x27;t see the size duplicated there for JPEGs anyway (PNG does though, if it has an XMP chunk).<p>It&#x27;s possible that some of the other officially-defined segments (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;exiftool.org&#x2F;TagNames&#x2F;JPEG.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;exiftool.org&#x2F;TagNames&#x2F;JPEG.html</a>) might also contain duplicate info, but then that&#x27;d be specific to the app that uses it, not for general-purpose use.<p>Storing the size in easily-parseable EXIF metadata and then once again in the JPEG bitstream seems pretty reasonable to me. Not to mention if you run a metadata&#x2F;EXIF stripper on a JPEG file, then you remove all duplicate info and the only remaining image-dimensions will be stored in the JPEG bitstream anyway.')
