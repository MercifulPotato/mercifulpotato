Really... can&#x27;t be helped with our current state of medicine, even if the person would want it)<p>I have a good bit of personal anecdata that psychopaths that are financially better off do seem to enjoy youth-middle age a good bit, but crossing over into older age leads them towards some rather harsh methods of suicide fairly quickly.<p>Also, on a slightly different note - if all your wants in life are to be able to spend your time playing video games... well, many, many things can be said about this and related to why this person feels the need to financially help others. May want to consider some self reflection... or not. In the end, the world really owes you nothing, nor do you it. Enjoy your time here in whatever way you find yourself able to.')
