Item(by='save_ferris', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609253108, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25570070, text='&gt; This is a major flaw in how many bitcoiners imagine post-apocalyptic scenarios. They assume that when the USD and society collapses they&#x27;ll be able to do and buy anything because bitcoin survived hyperinflation. It might resist inflation, but it&#x27;ll be futile if the populace turns against them, or bitcoin.<p>This is a pretty good point. Many assume that the collapse of the USD will neatly transition us to BTC without any real evidence. Not to mention all of the alleged BTC price manipulation that ran up the price last time.<p>The more I think about it, the harder it is to envision the public accepting a new currency that doesnâ€™t even have paper. In such a scenario, a BTC crash would probably be the end of it.')
