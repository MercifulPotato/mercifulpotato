(The French Resistance became active only after Sokel began enslaving all able-bodied French citizens, men and women.)<p>After the EU border-free crossings started, UK business owners had slave camps for Poles. That was only 10-20 years ago.<p>So before you go all SJW on HN, at least learn what you&#x27;re talking about. The US is not uniquely evil because we had slaves. What is unique is that we had a civil war to free them, and that&#x27;s lost in the SJW narrative.')
