Really great value for what you get. See multiple places, get fed, entertained, for less than it costs for a hotel in a lot of these places.<p>Looking through a low level port window at night, to moonlight, honestly feels like travelling through outer space on the USS Enterprise. Its pretty unique.<p>About the only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that since the food is included, it seems to attract seriously obese people to take these cruises. Just so they can indulge in buffet gluttony 3 times a day for several days non stop. Served by their poor and skinny third world waiters, with a reputation for f-ing like bunny rabbits in their cage like quarters. \nThe contrast is kind of comical.<p>Then seeing all these obese burgers leave the buffet tables, belly full,  walking on a port deck at sea reminded me of wobbling marbles in a Maze run. Pretty funny and Wally like.<p>But wouldn&#x27;t it make sense for a poorer countries government to buy this and use it for its tourism industry or even for fishing boats.<p>The value of a full ship has to be worth more than scrap metal. These ships are no longer to luxury standards. But most likely still very functional ships.')
