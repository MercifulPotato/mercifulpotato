I have a cheap Linux server (non pi) running in my home, and it&#x27;s immeasurably useful. It functions as a combination of a backup server (with an attached 8tb drive), Plex server (another 2 Tb media drive), PiHole host and MITmproxy etc.<p>Today I figured that I need to setup periodic email backups from my Gmail, and guess where that cron is going! I use Windows + WSL as my home machine so having a pure Linux machine locally SSHable is a godsend.<p>I though of getting a Pi but I&#x27;m just doing too much with the server.')
