I don&#x27;t think anyone has as much incentive as Apple does. \nWho else is as incentivized to make a laptop&#x2F;desktop-class arm64 chip? Maybe ARM themselves ... but without a mainstream OS to run it on (with mainstream software available for it), I don&#x27;t see it happening in the next 5 years. Its a chicken-and-egg problem that Apple is uniquely suited to address with their vertical control over the Mac ecosystem (hardware&#x2F;dev tools&#x2F;OS&#x2F;competitive software).<p>Server chips, maybe - but we can already see with Azure that competitive x86 chips from AMD have killed Microsoft&#x27;s plans to deploy arm64 on their cloud service.<p>But this:<p><i>- Apple could make all this futile with a push of a button (SecureBoot can be disabled for now, but what guarantees are there this won&#x27;t change?);</i><p>This is huge. We could all contribute to getting Linux ported to M1, and then Apple could shut us down with little or no effort. And ... maybe they won&#x27;t? They probably won&#x27;t? But who knows? Why build an ecosystem around a hostile hardware vendor?')
