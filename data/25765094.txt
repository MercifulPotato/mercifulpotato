For me, it usually stands in for &quot;that&#x27;s a good point&quot;, or &quot;my thoughts exactly&quot;, or &quot;this comment was unjustly downvoted&quot;.<p>Downvotes, on the other hand, are a communication to everyone involved that that comment crossed a line in some kind of way.  There&#x27;s almost a social shaming that goes along with it.  &quot;Keep expressing that opinion and what you say will be increasingly harder for everyone else to see.&quot;  I&#x27;m not a big fan of trying to suppress ideas.  Much better to respond to them explaining why you disagree or, alternatively, to just ignore them and move on.  I guess I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s up to me to work with others to make comments harder to read.  People can make their own minds up without me having to tell them what they shouldn&#x27;t agree with.<p>That&#x27;s why I only upvote and don&#x27;t downvote.')
