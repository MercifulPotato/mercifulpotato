Item(by='lpage', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1603150141, title='Tell HN: [Slack] Issue with Archival of Some Direct Messages', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='We are writing to inform you of an issue that prevented applications connected via the Slack Discovery API from collecting all direct messages.<p>Slack’s Discovery API allows applications to collect data from Slack for archival and discovery purposes and is intended to help an organization access all its message content within Slack. Slack’s eDiscovery and Data Loss Prevention partners also use the Discovery API when providing their services to customers who use Slack.<p>With Slack Connect, members of your organization are able to directly message members of other organizations if both members are currently in the same Slack Connect shared channels. From April 10th to September 16th, if someone from another company initiated a Slack Connect direct message with someone from your team, that Slack Connect direct message was not visible to the discovery.conversations.list function of the Slack Discovery API, which causes the API to miss collection of those messages. This issue has since been fixed and those messages will now be available to applications that use the Slack Discovery API (assuming that the original messages were not edited or deleted by the author of the message or a retention policy).<p>We recommend reviewing the applications you have and identifying any that use the Slack Discovery API. You may need to run those applications again to collect Slack Connect direct messages that were missed between April 10th and September 16th, while this problem existed. If you use a third party eDiscovery tool, we recommend working with your eDiscovery provider to help you collect any Slack Connect direct messages their service may have missed during this time.<p>We are here to help with any questions you may have. We apologize for this issue and for any impact on your organization&#x27;s compliance needs. We are working to ensure this does not occur in the future. Please let us know if you have any questions, or if we can provide additional assistance.')
