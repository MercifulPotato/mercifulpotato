They are often not the people who get to decide on where the company spends its money.<p>Super common in businesses. They prioritize what managers want, not what the employees need.<p>Example:<p>We switched to NextCloud&#x27;s Mail app for our webmail. It&#x27;s terrible and barely has any of the features you&#x27;d consider it for any size company much less ours (~$1 billion &amp; 3500 employees).<p>We brought it up to our VP of IT before we rolled it out and &quot;we like that its integrated into NextCloud and we can pay them or develop features ourselves!&quot;.<p>Rollout went as predicted. Our users hate it because it has tons of problems and barely works. So we brought up that we can switch to something like RoundCube and same thing: &quot;We like that its integrated&quot;. Even after we brought up that its a terrible experience for users. VP: &quot;I don&#x27;t care about that&quot;. There was a nice awkward silence after that.')
