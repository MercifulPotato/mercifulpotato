When I first learned about how US copyright laws were extended (and then pushed on the rest of the world via trade deals, etc), my respect for IP rules plummeted.  In college I had no qualms using Napster, and later bitorrent, etc.<p>Even today, I get frustrated by geo-ip blocking (I&#x27;m Canadian) and I have no idea how I&#x27;m going to watch the Animaniacs reboot (Hulu isn&#x27;t available here).  Even worse, a lot of content gets licenced to Canadian media companies which then (if I legally want to) force me to watch through terrible apps with terrible commercial interruptions at bad times.  The last movie I tried to legally watch via that last method has 20 minutes of commercials for every hour of the film.<p>I pay for Netflix and Apple music because they&#x27;re affordable and extremely convenient, but get in my way and I&#x27;ll have no qualms finding a better way.')
