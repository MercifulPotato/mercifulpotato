It&#x27;s not enough to have that pressure at the very beginning, it needs to persist all the way. This isn&#x27;t really the case for a vaccine.<p>I disagree.  You have the weak vaccine response the entire duration of infection applying selective pressure.  What you say seems to disagree with the consensus of the literature, e.g.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medrxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.11.17.20233726v2.full" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medrxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.11.17.20233726v...</a><p>&gt; The UK variant isn&#x27;t better at evading the immune system from what we know. It&#x27;s simply more infectious in general.<p>The mutations have been broadly described as &quot;immune escape mutations&quot; and are thought to have emerged from pressure to escape low numbers of existing sterilizing antibodies within the host, e.g.<p>&quot;The unusually high number of spike protein mutations, other genomic properties of the variant, and the high\nsequencing coverage in the UK suggest that the variant has not emerged through gradual accumulation of mutations\nin the UK. It is also unlikely that the variant could have arisen through selection pressure from ongoing vaccination\nprogrammes as the observed increase does not match the timing of such activities.\nOne possible explanation for the emergence of the variant is prolonged SARS-CoV-2 infection in a single patient,\npotentially with reduced immunocompetence, similar to what has previously been described [17,18]. Such prolonged\ninfection can lead to accumulation of immune escape mutations at an elevated rate&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ecdc.europa.eu&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;documents&#x2F;SARS-CoV-2-variant-multiple-spike-protein-mutations-United-Kingdom.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ecdc.europa.eu&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;documents&#x2F;SAR...</a>')
