I wouldn&#x27;t really hold them responsible. Higher ups should be made responsible but I don&#x27;t see it happening anytime soon. The law has a lot of catching up to do and seeing honesty and responsibility come directly from these people  is not going to happen anytime soon. As long as their incentives are short term profits this is what we&#x27;re going to come out of it')
