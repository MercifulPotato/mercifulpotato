For most massive particles, depending on the one should be equivalent to being dependent on the other, right? Seeing as for massless particles , the velocity is always c and therefore &quot;dependent on the velocity&quot; doesn&#x27;t really make sense, why isn&#x27;t &quot;dependent on the reference frame&quot; the appropriate extension of the concept?  \nThe [the quantity I described] definitely depends on the reference frame for which the photon is being described, because the photon&#x27;s frequency and wavelength depend on ones reference frame.<p>I don&#x27;t know why you brought up the photon traveling through different mediums. I&#x27;ve been assuming it was traveling through a vacuum. Bringing in a medium seems like it would just complicate things. Maybe you thought I was thinking of it moving in a medium so that it was sorta moving at less than c, so that there could maybe be reference frame for which it is at rest? This is not what I was thinking of. I mean to address only the case of a photon in a vacuum.<p>And yes, of course there would be no reference frame in which the photon&#x27;s [the quantity I&#x27;m describing] becomes equal to its rest mass, which is 0. That is implied by what I&#x27;ve said, namely, that the [the quantity I&#x27;m describing] is never 0, but changes with the reference frame. There are reference frames in which [the quantity I&#x27;m describing] is arbitrarily close to 0, but none in which it is 0.<p>The footnotes at the bottom of the wikipedia article on &quot;Photon&quot; do describe photons as having non-zero relativistic mass, though also notes that some prefer not to use the concept of relativistic mass.\nIn any case, at the very least, if one is to speak of the relativistic mass of a photon, it is not 0. If anything it is either &quot;nonsense quantity&quot; or [the quantity I have been describing] . Not 0.')
