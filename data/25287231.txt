I do the above as a matter of course, but I&#x27;ve learned how and why through osmosis, over the years, mostly because I dabble with gamedev as a hobby (and because I care about performance). None of that was covered in any of my university courses. And, out of the people I worked with, I was and am literally the only one who knows how to do any of that.')
