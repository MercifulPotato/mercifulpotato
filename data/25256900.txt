Item(by='gruez', descendants=None, kids=[25256926], score=None, time=1606759859, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25256840, text='&gt;Energy consumption in the classical model is substantially lower because if you scaled up Bitcoin to the size of visa alone it would exceed the amount of energy generated on earth a few times over and the amount of ewaste generated on earth too.<p>This seems to be a misunderstanding of how mining works. The amount of energy used for mining is largely disconnected from transaction volume. Mining a block with one transaction takes about the same amount of energy (within a few watts) as mining a block with 10000 transactions.')
