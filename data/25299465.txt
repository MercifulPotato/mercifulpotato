I have a similar amount of experience, but wouldn&#x27;t say I had to &quot;relearn coding&quot; when I did my last round of interviews.<p>I&#x27;ve landed enough jobs without crazy amounts of studying, but knowing what was coming, I did ~100 Leetcode questions over a month. I also read an algorithm book knowing it&#x27;s one of my weak points. I got a FAANG offer from my first interview, and even got feedback that I&#x27;m good at algorithms.<p>There&#x27;s a comment here about someone who&#x27;s in their 40&#x27;s and can&#x27;t get anyone to look at their resume. Maybe that&#x27;ll change for me, but I get lots of recruiter emails. It definitely helps that I have four well-regarded tech companies on my resume.<p>Hate the system all you want, but you know what&#x27;s expected. Either suck it up and do your leetcode and be an expert and the language you&#x27;re using or stop complaining about being stuck somewhere.')
