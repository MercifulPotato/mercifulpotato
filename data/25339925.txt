It was just a very convenient story for journalists who, weirdly, have been obsessed with highlighting deaths in states run by Republicans, and simultaneously ignoring the same in blue states due to their narrative bias.<p>Illinois has been practically ignored because of this bias, despite very bad numbers in the latest spike, while when Georgia first relaxed it&#x27;s lockdowns in May, articles were published calling it &quot;an experiment in human sacrifice&quot;.  (Didn&#x27;t see a surge in cases afterwards, since most Georgians are sane and just kept wearing masks while going places)<p>While I always am against excessive police force, I also am fed up with journalists trying to dramatize things, and add credibility when it&#x27;s not needed to any cause celebre.  A person who builds dashboards isn&#x27;t a data scientist BTW.<p>Edit:<p>I&#x27;m fully aware I&#x27;ll be downvoted to oblivion for this post, but this person is a COVID alarmist, has pushed for excessive caution, and claims credentials and skills she doesn&#x27;t have.  I particularly resent her pushing for keeping elementary schools closed despite all of Europe and the vast majority of peer reviewed scientific literature saying otherwise.  She&#x27;s marketed herself as a renegade scientist all year, and dramatized all of it to great effect.<p>Second Edit:<p>Here she is in spring making the claim on Rachel Maddow that Florida was &quot;hiding&quot; hospitalization data.  Absolutely untrue, and would have required conspiracy by public and private medical orgs:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Csvzt6kGzHw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Csvzt6kGzHw</a><p>Neutral media outlets wouldn&#x27;t touch the story.')
