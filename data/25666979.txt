The &#x27;Prophets of Doom&#x27; episode is my favourite.<p>Darknet Diaries - Hacking &#x2F; technology.<p>Planet Money - Short episodes on economics and money<p>Acquired - Analysis of Companies<p>Tim Ferris Show - He interviews interesting people. Hit or miss for me.<p>Lex Fridman - High quality interviewees but Lex Fridman is hit or miss.<p>Joe Rogan Experience - Plenty of great episodes. Episodes vary dramatically in quality.')
