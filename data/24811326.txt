He explained precisely what was changed, it was because a typo or something was causing the conversation to go sideways, it was after the edit window had closed, and the author thanked him for making the correction.  As far as I can tell, the site maintainers are quite committed to transparency of that kind.<p>Maybe a &quot;history&quot; feature would be nice.  OTOH, I appreciate that HN takes a very slow and deliberate approach to adding features to the site.  Personally speaking, most social media crashes my phone browser, and HN is beautiful in its simplicity.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s kind of acting like a newspaper though?<p>If newspapers have live comments sections and don&#x27;t contain the text of a vast majority of their stories... um, no.  This isn&#x27;t at all like a newspaper.')
