Of the three, it was generally accepted that WordMaster was the easiest for a novice to learn. WordStar was harder to learn but much more powerful. Thus Ed was reserved for when setting up a CP&#x2F;M system as it came on the 8&quot; floppy along with CP&#x2F;M. On the other hand WM and WS were third party products and came on a separate floppy.  If they&#x27;d been always available then I don&#x27;t think Ed would have been used at all.<p>Ed always had the reputation of being a bit of a PIA and no one wanted to use it if the other two editors were available. It was always looked upon as being primitive by comparison.<p>As WS was more powerful and flexible, Ed was thus confined to editing when only CP&#x2F;M files were available. Today, that comparison would be like comparing Notepad with say UltraEdit, which, incidentally, is my current text-based editor of choice (it having both Windows and Linux versions).')
