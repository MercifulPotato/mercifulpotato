You can get arrival prediction information on all stops&#x2F;lines now through their API, but that wasn&#x27;t the case until recently.  They are still behind the Boston MBTA, where you can get vehicle locations in addition to arrival predictions, and TFL (London Underground) where they have a very well thought out API.<p>We use all these APIs to power our Traintrackr boards[0], processing the predicted arrival data (or departure data if they only provide that) to show trains moving through the network.<p>However, these three APIs are all better than the BART API, which seems to change occasionally.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.traintrackr.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.traintrackr.io</a>')
