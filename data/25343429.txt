The junctor relays in particular were oddly hefty and made a solid clack, twice per call setup if I recall correctly, once to prove the path by swinging it over it to a test point of some sort, and then again to actually connect it through. On rare occasion, you&#x27;d hear a triple-clack as the first path tested bad, an alternate was set up and tested good, and then connected through.<p>Moments after such a triple-clack, one of the teleprinters would spring to life, spitting out a trouble ticket indicating the failed circuit.<p>The #5, on the other hand, was completely electronic, time-division switching in the core. The only clicks were the individual line relays responsible for ringing and talk battery, and these were almost silent in comparison. You couldn&#x27;t learn anything about the health of the machine by just standing in the middle of it and listening, and anyone in possession of a relay contact burnishing tool will tell you in no uncertain terms, that the #5 has no soul.')
