I have an idea or thought, that I urge to capture asap.\nAnd typically, when I read on mobile I donâ€™t have my notebook or note taking app handy, so I start commenting right away. Once I am done typing, I am only one click away from pressing &quot;Comment&quot;.<p>2. Is it really worth reading in full?\nA good article can cover one-two ideas tops, often you can get it from first few paragraphs and skim the rest. When people write, often more effort goes towards the beginning, not the ending, just like in reading. Posting things on the internet is &quot;cheap&quot;, not every written text is worth reading. Or maybe not every bit of written text is worth reading.<p>3. Not finishing an article is something I have been conditioned to do by reading news: the essence of an article can be expressed in 1-2 paragraphs, the rest is an empty talk in attempt to create space for ads. Or, worse, very biased opinions.<p>4. I personally often get distracted by hyperlinks. When I encounter a concept, that&#x27;s interesting, not very familiar and hyperlinked, I tend to click on it and often get sucked into a rabbit hole. This made me appreciate in-page tooltip style links, which provide a short overview info in-place.')
