In Java, checked and unchecked exceptions. In Go, err and panic. Rust also has Err() and panic!().<p>If you look at, say, the evolution of the “if” statement, it was a number of years before this “obvious” control structure was added to programming languages. So there might be something similarly obvious for error handling, we just haven’t figured it out yet.')
