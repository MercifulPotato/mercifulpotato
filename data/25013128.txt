The world would be a better place if vice didn&#x27;t exist. It would be a worse place if 4chan didn&#x27;t exist. But both should exist and the people should decide. Not a bunch of privileged elites at vice or their corporate masters.<p>Also, they aren&#x27;t upset about the &quot;racism&quot;. They are upset about the lack of political control. It&#x27;s the same bullshit they pulled with reddit, facebook, youtube, etc.<p>Maybe one day these worthless &quot;journalists&quot; will disappear and people can be free. But in the short term, it seems like they will become more entrenched.')
