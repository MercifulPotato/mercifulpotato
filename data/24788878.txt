In Sweden or in France, you can certainly discuss the topics you proposed without risking prison or worse. But free speech applies to other people as well, who are equally free to refute your opinion. Free speech is not censorship merely because it stops at other people&#x27;s basic rights. That&#x27;s merely finding a balance between fundamental rights that may come in conflict.<p>Russia and China do not have free speech. If you say the wrong thing there, you go to prison (or worse). That&#x27;s censorship.')
