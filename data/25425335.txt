But I don&#x27;t see much evidence that they were reliant on investor money; per Crunchbase they only took $2.8m over 6 years of operation. And I don&#x27;t think Amazon was their only potential source of revenue. Book publishers clearly still spend money on marketing, and Goodreads would be able to do very precise targeting. I also suspect they could have sold well-targeted ads to others, as some book categories strongly indicate monetizable non-book interest.')
