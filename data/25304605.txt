For GDPR purposes you need a legal basis and &quot;your legitimate interest&quot; is one.  You need to honestly assess - ideally write down - your determination of how your need to analyse website performance is balanced against the user&#x27;s right to privacy.  One thing you might consider here is the impact on the user.  Then you need to fulfil your duties as a data controller with respect to accuracy, security and so on.<p>What you do need is consent for cookies (or local storage or similar)Â·  That is required by the ePrivacy Directive (aka cookie law).  If you want to persist an identifier on a user&#x27;s device you need to get consent before you put it there.<p>GDPR and ePrivacy are related but not the same.  You can use GA without cookies (or with only &quot;strictly necessary&quot; cookies which are an exception to the consent rule) and therefore not fall foul of ePrivacy.')
