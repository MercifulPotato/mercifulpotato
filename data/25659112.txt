To me, when I see that voluntary participation in these studies is so low, that&#x27;s not a problem with privacy, that&#x27;s a problem with the institutions doing the collection.<p>A good example of that is political surveys, which are really hard because people don&#x27;t answer their phones. But why don&#x27;t people answer their phones? Because they&#x27;re swamped with scams, political ads, and other spam. Half of the time that someone says they&#x27;re conducting a political survey on a phone call, what they&#x27;re really doing is campaigning for a candidate.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t that people are allowed to decline phone calls, the problem is that most of the phone calls people get are unwanted crap -- so it really doesn&#x27;t make sense for them to answer the phone, they&#x27;re making the correct choice by letting unrecognized numbers go to voicemail.<p>As a further analogy, if 50% of mail in the US postal service was infested with live spiders, you might see delivery rates for paper bills and official notices plummet. That would be a problem. But the solution wouldn&#x27;t be to force people to open their mail anyway, it would be to stop putting spiders in people&#x27;s Amazon boxes. And as it is with spiders, so too it is with advertisers.<p>You want to improve voluntary participation rates? Focus on removing bad actors and making people feel safe about their data. Governments, telemarketers, political groups, advertisers, and just companies in general all have serious issues with self-policing how they use and collect data. That&#x27;s not anyone else&#x27;s fault or problem to solve.')
