The $500 aspirin stories are about what&#x27;s printed on the bill but that is no where close to what is actually paid.<p>This is a huge problem IMO and i mentioned it upthread. The prices printed on bills are never what&#x27;s paid (unless some poor patient thinks that&#x27;s what they actually owe). It&#x27;s all negotiable. Taking away price negotiating and enforcing that what is on the bill is what is expected to be paid would help a lot. These ridiculous numbers would go away and people would actually know what their healthcare actually costs.<p>edit: here&#x27;s something to try, let&#x27;s say your in teh US and you have a prescription card that does not cover brand medications, only generic. Goto your pharmacist and ask them how much you&#x27;ll have to pay to get the brand. Then, offer to pay them half that amount in cash. You&#x27;ll be surprised at the results.')
