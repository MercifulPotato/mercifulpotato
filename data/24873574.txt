If I play a sine wave at 498.753 Hz, how many of those decimal places will someone with perfect pitch get correct? Since classical music is based on discrete notes with intervals of at least a semitone, maybe an error of less than half a semitone is acceptable, because that&#x27;s enough to sort a note into the correct bucket? But then what&#x27;s the average error for people who don&#x27;t have perfect pitch?')
