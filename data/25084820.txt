Disproportionately children.<p>Every year, driving kills hundreds of thousands, even when you exclude the effects of alcohol.<p>Every year, people have sex without condoms, and pass on harmful -- possibly fatal -- viruses.<p>Every year, millions of people die from <i>communicable disease</i> of every sort, ranging from pneumonia to HIV.<p>This is the first time in my life that we&#x27;ve tried to apply transitive risk logic to justify curtailing of individual freedoms. Masks are one thing, but telling people that they can&#x27;t have family gatherings because it might hurt <i>you</i>?<p>This seems wrong to me.
