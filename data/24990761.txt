On the front page of the site there&#x27;s a prominent announcement that the site will be offline for 48 hours for a database migration. Is this fairly common, and is this reasonable?<p>I&#x27;ve made some small sites but nothing that&#x27;s ever gained real traction. I&#x27;ve always told myself that if I build something that starts to take off I should learn to do maintenance without interrupting availability. But I also remind myself that for anything I&#x27;m likely to build, it would probably be perfectly reasonable to take the site offline for an hour or two to take care of maintenance tasks and updates. I like seeing this approach, and I really like the communication style in the section &quot;What can I do while eBird is down?&quot;<p>Can anyone with experience maintaining a project of this scale comment on how reasonable a 48-hour downtime period is?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ebird.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;database-update-november-17-19-maintenance" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ebird.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;database-update-november-17-19-mainte...</a>')
