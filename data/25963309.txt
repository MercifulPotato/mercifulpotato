Apple has been slowly turning the screws making it more and more difficult to get information out of the phone. I&#x27;m not sure Facebook is going to be able to get that, but I suspect they have a plan B which is iMessage.<p>iMessage is Apple&#x27;s secret &quot;Social Network&quot;. When I quit Facebook, it&#x27;s what I turned to, and I know a lot of people who rely on it as their primary way of keeping in touch with friends&#x2F; family and the increasing functionality of iMessage is becoming more of a threat to FB.<p>While Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and all the other messaging apps have to beg to get access to Photos, Location, ApplePay, cameras, FaceId, etc, with iMessage everything is permitted out of the box. Apple has a whole mini-App Store for iMessage which isn&#x27;t really possible with Facebook.<p>Finally, I&#x27;m sure Facebook would absolutely love to open up their own Ad-supported App Store which tracks everyone to their hearts content. Piles of money building an App Store, particularly when someone else is building the whole tool-chain to make it work and you just have to serve up the content.')
