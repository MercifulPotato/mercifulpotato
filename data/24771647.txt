Can&#x27;t believe this needs to be explained.<p>That&#x27;s not how the market works, though. Would you pay $100&#x2F;m for borrowing your neighbors tools anytime?<p>What if you&#x27;re running a business and you depend on those tools, what hours can you get them? How does maintenance work? What is he obligated to do, anything? If he decided to retract the offer, change the terms, not give you the drill on a Wednesday because he&#x27;s feeling sick, do you get refunds?<p>None of your &quot;casual neighbor verbal agreement&quot; example applies here of course because we&#x27;re not exchanging money. It&#x27;s not a service, they&#x27;re not a seller and you&#x27;re not a buyer.<p>When you <i>are</i> a buyer, and they <i>are</i> a seller, suddenly people want explicit terms of a contract.<p>Imaging pumping gas in your neighbor model. &quot;Eh, just pump an honest amount, pay what you think it&#x27;s worth&quot; - would that fly? Of course not, the gas owner wants a very specific amount for each and every drop of gas.<p>Do you think Apple or Google has short contracts for when you signup? They must, if they have good faith right? No, they don&#x27;t. They have pages, and pages, and pages of written legal terms that you as a user are &quot;agreeing&quot; to try and cover their asses should you decide to try and sue.<p>All these companies with huge lines of legal spaghetti are doing that because good faith doesn&#x27;t in the majority of cases.<p>Look at it a different way: I have &quot;unlimited&quot; internet from tmobile. Are you telling me there&#x27;s no fine print that dictates <i>exactly how limited my &quot;unlimited&quot; is?</i> So Tmobile clearly knows unlimited isn&#x27;t unlimited - the users are the only ones with &quot;good faith&quot; apparently. But that&#x27;s how marketing works, isn&#x27;t it?')
