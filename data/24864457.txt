It may trick people into thinking that longer = more secure. Which is only the case up to a certain extent.<p>If you reach beyond 256 bits of entropy, there is no added security. No current system will use more than that. And going beyond that is not future proofing, because you&#x27;re storing it in a current system, defeating any added entropy.<p>I don&#x27;t see good reasons why you would use a password generator embedded in a password manager for non-security purposes. Security purposes here are always more important than other uses.<p>But if you do have a good example, feel free to prove me wrong.')
