If Amazon and Walmart are liable, I won&#x27;t need to worry about fake Sandisk memory cards, fake medicines, fake clothing, and other fake products there.<p>I&#x27;d love that.<p>Maybe I just had a really bad 6 months with Amazon, but it seems everything that comes is a fake or a scam.<p>I&#x27;d gladly pay 10% more for real products than 10% less for 50-50. Right now, I switched to mostly buying off-brands direct from China for a lot of products, since I get the same thing as Amazon, but at a lower price and with an honest label.<p>Or buying direct from manufacturers if I want something real.<p>I got screwed once doing even that, though. I ordered a brand-name headset. They did... fulfillment by Amazon. The headset is barely usable, so I&#x27;m assuming Amazon did commingled products. Or perhaps I got a defective copy. In either case, not worth fighting for 50 bucks.')
