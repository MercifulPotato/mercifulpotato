Each player in our group has predictable styles -- one is the aggressor, one is the engine-economist, one is the creative, one is the flexible. I&#x27;m the card-chooser, we have around ~10 expansions in a box and I pick around 5 randomly, then I round out with fan picks or what we think it needs.<p>The game truly is deep. There are so many cards, numerous mechanics, counting your own and your opponent&#x27;s cards, timing your green-buying, balancing deck control vs. buying high-value cards, etc.')
