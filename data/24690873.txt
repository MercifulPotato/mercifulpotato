But older versions of excel (before office 2007) used .xls files and had a limit of 65,536 rows.<p>I could easily see them exceeding this limit, if they were using an older version of excel.<p>Alternatively, even the new versions of excel enforce the 2^16 row limit if working on a .xls file instead of a .xlsx file.')
