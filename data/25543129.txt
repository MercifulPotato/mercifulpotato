Allowed government to track cell phones for quarantine and case tracking. This has turned out to be highly effective, without requiring a total authoritarian government. Even though I&#x27;m usually very much pro privacy, IMO with sufficient checks and limitations in place such a law is very effective - I&#x27;d gladly give up privacy in case I was tested positive or have traveled abroad in exchange of not needing any lockdowns and live normally otherwise.')
