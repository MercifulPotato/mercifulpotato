Item(by='kstenerud', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603902267, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24918927, text='&gt; Suppose it&#x27;s the early 1990&#x27;s and you&#x27;re James Gosling implementing String.substring(int, int) for the first time. What should happen when the index arguments are out-of-range? Should these tests pass? Or throw?<p>It depends entirely on what the rules of the API are. Function signatures in most languages lack any form of compiler enforcement of rules, so you must implement them in code, and then list the rules in the function&#x27;s description. The strictness you apply doesn&#x27;t matter as much as your description of what argument range is allowed, and how the behaviour is affected.<p>For example, substring could allow overshoot with the description &quot;If the substring would go beyond the end of the string, the remainder of the string is returned&quot;.<p>What you should be concentrating on is the 80% use case of your API. What will 80% of your users need? If the lack of length overshoot support would be cumbersome to the 80%, you support overshoot. If it&#x27;s useless to the 80%, you leave it out. You can also implement things as layered APIs, with more general lower level functions, and then higher level functions that are more strict. Then the 20% can use the lower level functions for their esoteric use cases, and the 80% can stick to your easy-to-use and hard-to-screw-up high level API.')
