You are looking for something for entrepeneurs in holland ideally. These usually have a price of admission like $300&#x2F;yr but can be worth every cent<p>For example, ecommercefuel is fantastic for ecomm sites. Mastermind may have something to offer for your geography.  Its going to boil down to reputation and how much you put in too.<p>You need a forum of entrepeneurs for people that are dealing with the same issues as you: payroll issues, VAT issues, engineering best practices, accounting advice, dealing with fraud, chargebacks, churn prevention, sales , banking contacts, brand registration and protection, outsourcing copy, and most importantly, advice on how to hire key staff<p>As you can see, its a lot. You need a whole village to figure that out. I am not sure whats out there for EU virtual &quot;villages&quot; for SaaS, but HN may be able to help.<p>From one entrepr3neur to other: if you dont have a crm already for sales leads, and your sales cycle is not self serviced, try the streak plugin for gsuite.<p>Good luck.')
