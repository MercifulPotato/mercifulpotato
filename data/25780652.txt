People need to understand this because most of his voters are not the radical MAGA people.  If those voters don&#x27;t believe they have a voice now, and arguably they don&#x27;t have that voice, that increases the chances of more fractionation, more violence, and so on.<p>They should be pissed, by the way.  They&#x27;ve either lost their jobs or had to continue delivering food or whatever <i>during a pandemic</i> for the white collar workers whose jobs are primarily nonsense.  Society rewards people who invent problems, the digital duct tapers who fix those problems, the countless managers and supervisors to wrangle those duct tapers, and governance structures like Human Resources, but pays shit for actual work.  Even if you are white collar, depending on what you&#x27;re doing you may get paid only modestly if you&#x27;re solving a real problem.<p>Something in us is telling us that we can&#x27;t allow actual problems to be solved because, if we solved them, we&#x27;d all be out of things to do.  And that&#x27;s one problem we don&#x27;t know how to fix.')
