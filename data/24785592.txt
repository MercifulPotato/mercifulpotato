On Mac (work), I use cmd+space (Spotlight) to open apps, ctrl+` to open up a terminal dropdown, and maybe some Finder here and there. On Windows (leisure) I just use the windows key (open start menu, focuses on the search key) to open up things, and usually it&#x27;s one of the game launchers (e.g. Steam).<p>The OSes are not in my way right now. If anything, I want app builders to move away from web technologies. Steam should be a native app. I suspect the main reason that we don&#x27;t see more native apps is that the native UI toolkits are limited in their design options &#x2F; freedom.<p>I wonder if there&#x27;s work being done to compile web apps into something that improves performance. WASM is one step I guess, but that&#x27;s only the &#x27;executable&#x27; part of it; we need something similar for the DOM + styling. Or Electron &#x2F; Chrome should do more aggressive (and persisted) optimizations.')
