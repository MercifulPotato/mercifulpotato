That seems very analogous to permitted organizing activities such as using your employers email system to organize or posting on a cork board.<p>&gt;  they baked an unnecessary ignored message into the encoded stream (about whatever) there should be repercussions for lack of good judgement.<p>Would you be fired? I&#x27;m not so sure. It is pretty obvious that this firing was not unrelated to the messaging.<p>I&#x27;m glad that the <i>very conservative</i> interpretation of labor law that most on HN seem to believe is not the reality of labor law in the US, although more should still be done.')
