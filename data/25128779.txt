When I&#x27;m guessing how long something will last, I guess it&#x27;s about halfway through its life unless I have really good information to the contrary. Intel was founded in 1968, so let&#x27;s say it will shut down in 2072 (give or take...many...years). And Fortune 500 companies don&#x27;t seem to totally shrink back to startup head count and revenue even when they go bankruptâ€”they might have significant revenue but even more expenses. So it seems pretty reasonable to guess Intel will be around with (at least) $20B of revenue in 2060, in spite of their rough patch today.')
