But, just like HTTP can be, and is, used for much, much more than serving HTML, Gemini should be able to be used for as many other purposes as possible without compromising the simplicity and privacy criteria above. This means taking into account possible applications built around non-text files and non-human clients.<p>Lots of documents and books contain passages in other languages, it&#x27;s reasonably common -- I don&#x27;t get why people are saying this is a niche concern. Books get around that problem because they have controls around presentation, and they&#x27;re not designed to be consumed visually, not as a semantic, parseable format. But Gemini, at least in theory, is designed to be parseable.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gemini.circumlunar.space&#x2F;docs&#x2F;faq.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gemini.circumlunar.space&#x2F;docs&#x2F;faq.html</a>')
