The question is, does the barber shave himself?</i><p>If the answer is &quot;no&quot;, then he&#x27;s shaved from another barber and the problem is solved. Nowhere is stated there&#x27;s only one barber in the world.<p>Tattoo artists don&#x27;t tatoo themselves but they&#x27;re not living paradoxes. How is this different?<p>Again, I&#x27;m sorry for the obvious elephant in the room I keep missing.<p>EDIT: I see your answer to <i>sumtechguy</i>, I understand now it&#x27;s more metaphorical than pratical. In my understanding, the paradox seems to arise when you try to put all your existing elements to fit one of 2 kind of boxes, which are clearly not enough.')
