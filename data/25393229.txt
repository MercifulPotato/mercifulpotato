Do you think Austin is a republican area? Austin is about as blue as it can get.<p>No one is leaving Democratic states to go to some hell-hole Republican area. They are leaving Democrat cities to live in OTHER Democrat cities, the only difference between cost of living. That&#x27;s it, simple as that. It has nothing to do with &quot;wokeness&quot; etc. It&#x27;s basically, Austin cheap, San Fran expensive.')
