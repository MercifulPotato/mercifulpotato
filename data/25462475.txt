To motivate the question a short quote from Wikipedia:<p>&quot;For longer targets such as chromosomes, common approaches consist of cutting (with restriction enzymes) or shearing (with mechanical forces) large DNA fragments into shorter DNA fragments. The fragmented DNA may then be cloned into a DNA vector and amplified in a bacterial host such as Escherichia coli. &quot;<p>Two questions:<p>1) OK, we cut up the DNA and replicate it. How in the heck do we assemble the pieces together to restore the original ordering? I&#x27;ve got three pieces A,B,C. How do I know it was originally ABC or CBA or BAC etc? I can correctly sequence a piece ... but what I want is the sequence of all base-pairs in their original order. How on earth do they do that?<p>2) DNA spends most of its time wrapped up around histones. How do does one get it off the histones for access to sequencing?<p>3) Less interesting: unless we sequence the whole chromosome researches must pick off a piece ... how do we know which piece to pick off and how do we know where it&#x27;s crammed around the histones?')
