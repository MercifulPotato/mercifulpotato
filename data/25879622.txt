Take it as you will.<p>-<p>They&#x27;re also ignoring the fact the &quot;deplatforming thing&quot; has recently kicked into high gear because of a certain set of events<p>This would be like someone from the Branch Davidians saying &quot;We&#x27;ve always felt persecuted&quot; in March 1993.. there were, but also a little thing happened with 4 ATF agents the month before!<p>That&#x27;s the point being brought up, those events are very relevant if you&#x27;re talking about deplatforming today. You don&#x27;t brush such a major occurrence under the rug if you&#x27;re arguing in good faith.<p>-<p>Even them saying it ramped up in &quot;around 2018&quot; is disingenuous. It ramped up with Trump and his actions.<p>And there was as a lot of gnashing of teeth over if that was right, if Trump was actually building a hateful support base or if this was just political lynching...<p>And then the Capitol breach occurred and removed all doubt and now we see it accelerating.<p>-<p>Also you read the sibling comment, you should have realized it makes the last part of your comment complete non-sequitur... sometimes it&#x27;s a useful sign the argument being made just lacking self-awareness')
