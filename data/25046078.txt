To do that you need:<p>1. All cryptographic keys controlled by the users.<p>2. Some way to confirm you are actually connected to who you think you are connected to.<p>3. A way to confirm that the code you are running is not leaking keys&#x2F;content.<p>So Zoom failed on all 3 points. There are lots of things out there claiming E2EE that fail on one or more of these points. Almost all fail on point 2 unless the user does things that they almost never do. Is the FTC going to come up with a E2EE definition for trade and start prosecuting those that don&#x27;t meet that definition? Otherwise it would seem unfair that they only went after the entity that ended up in the general media.')
