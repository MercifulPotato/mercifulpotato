I started playing around with it when I got tired of Mint failing to connect to 1 of my accounts and it lacked support for several others. My primary drive to use Mint was to have 1 place to view all of my accounts. The analytics to show spending on groceries vs restaurants was a nice-to-have.  I&#x27;d never been fully comfortable with the security model but I didn&#x27;t have much money at the time.<p>If I had to summarize my favorite features I&#x27;d say:<p>1) Strong support for multiple currencies&#x2F;commodities including cost-basis,historical-market,current-market price conversions.<p>2) Advanced reporting options to support various filters,  mutations, conversions, outputs. One of my favorite reports is total net worth in CAD converted using latest market prices<p><pre><code>  ledger bal Assets -V -X CAD\n</code></pre>\nAnother might be top expense accounts in decreasing cost:<p><pre><code>  ledger bal Expenses -H -X CAD --flat -S -T\n</code></pre>\n3) Error detection: by enforcing double-entry accounting it has helped me identify hidden fees. It also helps when I make a mistake balancing a transaction.<p>4) Better than 2 decimal precision. This helps with crypto where your crypto balances can look something like 1.23456789 BTC')
