Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=[25192320], score=None, time=1606163156, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25189415, text='I&#x27;m quite familiar with your comments here, I consider myself a fan (I too can be controversial).<p>But my disagreement in this specific case is the accuracy of your description.  In your prior comment, you seemed to be evaluating HN on an absolute basis, whereas this one seems to be mostly on a relative (to MetaFilter) basis.<p>Indeed, HN is one of the best forums going, even as its popularity has grown which makes moderation difficult.  That said, common descriptions of it bordering on perfection (mild hyperbole) seem innacurate to me.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m probably the only woman to have ever spent time on the leader board of HN, so I&#x27;m sort of a unique minority here and for that reason I make some effort to some degree to quietly let people know that I sincerely believe that HN is a place where you can get past your minority status if you will make an effort to read the guidelines and follow the guidelines, even when it feels like you are being ganged up on and have a minority view.<p>Might this depend on <i>which</i> minority status you hold?  If not, then does that not suggest some form of ~perfection &amp;&#x2F;or consistency in bias?  I don&#x27;t think it would shock too many people to discover that a forum frequented by hackers and silicon valley type are neutral to pro-equality when it comes to gender differences.  This notion seems to align quite nicely with any news stories I read.  But does it also follow (both logically and observationally) that this lack of bias <i>necessarily</i> holds for other dimensions, like political leanings?<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not easy because you do need to keep following the guidelines...<p>This depends to some degree on who you are and what you say.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m okay with you chalking this up to &quot;personal opinion and she can&#x27;t prove it.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not chalking it up to that, I was simply pointing out that you were describing HN in a manner that is literally not possible without access to significant quantities of voting data.<p>My issue is not so much the bias around here, that I can live with - it&#x27;s the widespread refusal to acknowledge that it (and other portions of reality) exists.  Sometimes it gets rather absurd, imho.<p>&gt; The membership here will take you to task and demand you support your ideas with something substantive, but if you can meet that standard, the social climate here is not actually the usual BS where you get banned for making people uncomfortably aware that they are merely prejudiced assholes. People here will consider your minority view if you can adequately support it.<p>I believe my comment history suggests things are not always as rosy as reflected in your personal experience.<p>But worry not, I&#x27;m not losing a whole bunch of sleep over it.  It is a very valuable learning experience, for my purposes.  It&#x27;s simultaneously depressing, and motivating.')
