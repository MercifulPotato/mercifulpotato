Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607824702, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25403371, text='<i>&gt; The paradox claims that the sky should appear bright, which I take to mean that a detector should be receiving light from each point in the sky at each moment in time.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think this is required for the paradox. All that is required is that the <i>average</i> flux of radiation received from the sky as a whole should be constant, and equal, roughly speaking, to the flux corresponding to the surface brightness of a star. That will still be true, under the specified conditions of the paradox (a universe in steady state and infinitely old) even if quantization is taken into account.')
