Someone&#x27;s gonna be nostalgic enough for the NTSC&#x2F;VHS look someday, to pay top dollar for original hardware.<p>Anyway, I noticed something about the parent comment that I missed earlier -- &quot;for timing purposes&quot;. Huh, like I guess the concept of genlock probably still exists, and they&#x27;re probably passing around a test pattern or black frame or something just as a common sync reference signal?<p>(For similar reasons, a lot of telecom gear uses a 1.544Mbps &quot;all ones T1&quot; signal for sync, even if there isn&#x27;t a real T1 circuit anywhere.)')
