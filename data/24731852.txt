I have to have a server which has to be capable of transforming data to valid HTML snippets which are aware of the context they&#x27;ll be put into, a client which is capable of listening to clicks and then putting some data or snippets in some context it has to be aware of, and I have round-trips for everything even though I have a stateful client, and it&#x27;s best if that stateful client is an orchestrator for remote systems which can somehow inject interactivity into my stateful client.<p>It&#x27;s spaghetti architecture and I don&#x27;t see what the gain is. Why do my servers need to know how to describe my layout!?')
