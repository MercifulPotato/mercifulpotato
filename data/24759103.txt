Please point out any egregiously incorrect numbers.<p>Price difference between smaller car and larger car: $15000<p>Lifetime of car: 8 years<p>Frequency the larger car is needed: once per month<p>Additional time to pick up and drop off rental: 3 hours<p>Money saved per hour: $52<p>So it seems that if someone values their time more than ~$50&#x2F;hour, they should buy the larger vehicle.<p>Edit: Forgot to take into account the rental fee: $150<p>Money saved per hour: $2<p>It looks like it doesn&#x27;t make sense to rent, as buying would allow the convenience of using the larger vehicle any time, especially if it is more than once a month.')
