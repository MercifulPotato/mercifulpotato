Item(by='avmich', descendants=None, kids=[25681017], score=None, time=1610074625, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25680747, text='&gt; As far as solar goes, clearly coal is cheaper than solar in Nigeria because that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re mostly building now.<p>If we want to find out what&#x27;s cheaper in order to decide what it is more reasonable to build, we can&#x27;t rely on the fact that something is actually being built as an argument. It&#x27;s the other way around - first we decide what&#x27;s better, then do it, otherwise whatever we do would be right since we&#x27;re doing that.<p>Or - in this case - if you assume that those calculations were made and it was found that the coal is cheaper - and that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re building coal plants - then there is a question of discrepancy (coal is more expensive lately than solar according to &lt;sources&gt;), which needs to be addressed, otherwise it might be assumed that a mistake was made.<p>&gt; Regulations and subsidies are what make solar cheaper than coal in the US.<p>Doesn&#x27;t coal industry also receive subsidies, and aren&#x27;t those subsides comparable or bigger than subsidies for solar? I&#x27;m not sure; are you?')
