You wouldn&#x27;t say that a leaf floating on a lake is swimming, and likewise, claiming that computers are &quot;learning&quot; or &quot;intelligent&quot; is at best a thin analogy and at worst a mischaracterization of the process.\nWhat&#x27;s happening in my brain is something we don&#x27;t have full scientific knowledge of, but we know it&#x27;s not x86 machine code. While the two processes may be in many ways similar, conflating the two into this ill-defined concept of &quot;intelligence&quot; is a discussion about semantics more than anything else.')
