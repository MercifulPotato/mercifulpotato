Just the opposite has been true.”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spectrum.ieee.org&#x2F;energy&#x2F;policy&#x2F;electricity-its-wonderfully-affordable-but-its-no-longer-getting-any-cheaper" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spectrum.ieee.org&#x2F;energy&#x2F;policy&#x2F;electricity-its-wond...</a><p>this is the reality<p>“Before the year 2000, when Germany embarked on its large-scale and expensive Energiewende (energy transition), that country’s residential electricity prices were low and declining, bottoming at less than €0.14&#x2F;kWh ($.13&#x2F;kWh, using the prevailing exchange rate) in 2000.”<p>“By 2015, Germany’s combined solar and wind capacity of nearly 84 gigawatts had surpassed the total installed in fossil-fueled plants, and by March 2019 more than 20 percent of all electricity came from the new renewables. However, over an 18-year period (2000 to 2018) electricity prices more than doubled, to €0.31&#x2F; kWh. The E.U.’s largest economy thus has the continent’s highest electricity prices, followed by heavily wind-dependent Denmark, at €0.3&#x2F;kWh.”<p>and finally,<p>“A similar contrast can be seen in the United States. In California, where the new renewables have taken an increasing share, electricity prices have been rising five times as fast as the national mean and are now nearly 60 percent higher than the countrywide average.”')
