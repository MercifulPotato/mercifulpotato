(I now consult on this stuff)<p>Picking in store has a huge number of cost base efficiencies compared to using a &#x27;dark store&#x27;. These are as follows:<p>* Reduced property costs and property overhead.<p>* Having 5 vans in 300 locations is better than having 300 vans in 5 locations from a transport perspective (you get much closer to the customer, or have to tranship through hubs).<p>* Depending on locale, store workers may have more relaxed terms and conditions and unionisation than industrial warehouse workers, which &#x27;warehouse&#x27; workers may get dependent on setup.<p>* Every darkstore you have needs to be fully stocked. This isn&#x27;t so much of an issue with long-life products, but is an issue with fresh products that need to be sold before their expiry. A darkstore has a &#x27;minimum viable size&#x27; with these fresh products dependent on the range you want to offer. Bigger darkstore with more customers means a bigger range - but you are also further away from the customer so either you have a bigger stem distance or need to do trunking to hubs and tranship from there.<p>So it&#x27;s not about getting wise, trust me we think about these things and will model what is the most optimum way to deliver, at least in the UK :) An incredibly rough rule-of-thumb of logistics in the UK is that 1&#x2F;3 of your money is spent on transport, 1&#x2F;3 is spent on warehouse labour and 1&#x2F;3 is spent on fixed costs (building, rent, utilities, equipment) - so your saving on labour has to be significant to pull back the fixed cost benefit of running out of an existing retail estate.<p>This is in the UK - most supermarkets have <i>their own</i> in-store pickers and will deliver with vans in the back. We have one company (Occado) that has a few large DC&#x27;s and will tranship to outbases with vans. Some supermarkets have these dedicated &#x27;darkstore&#x27; facilities in super-dense areas (e.g. Tesco, Asda), but they don&#x27;t work in most areas of the country and in most cases are actually more expensive to run than in-store picking operations (they are done for capacity reasons rather than cost reasons).<p>The <i>advantages</i> of the centralised approach tend actually to be about service. If I can centralise to a big enough warehouse, I can offer a better range and offer things like visibility of expiry dates.')
