Item(by='Zak', descendants=None, kids=[24757605], score=None, time=1602520896, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24755863, text='I&#x27;m a free speech absolutist in that I think governments should not be able to punish speech outside of direct and imminent attempts to induce others to commit crimes, false reports of dangerous situations that imminently cause real dangerous situations, and the like.<p>I don&#x27;t extend that to private platforms. Facebook should be free to host or not host whatever it likes, arbitrarily. What&#x27;s becoming problematic is that the algorithms of tech giants now dominate content discovery. If Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, and Reddit decide something is bad, that something will probably have trouble gaining traction.<p>Most of us, me included probably think attempts to color the perception of historical events to serve racist ends are bad, and do not want them to gain traction. That does not, however mean that I want Facebook to have the power to decide what ideas get traction. I&#x27;d like to see online content discovery grow more decentralized again, and I think using algorithms optimized for something other than maximizing engagement will probably tend to reduce extremist content without much active intervention, but I don&#x27;t know how to get there from here.')
