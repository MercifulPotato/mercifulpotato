Item(by='yason', descendants=None, kids=[25870806], score=None, time=1611306553, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25862943, text='&quot;- When art galleries charge admission, patrons feel the need to &quot;get their money&#x27;s worth&quot; so they rush to see as much of the exhibits as possible, without taking time to thoroughly enjoy anything.&quot;<p>Where I live there&#x27;s an annual subscription that&#x27;s valid for the majority of museums countrywide. The museums get the money in some proportion to how they were visited but the annual cost is fixed for one citizen. So, if you want, you can visit the same (or a different!) museum every day and look at just one painting or piece at a time.<p>This has both increased the income for museums but also number of visits. Sounds like a good model for financing the upkeep of museums.')
