I&#x27;ve averaged my 10k steps a day for almost a year now (actually averaged close to 11k in 2020 on a whole,but didn&#x27;t get consistent until mid-March), and, while I have lost weight, I just can&#x27;t get my diet under control. It&#x27;s quite frustrating, honestly, and stems form my lack of desire to meal prep.')
