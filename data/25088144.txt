You can hide implementation details with most ML module systems - eg. hiding the underlying type of `Node`. You can also make local definitions in the module private. It&#x27;s pretty challenging to get this stuff right - there&#x27;s lots of research about it.<p>Also, as noted in other comments, Zig&#x27;s type parameters are also dynamically typed. This leads to implementation details leaking out. This is not an issue in OCaml and other ML-style languages.')
