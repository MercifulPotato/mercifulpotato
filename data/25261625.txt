Normally you wouldn&#x27;t start manufacturing a vaccine before you know it at least works in animals.  You also wouldn&#x27;t _simultaneously_ vaccinate the 30000 people needed for phase 3 data.  The Moderna study has over 100 study locations [1].  A normal vaccine trial might have 10-20.  With that number, it takes much longer to get the same number of people in the study.  Given the virtually unlimited financial resources coming from the government, they were able to conduct the study, as well as begin manufacturing, in record time.<p>All the vaccine trials are following participants for over 2 years, at which point many of the 1-in-10000 effects should be known.  If you look at previous problematic vaccines [2], most rare side effects (&gt; 1-in-100000) were only seen after MILLIONS of innoculations, meaning you only see them in Phase 4 (post-approval) studies as they are extremely rare.  Given the high case fatality rate of COVID-19 [3], the risk of an unseen extremely rare reaction is much lower than the risk of dying from COVID-19, so general speaking, you should get vaccinated.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clinicaltrials.gov&#x2F;ct2&#x2F;show&#x2F;NCT04470427#contactlocation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clinicaltrials.gov&#x2F;ct2&#x2F;show&#x2F;NCT04470427#contactlocat...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccinesafety&#x2F;concerns&#x2F;concerns-history.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccinesafety&#x2F;concerns&#x2F;concerns-history....</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;mortality-risk-covid" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;mortality-risk-covid</a>')
