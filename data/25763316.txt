The beauty of a chat, rather than an email thread, is that each message contains (or should) a single point. Which means the chat thread is more of a sequence of the following kinds of responses: Yes, and; Yes, but; No, and further; No, but.  This makes for a better conversation, and makes it easier to process.  How many times have you asked two questions in an email, only to have someone respond to just the last one?<p>&gt;<i>2) context -- email threads are saved (and indexed) in the context of their thread.</i>\n&gt;<i>With chat, you really don&#x27;t get ether, so it&#x27;s significantly more difficult. You can never really know what a message is a reply to...</i><p>This is a matter of implementation, not technical capability. A decent context is achieved through proper use of tags and chronological ordering. Better threading can be achieved through a protocol implementation of a reply-id capability, which most chat systems have (XMPP, Discord, etc.), coupled with GUI presentation of messages in a threaded view.<p>&gt;<i>...Responses can come fast or slow...</i>\nTrue of any asynchronous channel, email or chat.<p>&gt;<i>Individual channels can have multiple conversations happening, if not simultaneously, then at least over time.</i><p>I see this as a feature, not a bug. With tagging a chat message can be part of several different conversations at the same time, even across channels. Which conversation you are presented with depends on which tag you are viewing.<p>&gt;<i>I mean, that&#x27;s the difficulty with any system... getting people to use it. If your team can be disciplined about the tags, then I&#x27;m glad that works for you. I not sure it would work well in many other contexts.</i><p>In my experience, this is often the biggest hurdle in implementing any revolutionary system (as opposed to evolutionary) that makes a big change in how people do things.  For messaging, there are systems with a reminder feature similar to most email client&#x27;s behavior when there&#x27;s no subject. For instance, &quot;This message has no tags. Messages are required to have at least one tag, and should have between 2 and 7&quot;.<p>You need management to force the issue though. An approach I&#x27;ve used in the past is to find a competitor or two using the technology, and use business&#x2F;financial FOMO as a motivator.<p>Also, if you do a typo in an email..it&#x27;s there forever. A typo in a chat can be fixed in many systems.<p>In a desire to be fair, I will add two reasons to use email:<p>1) If you are doing CYA. Email can&#x27;t be changed, and is routed through a number of servers, possibly leaving log fingerprints. Email also has bcc. Anything that is important you can bcc to a second friendly party to prove you sent it, or to a personal email account (do this with trade secrets, or heaven forbid - classified - and you should get what you deserve, and I don&#x27;t mean in a good way). If you want a paper trail, don&#x27;t use chat.<p>2) If you are sending a document. Most businesses have virus scanners built into their email server software. A document is typically sent, retrieved, and saved somewhere. Though, if a document will be referenced often by many, neither chat nor email are best. Use a wiki, or something similar.')
