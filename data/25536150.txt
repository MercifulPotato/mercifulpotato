There is signal in your poll about parity, but there&#x27;s a lot of noise there too. Figuring our what the signal is is very hard.<p>You&#x27;re writing isn&#x27;t elitist here, but I think it moves very quickly up the ladder of stasis in an unjustified way (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;owl.purdue.edu&#x2F;owl&#x2F;general_writing&#x2F;the_writing_process&#x2F;stasis_theory&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;owl.purdue.edu&#x2F;owl&#x2F;general_writing&#x2F;the_writing_proce...</a>).<p>At my school we&#x27;ve been trying to sort out this phenomenon for about five years, and we&#x27;re still wrangling at the stasis of <i>definition</i>, with understanding the nature of what we see in our students. An example:<p>After I teach imaginary numbers, I give my students an (ungraded) assessment with these questions:<p>1. Please circle the imaginary numbers in this list. (about half imaginary)<p>2. Please perform the following multiplications. (mixed; about half imaginary x imaginary)<p>3. What is the definition of an imaginary number?<p>4. In your answers to question two, please circle all the products that are themselves imaginary numbers.<p>5. Is the product of two imaginary numbers imaginary? Why or why not?<p>We&#x27;ve never explicitly discussed #5, but its answers flows necessarily from the previous answers. What I&#x27;m really interested in is whether the answer to #5 is coherent with the answers to the previous four questions. I&#x27;d say for about a third of students it is not. For example, a student correctly wrote that i * i = -1, and correctly identified -1 as not imaginary, but then said for #5, &quot;Yes. Because when you multiply two imaginary numbers it doesn&#x27;t become unimaginary.&quot;<p>We see that play out in essentially every subject, and it&#x27;s gotten much more prevalent in the last, say, ten years. It&#x27;s especially noticeable in our 8th grade formal logic class, where a meaningful fraction of students appear unable to reason propositionally or syllogistically <i>at all</i>.<p>We have some ideas about what&#x27;s driving the change, but are still trying to figure out which of them are correct and what we can do about it. My personal theory is it&#x27;s something to do with syntax and semantics, with some students not associating meaning with words in the way that one would expect. It&#x27;s so hard to extract signal from the noise about that though.')
