Also, different Linux distros committing to shipping ARM images. Windows also somewhat supports it already, although not very well for now.<p>It would seem that ARM has a much higher potential performance ceiling than already relatively optimized x86 and derivatives and so once we have enough viable ARM options for desktop or high-performance laptops, the industry won&#x27;t have a choice but move along with it.<p>If you&#x27;re building software and your competitor releases ARM support and suddenly their product performs better than yours, users will go to them.<p>If videogame makers realize that they can push more performance on ARM, they will start releasing ARM-optimizing games or even shift to ARM-first in time.')
