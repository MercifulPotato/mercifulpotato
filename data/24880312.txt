In math, that means solving problems with it, etc.<p>I learned analysis a long time ago. Forgot most of it, despite applying it a lot.<p>I learned statistics <i>twice</i>, applied it, and still forgot most of it. The third time round I made flashcards and I haven&#x27;t forgotten much.<p>I studied a textbook on floating point arithmetic for work (mathematical - with theorems, etc). Because it was secondary to my main work, I would have gaps - sometimes for months, before I could return to it. Yet  whenever I did return to it, I could continue where I left off without reviewing much - because of flash cards.<p>Memory is useful.')
