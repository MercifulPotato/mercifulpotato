And the article provides scant evidence to support its (to me) extremely controversial framing of the world.<p>To start with, I think it&#x27;s complete bullshit that most work doesn&#x27;t require independent mindedness, or creativity. Or that most work is uncreative.<p>Second, I strongly question the assertion that independent mindedness is innate in any sense. I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s any strong evidence to support this statement, and believing it leads to some pretty dangerous attitudes to the world and other people.<p>Thirdly, and somewhat illustrative of my previous point, I am quite repulsed by the suggestion that most people <i>think</i> they&#x27;re free thinkers but aren&#x27;t. How the hell do you know and who are you to day?<p>I&#x27;m not interested in that obnoxious arrogance.<p>Yuck')
