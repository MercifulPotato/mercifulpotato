I have no idea where you&#x27;re getting your second sentence from.<p>Judging by your username as &quot;no tankies&quot; and reading your comment history I can see you have a keen interest in political arguments. In general comments that insert politically divisive issues into unrelated posts tend to be downvoted on HN, as yours was. This isn&#x27;t just a liberal bias thing, but happens when people bash Trump on posts that were previously not political. If you continue to post on HN I would encourage you to set politics aside, as they are almost always against the guidelines (see the &quot;guidelines&quot; link at the bottom of the page).')
