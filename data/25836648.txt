How we achieve that is essentially where people differ. The issue with big companies which contribute nothing or very little back to the ecosystem is the tragedy of the commons. Eventually, the number of people working on FOSS will dwindle and we won&#x27;t &#x2F;have&#x2F; FOSS alternatives or communities.<p>For the record, I don&#x27;t even think that AWS are the worst offenders. I&#x27;ve worked at places which refused to even contribute bug reports or patches to upstream systems.')
