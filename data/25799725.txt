Are &quot;powerful people&quot; disinclined to visit suffering upon Americans? Do you have a particular reason to suspect a particular cause? Do you have a particular reason to doubt other causes?<p>To be clear: I don&#x27;t know &quot;the cause&quot;. It seems likely that the appearance of the virus is a random natural event, but that likelihood hardly precludes other possibilities. The USA <i>response</i> to this hypothetically natural situation has differed sharply from those of other, seemingly more rational, nations. It seems likely that &quot;powerful people&quot; might have had a hand in that. For instance, their lobbyists ensured that the &quot;CARES Act&quot; provided trillions for rich people, but $1200 for normal citizens.')
