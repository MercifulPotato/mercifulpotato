So if a candidate sees all your engineers using a laptop that they don’t want to use, they’re likely to take that into consideration when deciding whether they want to work for you. Expensive laptops, free food&#x2F;drink, a gym, free massages, and all of those other perks you might find in software companies sound extravagant, but they’re such an easy and cost effective way to compete with other employers.')
