Cochlear hair cells get their name from hair-like structures called stereocilia that project from the surface of the cells; they don&#x27;t produce anything like the protein filaments that make up human hair.<p>A treatment that happened to have application to both male hair loss and hearing loss due to cochlear damage would be a really weird coincidence.')
