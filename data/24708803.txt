Congrats!<p>First thing I would request as a feature is a way to be notified when new durable products are added.<p>Another feedback: the name did not catch my memory yet. After going to the site I could not even remember the name of it when I wanted to go back once the tab was closed. Maybe show the website title in big letters or go fo a different name? (durable-products.com is available and maybe good SEO wise for example). AND we also know that &quot;buy for life&quot; will only match a very few products (like pans, but not socks most probably), durable might be more accurate.<p>Final feedback: I understand it&#x27;s not a commercial project, but why not? I think you can totally create affiliate links while still maintaining a high level of trust and independence. Plus the fact that many times I searched on your site where to buy the products. I had to open a new tab and google them :)<p>Good luck!')
