Linux does not cause hardware issues like this with any high frequency (of course it may occasionally, but any software will damage that hardware eventually). I&#x27;ve installed Linux, and helped others install Linux, on dozens of machines over my life. I&#x27;ve worked with others who install Linux on everything they touch. I&#x27;ve literally never heard of a story like this.<p>So it is POSSIBLE that Linux might have caused your issue. Your computer repair guy, however, is probably just wrong. And I would personally guess that your damage was due to power or environmental issues rather than Linux.')
