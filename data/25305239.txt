There have been rumours about Apple making their own modem, and presumably integrate it in an A-series SoC, but nothing yet.<p>A 5G modem is pretty complicated tech. I used to work on Nvidia&#x27;s Icera, but that&#x27;s gone now. A lot of chip makers have given up, and Qualcomm is the undisputed leader. MediaTek dominates in low-mid end Androids. I think Huawei &amp; Samsung both have something.')
