Ubuntu worked great out of the box, but the battery lasted about 4 hours. I don&#x27;t know if it was a hardware issue, but I tried everything and couldn&#x27;t get it to last more than 5 hours. Everything else was great though. I was running Rust compiles on large projects without a sound from the fan, and it stayed cool throughout.  Sucks that I had to return it because of the battery.')
