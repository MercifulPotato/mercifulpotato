If it doesn&#x27;t seem well researched, you can leave it be or ask for better confirmation.  Otherwise it helps you write better software.<p>Pull requests and patches are even better.  Someone has researched the problem and attempted a solution.  You can review that and see how it fits into your bigger picture.<p>There&#x27;s two little diseases in OSS.<p>1. Loud, bullying complainers who attempt to monopolize the communication channels, spamming mailing lists and chat rooms about their problems and refusing help with workarounds, etc.  These people are usually mediocre programmers or non-programmers.<p>2. Apathetic maintainers who may be working on little features they care about and not worrying about the quality of the project as a whole.  I remember the experience of patching an upstream project to the one I was working on and I could not, for the life of me, get the upstream project to care that they had a bug that made their software look bad.  They were actively maintaining the project but I suppose they weren&#x27;t focusing on that area.  That&#x27;s a real turn-off to helping them out in the future and leads to forks.')
