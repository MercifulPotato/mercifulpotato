And it&#x27;s tough to make that judgement when many US high schools treat college education like a necessity. Also important to remember that education debt is unique, it&#x27;s not dischargeable. Unlike any other type of investment debt, borrowers don&#x27;t have access to bankruptcy, meaning that an investment in education that doesn&#x27;t work out follows you around for life like an underwater mortgage you can&#x27;t be rid of.')
