I agree that tough meat doesn&#x27;t taste good, but I would argue a properly cooked pot roast is about the most tender cut of meat you can find.</i><p>Ribeye, lamb ribs, and lamb leg are all relatively tender. Beyond a certain point, I don&#x27;t need my meat to be that tender. Frankly, ribeye is probably too tender to be optimal for health and physique -- it would be better to develop that Chad-like jaw to eat something a more tough cut ...<p>Rare meat is not only juicier, but too me it tastes a lot better. Rare meat tastes good, the denatured proteins of pot roast do not taste good. And while there is a tremendous amount of social conditioning and idiosyncrasies that determine people&#x27;s tastes, I don&#x27;t think is just me -- most people eat their steaks plain, but almost everyone I know adds sauces and fixins to their pot roast and brisket and other meats that have been cooked forever. IMO, they ruin the meat with over cooking and then add in sugars and other flavorings to make it palatable.')
