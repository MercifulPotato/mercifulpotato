Item(by='pranaygp', descendants=1, kids=[25284825], score=2, time=1606964374, title='Windsor.io â€“ A User Feed Built for Founders', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hey HN,<p>I&#x27;m one of the founders of https:&#x2F;&#x2F;windsor.io. There are so many analytics tools out there to choose from, but when working on our previous project with 5 users at its peak, the graphs didn&#x27;t make any sense to look at. We wanted to see what each user was actually doing. It&#x27;s the same data that analytics tools had anyway, but just presented in a way that was more useful.<p>The first version was a CLI tool for ourselves - and now we have a fully fledged event feed. It looks a lot like Whatsapp or FB Messenger - A list of users on the left, a stream of messages&#x2F;events in the middle, and the users profile + other actions on the right. Everything is realtime. It&#x27;s kinda addicting to watch our users through Windsor everyday and see what they&#x27;re doing. It&#x27;s become the basis of all our conversations with users, our customer support, and now it&#x27;s even a daily ritual where I run through some of our segments everyday (new users who signed up, or churned users who opened an email I sent out).<p>I would absolutely love to see what HN thinks. I understand that all you really have to go off of is the landing page at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;windsor.io, but if you sign up for an invite there, I&#x27;ll get it out to you within the day so you have better feedback and hopefully a ton of value.')
