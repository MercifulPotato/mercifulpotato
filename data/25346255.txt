These headphones are way over-engineered even by Apple standards. There is no reason for headphones to have a gyroscope&#x2F;accelerator combination except to enable VR or AR audio in conjunction with their existing ARKit.<p>From my reading of the quoted paragraph, it appears these headphones will play system sounds (alerts, siri, etc) in such a way that they appear to emanate from the paired device - a very neat trick. If the headphones can do that then it is a short jump to making sounds appear to come from ARKit objects moving in real space.')
