(with fully managed ACME certificate management)<p>The tech stack is ASP.NET Core + Postgres on the backend. The frontend is written in C# and uses Blazor to run using Web Assembly. If someone is interested in taking a look, we are working on a hopefully helpful Developer Documentation (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.gatekeeper.page&#x2F;developer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.gatekeeper.page&#x2F;developer&#x2F;</a>)<p>The code on GitHub: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GetGatekeeper&#x2F;Server" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GetGatekeeper&#x2F;Server</a>')
