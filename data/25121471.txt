I find subject-verb-object interface another dimension of debate altogether. Usual it&#x27;s being mentioned by FP devs, since they are usually very aware of that aspect since they don&#x27;t get to use it. :D<p>It&#x27;s not only that SVO is more suited from linguistic reasons. Selecting the &quot;object&#x2F;doer&#x2F;subject&quot; first  is just a better UX in all sorts of human-interfaces (e.g. games). It allows narrowing down the context naturally, improving discoverability (like auto-completion). Big part of the reason why I switched from Vim to Kakoune.<p>Subject serves the purpose of being a mini namespace&#x2F;module and context for operations.<p>In a way, I blame FP community for being so stubborn in their mathematically-inclined notation, and not experimenting enough with trying to achieve similar human-friendly notation. But maybe I&#x27;m just missing all the historical attempts or something.<p>One of the most interesting spins on the topic is &quot;subject-oriented programming&quot; from Hoon (which is native PL for Urbit OS), where every expression is always evaluated in ever-present implicit subject context, and results in a new subject which will be used for the next expression.')
