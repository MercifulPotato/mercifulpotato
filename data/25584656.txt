She&#x27;s gathering evidence at the end to confirm her story and persuade others that it&#x27;s not a mass delusion (of which the mathematical discovery is a part).<p>In the movie Jodie Foster cries and says they have to take it on faith - basically the exact opposite of the book&#x27;s message.')
