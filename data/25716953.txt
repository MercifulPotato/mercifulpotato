Item(by='mlyle', descendants=None, kids=[25718765], score=None, time=1610299522, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25715718, text='&gt; The key word is usually immanent<p>I don&#x27;t know that word.  ;)<p>&quot;imminent lawless action&quot; and &quot;likely&quot; are the important words here.<p>Imminent lawless action here usually means there&#x27;s a specified timeframe (as clarified in Hess v. Indiana).  Given that many people are explicitly talking about January 18th and January 19th violent action, it&#x27;s hard for me to see how this standard isn&#x27;t met.  Daydreaming the overthrow of the government and murder of specific elected officials a week from now is not protected speech, especially when made credible by violent action a few days ago.')
