The closest cable run was about about two miles away. I guess if I was patient, the low speed DSL would have been fine until the virus hit and now everyone is at home watching zoom.<p>We limped by at first while we connected with the cable company&#x27;s engineering division. They scoped out a project to run cable the remaining way to our place down an existing set of power poles.<p>We paid for the project and if any of our neighbors tied into &quot;our&quot; run in the first few years they would have been forced to help offset the cost of our install. Once they started stringing line, the project was done in a few days including trenching near our house.<p>We get good internet now and we also run an AT&amp;T mini access point to boost our cell signal. We kept the DSL access as a backup. I have also put in for the StarLink beta program  but have not been called.')
