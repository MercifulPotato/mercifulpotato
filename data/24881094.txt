Also it&#x27;s only a tiny portion of Xinjiang.<p>For the Second, even if we consider it 100% true, it doesn&#x27;t really support the original claim from that interview article, in several ways:<p>1. It&#x27;s a small portion of Xinjiang, and the claim _implies_ that the whole Xinjiang was &quot;formerly East Turkestan before the Chinese invasion of 1949&quot;<p>2. The Second ETR was pro-communism, pro-Soviet, pro-CPC, and against the rest of Xinjiang that&#x27;s under RoC control. In 1949 CPC won the civil war against RoC (KMT), took control of all of Xinjiang. So I don&#x27;t see in anyway it could be claimed that China invaded ETR in 1949.<p>One thing I don&#x27;t understand is why do those condemn China&#x27;s treatment of Uyghurs have to add the (likely dubious) claim of China invaded Xinjiang in 1949. It&#x27;s not like doing a domestic (cultural) genocide is something &quot;better&quot; than invasion and genocide, so why add some dubious claim to your legitimate claim?')
