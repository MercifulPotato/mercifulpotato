It&#x27;s running production workloads - and at AWS scale, I&#x27;m fairly certain it&#x27;s running more work than most of us here ever touched in their career total. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;firecracker-microvm&#x2F;firecracker" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;firecracker-microvm&#x2F;firecracker</a><p>&gt; And they at least have PEPs.<p>Rusts language development has been guided by RFCs since like the beginning. There&#x27;s no comprehensive standard as in &quot;somebody went and wrote down the current state&quot;, but it&#x27;s also not the case that there&#x27;s no written spec of how things should behave. You could base a new compiler on that and there&#x27;s actually developments to have different backends to rustc. Cranelift for example <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bytecodealliance&#x2F;wasmtime&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;cranelift&#x2F;rustc.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bytecodealliance&#x2F;wasmtime&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;crane...</a><p>&gt; &quot;The Rust development team isn&#x27;t interested in supporting your obscure embedded architecture&quot; or &quot;sorry, this platform was phased out due to technical debt&quot; is what I mean by not serious.<p>So any compiler team that stops supporting some sort of architecture because it&#x27;s either rare or no longer worth the effort is not serious in your opinion? Like GCC, that has a decision making matrix for that? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gcc.gnu.org&#x2F;backends.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gcc.gnu.org&#x2F;backends.html</a> And dropped various architectures along the way?')
