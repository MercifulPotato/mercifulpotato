They donâ€™t sell my information, and they have an incentive to not change that.</i><p>I&#x27;m sympathetic to this, because I <i>do</i> think it&#x27;s great that Apple values user privacy.  But I think it&#x27;s unfortunate that the perception is that the only way to get that privacy is to use a heavily locked-down device that the user doesn&#x27;t actually have control over, and that the entity protecting your privacy has to impose strict restrictions on what you can do with that device.<p>Obviously Google will never be a good example of a company that protects user data and user privacy; their entire business model depends on the opposite.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean that the concept of a company selling a premium product that protects user privacy by default couldn&#x27;t also allow users to do whatever they want with their device.')
