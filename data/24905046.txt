The company that sold you will receive a payment of about half a year of your salary conditional on you staying on for some time post transfer. They will contractually be covered against you quitting and being hired by the company to which you were sold for some period as wel. This puts you at a disadvantage in renegotiation since you already are on contract as far as they are concerned. and asking for a raise, not a fresh recruit negotiating for a starting salary, and your recruiting costs through one of the more expensive channels are not renegotiable. Furthermore. what could have been an obvious great match new employer for you as a free agent has been taken off the table.<p>If you are ever in a position where you find out your current employer is looking to sell your team, and assuming you have an easy marketable skillet. it might be best to quit ASAP.')
