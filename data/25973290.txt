This resulted in murders of at least 53 people, including a highly gruesome lynching of a police officer.<p>Also again for context, as Kashmir internet ban keeps coming up in discussion, ni the 90s 500K minority (Hindu+Sikh) people were forced out of their houses in Kashmir, many of them still living in refugee camps. Thousands were murdered, thousands raped. This was coordinated using loudspeakers. I personally shudder to think what kind of genocide can be coordinated using Internet technologies. Especially when there are motivated, well funded enemies like Pakistan involved in both regions.')
