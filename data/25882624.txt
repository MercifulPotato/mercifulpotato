For example, I would expect violent criminal behavior to significantly increase one’s chance of being shot by police, and as I understand it, criminologists pretty much agree that black Americans commit violent crimes at considerably higher rates even than white Americans. And no doubt there are good reasons for why black Americans commit more crimes; legacy of systemic racism and all that, but that doesn’t suggest that they are dying due to police racism, which is the whole BLM thesis (ACAB and so on). Surely we would answer this question decisively and publicly before we would go marching through the streets and burning neighborhoods to the ground (or perhaps for those in the higher social classes, merely cheering on or justifying the violence—perhaps with miscontextualized MLK quotes—on social media)?')
