Conversely on MacOS if you need to do any of those things your only option is to use Finder which really sucks because you then have navigate to wherever you were in the app&quot; - I&#x27;m having trouble understanding what you mean here.<p>- Don&#x27;t get me started on sizes for accessibility reasons, that was partly why I had to switch elder friends to a mac after watching them suffer on windows.

Maybe the popularity of videoconferencing may help the FOSS world actually see how people work rather than just posting pictures of &#x27;screenshots&#x27; and battlestations.')
