They&#x27;re highly involved.<p>Melvin Capital isn&#x27;t just a GameStop short. It has billions of other assets. But not all of those are liquid. Margin calls require liquidity, and Melvin didn&#x27;t have many options other than fire selling the rest of their portfolio and taking a private bailout at exorbitant terms (but less egregious than the losses they would have incurred in a fire sale).<p>From Citadel&#x27;s perspective, why on earth would they assume the short positions? They&#x27;re in the red. That is Melvin&#x27;s investors&#x27; problem. The second-order problem, that of avoiding a fire sale of remaining assets, is what the bailout prevented.<p>With respect to Melvin, I&#x27;m blown away that these trades were executed as unhedged shorts.')
