If you have any opposite thoughts, yes thoughts, not actions, you can face real jail time. This can be a comment on Twitter, or even something you say in your neighbourhood, around friends, anything and anywhere. No cartoons, no essays, no personal blogs. You can have an pollice officer in your door knocking.<p>We have a big website called &quot;eksisozluk&quot; which motto was &quot;sacred source of knowledge&quot;, and now is filled with entries, posts regulated and restricted with court orders, deleted accounts, and also imprisoned users.<p>Turkey blocked Youtube, Wikipedia and such websites for a very long time. Paypal is still not operating. Even they seem not related, everything is related.
