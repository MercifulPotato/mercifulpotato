Not necessarily agreeing with FB&#x27;s act here, but this post and the way they connect their issue to a hot topic these days (small businesses) seems hypocritical and an attempt to make people sympathize with them. That&#x27;s not what&#x27;s happening here. They should instead talk about the entirety of their business (all their pages, not just a handful) and then claim it is a small business.')
