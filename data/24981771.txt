Not only does my CI not have to rely on third-party actions, it&#x27;s also extremely portable between CI providers, can be tested locally, and is infinitely more flexible.<p>(Apart from having run actions, the only other actions I use are the upload&#x2F;download-artifact ones to share binaries between jobs, and the matrix feature for parallelizing runs.)<p>But to be clear, the kind of vulnerability that the P0 issue is talking about is not necessarily from malicious actions. As the issue itself says, the vuln also happens from untrusted input being processed by a trusted action, like issues and PRs.')
