I may try making a few of these over the year for next hunting season, and place them in a mile or so radius from basecamp for the duration of my trip, anyways. That way we could split up but still maintain contact, get help if we shoot an elk, etc. We&#x27;re definitely outside direct walkie-talkie range, and I&#x27;m in the only one in the group with a HAM, so this could be pretty useful.')
