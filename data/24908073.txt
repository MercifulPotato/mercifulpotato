Linear maps are determined by their behavior on basis elements\n    2. The composition of linear maps is still linear\n</code></pre>\nTogether, this means you can work out how the composition of two linear maps affects the coefficients of each vector (relative to a fixed basis). If you do this, you get the &quot;formula&quot; for matrix multiplication.<p>Let V be an n-dimensional vector space. Let {e_1, e_2, e_3, ..., e_n} be a basis for V.<p>That means any v in V can be written<p><pre><code>    v = a_1*e_1 + a_2*e_2 + ... + a_n*e_n\n</code></pre>\nLet f: V → V be a linear map. Let&#x27;s see what it means to apply f to v. We have<p><pre><code>    f(v) = f(a_1*e_1 + a_2*e_2 + ... + a_n*e_n)\n         = f(a_1*e_1) + f(a_2*e_2) + ... + f(a_n*e_n)\n         = a_1*f(e_1) + a_2*f(e_2) + ... + a_n*f(e_n)\n</code></pre>\nIn other words, if we know the values of f(e_1), f(e_2), ..., f(e_n) then we can calculate the value of f(v) for any v.<p>Every choice of value for f(e_1), f(e_2), ... is valid and determines a unique linear map.<p>For n=2, use the standard basis where e_1 is (1,0) and e_2 is (0,1).<p>Write f(1,0) as (a,c) and write f(0,1) as (b,d). This is just &quot;relabeling&quot; the values f(1,0) — under the standard basis we know that f(1,0) looks like (a,c) for some values of (a,c).<p>Write v = (x,y) so that<p><pre><code>    v = (x, y)\n      = x*(1,0) + y*(0,1)\n      = x*e_1 + y*e_2\n</code></pre>\nThen we have:<p><pre><code>    f(v) = f(x, y)\n         = x*f(e_1) + y*f(e_2)\n         = x*f(1,0) + y*f(0,1)\n         = x*(a,c) + y*(b,d)\n         = (x*a, x*c) + (y*b, y*d)\n         = (x*a + y*b, x*c + y*d)\n</code></pre>\nOr written using matrix notation:<p><pre><code>    [ a b ] [x]   [x*a + y*b]\n    [ c d ] [y] = [x*c + y*d]\n</code></pre>\nSo that&#x27;s the &quot;formula&quot; for applying a matrix to a single vector. It&#x27;s determined entirely by the four values (a,b,c,d), but really it&#x27;s determined by the action of the map on the basis vectors.<p>Now let f,g be linear maps and calculate g(f(v)) in the same way. You&#x27;ll get the &quot;formula&quot; for matrix multiplication.<p>In other words, matrix notation, matrix multiplication formulas, etc. are &quot;just&quot; compact ways of representing the behavior of linear maps.')
