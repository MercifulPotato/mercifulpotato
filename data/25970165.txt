Perhaps a possible partnership with Apple could give them a much needed jump start since Apple thinks it wants to get into the Auto Industry.<p>But if Toyota&#x27;s miracle battery comes to fruition and meets expectations then that could be the real dark horse and make all but maybe Tesla the only real competitor anymore.<p>It&#x27;s very clear to see that other than some mainstays like the Charger&#x2F;Hellcat variants, a high end Cadillac SUV and Corvette GM don&#x27;t seem to be doing much in the ICE department worth staying in that game long term to keep the brand(s) alive and even the Hummer is being offered as an EV.<p>I&#x27;ve only been in a late model volt during a lyft and to be honest it all felt incredibly cheap, like a base model Jetta assembled in Mexico cheap. Nothing seemed to be remarkably good about it and the driver said he got under a 100 miles of range so he hung around the local college bars and charged on campus until the next hail, and while Teslas aren&#x27;t exactly amazing when it comes to interiors either, the Model 3 I drove months earlier was far superior.<p>I&#x27;d decry there bailout in 2008, but if they&#x27;re really taking EV seriously and the Biden administration is pushing for EV then maybe it was all worth it in the end for this perfect storm situation, as so much of GM&#x27;s lineup were mainly disposable cars that ended up in the scrap heap after 7-10 years due to unreliability. I will say their LTX V8s engines were being swapped in every imaginable chassis up until a few years ago, so they probably could just keep making crate engines and parts with existing infrastructure and still make a profit. Otherwise its game over for a ton of people who will need to buy multiple engines&#x2F;chassis just to keep one running until they pull a Cuba and create their own backyard OEM parts supplier alternative.<p>Edit: Mopar stuff is not Chrysler.')
