[...] they typically still don’t think they’re quite as good as people who, you know, actually are good.<p>This is just categorically false, and the chart linked not one paragraph above completely torpedoes it. The bottom quartile of people thought that they would perform at around the 57th percentile. They clearly expected to perform better than more competent individuals.<p>Perhaps the author meant to write &quot;not that [they] think they&#x27;re better than competent people do&quot;, which would be correct, but the rest of the conclusions seem to follow off of this flawed reading of the data.')
