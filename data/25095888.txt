I will do more testing on this one, but I should actually support this already. I do interpret everything down to the microsecond, so it should work quite fine.<p>I also support mixed source footage - even though I want to provide even more helpers on this front.<p>Having said that, I do allow even 240 fps as input, but right now I don&#x27;t output at more than 30 fps. The rationale has simply been that this will require heavy testing. Once I go live, this will definitely work ;)<p>Thanks again!')
