Item(by='tshaddox', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611795811, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25933746, text='&gt; Self-made just means that you made the money with your own effort as opposed to inherited it. There&#x27;s nothing in that comment that attempts to paint them as relatable.<p>I disagree. The point of the term is not to describe a financial technicality. If someone inherited $900m and worked really hard to earn another $100m, I think most people would be confused to hear them described as a self-made billionaire. On the other hand, of course, people wouldn&#x27;t tend to be confused if you described some billionaire as self-made if they grew up lower-middle-class and their parents gave them $100 when they turned 18.<p>So, yes, it&#x27;s not an &quot;all or nothing&quot; thing, but it is absolutely about conveying relatability to a certain audience. We can reasonably disagree about whether describing Bezos as self-made is appropriate for the HN audience, but I tend to think the $250k &quot;business loan&quot; from his parents should at the bare minimum accompany the inspiring anecdotes about making a desk from a door (which, from what I have read, was literally done to symbolize the imaginary need for extreme frugality).')
