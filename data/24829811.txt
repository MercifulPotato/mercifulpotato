In the background it compiles down to blaze-html and can be used together with e.g. forM_ (which we have aliased to forEach). It&#x27;s just a more familiar syntax on top of blaze html.<p>Ok, but then your users will write views without understanding what they&#x27;re doing. All the magic will make them feel confused and powerless when they do anything outside of the blessed path. They can&#x27;t extrapolate that forM_ works for any monad in the future.<p>&gt; The |&gt; just looks more beautiful to us :) Take a look at the gorgeous expressiveness of this<p>Agreed, I wish we all used |&gt; instead of &amp;, but that operator is called &amp; in Haskell. You&#x27;re crippling your users&#x27; ability to read other code-bases in the future. And that same code would be plenty readable with &amp;, don&#x27;t you agree? Your example doesn&#x27;t even show your operator, you&#x27;re replacing it with a unicode character. I could make vim do the same for &amp;.<p>&gt; Yes, IHP is the haskell framework for builders :-)<p>There&#x27;s so much more to &quot;building&quot; than the first month of development! Easing someone into the Haskell ecosystem is much more important than helping them get a CRUD app running that they don&#x27;t know how to customize. Haskell is an order of magnitude more productive for me than other languages (ruby), because of its differences.')
