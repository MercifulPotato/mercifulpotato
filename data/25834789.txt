Amazon benefited from Elastic&#x27;s open license, but so did Elastic. Being open source has greatly benefited Elastic&#x27;s own business and growth.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say that Amazon&#x27;s size and practices around open source aren&#x27;t cause for concern, just that Elastic come across as very disingenuous when they try to lay all the blame on Amazon while proclaiming how dedicated they are to &quot;openness&quot;.')
