Most developer jobs have been simplified, compared to pre-2000 development, that the knowledge conferred by a CS degree is indeed no longer required and knowledge of in vogue languages and frameworks is more immediately useful.<p>The rub is, of course, that creating those frameworks, language compilers, etc., still does require knowledge of CS.  Knowing how to operate a car is not the same as knowing how to design and build one.  As a person advances in their career, more and more deep knowledge is required and they may find themselves hitting a wall mid- to late in their career because they never acquired these fundamentals.  And, unlike tools, these fundamentals are built on each other so that one has to acquire one before going on to the next; you can&#x27;t just skim a book on compiler design without the prerequisite knowledge.<p>So, it&#x27;s kind of a gamble that their career trajectory is going stay in the space where they never need that knowledge.  It&#x27;s not necessarily a bad gamble either since there are always going to be such jobs but the risk should be understood by anyone intending to follow the poster&#x27;s advice.')
