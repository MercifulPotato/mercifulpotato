I mean, if you give engineers cloud computing resources equal to a few percent of the cost of having said engineer then you can do this easily. And why not give them that? 20 engineers and $100k worth of experimental cloud quota is worth a lot more than 21 engineers and very limited cloud quota, at least if they are working with data pipelines and such.')
