It&#x27;s very much the case of trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. The two don&#x27;t work all that well together, despite the pretty heroic work done by the webpacker team.<p>For an &quot;idiot proof&quot;, batteries included, zero config approach, I would try out Parcel: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;parceljs.org&#x2F;getting_started.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;parceljs.org&#x2F;getting_started.html</a> You just pass it an HTML file and it figures out what it needs to build from there. You can drop everything in &#x2F;public&#x2F; and it all just works without any additional installs or fiddling. It works with pretty much anything you might drop in as an asset, whether it&#x27;s via HTML tag or import statement.<p>As a close second, you can try esbuild: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esbuild.github.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esbuild.github.io&#x2F;</a> It&#x27;s coming along and already does a lot of what you might do with Parcel or Webpack, but is stupendously fast. Fast enough that you&#x27;d need to be shipping an obscene amount of code to the browser to have build times exceed 1 second. It&#x27;s a little more quirky right now, but I like it and appreciate the forward momentum it has right now.')
