In a one person one vote system, the concept of a state never comes into play. It is a national election, states are irrelevant.<p>Under the electoral college system, states actually come into play. There could be a case where a state grows large enough in population to get 51% of the electoral votes. If that state had a winner take all system, then that state would choose every president. It would 100% dominate, non of the other states would matter.<p>The electoral college is truly a terrible system, unless the founders wanted Florida to decide every election.')
