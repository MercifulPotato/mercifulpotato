He writes that he managed a team (that means other had to work), that he prefers team work (usually it means that someone else has to do the work).<p>Then he started with the classic: previous code is bad so I rewrite it from scratch.<p>Then came to a conclusion that his own code is bad and shouls be rewritten.<p>And only then author had another conclusion: it was unlcear how the product should work. So they hired an UX person. Then we learned that moving buttons around requires back end changes (wtf?)...<p>And then we learned that the author still didnt know how to make the main feature of the product.<p>My guess: if they hired another programmer the other person would code it in few days.<p>Author looks like a manager &#x2F; team player - someone who never did anything on their own.<p>Also I really loved the part about previous code being bad (classic) and rewriting everythig just to say that own  code is bad too and didnt move the project at all.\nI wonder what part of the solution even works. Probably nothing apart from login window.<p>Also the part where the author wrote that after coming back to previous work they had to do lots of frantic work... sounds like normal work. But author wasnt a manager anymore so the work had to be made: hence it was so painful. No more possibility to delegate the problem and do nothing all day. And real deadlines.')
