So just because it is made of plastic and can be used for the next 350 years, doesn&#x27;t mean I would enjoy using it for a single day.<p>Duration is just one aspect of a high quality product, but so is ease of use or overall functionality. High quality is what I want to buy. Nevertheless, I appreciate the undertaking to develop a platform that is not just about the price and has a higher goal in mind.')
