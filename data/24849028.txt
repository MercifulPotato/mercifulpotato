I feel like these objections about &quot;intrinsic value&quot; are missing the point.  There are lots of things out there that have little to no intrinsic value (like currency) that are nevertheless very useful.  You are acting like there is some inviolable law of the world where things without intrinsic value will inevitably become worthless, but there isn&#x27;t.  There&#x27;s lots of things with fundamentally no intrinsic value that have nevertheless commanded a very high market price for many centuries now.<p>I&#x27;m not saying Bitcoin is necessarily on that path, but there&#x27;s also no reason it <i>couldn&#x27;t</i> be, and whether it is or isn&#x27;t isn&#x27;t related to any intrinsic value it might or might not have.  And lots of things that do have intrinsic value, like grain, are terrible investments because they&#x27;re easy to make more of and because they don&#x27;t store indefinitely.  &quot;Intrinsic value&quot; is just an orthogonal concern.')
