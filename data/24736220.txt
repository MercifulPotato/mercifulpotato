You don&#x27;t seem to have an understanding of the issues, and your examples are so irrelevant as to be not even wrong.<p>Roughly, the way it &quot;should&quot; work is that if Company A and Company B are in the same industry, and Company A is more productive than Company B, free market forces cause Company A to pay more than Company B, thus improving their ability to compete for workers.
