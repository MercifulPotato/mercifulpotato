This, in theory, requires said investigators to be smarter than the perpetrators or at least somewhere on par. While these folks are paid really well on average... this isn&#x27;t &quot;fuck you money&quot; like on Wolf of Wallstreet. Even &quot;poor fuck you money&quot; is better than what they make. While I won&#x27;t dismiss the need for a lot of attorneys and accountants in their profession, 333 examiners doesn&#x27;t seem adequate against a $440k average salary industry with 176k employees 2018 numbers (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osc.state.ny.us&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;reports&#x2F;documents&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2018-11&#x2F;report-6-2019.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osc.state.ny.us&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;reports&#x2F;docu...</a>). Unless there&#x27;s much more overlap than I&#x27;m imagining.<p>I mean seriously, if you&#x27;re smart enough for the financial industry, you need to have a much higher moral code to take the less than half rate of average salary compared to the people you&#x27;re investigating. Which I&#x27;m not knocking. I always respect people who take a moral high ground stance and try to do some actionable good, especially if it&#x27;s at a detriment to their own wallet. It&#x27;s just, expectations need to tempered with their overall capabilities. On top, agreeing with you on structure, what kind of hell do some of these folks experience working in a government environment? How many get salty real fast and get all pissed off from the shit they deal with bureaucratic wise along with shitty pay compared to the industry&#x27;s employee?<p>There was a line from Burn Notice that I&#x27;ve always attributed to this, &quot;Fighting for the little guy is for suckers&quot;. So yea, can we all <i>really</i> trust the SEC? Maybe... but can you really blame them by too much regarding &quot;issues&quot; granted that most of any industry, especially tech &amp; finance, is about jumping to the next better paying job? I mean think of this scenario, &quot;You&#x27;re going to get fined no matter what happens today. But I can reduce it by half if a moving box full of cash magically appears on my back porch.&quot;')
