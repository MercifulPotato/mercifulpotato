The biggest baddest Intel and AMD microprocessor cores have 4 decoders, which means they can decode 4 instructions in parallel spitting out micro-ops.\n&gt; But Apple has a crazy 8 decoders. Not only that but the ROB is something like 3x larger. You can basically hold 3x as many instructions. No other mainstream chip maker has that many decoders in their CPUs.<p>&gt; You see, for x86 an instruction can be anywhere from 1â€“15 bytes long. On a RISC chip instructions are fixed size. Why is that relevant in this case?<p>&gt; Because splitting up a stream of bytes into instructions to feed into 8 different decoders in parallel becomes trivial if every instruction has the same length.')
