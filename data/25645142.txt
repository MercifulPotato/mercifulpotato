Selection bias applies.<p>Viruses grow by the millions, billions, and mutations occur frequently. This virus&#x27;s ancestor might have hopped around civets for months. Then, a few random mutations on one got lucky and made it really good at infecting humans. That&#x27;s when it made the leap. We don&#x27;t see the billions of attempts and mutations that sucked at infecting humans. We see the one that did.<p>Now, my own bias is that my honours thesis was on evolutionary algorithms and I spent a lot of time being amazed at how well random mutations can lead to optimal answers.')
