Why is it reasonable to conclude that all outdoor non-crowded areas are safe?<p>I assume that not all outdoor environments are created equal.  Variables like weather, wind, humidity, and population density probably all play a large factor in transmissibility.  Certainly, more than 2 samples are required before making such a generalized conclusion?')
