I don&#x27;t think it was my actual skills as I failed two out of three questions in one of the interviews. I&#x27;m not particularly smart either, just common sense and can hack things together.<p>I have a zoom interview soon, we will see how that goes, maybe I need to hold banana or something for scale.')
