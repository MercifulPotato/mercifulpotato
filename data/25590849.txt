And is globalism sustainable?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='It seems like much of the world has become Americanized either way. As if Rammstein&#x27;s song &quot;Amerika&quot; got its way. Companies adopting anglicisms ad infinitum instead of using native counterparts. Sometimes it gets so odd, that people start mixing English and their native language and speak in &quot;Naglish&quot; (I made that one up).\nYou also see the soft power influence that America has in non-American media. Think of Japanese games like Resident Evil. &quot;Leon S. Kennedy&quot;, or Snake from the Metal Gear Solid series. America seems to be a safe bet when it comes to designing art. Crysis is another example despite being a German-based company, the themes are American again.\nAmerican fast food chains wherever you go, American products, stores, holidays and company culture. However, while this is ongoing, the people (esp. older ones) haven&#x27;t really embraced the American mindset. Meaning, accepting and living with people of different backgrounds be it cultural or otherwise.\nAt this point I wonder whether each nation can become another \n&quot;Amerika&quot; on its own. I wonder if the whole globe can just become the United Continents of America or something.\nBut tribalism is a strong human instinct it seems, and it is a natural &quot;force&quot; by itself.<p>So is globalism for the long run? Or is it utopia?<p>The HN posts that sparked this submission:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19987462\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15242968<p>The intend is not to spark another &quot;Breitbart-esque&quot; tirade on this issue. Rather an honest, constructive &quot;Sam Harrisian&quot; discussion of this topic.')
