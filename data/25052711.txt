I&#x27;m certain that many dozens of those were involved in getting the current storage engine to a stable place. And now that hard work is on a path to being deprecated by moving to a completely new language and set of underlying technologies.<p>Taking the project from a handful of contributors to a production-ready technology within an existing ecosystem is a non-trivial task. I&#x27;m sure it will come together eventually, but the commitment to ship it &quot;early next year&quot; seems unlikely to me.')
