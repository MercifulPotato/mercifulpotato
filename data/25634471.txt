Item(by='SilasX', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609780611, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25634171, text='Okay there are two separate issues here:<p>1) I think it&#x27;s very unhelpful to speak in terms of &quot;not owing things&quot; to people and defending anyone whoever does the absolute minimum until they&#x27;re dragged kicking and screaming to extend the most basic courtesy. Part of being a decent human being is extending such basic courtesies to others <i>even when there&#x27;s no legal obligation to do so</i>, and, when an org doesn&#x27;t do that, it&#x27;s absolutely right to call them out on it.<p>2) If you&#x27;re right, that this only came after extensive negotiation in which FB did reveal their objections, then yes, it&#x27;s fair to call the advertiser out on <i>that</i>, for misrepresenting what explanation FB gave him.<p>Edit: Also,<p>&gt;With regards to this, my point was that Facebook doesn&#x27;t want to get into a long drawn out discussion with whataboutisms and splitting hairs on policy.<p>That&#x27;s not relevant, because FB can recognize when they&#x27;re making a judgment call; my point was just that it&#x27;s courteous to at least recognize when you&#x27;re doing so.')
