I enjoy content co-produced with ARTE like documentaries, but all of that has zero retention.<p>German public broadcasting laws do prohibit them from storing their content for an indefinite time, which the private media industry lobbied for as they feared public broadcasters would build massive libraries &quot;distorting the market&quot;. This even applies to publicly funded news portals like Tagesschau [0] where articles will often be deleted after a year or ARTE documentaries that are only streamable for like 3 months, to then vanish in distribution&#x2F;publisher limbo for sometimes years before they can be <i>bought</i>.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tagesschau.de&#x2F;inland&#x2F;rundfunkaenderungsstaatsvertrag108.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tagesschau.de&#x2F;inland&#x2F;rundfunkaenderungsstaatsver...</a>')
