I&#x27;m struggling to think of any other customer-facing job where that would be acceptable.  This is like suggesting that it&#x27;s fine if a waiter throws your meal in the trash and refuses to comp you because you complained that it was taking too long.  They would be fired on the spot, for the crime of slightly inconveniencing you!<p>Also, there were FOUR cops there.  Are you trying to suggest that an experienced cop, with three other cops present, was afraid of one guy who was supposedly so incapacitated that he was actively dying before even being subdued?')
