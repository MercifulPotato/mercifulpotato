Any trader whose strategy is closer to optimal will have larger profits over time and come to own a larger and larger fraction of the market. Though saying that out loud makes me realize optimal doesn&#x27;t have to mean buying and selling according to true value.  Optimal would in fact be predicting the behavior of other participants and trading off those predictions.  I still think certain events ground value though: bankruptcies, mergers, and dividends attach a real cost&#x2F;gain to holding a stock.')
