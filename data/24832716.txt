And there are some examples of excellent desktop software (Firefox, KeePass.?.?, GNOME Terminal). However, many GUI applications have the kind of decade-old bugs and UX which means I really can&#x27;t recommend any of them, and I only use them because I don&#x27;t trust the intentions of their closed source equivalents.<p>- Calc seems to have fewer graphing options and mathematical functions than the last Excel I used back in 2009.<p>- Thunderbird keeps randomly losing emails when dragging and dropping things between folders, and incoming email filters only work some of the time.<p>- GNOME Evolution doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to save draft emails while offline, so I just have to hope that I get online to send it before GNOME desktop has one of its moments. Weekly recurring calendar entries seem to be split up into daily recurring ones in recent versions. Search is interminably slow compared to any other client, including Thunderbird.<p>- Darktable has absolutely oodles of features, but I can&#x27;t tell what anything does except by trial and error. F1 doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything other than scroll to the currently selected folder, and there&#x27;s no help to be seen.  &quot;Collect images&quot; keeps reverting the view to <i>unordered</i> &quot;film roll&quot;, which is useless with a big collection. The devs refuse to add file handling code[1]. It&#x27;s currently using 400+% CPU while not showing anything happening.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.darktable.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;faq&#x2F;#faq-rename-files" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.darktable.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;faq&#x2F;#faq-rename-files</a>')
