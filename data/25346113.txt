Also, there is a simple way to copy all properties from a object: const copy = { ...object }; Of course, if these properties are themselves objects, then changes in one of them will appear in the other.<p>One way to have a deep copy which shares nothing is const copy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object)); but that may not always work. In short, copying a arbitrarily large object will probably waste memory, so it should be a little hard so you don&#x27;t do it unless it&#x27;s really necessary.')
