Wasn&#x27;t she on the floor of the House at that time? Why wasn&#x27;t her screen locked? I can think of half a dozen scenarios of carelessness or time pressure. The first one comes to mind is that she was using it, suddenly evacuated and didn&#x27;t flip the lock on, and the mob reached her desk before the lock timer expired. But I do wonder if the was even a screen lock.')
