The nominal use would not likely to be for insertion but logistics, like a really fast C-17.<p>It&#x27;s intended to be quite cheap to build, however, so it&#x27;s not impossible that it could be used one way (in a very high-value operation.)<p>&gt; Can starship land in Earth like gravity on a standard concrete area?<p>Yes. They&#x27;re doing that right now. Taking off from a flat pad, however, is unlikely, at least in current configuration. A &quot;tactical&quot; version with pre-main-ignition &quot;hop&quot; engines, like planned for the lunar lander version, might allow such ops (providing you can provide large quantities of liquid methane and oxygen on site!)')
