Traditionally done along the Nile.  &#x27;Sustainable&#x27; in terms of family owned farms for literal millennia, community works projects of maintaining the nile flooding irrigation, etc.  Of course there are issues, but the families live close to their fields, kids go to school, they make their own business decisions, don&#x27;t want to deplete their soil, and there are social frameworks in place for solving collective problems.  BUT! Doesn&#x27;t work for organic: if a neighbor 3 fields up uses pesticides, and a tiny amount blows over onto your field, your crop isn&#x27;t organic.<p>No problem!  We found an aquifer  (fossil, non-renewable) in the middle of the desert, we&#x27;ll pump up the water and irrigate the ground out there where we&#x27;re far away from pesky neighbors.  Of course this is a big operation, so we need big investment, and thus a big company.  Also we need workers, since nobody lives out there.  We&#x27;ll bus them in. They&#x27;ll need a place to stay, so we&#x27;ll put them in camps.<p>After my evening yoga I like to have some warm chamomile tea to wind down before bed.  I like this one because it&#x27;s organic and has a haiku on the inside about how we should take care of the planet.')
