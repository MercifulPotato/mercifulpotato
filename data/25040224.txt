The beauty of Vim is that it&#x27;s not only\nflexible but also respects the user; unlike most IDEs it doesn&#x27;t\nblindly make assumptions, auto-format code while it&#x27;s being\nwritten, auto-close brackets and tags, it has no &quot;plugin XY has\na new update!&quot; popups. It just reacts to input and nothing more.<p>Vim can have most of those things if needed, but after years of\nusage my tolerance for &quot;smart&quot; features declines constantly.\nWhich in turn made me gravitate towards using more CLI\nutilities, as those follow the same philosophy and go hand in\nhand with Vim. The &quot;no automation but efficient shortcuts&quot;\napproach just feels more reliable and predictable.')
