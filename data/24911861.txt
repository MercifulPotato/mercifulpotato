Price less so; that&#x27;s a function of supply and demand.<p>They are related, of course, but the important stuff can be measured more directly by looking at how well programs work on a given computer. I think it&#x27;s just a little odd to praise one cherry-picked, arbitrary metric for being less game-able than another cherry-picked, arbitrary metric. Especially when we have metrics to hand that are a lot closer to what real people care about in a computer. I certainly have never shopped for a CPU based on the number of transistors, but I have made purchasing decisions based on things like cinebench and passmark scores, which try to get at what ultimately matters to me (i.e. how many FPS a CPU will drive in the games I play).')
