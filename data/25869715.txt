It seems unlikely there was even an attempt to understand Parler&#x27;s moderation process, because having those conversations and raising&#x2F;addressing concerns takes time.<p>It is clear that the process to remove Parler wasn&#x27;t slow and deliberative. The question in my mind is whether it was explicitly political, implicitly political or if someone powerful in AWS was just panicking. None of the 3 situations bode well for anyone trying to use AWS as infrastructure for communication. Which is a number of their major customers.')
