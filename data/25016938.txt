Indoctrinating a large group of people with false&#x2F;misleading information to try to weaken&#x2F;de legitimize the rules and systems of democracy will more or less lead to breaking of them, at that point who cares what the supreme court believes, it probably won&#x27;t have any effect, the damage is already done. I wish we had an educated, critical thinking, rationality driven humanity but the fact is a majority of them (on either side) are not but right now, only one side (not even most of R&#x27;s, just Trump and his hardcore fans) is trying to weaken the democratic process by lying.')
