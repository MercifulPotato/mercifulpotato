Texas has, proportional to total population, more illegal immigrants than California and indeed any other state (at least by estimates). And guess what? They are getting free healthcare there and everywhere else too! If California&#x27;s sanctuary policies are what&#x27;s preventing the feds from deporting them, why does Texas, who is staunchly anti-illegal, continue to boast such a high illegal population? I&#x27;m actually proud that California gives some small humanity to the illegal immigrants here since the federal government has decided not to do the job that they decry as such a huge problem.<p>Also, it&#x27;s really...strange...to place the blame for the fires or the weather at the foot of the state.')
