I have been working part time for almost a year now to rebuild a house and it has been very nice. It always seemed weird to me that people make such high salaries in tech but just don&#x27;t value time as the main commodity of our lives. The reality is that if you move to a low CoL area and work part-time you will almost certainly be happier.<p>But this doesn&#x27;t mean you are idle the rest of the time. It means you can pursue what you love. We place way to much value in jobs as an end rather than as a mean to an end IMO. I tend to believe that the work week should have been reduced decades ago.')
