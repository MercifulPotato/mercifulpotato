That was <i>enabled by</i> the moving away from the gold standard, but was not the abandonment of the gold standard per se.<p>It allowed the wage numbers to increase, but not sufficiently to keep up with inflation. In other words, where before there was one rate of change, there were now <i>two different</i> rates of change.<p>A concrete example: before 1970 a blue-collar worker <i>had a big enough wage</i> that enabled him to buy a house, car, and good standard of living while his wife was able to stay home and look after the house. Today his wage needs to be supplemented by his wife&#x27;s wage, and they do not have sufficient to have a house, car and good standard of living. In fact they struggle to make ends meet.<p>If wages had kept in line with cost of living rises, that blue-collar worker would be making over $2000 per week.')
