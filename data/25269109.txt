Then they either respect your wishes and don&#x27;t get anything, but seem to harbor some kind of resentment against you in their heart, or they get some random garbage you don&#x27;t want and call you ungrateful when you don&#x27;t like it.<p>Really the greatest gift of all would be some kind of exemption from this custom so I don&#x27;t have to go through this twice a year.')
