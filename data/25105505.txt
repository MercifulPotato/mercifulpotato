He has frequently tweeted multiple debunked claims and theories.<p>He said in his latest tweet that something extremely bogus is going on with testing, but the FDA has already admitted to the challenges with the rapid antigen tests. Therefore nothing bogus was happening, just issues that were already publicly known, however Musk has made it clear that he is against precautions so it benefits him to spread confusion and doubts about the virus and testing because he doesn&#x27;t want to lose any profits from the impact caused by shutdowns.')
