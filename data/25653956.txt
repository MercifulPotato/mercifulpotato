Consider a hypothetical: SQLite is to be used to mediate the monitoring, arming and detonation of a thermonuclear warhead. Would you want to use Type4 GUID keys or integer keys for the arming sequence table? Why not just take that extreme as the normal, and use boring &amp; safe approaches everywhere? Assume everything can explode in horrible ways that you could never hope to anticipate. All you really need to do is make sure the explosion is impossible within your problem domain, or is at least manageable if it does occur.<p>An observation I have happened upon recently: The more time you spend away from the computer thinking about the problem you want to solve with the computer, the better the outcome will be. Spending a few days to consider the pros&#x2F;cons of various business entity identity schemes is probably worthwhile when weighing the long term consequences.')
