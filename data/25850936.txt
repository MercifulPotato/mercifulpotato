Most southerners would not have fought purely for slavery because most of the soldiers were too poor to have owned slaves.<p>It was still about slavery: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.battlefields.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;articles&#x2F;why-non-slaveholding-southerners-fought" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.battlefields.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;articles&#x2F;why-non-slavehol...</a><p>&gt;What concerned Southerners most about Lincoln’s election was his opposition to the expansion of slavery into the territories; Southern politicians were clear about that.  If new states could not be slave states, went the argument, then it was only a matter of time before the South’s clout in Congress would fade, abolitionists would be ascendant, and the South’s “peculiar institution” – the right to own human beings as property – would be in peril.<p>As I said before, while there are other factors and while they are interesting and worthy of study, sometimes the core reason really is that simple. It&#x27;s not &quot;enlightened&quot; to pretend that simple things are complex.<p>&gt;Culture wars are useful for pushing narratives and keeping both sides locked in a relative stalemate. Coke and Pepsi both benefit from these antics (Are you a coke drinker or a pepsi drinker?), but it&#x27;s not an appropriate framework for political decision making where you often need to find compromise and pressure points to move the conversation forward.<p>It&#x27;s worked great for the Republicans for the last 40 years (Ronald was the original Donald) and there is no sign it will stop working any time soon. It&#x27;s only ever the left who have to compromise. Name a time in the last 40 years where a Republican has compromised and been rewarded for it.')
