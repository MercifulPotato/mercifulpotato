If durations of cues are correct in you case, there is no need to use this feature and passing in flag -so will switch it off. So why not get rid of stretch and see the difference?<p>What I know is Aeneas is using DWT which does not guarantee triangle inequality and for low voice or noise, DNN can handle those better with good enough model capacity.')
