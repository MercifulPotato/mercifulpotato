In areas with highly supportive populations that want the nuclear jobs in their community, with an NRC that changed processes to try to make it easier to get approval, we are still 12 years in, way behind schedule, and 2-3x over budget, without a solid feel for when we will star pushing electrons with the new reactors.<p>Last I heard, NuScale is hoping to hit a cost of $55&#x2F;MWh. That&#x27;s about the current cost of wind&#x2F;solar <i>and</i> the storage to make it dispatchable. Meaning that by the time they finally ship, it will be a more expensive option for firm low-carbon energy than the current options we have.<p>So not only is NuScale aiming at a not-so-desirable target, by the time it can deliver its first 10GW, it&#x27;s quite likely that the renewables will be curtailed for much of the year, meaning that we have extra generation capacity that goes unused, which is likely to spur a huge round of economic innovation for that energy.<p>I would hate to get stuck with the path dependence of nuclear. Renewables are so cheap that they open up a ton more doors for society.')
