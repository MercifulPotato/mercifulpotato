I learned to program _after_ all my legal troubles started, and my sentence wasn&#x27;t _nearly_ as long as this (6 months, drug crime).<p>I 100% honestly feel like tech saved my life.  My first job immediately gave me hope that I&#x27;m not defined by my past. \n Went from working in a factory making $7&#x2F;hr (about 10 yrs ago), to now grossing well over 6 figures (currently making west coast type wages).<p>Run a small consultancy now and can even subcontract out work to a few friends.  I know there&#x27;s alot of talk on how to make the industry more inclusive (which I agree we need to do better at).  But I can&#x27;t think of any industry as meritocratic as tech.')
