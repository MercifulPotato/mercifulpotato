Users will also complain about not having the features they want just as readily as they will complain about something being slow.<p>But that’s really besides the point. As long as an application is fast enough that a user doesn’t notice a problem with it, then you’re done optimizing for performance (in most cases at least). So if new hardware comes out that’s twice as fast, you could very sensibly keep the performance at the same acceptable level, and use the new performance budget in other ways. Such as by introducing various inefficiencies via abstractions that make feature development faster.')
