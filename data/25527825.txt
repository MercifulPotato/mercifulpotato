They know if a car with licence plate &quot;GH13 JFG&quot; is covered under warranty or not, because they know when they sold it. It doesn&#x27;t matter if since then it got sold several times. I suppose it won&#x27;t work any more if you put a custom plate on the car, but if you kept the one it was originally registered with then yeah, it doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s second hand or not.')
