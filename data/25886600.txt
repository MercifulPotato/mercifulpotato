Because one of the mechanics of the game is the colonists can lose their minds due to stress, where usually they strip naked and grab a gun and start shooting people or run toward the nearest living thing and try to beat it to death, managing that is important.<p>Anyway, one of the early builds had this bug where sufficient terror&#x2F;horror stats were enough outweigh any degree of stress. So the solution to a happy colony was hundreds of occupied gibbet cages placed in rows as a sort of path guide to&#x2F;from the entrances to the cafeteria, bunk houses, etc. so colonists would constantly be exposed to them.<p>If you filled them with barbarians or whatever you could catch (sometimes your own people if the headcount started to get above your food production...) you&#x27;d have a nice &quot;happy&quot; colony.<p>I&#x27;m sure this is long removed or fixed, but it just struck me as amazing at the time...')
