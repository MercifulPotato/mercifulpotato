Buy on good news, sell on bad news, hopefully fast enough to beat others to it.<p>After a great deal of crunching and study he said they <i>did</i> come up with a model that could do it reasonably well. Then realised it could be replaced with a simple rule:<p>Are there a bunch of numbers at the top? Good news.<p>Are the numbers buried way down? Bad news.<p>Another simple rule, by the way, is timing vs executive compensation events. If there&#x27;s an announcement just before a big block of options or RSUs are vesting, then it&#x27;s good likely to be good news. If it&#x27;s being posted far away from vesting dates, then it&#x27;s likely to be bad news.')
