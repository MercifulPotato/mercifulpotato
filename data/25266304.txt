It’s a low-code user experience that allows anyone to build business logic that precisely defines how data flows through their organisation.<p>We recognise this is a stressful and uncertain time for everyone; Tray.io endeavours to stay strong during this period. We are well funded, with two recent rounds behind us; the latter to make a statement we wanted to remain independent, so we have a large cash runway. The goal of our Engineering team at this time is to come out the other side with an even stronger product so we are continuing to hire.<p>We’ve worked hard on creating a fantastic support layer and business continuity plans for our technical teams and we’re continuing to expand and empower. We are already used to working from home and you’ll find our calendars full of socially “distanced” events already and our leadership are leading regular company-wide updates.<p>We are excited by people who want to constantly innovate; borrow from other industries, experiment with new tools and pool their knowledge with other solution seekers; people who have shipped entire projects with ownership and autonomy; people who take pride in what gets built, all the whilst balancing day-to-day pragmatism with building for the future.<p>Current open roles:<p>- Backend Software Engineer \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4743614002" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4743614002</a><p>- Engineer Manager(Quality)\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4878783002" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4878783002</a><p>- Customer Success Engineer\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4363924002" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io&#x2F;trayio&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;4363924002</a><p>Tech stack: Scala, Go, GraphQL, ReactJS, TypeScript, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, ElasticSearch, MongoDB, DynamoDB, AWS SQS, AWS Kinesis, Docker, Terraform, AWS Lambda, Serverless Framework, Jenkins, Grafana, Prometheus, AWS &amp; Linux.<p>Apply: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tray.io&#x2F;jobs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tray.io&#x2F;jobs</a> or get in touch with london-talent@tray.io')
