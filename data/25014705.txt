It&#x27;s basic human nature.&quot;<p>These two things do not contradict each other. Given how often do ideologically controlled societies emerge throughout history, I would argue that basic human nature contains some seeds of totalitarian thought: &quot;Shut up the heretic, or better kill him.&quot;<p>&quot;be happy that people tell you to shut up&#x2F;stop inviting you to parties&#x2F;block you on Twitter.&quot;<p>That is not what the author had in mind (probably). The consequences such as being fired or expelled from a school are what bothers people like him and probably me.<p>There isn&#x27;t a clean 1-0 spectrum of &quot;being told to shut up o Twitter&quot; and &quot;being thrown in prison&quot;. Consequences such as being fired from your job are somewhere in the middle, not totally devastating, but still causing a pretty strong chilling effect. This is a pretty serious punishment that should be used sparingly, not over a stupid Tweet.<p>I am almost certain that over next 10-20 years, current willingness of bosses or directors to act on Twitter mobbing will be seen akin to other hysterias of the past.')
