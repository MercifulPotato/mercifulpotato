It&#x27;s small and relatively quiet and sits under my desk tucked in a back corner with just a power cable and a few ethernet cables plugged into it.<p>Maybe some time in the near future I&#x27;ll add a 2TB HDD that I have sitting around into it so that I can create VMs that have a &#x27;fast&#x27; boot&#x2F;root disk, and also give them some lvm partitions on a big slow disk.<p>It&#x27;s running debian stable amd64 and is set up as a xen dom0 hypervisor, with 768MB of RAM assigned to the dom0 and the rest available for VMs.<p>The amount of capacity that&#x27;s available there to create random PV or HVM VMs with as much RAM as I could want, is more than sufficient for my personal needs. If I need anything bigger I&#x27;ll make it a more formal process and put it on a machine at work.')
