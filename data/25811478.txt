This looks very like an HTTP URI. In other words, if you think your organization will be capable of creating URNs which will last, then prove it by doing it now and using them for your HTTP URIs.<p>Swap out the topic of URIs and stability for the kinds of content that Gemini is supposed to carry, and we&#x27;ve got the same situation: people mistaking practices—like breaking your URIs all the time, or overly stylized content (including the linked article)—as something that the web <i>demands</i>.<p>Here&#x27;s an exercise: suppose we checked the personal homepages of the people who&#x27;ve been suggesting Gemini is a good fit for the problem at hand, what would happen?  Would we find that the content there can be cleanly moved to Gemini space?  If not, why?<p>The very next thing TBL says about Cool URIs:<p>&gt; There is nothing about HTTP which makes your URIs unstable. It is your organization.<p>This is a softer way of saying, &quot;you are the problem (not HTTP)&quot;.<p>I think the real tragedy of Gemini is that although its existence is a reaction to a genuine problem, what it proposes as a solution is a piece of tech that, in addition to having new problems of its own, it also makes some nebulous promises, doesn&#x27;t address the underlying problem, and rests upon some less-than-rational arguments not rooted in clear thinking or even clear understanding.  It&#x27;s another instance of a bad solution to a problem making that problem worse.  This happens when bad solutions capture the attention of people concerned with and&#x2F;or affected by the problem, and then they divert resources away from the problem instead of allowing those resources to be better put to good use—i.e., into efforts that can actually be effective.')
