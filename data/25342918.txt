That&#x27;s it. I don&#x27;t care how well it works as a phone. I want a fully-featured, honest-to-god GNU&#x2F;Linux terminal in my pocket that I can use to do anything that I could do on a (massively underpowered) Linux laptop, especially on the command line (i.e. I don&#x27;t even care too much about GUI apps except some basics like web and PDF display).<p>If it can someday replace my phone, that&#x27;s a massive bonus of course, but realistically I don&#x27;t think it will within the next decade, for my specific smartphone needs. But that&#x27;s OK - I don&#x27;t mind carrying alongside it an Android device that is my actual &quot;smartphone&quot;.')
