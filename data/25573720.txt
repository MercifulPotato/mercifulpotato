In short, the vision processing aspect still worked quite well, wrt. drivable area, lane lines, pedestrians, etc. Room to improve, for certain, but I’m not seeing a fundamental flaw here.<p>What’s left is the <i>driving</i> part, the “how to make the car follow this path” part. I predict this part will be ridiculously good once Tesla gets around to it. Imagine the traction control in your car, now with immediate-response electric motors, and it knows where it wants to go in 3d space (not just “driver is turning wheel to the right”, but actually knowing the arc to follow).<p>Exciting times.')
