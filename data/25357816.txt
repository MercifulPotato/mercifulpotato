The intended result is to make RHEL <i>even more</i> stable than before, but leaving CentOS in the position where RHEL was until now.<p>Seriously, think about it.  Yes, users of CentOS Stream will be essentially be doing beta-testing for RedHat, but it&#x27;s a type of beta testing that until now didn&#x27;t even exist; any instability, conflict, or vulnerability that enters into CentOS Stream is one that would have entered into production RHEL systems otherwise.  So the net effect is fewer of those for RHEL, but the same number as before for CentOS.  CentOS users lose nothing they ever had.')
