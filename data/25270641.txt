Postman describes himself as being close to a technophobe—more like a techno-skeptic. I think that makes his perspectives on the downsides of technologies particularly potent.<p>I think we (I mean the HN community, as well as technology-workers in general) do a good job of self-marketing the latest technological gadget, tool, etc. The problems we like to think about (e.g. efficiency, scaling, responsiveness, etc.) are fun to solve with technology, and we sell ourselves on the latest and greatest solutions to these problems. However, we loose a bit of touch with the bigger human problems we need to solve.<p>I’m personally grateful for Postman’s perspectives; I think more about my technology choices and I’m more aware of the hidden effects that technologies have on my thinking. I highly recommend reading his books.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lambdaland.org&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2020-08-16-book-review-technopoly-v2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lambdaland.org&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2020-08-16-book-review-technopo...</a>')
