What we get to &quot;see&quot; in cyberpunk novels, movies and games, is mostly an abstraction sice we&#x27;re not that cool dude or dudette, we don&#x27;t have that deep deep understanding or those amazing skills, maybe we just lack the right implants, but nevertheless, the author is forced to portray some hybrid between the &quot;concept of what&#x27;s going on&quot; and what observers would see.<p>Also, Duskers is a great game.\nPs I&#x27;m a Linux user and I&#x27;d love to see more native games for my platform of choice, but I also know that there&#x27;s a reason I can&#x27;t always have nice things, and I don&#x27;t blame anyone for that.')
