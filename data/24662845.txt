Most applications cannot be built statically, at all.<p>Solaris-style RPath is still an option on Linux, but it is rarely used.<p>As far as “security,” dynamic linking is not an attempt to contain applications, but rather to fix as many things as possible with as few updates as possible.<p>Flatpak actively encourages upstream developers not to participate in the wider picture, and as it turns out, upstream developers can’t be trusted to fix security holes in a timely manner.<p>This was a widely foreseen issue that was pooh-poohed in the early days of flatpak, but, well, look how it turned out.')
