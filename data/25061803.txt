If it wasn&#x27;t so scary it would be funny, because people accuse the president of acting like a dictator and then complain when he isn&#x27;t enough of a dictator.</i><p>You seem to be considering &quot;freedom&quot; as equivalent to irresponsibility. Being a <i>leader</i> means <i>convincing people</i> to do work they don&#x27;t want to do, like wearing masks during a pandemic. We don&#x27;t even need to debate whether the federal government should have implemented a national mask mandate. Simply having a president that <i>recommended</i> wearing masks instead of encouraging indignant irresponsibility would have saved tens of thousands of American lives, no laws required.<p>Trump is described as a dictator because he unilaterally picks nonsensical ideas and then barks them at everyone to get done, while accepting no feedback about how things are actually working out. This is the behavior of a dictator, regardless of how much power he actually wields or how effective he is. The latest example is his hissy fit over losing the election - there&#x27;s no basis in reality, yet he&#x27;s continuing to push it anyway. And seeing someone acting like the law does not matter sets off the fascist alarm bells.')
