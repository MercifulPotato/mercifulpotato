Burned quite a few times trying out Julia stuff.<p>Last time it was because cold start times were unbearable (compared to Python&#x2F;R&#x2F;Stata&#x2F;Matlab). My goal was to compare how regressions in a few software packages behaved with difficult datasets, so I had to open each of those, run a snippet of code, and log the output. Here, Julia&#x27;s cold start (and importing the CSV, GLM, etc libraries) took way longer than all of the other tools together.')
