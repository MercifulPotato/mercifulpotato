That gives you an average of 25,000 tool-building worlds per galaxy, something like a 1 in 20 million change any star in our galaxy has a tool-building civilization.<p>If you remove the first billion years of the galaxy you get 12.21-12.51 billion years.<p>Again if we assume an even distribution and assume 140,000 light-years in diameter for a galaxy, <i>that gives you something like 1 tool building civilization per 600,000 square light-years spread out over 12 billion years</i>.<p>:( :( :(')
