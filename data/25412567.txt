I actually worked on an automation system (mostly on my own time) that literally reduced the &quot;manual human intervention time&quot; to an 8:1 ratio. I&#x27;ll admit it was rough first  and I estimated it would take me time to train a typical technician a day or two to wrap their head around it but it could be done (I actually trained one tech on it during an all-nighter demo to him, and he loved it). Anyway fast forward a bit, I presented it to my manager and his manager and he said &quot;we don&#x27;t time to train techs on that, we have to get work done&quot; and I had already trained 1 tech on it, and we did it on our on time! I was so dejected after that that I left the company about a month later and was much happier.')
