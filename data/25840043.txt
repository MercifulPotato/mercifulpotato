Like, open-and-shut.<p>&gt; (and only about 100 people are wanted at all).<p>As of two days ago, 116 had been charged (74 in US District Court, 42 in D.C. Superior Court) and more than 300 were being investigated.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;fbi-releases-photos-suspects-wanted-alleged-assault-officer-during-capitol-n1254558" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;fbi-releases-photos-sus...</a><p>&gt; If such charges could be reasonably made, don’t you think they would make them?<p>No, I wouldn’t expect indictments or plea bargains for any but the most trivially-apparent offenses to be announced right away, because they both take time to present to a grand jury (or to negotiate with the defense to get an agreement to proceed without indictment), and because they tip the hand to others under investigation and risk destruction of evidence.<p>&gt; The prosecutor isn’t an idiot.<p>Correct, which is why when they have an easy charge to arrest on, they don’t see the need to tip their hand on much else prematurely, and there is nothing easier than the unlawful entry charges.')
