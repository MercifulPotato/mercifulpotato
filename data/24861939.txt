Item(by='zozbot234', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603393183, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24860589, text='&gt; Anki has some poor defaults for some parameters, which will cause you to be needlessly inundated with reviews.<p>The problem is that people incorrectly assume that they <i>must</i> &quot;do something&quot; about missed reviews. That&#x27;s just not how it works; in fact, Anki will give you extra credit for recalling a card beyond the expected forgetting time, so working with a backlog of cards to review is a lot easier than it sounds.<p>The whole idea is that once the expected forgetting time for those &quot;review&quot; cards has been pushed far in the future, that&#x27;s the best time to learn new, more challenging content. It works very well in my experience.<p>Where reducing the amount of reviews may well be justified is for cards that are &quot;nice to have&quot;, but that you don&#x27;t <i>actually</i> care about remembering. That&#x27;s also the only sorts of cards for which &quot;leech&quot; protection makes sense, and that&#x27;s a lot closer to a poor default in my view.')
