It&#x27;s deterministic in the sense that all the inputs to the system are known and controlled. This allows us to repeat all inputs and reproduce the exact same behaviour as before, e.g. an error state we stumbled upon or an interesting program state we want to continue exploring.<p>This in no way precludes sampling the input space stochastically. Brute forcing by sampling all possible inputs sequentially is usually untenable and wasteful. However, once you do encounter a new program state, you&#x27;ll be able to perfectly recreate it forever.')
