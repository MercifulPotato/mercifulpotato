Now with Wayland the person who wants to write his own desktop environment has to rewrite <i>much more</i> to get to something that doesn&#x27;t even provide half of what Xorg gives.<p>Also, compositors are not mandatory anyways on X (I don&#x27;t use one personnally and prefer it like that) so it&#x27;s a weird remark to make.')
