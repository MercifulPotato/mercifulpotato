If the device can&#x27;t be managed &#x2F; is no longer supported the safest choice is not to allow it online at all. Different people will have different risk tolerances â€“ it might make sense to put, say, a remote-control power switch on an IoT no-man&#x27;s land network but if it has access to personal information or cameras&#x2F;microphones it&#x27;s not unreasonable to say it should just be blocked unless you&#x27;re actively using those features.')
