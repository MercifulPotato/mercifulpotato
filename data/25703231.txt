From server rendered react to typescript and design systems to how the hell kubernetes works. I went from dokku, to lando, to trying to figure out Consul and Hashicorp stuff to managed K8s on digital ocean. I decided to try to only write SQL and create my own typesafe patterns with TypeScript. It didn’t work out all that great but it wasn’t all that bad either.<p>This is half baked because I had so many more plans for a product no one asked for. Definitely one of the best learning experiences I had. I started with a monorepo of modules and realized that was a stupid idea for an app. I developed some strong opinions along the way. Oh I reimplemented email auth for the nth time but this time I used postgres’s built-in crypto functions. Man I like this implementation')
