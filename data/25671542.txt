It&#x27;s true that Trump doesn&#x27;t appear to be as imperialistic or hawkish as many previous presidents, but that doesn&#x27;t imply one way or another anything about potential authoritarianism.<p>You made an argument that accusations of Trump being an authoritarian are unfounded, but as evidence you cited examples of him not being an imperialist, rather than examples of him not being an authoritarian. Your examples don&#x27;t preclude the possibility of him potentially being a non-imperialistic authoritarian.')
