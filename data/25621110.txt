It actually isn&#x27;t difficult - you just need to not get stuck into a dependency on something heavy.<p>For my company&#x27;s backend, our entire middleware stack incl auth checks is around the 1-2ms level including hitting a DB server to check for token revocation. That&#x27;s all there is between the end user and our application code, plus network latency. We didn&#x27;t do anything particularly clever or special. But we didn&#x27;t use any frameworks or heavy magic products - just Go&#x27;s net&#x2F;http, the chi router and Lambda@Edge.')
