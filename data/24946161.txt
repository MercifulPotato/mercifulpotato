It seems that when the original constitution was written, people kinda thought of the states as different countries. Robert E Lee seemed to think he had to fight for Virginia, for instance.<p>Nowadays, that thinking seems wrong. Not sure what yall think over there, but I&#x27;ve always thought of Michael Jackson an American artist, rather than a person from Indiana. I just don&#x27;t see that Americans see the states as a federation of countries, but I guess people there might.<p>Something like the UN might have similar votes per country, on the rationale that countries are equal regardless of relative size.')
