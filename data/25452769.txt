A Wankel engine is a certain type of engine with certain key characteristics, by definition. The LiquidPiston engine does not share all of these key characteristics, so it is not a Wankel engine. Of course you can call whatever you want a Wankel engine, nobody can stop you. You can call the SpaceX Raptor engine a Wankel engine. But we will ignore you, because you are objectively wrong.')
