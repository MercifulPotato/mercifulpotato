The experimentator applies some decision procedure d to the observation to get their result.<p>A Frequentist will analyze the situation by conditioning on the the model parameter θ. As a result, we get a single target value γ and probability distributions for the observation and decision, depending on θ.\nIf d results in an interval, the Frequentist calculates the confidence level as the probability that the descision procedure d produces an interval containing γ, under worst-case assumptions for θ. Unbiasedness of the decision procedure means that γ is indeed the function it estimates the best, and it is not a better estimator for any other function γ&#x27;(θ).<p>A Bayesian, on the other hand, will condition the joint distribution on the observation. Consequently, γ is a random variable, while the observation and decision are known.\nIf d is an interval, its credibility is the probability that γ is within this interval, given the observation. Optimality of the decision procedure means that no other estimator d&#x27; produces better results.<p>[1]: S.
