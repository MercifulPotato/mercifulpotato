Not as good as Google or Bing, but I think it is a one-man operation.  Mojeek also just received an investment to build out their index.<p>At Runnaroo, I partially use Google as the backend, but I have done a good amount of testing on the above options in case Google or Bing stop being options.<p>Just as important as the search results, Bing provides the monetization for DDG through their ad network, so  DDG is dependent on Bing for two critical parts of the business.  I don&#x27;t think Bing will ever kick them off because it must be very profitable for them and they need to do everything they can to get marketshare against Google.')
