I remember talking to one of the other people at the company, and he had a debugging story that—if I&#x27;m recalling correctly—came down to one core seeing the output of another core <i>part way through the register being updated</i>. Cores communicate by linking the top registers of their stacks against the top register of neighboring cores and, since there&#x27;s no system-wide clock, two cores can run slightly out of step with one another.<p>That must not have been easy to diagnose! I suppose that&#x27;s the trade-off with not having clocks, although I don&#x27;t really know enough about computer architecture to judge.')
