I feel like, at least in my country, that &quot;Engineer&quot; is a term used by people that want to feel they have a shinier title. Most of those people don&#x27;t even have a degree on any form of engineering. I call myself a programmer because this way I feel like I&#x27;m not trying to show off a title and it also transmits the message of what I do: work on computer programs.')
