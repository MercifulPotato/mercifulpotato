Your bank floats you the amount as a credit within a few days or a week, depending on the funding source. For example, business cheques usually &quot;clear&quot; faster because they are less risky.<p>But they haven&#x27;t actually cleared yet, it&#x27;s a multi day (probably weeks, tbh) situation where you have to download ACH return&#x2F;error files every day and hope none contain that transaction.')
