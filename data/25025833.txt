Your web browser can probably save images for you that could be opened in photoshop&#x27;s. If you want drag and drop that could be done (browsers dont allow you to drag out AFAICT). But filters are software, not data. Someone could try to create a standard way to define filters but then each program would need to understand that. I like the idea of dragging a filter onto an image in any program and having it apply there, but that means the filter has to be some independent piece of code implementing &quot;the image filter API&quot;. Would every app need to know how to apply those, or would the UI toolkit have means of presenting images that all apps use and that knows how to apply filters?<p>Not only does this require extremely good design of abstractions, it requires a very open system that seems to go against commercial interests. In the long term I think commercial software has other similar issues, but we need an alternative means of paying developers before that can change.')
