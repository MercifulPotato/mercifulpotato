Claiming that pumped storage is in any way a viable grid-storage system that can handle baseload in the UK is inaccurate.<p>Even if every battery production facility on the planet was dedicated entirely to producing storage batteries for the UK it would take almost half a decade to meet the requirements.  You can claim that more will be built, but there are resource pipelines involved that are not as elastic and just throwing a pile of money at someone to build a factory.  Battery production is growing, but nowhere near fast enough to meet the requirements for grid scale storage.<p>Right now fission has no competition from renewables+storage because the storage part of that equation remains a fantasy.')
