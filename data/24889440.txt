That usually happens a couple hours before the flight, and I can&#x27;t be bothered to deal with e-mailing National Geographic and Coyote Peterson and Smarter Everyday and their ilk and pray that they&#x27;ll send me a high-res video file. They probably won&#x27;t.<p>And there are all the times I&#x27;ve used hundreds of downloaded videos as datasets or test sets for machine learning algorithms.<p>Just because rights <i>can</i> be theoretically violated with a tool doesn&#x27;t mean we should ban the tool.
