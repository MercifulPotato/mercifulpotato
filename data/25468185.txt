To oversimplify, it&#x27;s poorly incentivized, and might not fit anyway.  XR and associated edtech, seemingly has the potential to alter these pedagogical constraints and incentives.  So looking ahead...<p>How might scaling laws be used in education?  Now or eventually?  Perhaps one possibility might be as part of skill cluster emphasizing rough quantitative reasoning and Fermi questions, as rules of thumb, in conjunction with an order of magnitude feel for reasonable numbers for physical properties.  But that&#x27;s an &quot;eventually&quot;.  For &quot;now&quot;, area-vs-volume length scaling is a familiar part of intro biology.  For &quot;near term&quot;, maybe as part of intros emphasizing quantitative and physical biology?  So what else...?<p>Any brainstormy thoughts on how scaling laws might be used in education, now or soon or eventually?')
