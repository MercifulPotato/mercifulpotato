The plumber arrives, does his thing, and hands over the bill.<p>The engineer is shocked. -&#x27;What, this is like a quarter of what I make in a month - for half an hour&#x27;s work???&#x27;<p>Plumber shrugs. -&#x27;Well, why don&#x27;t you come join us? Easy work, well paid, no responsibility - just remember to keep mum about your degree, as we&#x27;re not supposed to hire academics.&#x27;<p>Our engineer contemplates this for a while, applies for a job as a plumber - and gets it.<p>All is well, good money, no responsibilites - until management requires that they take evening school classes to gain new skills and thus better build socialism. So, grudgingly, our engineer enrolls in a math class and, upon arriving, finds that the teacher wants to establish what the plumbers already know.<p>-&#x27;You over there - could you please come to the blackboard and show us the formula for the area of a circle?&#x27; he asks our engineer.<p>Standing at the blackboard, he suddenly realizes he can&#x27;t for the life of him remember the formula; while a bit rusty, he soon figures out how to reason it out - furiously writing out integrals on the blackboard, only to find the area of a circle is -(pi)*r^2.<p>Minus? How did a negative enter into it, he thinks, going over his calculations once again. No, still gets the same result. Sweat building, he turns away from the blackboard for a moment, turning to the other plumbers watching.<p>As in one voice, they all whisper -&#x27;Comrade, you must switch the limits to the integral!&#x27;')
