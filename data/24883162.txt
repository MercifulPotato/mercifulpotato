The most widely used public blockchain, Ethereum, could be millions of times more expensive than AWS per ledger entry.<p>This is because it is designed to have its state stored permanently by thousands of computers, with any entry becoming part of a permanent canonical shared history of the network going forward.<p>What all of that distribution and synchronization gives you is unparalleled immutability, data permanence and uptime.<p>So the applications best suited to this highly constrained and highly reliable&#x2F;accessible computing environment are those which require relatively small data transfer&#x2F;storage, where the data operations are of extremely high value relative to the computing resources they consume.<p>So far these applications have been currency, marketplaces and financial contracts, which all benefit from being on an open platform that is effectively resistant to capture by any party.
