Makes me curious what is behind the scenes that could make Wolfram think this.  I first imagined something like where people poison Google results by posting a lot of things that cause specific searches to turn up certain people.<p>Searching for who is the President got the result of &quot;Joe Biden&quot; but with the modifier &quot;in 2 months and 12 days&quot;.  If I directly ask Wolfram Alpha how old the president is it says that it is reporting Harris&#x27; age, and also says she is an attorney.<p>Really curious, and kinda funny.')
