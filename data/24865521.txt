Such assumptions often don&#x27;t hold. Encryption and physical protection are not redundant, they are defense in depth.<p>I agree with the GPG part and that a mail provider can not reasonably create something similar, however they have a weird understanding of &quot;encryption at rest&quot; at the base of their argument why they don&#x27;t do it.')
