The most important one is the experiments that led to CIE XYZ. Lecture notes from universities seem like one of the best sources of info about the basics. Such as this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cl.cam.ac.uk&#x2F;teaching&#x2F;1516&#x2F;AdvGraph&#x2F;02_Light_and_colour.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cl.cam.ac.uk&#x2F;teaching&#x2F;1516&#x2F;AdvGraph&#x2F;02_Light_and...</a><p>Other experiments that are interesting, but a bit hard to find information about are:\nThe Munsell renotation effort in the 1940s, the experiments that led to OSA-UCS, the MacAdam ellipses.<p>I also like this paper since gives a fairly good overview and lots of new keywords to search for: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osapublishing.org&#x2F;viewmedia.cfm?uri=oe-25-13-15131" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osapublishing.org&#x2F;viewmedia.cfm?uri=oe-25-13-151...</a> (and is freely available)')
