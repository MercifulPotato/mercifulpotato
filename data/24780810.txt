Nobody claims otherwise.<p>But - also know from Snowden we know that that PRISM <i>is not</i> just an aggregation of responses to fisa warrants.<p>PRISM also involved intercepting Google’s bulk traffic from their fiber without Google’s knowledge, and various other kind of interception.<p>If you equate PRISM with aggregating fisa warrants responses, then what you say is true.<p>However it is not actually accurate to make that equation.<p>And even if court ordered data was aggregated as part of PRISM, that doesn’t constitute ‘participating’ in PRISM in any by the most semantically stretched way, since they didn’t know about it.<p>If you are going to argue like this, you may as well say that the end users ‘participated’ in prism, by giving their data to these companies.  In a way that’s true.<p>But it’s not true in the common understanding of what it means to participate.')
