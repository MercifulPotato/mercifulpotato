Your sites are so snappy and I&#x27;m assuming secure-by-default as they&#x27;re static.<p>On the other hand, though, your sites look more like Craigslist ads than actual eCommerce sites.  The font choice is ugly, and the lack of things like logos, contact&#x2F;about pages don&#x27;t exactly fill the user with trust.<p>If you polished it up a bit, I think you could have a real winner on your hands.')
