The end result is that the disk fills up, and the on-device file manager is anemic and slow. Not only is there no discernable way to clear the sync queue (so as you free up space it gets filled again..) - even if you can sort by file size, you can&#x27;t actually list file size.<p>I had hoped to use it, beyond comics, for technical books - but both zoom and reflow of text, and font selection is poor for both Pdf and epub.<p>Then finally, I had hope it would work for viewing Pdf rpg rulebook - but it chokes pretty badly (on the admittedly quite horrible) white wolf mage 20th book for example.<p>And to add insult to injury the built in Pdf reader can&#x27;t be used with the interactive (Pdf form) character sheets.<p>It can read a &quot;printed&quot; version and allows doodling on top - so it&#x27;s not all lost. But the end result isn&#x27;t machine readable, so you&#x27;re almost better off with a paper sheet anyway.<p>Finally, reading a standard epub (like &quot;The Star&#x27;s my Destination&quot;) is painful because the limited font&#x2F;margin&#x2F;reflow, and the sluggish response for turning pages (a hw button would&#x27;ve helped here). In the end, my aging huawei phone [1] with oled display set to night mode is a better book reading experience both in Kindle and FBreader.<p>But again, the doodling is pretty good, and the screen is crisp - so I hope something can be done via software. Maybe even just adding a djvu-reader and do the conversion off device if the cpu is truly as underpowered for Pdf as it appears.<p>[1] p20 pro (wow, it really is a 2018 phone - thought it was older..)\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Huawei_P20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Huawei_P20</a>')
