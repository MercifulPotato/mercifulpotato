In fact it’s a core design goal. Jax arrays implement the Numpy API. I routinely drop Jax arrays into other python libraries designed for Numpy. It works quite well. It’s not effortless 100% of the time but no library interop is (including Julia multiple dispatch).<p>I can introspect Jax. Until you wrap your function with jit(foo) it’s as introspectable as any other Python code, at least if I’m understanding what you mean by introspection.<p>Jax has implemented most of the Numpy functions, certainly most of the ones anyone needs to use on a regular basis. I rarely find anything missing. And if it is, I can write it myself, in python, and have it work seamlessly with the rest of Jax (autodiff, jit, etc)')
