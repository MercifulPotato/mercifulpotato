The main useful thing that emerged somewhat recently is the system called &#x27;spawngrid&#x27; which leverages fossil rootscores, venti replication, and independent namespaces provided by ANTS to spawn independent plan 9 environments on demand and make them available on multiple nodes. It was a bit too ambitious for the real world so I&#x27;m going to stop wasting the money on running the unused servers but it did work pretty well in the technical sense. The lighter and simpler public grid will continue because it has an active user community.<p>I also developed a lot of interest in more theoretical computing topics which I may or may not be able to bring toward Plan 9 namespaces at some point, but I don&#x27;t have the time to summarize that here, the blog on my site covers some of the ideas.')
