Zwave has its own barrel of shit, but at least it stays inside the barrel.<p>When I first started playing with HA a few years ago, I got an internet connected hub, and it eventually occurred to me that every time I walked into a room some server somewhere else was notified before my light came on.  What an insane round trip to rely upon!!  Some server about 800 miles away just told my lights that I was in my dining room.<p>Granted it was cool that it happened quickly enough to be useful, but what a dumb thing to rely upon.  Add to that the unreliability of comcast and I felt like an idiot complaining that my lights weren&#x27;t working because of my internet connection.<p>Now I rely upon zwave2mqtt and the occasional spare time to write my automations in javascript.<p>It&#x27;s imperfect, but no company in the world will ever know .  And no internet required.')
