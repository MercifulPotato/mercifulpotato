If that merely means the use of the word &quot;revolution&quot; often associated with socialism, honestly, it&#x27;s time to get a new buzzword. It has become pathetic, in a &quot;South Postpones Rising Again For Yet Another Year&quot; fashion[1]. If they&#x27;re serious about violent revolution, Facebook is well within their rights to remove it. If they&#x27;re not, stop playing armchair revolutionary.<p>Facebook make it quite clear that shutting down right wing conspiracy theories was about the potential for violence. If that&#x27;s the case for left-wing groups as well, they should say so, as a blanket statement if not on a case-by-case basis.<p>If they&#x27;re doing it out of a sense of &quot;balance&quot;, so that they can remove nonviolent groups of various sorts, that I oppose. Violence is a fairly bright-line concept and I&#x27;ve got no fear of it becoming a slippery slope. Conpsiracy theories tending to incite violence are less clear and more fraught, but January 6 demonstrated conclusively that it&#x27;s a genuine and not merely theoretical issue.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theonion.com&#x2F;south-postpones-rising-again-for-yet-another-year-1819565548" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theonion.com&#x2F;south-postpones-rising-again-for-ye...</a>')
