First-term outgoing executive declares a bunch of policies last-minute that his supporters love, incoming executive cancels all of them.<p>Since the policies were untested, they became symbolic rather than a demonstrably failed experiment.<p>When the first executive tries for a second term later, they can use this as an example of how they tried to do X, but their replacement didn&#x27;t even give them a chance.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this exact thing done many, many times, and not just in the American presidency.')
