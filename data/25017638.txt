This means that trying to divine whether or not a ballot recorded an intent to vote for a candidate can be subjective and depends on the exact standard you want to use, which Florida didn&#x27;t specify (and the Florida Supreme Court ruled was ultimately too vague).<p>Since 2000, most states have switched to optical scan ballots as their paper records. These ballots have much lower error rates, closer to 1 error per million votes. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s been a single race using optical scan ballots where a recount actually caused a winner to switch.')
