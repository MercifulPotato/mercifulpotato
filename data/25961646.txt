So randos buying N95s and wearing them will frequently not work.<p>That was the excuse doctors were giving me in March that they all suddenly dropped. Are N95s without perfect fits worse than cloth masks, which don&#x27;t have fit tests either? Are they better than no masks? Was Facebook wrong to stock up on N95s for employees during wildfire season?<p>&gt; So the overall adherence is higher with cloth coverings and have a net higher benefit.<p>This is one of the worst things public health experts seemed to just be totally wrong about. They were obsessed with &quot;risk compensation&quot;, where if you make things safer in the wrong way people will act riskier so it doesn&#x27;t help. But this doesn&#x27;t actually seem to happen.')
