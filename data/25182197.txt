And if the motivation is driven by international relations, well again, that is the definition of geopolitics.<p>There&#x27;s a reason we talk about the Space Race and not the International Geophysical Year. Popular and political support for the Apollo and predecessor programs were ultimately driven by the geopolitical goals, and once the Space Race had been &quot;won,&quot; that support dwindled to the normal, pitiful scientific research levels. Spaceflight and space research reverted to just being yet another scientific field trying to catch a few drips of the governmental funding pipeline. It&#x27;s the sad truth here.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that all science is driven by geopolitics. A lot of high-energy physics research isn&#x27;t, for example (although supporters of the SCC did try to frame cancelling it thusly to try to preserve its funding, though they ultimately failed).')
