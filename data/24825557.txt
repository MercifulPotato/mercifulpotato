There&#x27;s no argument that the C64 was superior in terms of graphics and sound although even that comes with a caveat.<p>Marketing is <i>not</i> why Apple beat Commodore, or at least far from the only reason. Nobody bought Apples because of the ads. I don&#x27;t remember even seeing an Apple ad on TV, and people weren&#x27;t so impressed by magazine ads that they would go spend an extra $1,000 on Apple.<p>---<p>1. The Apple II&#x27;s were much more expandable thanks to their expansion slots, and there was a big ecosystem in place here already by the time the C64 gathered steam. You can see a somewhat similar dynamic at work today with RaspberryPi. There are competitors with more powerful hardware but with RaspberryPi, the <i>ecosystem</i> is the draw.<p>2. The Apple II (and soon after, the Mac) dominated the US education market. They developed strong relationships with schools, and had the most &quot;educational&quot; software titles.<p>3. 80-column mode. I know there were ways to achieve it on a C64, but what percentage of titles supported it? Additionally, a lot of folks had their C64s hooked up to crappy TVs that couldn&#x27;t display it.<p>4. The C64&#x27;s superior graphics and sound ability hurt it in the minds of many consumers. It was cheaper than an Apple II, but as far as parents were concerned that was still a <i>lot</i> of money to pay for a &quot;game machine.&quot; Whereas the even more expensive Apple II, with a better selection of educational and &quot;serious&quot; software, was seen more as an investment in a child&#x27;s future.<p>---<p>I can tell you that in <i>our</i> household, #2 and #4 were why my (non tech savvy) parents bought us an Apple. They wanted me to have &quot;what schools used.&quot;<p>Did they make the right choice? Well, the Apple IIgs we got was definitely underwhelming. Obviously a C128 or Amiga would have been better for gaming and writing fun stuff. But, our local school district did use Apples back then. So it was kind of an advantage for me, to have one at home.')
