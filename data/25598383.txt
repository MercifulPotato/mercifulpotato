Your project management software, one of the flagship features of which is reporting - now tells you essentially &quot;no work is being done&quot;. Somebody in management panics, the team is told to get its act together and some variation of &quot;improve the numbers&quot;. Yet features are getting shipped and clients are happy. The two most frequent (bad) options teams take to get out of this are:<p>1) Ignore the burndown chart &#x2F; any other reports. Everything is fine on the business side, so let&#x27;s just accept that the reports are broken and not spend time trying to fix them.<p>2) Have everyone invest more time into using the system (usually on an ongoing basis), so that it produces the correct looking down-and-to-the-right chart.<p>The problem is that with #1, the software is arguably not producing much value, if any. The problem with #2 is that you&#x27;re spending extra energy and effort to make the software happy, even though outside of the software it seems like your team is working well, shipping features and keeping customers happy - all of which are more important than a pretty graph.')
