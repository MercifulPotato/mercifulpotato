Do you think the reason theyâ€™re still running is because of some jurisdiction issue?</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure about the implication of your words. But, clearly, Elsevier has already tried to take legal actions against LibGen previously, and once in a while, LibGen&#x27;s domain names are still being blocked and routinely replaced, just like Sci-Hub. I&#x27;d still say the reason it&#x27;s still running is a jurisdiction issue, or let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s a geopolitical issue, it&#x27;s using Russia to shield itself away from US influences.<p>But an IPFS gateway hosted in the United States by Cloudflare does not enjoy these legal and political benefits.')
