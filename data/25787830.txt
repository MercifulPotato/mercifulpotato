Maybe it&#x27;s because isolate rings like a chemical name? It&#x27;s especially funny when considering that folks appear to be fussy about finding a natural-enough vegan protein source to make <i>meringues</i>, the other half of which is white sugar anyway, aka refined sucrose if you wanted to give it a chemical name, and IMO a quite &quot;unnatural&quot; product to begin with')
