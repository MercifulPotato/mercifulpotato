Pfizer does not have their cash balance invested in other stocks.  Ability&#x2F;willingness to pay a dividend has to do with excess cash.<p>To the extent there&#x27;s any relation, it&#x27;s a <i>high</i> stock price that discourages paying a dividend.  If the dividend yield will be basically nothing, why bother spending down precious cash that could be reinvested (because obviously the market values future cash flows a lot more than current ones).<p>Deflation might encourage a little bit of holding of corporate cash rather than spending it on R&amp;D, sure.  But even then I think you&#x27;re overstating the case.')
