Slowed movements put you in the path of fewer people, especially in a pre-modern environment (say, hunter-gathering). The natural inclination of a depressed person is, afaict, not to leave the house at all.<p>&gt; Flat affect reads as ingratitude.<p>Only matters in a particular type of social environment, which a person suffering depression would likely rather avoid.<p>&gt; Emotional deadening tends to leave you with the one emotion that will get you in the most trouble, anger.<p>This doesn&#x27;t square with any account of depression I&#x27;ve ever heard. I think it&#x27;s an entirely different kind of deadening.<p>And it&#x27;s not about &quot;submissiveness&quot;. If you&#x27;re getting that from the one example in the article, I don&#x27;t think you understood it. I think the theory is that depression is about avoiding negative stimulus&#x2F;continuing damage&#x2F;trauma. &quot;Conformation&quot; as the prime way to avoid damage, rather than staying out of the way of predators or, I don&#x27;t know, conserving strength after an injury, is extremely modern. Depression can get behind sugar-craving in the line of things that just recently became maladaptive.')
