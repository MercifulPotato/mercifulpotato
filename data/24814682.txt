If you need a structural change, make a migration and deploy it properly; if you need an urgent ad-hoc fix to data for some reason (which you hopefully shouldn&#x27;t need to do very often), then do that temporary privilege elevation thing; perhaps it&#x27;s just &quot;symbolic&quot; but it can&#x27;t be done accidentally.')
