In the JSVM world, we were forced to optimize for this and optimize we did (otherwise page loads would suck). I suspect that Zing with the ReadyNow thing is way better than normal Java, but I don’t know if it’s better than what JSVMs do. It’s probably still way worse if you’re not cached. It might be better in the cached case but then again JSVMs also save some profiling in the cache (JSC definitely does). That suggests that JVMs can probably improve further. No reason why Java - an overall very performant language - should start slower when uncached than JS. I suspect this will get fixed since AOT is a thing now, but getting start times right is about way more than just JITing less.')
