Take a look at the stark difference between campaign finance reporting for individual candidates, and everything else.<p>Your last bit is a loaded question. If an entity&#x27;s business <i>is</i> lobbying, then obviously they can engage in lobbying. But they could only be funded by individuals, not companies whose business is other-than-lobbying.')
