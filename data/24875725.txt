Certainly they are in some cases. Ants are able to physically perceive us. So if aliens aren&#x27;t using some means of passive remote sensing to study us then I don&#x27;t see why we wouldn&#x27;t also notice them (though they may have good reason to not use active means). Sure, the ants aren&#x27;t aware of what <i>why</i> we&#x27;re hanging out around them, but they are aware of us.')
