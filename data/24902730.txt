It&#x27;s very interesting.  I&#x27;ve always viewed freedom of speech from a purely personal liberty perspective but you are right that it also creates an opportunity for the rest of society to hear and react to that speech.  For better or worse.<p>I&#x27;m not totally comfortable with this because it creates a situation in which people may be compelled to speak or reproduce the speech of others for the supposed benefit to society.<p>This is a very interesting perspective I will continue to consider.')
