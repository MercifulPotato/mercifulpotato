Then we can all keep learning (and also kick the can down the road a bit regarding the part where we degenerate into flaming spears and tribal warfare).<p>I get that the GP comment was also a provocation without much information in it, but these things are matters of degree, and the right direction to go in response to provocation is exactly the opposite to the way your comment went.')
