So if you want to be &quot;as good as PGP&quot;, there is no need to learn those concepts.<p>The &quot;safety numbers&quot; concept does need to be learned, but I think it is way easier to explain than PGP key management.<p>The goal is not to have the perfect system, it is to have something better than PGP.
