The existence of the Altwork station and especially the 3-8 generations means that Paul could essentially avoid all the ergonomic decisions and many of the technical ones too... until he comes across something that doesn&#x27;t work for him. But it saves a lot of time having something to crib from!<p>In some ways this is like a code refactor - different tools, aiming to make it cheaper&#x2F;more efficient, but using the R&amp;D knowledge from previous iterations. Given the state of the software industry I&#x27;m just glad he didn&#x27;t get tempted to use Svelte somehow.')
