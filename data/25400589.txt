Prisoners is very good though more ordinary in its plot and characters and I found that I forgot about it after a while and didn&#x27;t realize I&#x27;d seen it until I was rewatching it... It&#x27;s not especially tense but it&#x27;s well written. Drive is an incredible noir thriller. Goodfellas is another one that has unforgettable moments that will force you to just clench your fists, even if in the end the story left me feeling a bit empty. I should probably throw out American History X too, which is a different sort of movie but still has that feeling of &quot;oh my God did that just happen?&quot;')
