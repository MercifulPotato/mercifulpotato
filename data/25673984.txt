And for that matter, Intel has excellent compilers and profilers too.<p>All it takes is looking at what&#x27;s going on in commonly used code, deciding to optimize for X, Y, and Z, and commit to it. If Intel isn&#x27;t doing this already, that&#x27;s all the fault of current management for not making it a priority.<p>The only way that Apple&#x27;s vertical integration helped them make that management decision is that they were able to say &quot;our customer is a typical laptop user.&quot; Intel tries to cater to much larger markets, so perhaps when management goes to plan a laptop chip, they are less aggressive with deciding to optimize. But I have a feeling that Apple&#x27;s optimizations are <i>generally</i> good for nearly all code, not just for specific use cases.')
