Item(by='Erlich_Bachman', descendants=None, kids=[25968616], score=None, time=1612001675, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25966292, text='&gt; I have a tendency to feel these tools only negatively impact people who use them in stress-creating ways<p>I came to the same conclusion. It is much easier to blame some internet website (which is basically just some pixels on a screen) instead of figuring out internal psychological reasons for being addicted. If a person is looking for addictions, they will find them. If it won&#x27;t be facebook, it will be porn, binge-watching, sugar, compulsive excercise, compulsive talking, etc. etc. The list is endless.<p>I just don&#x27;t buy an idea that some pixels have more responsibility for their choices than the person itself does.<p>Also when they start mentioning &quot;dopamine&quot; it makes me laugh. Brain just doesn&#x27;t work that way. Dopamine doesn&#x27;t make you do things, you make you do things. Dopamine is just a way for the brain to encode whatever you like. If you want to be addicted to facebook - it will encode facebook. If you want to have a healthy life - you&#x27;ll get your dopamine exactly the same way when you get up in the morning, look outside and just think for yourself &quot;this is a beautiful day&quot;, or when you solve a particular puzzle in your work, or when you say hi to a stranger. Brain has no shortage of dopamine and it is you who decide when it is released. Unless you are addicted of course. But don&#x27;t blame the thing, work with the addiction instead, it&#x27;s the only truthful way to stop being addicted.<p>Now, for some people who are highly addicted, quitting facebook completely - might be a good thing. Like for an alcoholic, it might be good to quite 100% of alcohol for a while. But it doesn&#x27;t mean that a healthy person can easily enjoy a glass of wine every now and then and don&#x27;t have any problems with it.')
