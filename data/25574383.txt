Item(by='toast0', descendants=None, kids=[25576211], score=None, time=1609273286, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25573550, text='&gt; Indeed, but even if 20% of people don&#x27;t get their second shot on time<p>I think my worst case expectation is much worse than yours.<p>With a two week production shut down, I expect my corner of the world would not get new shipments for more than two weeks; higher priority places would be getting their previous orders filled before us, and we&#x27;d only get more once the backlog was filled. Also, I fully expect any production will take at least a week to be made public, so too late for an eager dosing regimine to start holding back.<p>Keep in mind, we&#x27;re in winter, and winter storms often cause logistical problems.<p>The one dose efficacy data is too low confidence to make good decisions with. I&#x27;m open to the argument that it&#x27;s better to use two doses to give two people one dose than to give one person two doses, but it would have been nice if that was trialed. There&#x27;s also a related question of if you have a dose, if it&#x27;s better to give that to a properly timed first dose recipient, or to give it to someone who hasn&#x27;t received a dose yet. Again, there&#x27;s not quality data; I would lean towards following the trial parameters.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s precisely where the government can step in and ensure that antibiotics therapies are available to workers in those facilities as well as daily tests.<p>Where has this suddenly competent government been for the past year? Yes, we expect a new executive in the US in a month, but the handoff takes time in normal conditions, and we have reason to believe this one will be more abrupt than many.<p>How do antibiotics help for covid?<p>How do daily tests help avert a shutdown when you can spread the disease while testing negative? One person could infect most of a shift of workers, given the right circumstances; more than one shift if they do handoff work to the next shift.<p>Supply chain workers for the vaccine aren&#x27;t in the priority lists for the vaccine either. Anyway, covid isn&#x27;t the only communicable disease possibility.')
