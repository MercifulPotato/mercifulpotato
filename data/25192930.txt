Managing a lot of certificates gets out of control pretty quickly and if they build a system with decent hierarchical authentication you can start to see a situation where large companies might opt to use them for most (or all) certificates.  Put another way, imagine being able to log into your dashboard, create a sub-user and assign permissions for that sub-user to issue certificates for subdomain.example.com.<p>You can limit certificate issuance to a single issuer via CAA in DNS, so you could set your domains to use ZeroSSL exclusively and ZeroSSL could validate ownership of a domain to allow you to create that hierarchy.<p>I can think of a lot of value added services that can be sold alongside SSL certificates.  One example would be CTLog monitoring including for lookalike (FACEB00K) issuances.<p>The other thing with SSL is that a lot of people equate it with domain security, so I think there&#x27;s a certain level of domain monitoring that could be sold alongside certificates.  Things like domain expiration monitoring, registration of lookalike domains, NS changes, DMARC reporting, etc. all start to feel like a single &quot;domain security&quot; service.')
