Which makes sense; the increasing ability of programs to actually scale beyond four cores means that multicore should get more importance.  And so they changed the influence of multicore numbers from 10% to... 2%.  Not only was it a blatant and ridiculous move to hurt the scores of AMD chips, you got results like this, an i3 beating an i9 <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net&#x2F;jDJP8prZywSyLPesLtrak4-970-80.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net&#x2F;jDJP8prZywSyLPesLtrak4-970...</a><p>And there was some suspicious dropping of zen 3 scores a week ago, too, it looks like.')
