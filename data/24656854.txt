From the District Court level, you have the right to an appeal to the relevant Circuit Court of Appeal. (By contrast, you don&#x27;t have the right to an appeal from the Circuit Court level to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court gets to decide which appeals it wants to hear and only a small minority get accepted.)')
