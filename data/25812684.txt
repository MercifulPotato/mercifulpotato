A decentralized version of Signal might not be necessarily more reliable. What do you do when your Matrix home server is down? Will you still be able to log in? Receive messages? Is this overall system more stable if only 90% of the network work all the time?<p>Apart from that, most non-technical users won&#x27;t care about it, and a decentralized solution might not be as convenient for them. It also might open up other attack vectors, like compromised servers in the network and stuff like that.<p>Signal is probably the best solution for now.')
