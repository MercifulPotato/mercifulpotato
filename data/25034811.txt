So yes, there are different 20kg bags of fertilizer in the shed. Ammonium nitrate being NPK 34-0-0 (wiki), I think I can get pretty close to that with boosting fertilizer (like 25-5-5 or something). The point is that one could write a hit piece with only &quot;true&quot; information about me. I even have both &quot;rightwing&quot; and &quot;leftwing&quot; extremist propaganda in my house!
