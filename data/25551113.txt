I’m basically as Remain-y as it’s possible to be, but the post-Brexit issues are:<p>• Mutual recognition of qualifications: usually not as important in software as what you do after your degree, but even when it is the “engineer” in “software engineer” isn’t a protected term.<p>• Customs and border controls: solution for software is “the internet!”<p>• Work visas when visiting the content from the UK: apparently not needed for short business trips?<p>• Work visas for those going to the UK: IIRC the UK wants a minimum pay threshold such that most of us would reject a pay offer that low even straight out of university.<p>• Pay&#x2F;living costs: possibly a real issue — as others point out, the UK is already not very competitive for pay and London is somewhat expensive.<p>•• Regarding pay: while the exchange rates may swing sharply in the next few months, I expect that a year from now they will mostly be close to the current values.<p>•• Regarding living costs: if it hasn’t been for COVID, I’d have expected housing costs to go down and everything else to go up (when measured in £), given COVID I have no idea what to expect.<p>I’d actively try to dissuade you if you were doing anything involving hardware, chemicals, medicine, law, space, or food; and I’d still put 5% on this developing like the Northern Ireland Troubles; but software as a particular domain is probably either fine, or at the very least the problems will be unrelated to Brexit.')
