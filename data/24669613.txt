But does anyone else desire for simple things in your personal life? I drive an old truck, have new(er) speed queen washer&#x2F;dry, a dumb fridge, no cable box, dumb(maybe just old) t.v.s, etc?<p>A few years ago I bought a toothbrush that had an app. This was a moment in my life ill never forget. I was using my phone to brush my teeth... I have since started removing &quot;smart&quot; and &quot;connected&quot; things from my life.<p>Partly because I create software that always has problems and partly because I know the complexity adding computers to everything adds...<p>I love simplicity these days. Im thinking of getting one of those dumb phones too.')
