To me it seems like the Armco is just a bad barrier for that part of the track, because when he hit it, his car penetrated between the horizontal parts of the barrier, but the chassis was torn in half when it encountered resistance from the upright support beam (which really should have given way as well).<p>I don’t know if this Armco wasn’t up to spec, but the way this barrier performed, it made the crash as bad is it could possibly have been. Compare this crash to LeClerc binning it at a similar speed&#x2F;angle into the tire barrier at Monza.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;K0WzAatudAo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;K0WzAatudAo</a><p>It seems that literally any other sort of barrier would have performed better here, and since this is a fast part of the track, you’d typically expect this to be something that had already been considered.')
