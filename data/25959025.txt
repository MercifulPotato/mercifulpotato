If there is a stronger consensus that it&#x27;s an outgassing comet, then money&#x2F;time&#x2F;resources will be invested in looking for evidence of that. Likewise, of the consensus is that it&#x27;s a probe, those same resources will be invested differently.<p>This is actually Avi&#x27;s argument for considering the probe hypothesis. He&#x27;s not trying to prove it was a probe, he&#x27;s making a case for investing resources into experiments that could detect probes and industrialized alien civilizations, as opposed to detecting new classes of comets.')
