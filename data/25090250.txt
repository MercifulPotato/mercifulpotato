It&#x27;s an excellent reference, but if you&#x27;re just getting started reversing, Eidad Eilam&#x27;s _Reversing_ is still a good choice.<p>Part of the reason I keep saying this is, if you&#x27;ve done reversing work with IDA or Hopper, you can fumble your way to productivity with Ghidra without a book. So: if Ghidra is completely greek to you, start maybe with fundamentals.')
