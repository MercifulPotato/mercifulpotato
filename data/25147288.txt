I found it quite funny that I could buy access to UK ministers for a pittance, while if I had to do the same in India, I would have had to consistently fork over a lot more and sell my kidney along with it. It&#x27;s funny how you could get access to the PM for just 50k GBP a year, even less if it&#x27;s a Labour PM, or how you can get access to Rishi for 25k GBP a year. It&#x27;s also the reason why a lot of donors are Russian or Arab.')
