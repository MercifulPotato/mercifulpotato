For others it&#x27;s a whole new world that they won&#x27;t leave. For example, got an Oculus for the gimmick and didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be so attached to it, but I cannot go back to playing any flight or racing simulator without it again, it&#x27;s simply not the same. I tried the new FS2020 briefly on launch, but had to go back to X-Plane as FS2020 still doesn&#x27;t support VR headsets.')
