And when you realize that you can&#x27;t even give them a shot because you know that even if they&#x27;re decent there won&#x27;t be any resolution or closure in the form of a series ending then it makes you not wanna even start to watch them.<p>Seriously, they should fund less shows but really make sure they&#x27;re quality shows. They should act like HBO in short.')
