Item(by='DubiousPusher', descendants=None, kids=[25445215], score=None, time=1608138938, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25444256, text='&gt; worthwhile to recycle<p>People say this implying that there is something about the material which makes it inherently &quot;worthwhile&quot; and that&#x27;s just not true anymore. Recycling has advanced quite a bit and these days what makes things not &quot;worthwhile&quot; to recycle can have as much to do with how they are designed and disposed as with the utility of the underlying material.<p>A cottage cheese tub is made from recyclable plastic but it&#x27;s not &quot;worthwhile&quot; for a recycler to collect them if they aren&#x27;t rinsed. Cardboard is useful but moreso if flattened. Though not at all if a plastic liner is still glued inside.<p>I encounter people all the time not knowing if a thing is recyclable and if so how to prepare it. The worst part is that people often even put extra effort into recycling but because they don&#x27;t understand how the recycler consumes the items they actually harm the recycler with improper disassembly.<p>You could have one icon for things like pop cans and milk jugs which are recyclable without modification. Similarly, there could be icons for compound packaging. You might have a symbol that means a box must have a plastic liner removed and the box be flattened. The important thing is consistnecy.<p>People might even begin to shift their shopping habits towards products that came in easy to recycle packages. But consumers can&#x27;t even really index on that currently because they have to get pretty educated on their local recycler&#x27;s practices to know this.')
