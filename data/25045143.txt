You should avoid it in performance constrained situations. And you only should avoid <i>calling</i> malloc. It&#x27;s not necessarily a problem to <i>use</i> these allocations in those situations. That&#x27;s quite unlike Java, unless you&#x27;re a GC wizard, and I&#x27;m not sure how far even those wizards can circumvent problems.<p>Second, to my knowledge it&#x27;s still very cumbersome to avoid GC allocations in Java. By comparison, it&#x27;s easy to reduce calls to global heap allocators in C.')
