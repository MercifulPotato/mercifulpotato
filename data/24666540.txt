If my laptop&#x2F;password is compromised, then they still can&#x27;t log in because they need my secret token from the yubikey.  Well, if having that secret token is just one curl call away if they&#x27;re on the same network then its no longer a very physical and intentional safeguard.<p>I know... layers of unlikelihood.. but I&#x27;d probably opt for a physical &quot;good button&quot; gapped from my computer as sort of a closed electrical extension of my finger.')
