I have a working thesis that if a person believes something will happen &quot;inevitably&quot; then that person will have a greater disposition to do horrific things in the name of &quot;inevitability&quot;. Zizek has pointed out that the belief in the inevitability of global communism allowed hard core communists to commit atrocities. Communism worked through them, they believed. Capitalists do something similar when they help destroy the environment or help exploit workers. They believe that if they don&#x27;t do it then someone else will.')
