Everyone refers to them by their full name. Nobody mistakingly calls them &quot;PostgresDB&quot; or &quot;ClickhouseSQL.&quot;</i><p>… and yet that article misspells <i>both</i> of them, consistently not calling one of them by its full name (though it acknowledges this in the fourth footnote, with the relevant history).<p>Postgres is actually PostgreSQL.<p>Clickhouse is actually ClickHouse.<p>Gluing two words together guarantees that a significant percentage of your users will misspell it. (I’m categorising incorrect capitalisation as a misspelling.) Some will follow the declared spelling, and some will incorrectly capitalise, regardless of what you declare to be true, either introducing spurious capitals or lowercasing authentic capitals.<p>Some entities change the spelling of their name over time. Some are inconsistent by accident, which I don’t really understand (I could never do it myself; yet I observe it happens quite commonly). But you know what really grinds my gears? When the original source is <i>deliberately</i> inconsistent in its spelling, refusing to declare a canonical spelling, as is the case with sauceHut.')
