In bilking the public, the publishers restrict access to scientific knowledge. This restriction delays and limits progress. While any individual hinderance is minor, this is repeated millions of times over. The lost progress is lost to you, as much as to everyone else. How can anyone support parasites who hurt the whole of humanity and don&#x27;t even have the decency to pay the scientists whose work they profit off? Piracy in this case is not only acceptable, it is a moral imperative.')
