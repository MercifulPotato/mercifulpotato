At traffic lights, there are normally the usual car traffic lights (red, yellow and green), and then &quot;pedestrian traffic lights&quot; that face the crosswalks. The pedestrian traffic lights usually light up white in the shape of a person when you have the right of way to cross the crosswalk, or they show a red hand if you do not have the right of way.<p>For crosswalks not at an intersection (typically when there is several hundred feet of road without an intersection for crosswalks), I believe pedestrians always have the right of way. Sometimes they have a button you can push that will activate yellow lights overhead so drivers know that you&#x27;re crossing (primarily useful at night). I think you have the right of way regardless, but given how little attention many people pay, I tend to treat them like I&#x27;m jaywalking anyways.')
