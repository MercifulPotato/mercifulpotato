I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s more common ground if you look just at policy.</i><p>It won&#x27;t force bad faith actors to cooperate, regardless of any common ground between voters because they, as the GP said, won&#x27;t hold their politicians to account. Acting as the opposition even when they&#x27;re in power is built into the party at this point, as demonstrated by the President&#x27;s many legislative failures starting with the ACA repeal. It&#x27;s just wishful thinking and I&#x27;m hoping enough people are done with the feel good woowoo.')
