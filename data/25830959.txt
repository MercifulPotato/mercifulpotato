However, I think this is the case because the drawings are largely terrible. For one of the challenges that I saw, I couldn&#x27;t beat a very well-drawn giraffe with a solid color. Of course, it&#x27;s possible that for that particular challenge a different color from the standard pink would have been more highly rated.')
