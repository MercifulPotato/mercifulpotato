Even in Europe (I live in Hungary), I can feel all this happening, the false creation of enemies, let it be inner or external. There is always some fight we have to win, airing in the mostly state related media. And one by one every institution is grinded into the system, by small or big changes in the constitution, hinding under other less controversial laws, changes, usually proposed a day or hours before the parliament votes on it. And the only thing I can think about now, is to move out of the country, like a coward.')
