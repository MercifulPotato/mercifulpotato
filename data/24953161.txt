Excel is a bad example because it&#x27;s closed-source and does not put a developer building a solution on top of it on equal footing with its creators. Wordpress is probably the best example here; if it does 90% of what someone wants, it may be easier to add that 10% than to use a different solution.<p>I&#x27;d be surprised, however if there aren&#x27;t solutions written in other languages that provide that same 90% in most cases. None of them are as famous, but that shouldn&#x27;t hinder someone working as a consultant to help small businesses get online.')
