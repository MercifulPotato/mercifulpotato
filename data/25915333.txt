Just one of many who took a diamond-handed bet on a lowly priced stock to be the 0.0001% of those who became multi-millionaires as soon as the short were squeezed up to $155 a share. Well played to that guy and others who didn&#x27;t sell and got in very early.<p>As soon as it&#x27;s reported on the news, for that stock at least it is probably too late to get in.<p>&gt; more than any of the jealous fucks here will make in their lifetime working their miserable engineering jobs and afraid to take any risks in life<p>I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;re spot on. But I&#x27;m sure that some may say it is less risky to work at those FAANMG companies than it is to go all in your life-savings into meme stocks. (TSLA, GME, etc.)<p>On the other hand, building startups is also very risky, via the VC route or bootstrapped route. Depending IF you attract VCs to invest in it, its either you get acquired for &gt;10x or IPO (might become a multi-m&#x2F;billionaire), or you return their money or go completely bust.<p>Some play it safe whilst they watch others take risks.')
