Sound, maybe. Or chemoreception. Possibly even eye-like structures.<p>&#x27;eye-like structures&#x27;?!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1016&#x2F;j.tplants.2016.07.008" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1016&#x2F;j.tplants.2016.07.008</a>:\nAlthough plants are sessile organisms, almost all of their organs move in space and thus require plant-specific senses to find their proper place with respect to their neighbours. Here we discuss recent studies suggesting that plants are able to sense shapes and colours via plant-specific ocelli.<p>Cannot access the study but this sounds fascinating!')
