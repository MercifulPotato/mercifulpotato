Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604929946, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25034607, text='&gt; Not sure people realize how much scale modern agriculture has.<p>I do, I&#x27;ve admitted to be obsessed with the topic and have spent a large part of my life dedicated towards it. Look at my posts to see what I&#x27;ve done.<p>&gt; Um, food riots were an absolute MAJOR thing in antiquity and right up until only very recently (&lt;50 years).<p>This is very disingenuous and deflecting comment. What is being argued here isn&#x27;t that food scarcity didn&#x27;t take place, for that one really should look towards currency debasement, peasant uprisings, and the clashes in slavery and indentured servitude as well caste systems and feudalism as the likely culprits. Disease and blight both Human as well as crop (like the potato famine) also play a significant part in this story.<p>But what is being argued is that the advent of CURRENT Ag practices, those reliant on those inputs, aren&#x27;t commonplace as you are making it out to be in the total History of Agriculture as a whole.<p>But it must be said that scale means nothing when the most obvious byproduct is disease (heart disease and diabetes kills more than thing else in the West and obesity has been endemic for some time) and destruction of the environment along with it. And that&#x27;s where we are.<p>&gt; Urban farming doesn&#x27;t work at scale.<p>Urban farming, logistically speaking, is pretty much how most of Europe was built. The wars changed a lot of the landscape of many Capitals and metropolitan areas and displaced many farms outwardly as distributions and supply chains expanded, but in my experience with 15+ European countries I lived&#x2F;worked in most of the country-side is built in such a way where the cities surround the farms&#x2F;orchards&#x2F;vineyards outwardly. They served as a sort of nucleus, which makes sense if you were going design a system to serve a growing population and it&#x27;s civilization.<p>The exception being coastal areas that seem to have a more spontaneous pattern about them, likely due to port city trade&#x2F;imports.')
