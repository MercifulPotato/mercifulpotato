The projects themselves are not a democracy, but they&#x27;re certainly not the same sort of ballgame as employment. If I decide my management chain is doing the wrong thing, there&#x27;s a huge personal cost to finding another job, and little guarantee it will be better. If I decide Linux is doing the wrong thing, I can just stop using it or contributing to it.<p>That is - the fact that Linux and Python have BDFLs is not the reason for their success. The fact that they have <i>effective</i> BDFLs who make sound decisions that actually work is the reason for their success. And the BDFLs only have power insofar as the community still believes in them - Guido stepped down and Linus has faced significant opposition.<p>BDFLs and traditional corporate governance are quite efficient, yes. But democracy doesn&#x27;t aim to be efficient; it promises to be pointed in the right direction. There&#x27;s no sense in going at 100x speed in the wrong direction. Democracy isn&#x27;t the only way to get there - if you have tangible data about leadership and where they&#x27;re pointed and how they make decisions, and the cost of switching is fairly low (so that you can keep pressure on leadership), that works too.<p>When was the last time you had any data about how effective your management chain would be when you started your job?<p>(I&#x27;m happy in my current job because I asked hard questions about management at each place I interviewed, and I found one where my own management chain seemed to have good people - but even so, only one person in my management chain is still the same as when I interviewed, so I still took a gamble, and I had far less data on any of them from a bit over a day of interviews than anyone has on Linus or Guido.)')
