But going to buy a good desktop (as I used to have 2 decades ago) I would rather buy a good mainboard with as many PCIe slots as possible (and no built-in devices if this were possible), the cheapest discrete cards for everything and upgrade them as I see fit. I doubt the cheapest&#x2F;used discrete card for anything is going to be worse or more expensive than a built-in non-removable version.')
