Somehow I am not &quot;getting into&quot; anything like I used to do with RPG maker back then. Mailing lists partially behave in similar ways and everything is organized in threads as well. Then there are specialized question and answer websites like stackexchange, which cover a lot of ground.<p>Still, I think I would enjoy getting back into some great forum with great community. Perhaps I should look for programming themed forums.')
