They run some of the major tech companies that produce products tech people love.<p>The difference is that top engineers have more options these days. They can choose to move into a high paying job at Google or Facebook where they don&#x27;t have to deal with abusive relationships with the CEO.<p>Instead, companies with abusive CEOs attract people with high ambitions who don&#x27;t yet have the skills and resume to walk into an easier, high-paying job. The CEO (ab)uses the ambitious, early-career people to extract as much work as possible before they burn out. The employees use the grind to level up their skills and resume to pivot into a better job later.<p>I worked for one such company early in my career. Turnover was high. It was basically a pipeline that either led to burnout or a cushy, high-paying job elsewhere if you could survive the abuse long enough to get an impressive resume out of it.<p>The catch is that none of us wanted to talk about how terrible the working environment was, because it would only devalue those lines on our resume. So instead we kept quiet and let everyone assume the famous tech company and CEO we worked for were actually amazing places to work. Anything else would be self-sabotage. It&#x27;s a strange cycle.')
