Just make sure to find one which is compatible with the size of your room (mine is in a big living room, so the smaller models weren&#x27;t fit).<p>It&#x27;s hooked to the system ceiling.  If you don&#x27;t like that look you can put them in a trap that comes down or use one of the newer, fancier, &quot;short throw&quot; ones.<p>The diagonal I have (for a few hundred bucks: 400 EUR IIRC) is something silly like about 350cm&#x2F;138inches. Movies, sports, video streaming (Youtube or similar), ...<p>In my case it&#x27;s the best solution: I love the theater feeling a projector gives and I definitely and positively hate the sharp and crisp pictures all these new TVs do give.  Every time I see one at a friend I simply cannot stand the experience.  And inversely: when friends come at home they&#x27;re always impressed by how good the picture is from my cheap 1080p projector.  I didn&#x27;t even bother with the wall: I just project the picture on a regular blank wall.  I didn&#x27;t even make the wall perfectly flat: I just painted it white myself (and not even with a projector-specific paint: I had no idea these existed when I painted the wall).<p>It&#x27;s getting used everyday since two years (had a 720p before that) and lamp use ain&#x27;t even a concern.<p>As a bonus it&#x27;s still trivial to find projectors without microphone listening to you 24&#x2F;7 and which aren&#x27;t sniffing on the HDMI ports.<p>Now I don&#x27;t doubt that in the future we&#x27;ll be graced with no other choice but &quot;smart AI projectors&quot;, but that day hasn&#x27;t arrived yet.')
