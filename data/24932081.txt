Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=[24932395], score=None, time=1603988171, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24931849, text='I agree with you, but at least the advice gives an idea of how some others approach finding work at that age.<p>It comes with the implication that it&#x27;s worth aiming towards similar, if you think you could, because it&#x27;s actually working for some people.<p>I.e. by being more aware of network-building, being a bit less afraid to mention your availability when getting to know people, having in the back of your mind that it&#x27;s actually good for your future prospects if you&#x27;re helpful and pleasant to people, being willing to play the slow &quot;keep in touch&quot; game, and the LinkedIn game, and maybe appreciate that it&#x27;s not entirely social BS, it&#x27;s actually kinda useful in the big scheme of things.<p>That doesn&#x27;t solve the problem for people who are lonely and struggling, but it gives an idea of a useful direction to start building in, from knowing it&#x27;s working for some people.<p>I will add a tiny bit of advice: It&#x27;s really ok if you don&#x27;t already have decades of networking and colleagues like some appear to.  You&#x27;re not at a permanent disadvantage.<p>If you have few friends and no colleagues, it will take a while but that while is measured in months and low years, and like anything, cultivating freelancing&#x2F;consulting connections is a skill you can get much better at with practice.  Get used to reaching out, like for example write to some of the &quot;freelancer wanted&quot; posts on HN, and write to people at companies who post something interesting, including C?Os and so on.  That&#x27;s kinda fun, because some of the people you end up talking with actually really enjoy human connections and are interesting people, and you are building their network too.  <i>To them, you are valuable, even if they don&#x27;t know why yet.  Some of them know this and are happy for the contact.</i>')
