And I&#x27;ve had dozens more experiences with people thinking they were taking acid when it was really 25I or something even worse (if it tastes like something, it&#x27;s not acid). When I was younger taking any drug anyone could get their hands on, I was usually in the latter camp. And I think very few people are privileged enough to <i>not</i> be in the latter camp as you don&#x27;t tend to have much control over the drugs you get. Most normal people might get like one &quot;acid contact&quot; their whole life and they&#x27;re taking whatever he has to sell them.<p>If you&#x27;re in the former camp (taking real acid), I have a truly hard time believing the anecdotes of bad things happening. And I think most anecdotes are actually stories from the latter camp. Just take a small dose and know that you can take the edge off with a beer if you really needed to.<p>But if you&#x27;re in the latter camp where you don&#x27;t even know what you&#x27;re taking, I&#x27;m not particularly surprised if something bad happens.')
