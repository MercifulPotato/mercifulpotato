If my Lambda code has a bug in it, which yes sure that happens, I can as part of my exception catching, put that message into a dead letter queue and process it later or report on it. No polling, no querying, I know exactly what went wrong and when.<p>Meanwhile, I don&#x27;t have to do things like &#x2F;make sure the ETL process is running&#x2F; or &#x2F;clear out a bunch of logs when a disk inadvertently fills up&#x2F; or any of those other stupid last-century compute problems. It&#x27;s just a far, far easier way of thinking about application development.')
