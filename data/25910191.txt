Google was one of the first companies explicitly encouraging this behavior (displaying &quot;Why delete email when you can archive it?&quot; when you tried to remove messages). After all, it&#x27;s not easy to be 100% whether you are going to need a particular document or not. And, given the fact that archiving is cheap, it seems more reasonable not to take the risk.')
