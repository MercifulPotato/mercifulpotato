The whole point of computers is to do things for people.<p>With physical messages, unsending has at least partial support. Before the mailman picks up from my porch, I can grab a sent message any time. If you FedEx the envelope, you can cancel before delivery. With a university&#x27;s mail system, you can get the receiving department&#x27;s admin to return something even later in the chain. And of course, you can always tell a recipient, &quot;Hey, I sent you the wrong box, just send that back.&quot;<p>The reason email doesn&#x27;t support unsending is not some essential property of messaging. It&#x27;s just that at the time our email protocol was defined, both our hardware and software was pretty primitive, so we locked in a very primitive model of messaging. But note that more modern systems, like Slack and Facebook Messenger, happily let you unsend things. And consequently, they&#x27;re effectively replacing email for most users.')
