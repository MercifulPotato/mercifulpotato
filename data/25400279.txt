For example: it’s seeming quite likely that our extreme, panicked reaction to this illness has killed a huge number of people.<p>How many more will die due to postponed cancer screenings, surgeries, and so on? How many children will be set back in their education, permanently? How many minority and low-income families will\nbe carelessly tossed into generational poverty? How does that number weigh against the people who have died from this virus? Have you even given it a second thought?<p>But sure, go be “sad” about people sharing documented facts, instead. It’s much easier than critical thought, and it lets you feel morally superior. I can see why you prefer it.')
