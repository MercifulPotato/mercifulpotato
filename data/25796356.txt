Quotes are evaluated by the shell; your program gets an argv.<p>(Yes, Windows is complicated by having two different built-in parsers for argv [CRT and shellapi] because the kernel itself doesn&#x27;t have a concept of argv. But if we&#x27;re talking about .Net programs then the runtime makes that choice and gives your entrypoint an argv, so again quote-evaluation is not in the program&#x27;s purview.)')
