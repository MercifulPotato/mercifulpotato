I assume it predates HN and Reddit, but unsure when it started.<p>&gt; It has never been the case that journalists have honored a right to public pseudonymity.<p>I imagine this could be answered empirically by finding articles -and the reaction to said articles- that revealed the true identity of a similarly situated pen-name writer. But I&#x27;ll take your word for it.')
