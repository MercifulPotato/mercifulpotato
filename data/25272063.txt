But folding by itself is essentially a physicochemical process. A protein will fold (or its mutant will misfold) within a cell just like it would do it in a test tube.<p>Don&#x27;t underestimate the role of structure prediction in human disease. There are proteins known to be involved in disorders where a structure has been impossible to determine by experimental methods (membrane proteins are a known example). And there are still plenty of barely characterized proteins where a structural model might shed light on their function.<p>&gt; Your body produces this string of protein sequences<p>A small nitpick: you meant &quot;string of amino acids&quot;. In other words, a protein sequence.<p>&gt; Sometimes -- like with egg whites -- it&#x27;s not.<p>Under the right conditions even proteins in coagulated egg white can be renatured.')
