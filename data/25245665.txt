Item(by='4bpp', descendants=None, kids=[25245939], score=None, time=1606663998, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25245438, text='I think you could make a good case that orphans with leukaemia are a stereotypical example of a utility monster, where the moral halo around them leads our society to waste tons of resources that would go much further doing something unglamorous like, say, free mass vitamin D supplementation. Would this rise to the level of criticism? Because I wouldn&#x27;t be particularly worried about making that statement and signing it with my real name. Sure, the Society for Saving Orphans with Leukaemia and the ten people who read their tweets may be very upset at me, but I doubt that my employment or social situation would be seriously threatened, I&#x27;d find my phone calls mysteriously redirected, be rejected at the US border or barred from flights altogether.')
