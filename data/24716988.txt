And all the password managers have a single point of failure. You lose your master key, you lose everything.<p>I’ve spent the last 5 years of soul searching to find a solution that does not rely on any trusted party. I built something for myself but you may also like it. So I’m sharing it with you and welcome any feedback.<p>All you need is a keepsake photo that you would anyway never lose. The solution works by transforming your memorable password using the photo to thousands unique passwords. The photo never leaves your device, and your memorable password stays only in your mind. That way, you can use&#x2F;reuse the same memorable password everywhere without worrying about anything.<p>If that sounds too good to be true, let me do this. Not only I will share my password with you, but also everything stored in the server. I even posted my keepsake photo online. Now, try to break my Gmail, instagram, or Github.<p>zhi.li@pepperword.com\nPassword: ziTJune\nDatabase record available at: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;zhili-ppwd&#x2F;810c091a4efb6d17c878e4cf42f0367f" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;zhili-ppwd&#x2F;810c091a4efb6d17c878e4cf4...</a><p>My keepsake photo posted to instagram: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;CFrYIBugZlP&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.instagram.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;CFrYIBugZlP&#x2F;</a><p>Live demo: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ybU9Jst2IhI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ybU9Jst2IhI</a><p>Obviously, I don’t encourage anyone to share their password, but I want to show you how we can make it irrelevant, and why the solution is secure, convenient, and private.
