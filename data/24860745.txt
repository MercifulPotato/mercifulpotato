Item(by='WorldMaker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603388381, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24855473, text='DreamWorks Animation, as one existing example, is still doing a lot major 2D projects (though certainly not &quot;traditional hand drawn&quot; as technology has shifted a lot post-Flash) as the animation house brand for Netflix these days. (She-Ra and Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts, as two recent examples.) At least in &quot;TV budgets&quot; 2D animation is seen as more than competitive again (though it was a much briefer period where all TV projects seemed to be CG, and 2D never really &quot;died&quot; in TV like it did in features) and it&#x27;s likely just a matter of time and aesthetic drive before someone (maybe even Disney) tries it again at the feature level. (Supposedly Rastetter was still pushing for it at Disney Feature Animation even after Princess and the Frog and right up to his ouster. Who knows when a successor will champion it as a priority.) It probably won&#x27;t be DreamWorks Animation today unless Netflix has some reason they want to do an animated feature. (It is an Oscar category they could compete in, if they need the motivation to push. Maybe less controversy in that category for winning as a streaming site than their battles over streaming versus theater in other categories.)<p>(ETA: Oh and I just remembered that Fox, the crazy Australian company not the parts of Disney formerly known as Fox, and its subsidiary Bento Box do have a full Bob&#x27;s Burgers feature film release on their schedule. Not that it entirely compares to the prestige of a classic DFA fairy tale based film, but there&#x27;s at least one attempt at a 2D animated feature film in the near future.)')
