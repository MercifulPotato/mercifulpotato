That might be right if you only count the brain, but then you would have to revise the neural network numbers to only count CPU and memory, which would easily halve those numbers (fans take a lot of power).<p>If we want to account for power supply, temperature control etc. we could use the entire calorie count of a human over 35 years, leaving us with around 30000kWh (assuming a health, not-overweight human). You could now argue that that&#x27;s too high (the human is doing a lot of other things). But as you pointed out it&#x27;s a bit of a pointless comparison anyways as humans don&#x27;t start from scratch.')
