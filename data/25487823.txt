Besides describing all the strange and unusual remissions of autoimmune problems that people experience after switching to a carnivore diet, he gave an account of his journey leading up to becoming a diet luminary.<p>He tells some really interesting stories about being a surgeon in iraq and then his surgical practice in the United States. Being a man who values results, he began to recommend lifestyle and diet changes to his Patients, finding that sometimes it even made surgery unnecessary. And according to him this upset the hospital. He went on to explain the surgeries are very profitable for hospitals and that because of this they are over-prescribed. People are having unnecessary surgery all the time.<p>Ever since then I have been keeping my eye out for further evidence if this is true or not. It strikes me as plausible.')
