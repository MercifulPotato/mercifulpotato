It lets high risk takers take on bigger risks (for the corresponding potential return), without taking up the required time.<p>It&#x27;s a misconception that many people have, that investing in the public markets is less useful to the economy than direct investment. Both play a critical role, and without one or the other, the capital markets will be _way_ less efficient.')
