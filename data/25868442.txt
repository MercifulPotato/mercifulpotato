The parameters of that union are spelled out in the Constitution -- you remove that Constitution at peril of the continued existence of that union.<p>Amendments, like the 17th, are one way to change that union, with the consent of those members of it -- but if you push too far there won&#x27;t be a union any more, because a portion of those states will walk away from a union no longer defined as they define it.')
