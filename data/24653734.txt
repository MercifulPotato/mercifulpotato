Like $15-$30 per seat more expensive in many instances.<p>They did pretty good business because many fights were booked through travel agents who would be able to explain that a flight that costs a bit more was worth it.<p>When flight aggregators arrived on the scene, people (casual fliers in particular) would almost without exception book the cheapest flight that was reasonably within their time preferences and without extra stops, if possible. Because there was no one to talk you into the better value of other airlines it became a race to the bottom. The edge these airlines had in selling comfort became obsolete and they mainly sold out to larger carriers during the airline consolidation of the early 2000&#x27;s.')
