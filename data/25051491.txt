Jump off a building?<p>Chronic pain sucks...but people fail to understand that some people suffer from high level of pain and that doctors often fail to manage it. I have tried many things to manage my pain, it is at a point where I for the most part get on with my life with some &quot;take it easy&quot; days. Unfortunately, the only thing that helps is opiates, and currently nobody wants to prescribe those. My primary does and 30 pills of low dose last me months. Still when I switched doctors they refused giving me opiates, even though all the other meds lyrica, cymbalata, gabapentin did nothing. A pain doctor offered ketamine treatments at $500....like that is reasonable on monthly basis.')
