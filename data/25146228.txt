It ties together early San Francisco&#x27;s extractive economy with late 19th century American imperialism and industrialization. The author argues that by the 1860s, Northern California and Nevada were already in San Francisco&#x27;s hinterland, but city leaders sought to bring the entire Pacific basin under the city&#x27;s dominion. The book covers mining, energy, armaments, and media as well as water. And it asks the same question as this essay: what were the costs, and was it worth it?')
