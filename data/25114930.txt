GitHub seems to have made up a 1201 notice-and-takedown mechanism out of thin air, with this mechanism serving as Microsoft voluntarily doing favors for other big corporations rather than the fulfillment of some kind of legal obligation.<p>I find the GitHub announcement deeply unsatisfying for that reason: GitHub is unilaterally inventing a body of &quot;law&quot; that&#x27;s going to meaningfully govern the lives of tons of developers in the future. This body of rules is &quot;law&quot; and not law because the entity doing the enforcement is GitHub and not some government, but GitHub still has enough power to cause injury if it decides it doesn&#x27;t like you.')
