The first two were a complete waste of time, the third one completely changed my life for the better (incidentally, this started out as couple&#x27;s therapy for my failed marriage).<p>It&#x27;s basically like in any profession: 80% are mediocre, 10% are so bad you never want to try again and the last 10% are the gold you&#x27;re searching for. There&#x27;s also a question of whether you go along with a certain type of person, but there&#x27;s also clearly excellence at work.<p>I knew I was onto something very early on. She went directly to work, stabbing into the wounds with massive empathy and brutal honesty. She described herself as her goal being &quot;getting rid of me as soon as possible&quot;, which contributed to my trust in myself not just being a money cow for her. But the most starring fact was that I couldn&#x27;t hide. She broke through all my layers and facades and went directly to the core issue of me not accepting myself as I am.<p>I think these are signals to watch out for (plus: a waiting list so long you usually don&#x27;t get a place with the good ones), so good luck and YMMV. In any case, it&#x27;s a pain finding a good therapist, but it&#x27;s still worth it.<p>But before you get or continue a bad therapy experience, be sure to try out Leo Widrich and his blog. He&#x27;s the only other therapist I didn&#x27;t see who helped me grow to being a better version of myself.')
