Classes were also recorded for later viewing. The arts &amp; sciences classes required textbooks. The professors were often co-authors of those books too. I donâ€™t think it is a coincidence that the quality of education was vastly superior at the business school. For more reasons than just using textbooks vs slide decks but that was a factor.')
