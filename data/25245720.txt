One annoyance though is the connection&#x2F;disconnection process should be more streamlined. When I leave my desk to wander around im always taking my phone with me but of course I would leave my laptop behind if I was using that instead. With my phone it was very annoying to disconnect, close things on my phone so it isnt eating battery, just to come back and have everything be out of wack.')
