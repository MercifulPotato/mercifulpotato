Item(by='amadeuspagel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604794220, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25018221, text='&gt; Weimar Germany did have hate-speech laws, and they were applied quite frequently. The assertion that Nazi propaganda played a significant role in mobilizing anti-Jewish sentiment is, of course, irrefutable. But to claim that the Holocaust could have been prevented if only anti-Semitic speech and Nazi propaganda had been banned has little basis in reality. Leading Nazis such as Joseph Goebbels, Theodor Fritsch, and Julius Streicher were all prosecuted for anti-Semitic speech. Streicher served two prison sentences. Rather than deterring the Nazis and countering anti-Semitism, the many court cases served as effective public-relations machinery, affording Streicher the kind of attention he would never have found in a climate of a free and open debate. In the years from 1923 to 1933, Der St√ºrmer [Streicher&#x27;s newspaper] was either confiscated or editors taken to court on no fewer than thirty-six occasions. The more charges Streicher faced, the greater became the admiration of his supporters. The courts became an important platform for Streicher&#x27;s campaign against the Jews. In the words of a present-day civil-rights campaigner, pre-Hitler Germany had laws very much like the anti-hate laws of today, and they were enforced with some vigor. As history so painfully testifies, this type of legislation proved ineffectual on the one occasion when there was a real argument for it.<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;news-desk&#x2F;copenhagen-speech-violence" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;news-desk&#x2F;copenhagen-speech-v...</a>')
