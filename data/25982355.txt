A couple of years ago I made a small experiment and cut out coffee completely for at couple of weeks and I noticed two positive things. One is toilet oriented and the other was that I found it significantly easier to fall asleep.<p>I&#x27;ve also sometimes tried something I read in a blog a long time ago. I think they said it was what the Marines did but I have no idea if it&#x27;s true. I&#x27;ll imagine I&#x27;m lying in a canoe on an almost still lake with a crystal clear sky. Focus really hard on imagining the clear blue sky and then start imagining the gentle rocking of the canoe by the lake. Keep focus on just those two things.<p>Zero science, pure anecdotal, so take it for what you will :)')
