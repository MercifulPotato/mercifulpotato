(One may need to define some custom datatype de&#x2F;serialization but not much)<p>If I had to say two things that I would like to get improved: \n1) better typing related to Reactive Forms and Angular Material (e.g. IIRC Material dynamic table definitions were declared in a way that it lost IDE navigation and static analysis) \n2) Faster compiling times, but we got this to be good enough for hot-reloading which matters most.<p>RxJS Observables with Push ChangeDetection was heavily used.<p>Personally just thanks for your contribution to make web developing more enjoyable!')
