The reality was that GM didn&#x27;t want to do it — they say it as a big distraction — but the company had to deal with their dealer networks, which would complain loudly if a variant of the latest hot model for some other emblem weren&#x27;t available for them.<p>Reading the article, I&#x27;m wondering if GM tried to induce as many dealerships as possible to ask for a buy-out. In the age of company-owned and branded stores — Tesla is like an Apple Store for cars — for every product category <i>except</i> cars, GM may be trying to claw its way to controlling the consumer experience for Cadillac, its marquee brand, from soup to nuts.')
