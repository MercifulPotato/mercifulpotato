It breaks the algorithm for reading new messages. I use it when teammates do, and acknowledge it&#x27;s useful sometimes, but I would prefer not to have that feature.<p>Discord also does not have threads. I&#x27;ve heard some complaints about it, but not many.<p>Threads in Zulip seem to change it into a different kind of app. I don&#x27;t see how the Slack workspaces that I&#x27;ve used heavily would work with it. There are about 15 channels in my sidebar. Making them nested would turn it into 75, assuming 5 threads per channel. Perhaps there wouldn&#x27;t need to be as many top-level channels with Zulip threads, but it makes it into a whole different paradigm. They are also missing Slack-style threads. I don&#x27;t think it would be good to adopt it.')
