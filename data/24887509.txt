So likely they&#x27;ve put a tiny light sensor in it that the microcontroller polls occasionally during the lowest power mode. That might be a tiny solar panel too. But using that to electrically drive an electronic power switch is tricky if you don&#x27;t have the budget for a custom ASIC; if you don&#x27;t have that budget, you&#x27;ll add a decent amount of weight in a device that tiny.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;m not at all surprised that they&#x27;ve chosen to accept a short shelf life instead. It&#x27;s pretty remarkable that they can squeeze that much functionality into a 11mm long by 3.5mm diameter cylinder.')
