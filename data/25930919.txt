From the very first access to tech has continually found opportunity to find toxic, negative communities (hentai, r&#x2F;teenagers, edtwt, sh, bdsm).  Any attempt to reduce results in hiding and lying.  The speed that a kid can change window or swipe away is ridiculous.  Literally can&#x27;t find a way that tech has benefitted her.<p>Another child (shy too), enamored with anything that teaches her more (tik tok, youtube, etc).<p>The big difference is that the second child isn&#x27;t looking for community.  The first child is looking for community but can only find community in echo chambers that reflect back teenage angst, and those echo chambers run deep.<p>I can only hope that the first child grows into an well adjusted adult, and while not social media, toxic and negative online communities are just simply too easier to slide into.')
