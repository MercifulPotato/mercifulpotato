I always found it way more intuitive than ffmpeg, but I have to admit that by now I&#x27;m more proficient with ffmpeg than I ever was with mencoder. Happy birthday ffmpeg, RIP mencoder.<p>Edit: just realized mencoder seems to be still alive and kicking. Thought it was lost in the transition of mplayer starting to use ffmpeg code -&gt; mpv... Have to take a look at mencoder and if it is as easy as I remember :)')
