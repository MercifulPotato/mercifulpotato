For starters if you want to go strictly by averages, the average household has two cars, so your 9.2kW goes to 18.4kW out of the gate.  Additionally that average includes teenagers which drives the mileage down, but households with teens tend to have more cars, so that means either they come out of the average or the 18.4 jumps to 27.6kW&#x2F;day.<p>The average household uses &lt;1200kWh per month.  Adding another 18kW per day increases power usage by almost 50%, which goes back to: the national power grid doesn&#x27;t have anywhere near 50% spare capacity.')
