It&#x27;s up in the air whether a different high-level language would have made those compilers feasible.<p>My day job involves supporting systems on Itanium: the Intel C compiler on Itanium is actually pretty good... now.  We&#x27;d all have a different opinion of Itanium if it had been released with something half as good as what we&#x27;ve got now.<p>I&#x27;m sure you can have a compiler for any language that really makes VLIW shine.  But it would take a lot of work, and you&#x27;d have to do that work early.  Really early.  Honestly, if any chip maker decided to do a clean-sheet VLIW processor and did compiler work side-by-side while they were designing it, I&#x27;d bet it would perform really well.')
