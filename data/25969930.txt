The problem for shoppers is that it&#x27;s almost impossible to know if what you&#x27;re being told is true, and most people have been burned by scummy sales practices too much to trust what a site is telling them since there&#x27;s usually no way to verify it. Is the stock really low? Is the sale really about to end? How would the shopper know whether it is or whether it&#x27;s a lie to trick them?')
