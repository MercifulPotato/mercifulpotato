Would you be ok with Silicon Valley de-platforming and doing everything in their power to silence the Nazi-opposition political party? And knowing what&#x27;s about to come, do you think the stance of &quot;they can build their own communication systems&quot; would be beneficial to humanity as a whole?<p>I&#x27;m aware this is kind of extreme but there are multiple responses that missed the point.')
