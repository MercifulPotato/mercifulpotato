I basically don&#x27;t tell people I meet in person &quot;I have (diagnosis).&quot; I have taken to telling kind of a little white lie that &quot;I have a paper allergy&quot; to explain my aversion to handling papers and even that has proven to be so much ridiculous bullshit that it is a factor in me quitting all my volunteer work.<p>It&#x27;s aggravating because my ATM asks me if I want <i>a receipt, no receipt or email me a receipt</i> and doesn&#x27;t need an explanation or doctor&#x27;s note or invasive chit chat as to why I prefer it emailed me. The paperless option in most settings is deemed to be the environmentally-friendly option and doesn&#x27;t require justification or putting up with lurid interest and harassing comments about my health, my lifestyle, blah blah blah.<p>I don&#x27;t want to discuss my condition under any circumstance anymore where I can&#x27;t just give people a link to explain X if I want to share info but don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time and effort repeating things I&#x27;m bored to death with repeating because while my condition and situation may be new to &quot;you,&quot; it sure as hell isn&#x27;t new to me, good god and please shut the hell up and leave me the hell alone.')
