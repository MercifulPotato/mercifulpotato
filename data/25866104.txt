Item(by='petejohnson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611271638, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25865600, text='&gt; Its arguable that Elastic simply hasn’t come up with an open-source compatible business model, and that’s fine. But its not Amazon’s fault.<p>Elastic has indeed found a profitable business model: they have their own cloud (cloud.elastic.co). But for it to be profitable they need to cover the costs of both developing the Elastic stack, and running a SaaS. AWS only has to cover the cost of running a SaaS (since they are getting the stack for free) which gives them a HUGE cost-wise advantage.<p>To counter this advantage Elastic is asking them to partner with them like other cloud providers do (Microsoft, Google, Alibaba etc) but AWS has refused to do that.<p>Isn&#x27;t it then fair for Elastic to restrict AWS from using their software?')
