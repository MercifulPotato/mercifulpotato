Long trips with an EV require planning due to missing infrastructure, longer &quot;fueling&quot; times, and shorter ranges.<p>But if we break out off the assumption that you can go anywhere any time in your electric car because there&#x27;s another option available (rental? ride sharing? public transportation?) and EVs are at least for now meant for shorter trips then it becomes less of an issue.<p>But you&#x27;re right - the freedom to just hop in an EV and go isn&#x27;t here yet. I look forward to when it is. Can&#x27;t come soon enough for me.')
