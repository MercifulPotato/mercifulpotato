This really encourages to move away from Macs. \nI do not wish to pay premium money for shitty equipment.<p>This 2015 model have just fallen apart, starting with screws that by some unknown to me reason where unscrewing themselves and you cannot not tight them back because some idiot made them non standard to make sure you really cannot do it, not even with the knife.<p>Then I discovered that screen has traces of buttons after closing the lid. Then I discovered those small traces are unremovable. Nice design.<p>Then battery even with a proper care died anyway after third of a cycles it suppose to have.<p>Then SD Card slot was reading only some of the cards, while cheap neighbour’s laptop had no problem reading all of them.<p>Then I discovered that connecting MBP to external monitor \ngets it heated too much to the level that loud funs make it unusable.<p>Then internal screen stopped working completely.<p>Then after some time this shit failed to  boot at all   ( even with external display).<p>I should also mention power cord ( with cheap plastic) that became yellow and was not always connecting , while it was carefully kept from banding too much.<p>HDMI that in critical situation did not work, with the best cable you can get.<p>Mac OS that was constantly confusing where the main screen is, forgetting the ‘mirror’ option at will and so on....<p>Overall the experience is horrible.<p>I have other models from previous years and nothing like that had happened.<p>And I am told MBP 15inch mid2015 is considered to be one of the best models from recent years, as after mid 2015 models are even worse, not mentioning lack connectivity that renders them useless for mobility I need.<p>So looking at the way Mac is made these days finally I hear something sane as I am not at all convinced they would continue to sell ‘tons of Macs’ in the following years otherwise.<p>I think only inertia saves them in such situation but for how long? In my case I cannot move from the platform now because naively I’ve decided to write a ‘proper File Manager’ for Mac. I am using what I wrote and I simply cannot live without it. I also cannot leave it unfinished as this would be a huge waste of effort. So I’ll have to finish it, and only then think of porting it to other platforms.<p>Right now I do not know even what do. Buy another 2015 one ?which  could fall apart just as this one did? Buy new model? But which new model? They do not even have a model I need and looking at the quality of the shit I was counting on ... well,  I see  really no good options. Those with \nTouch-bars are unacceptable, smaller screens then 15 inch too. I would actually wish 17 inch for work  in case some one sane from apple is reading. I wish model that have _all_ possible  connections including USB3 which are still around a lot so I would not have to think about those stupid issues and concentrate on my work. And I have a lot of work. This is the way and how it _should be_ with a  ‘proper laptop’.<p>Concentrate all _necessary_ ports_ on one left side at least pwr and video ports so I would not have dongkes or “Y” shape wires when you hold machine whike connected to external screen. Put only redundancy ports on the other side, and yes we need redundancy ports.<p>Bring magsafe back, this was good as long as the cable is not cheap-made so it can band nicely if required.<p>Having IRreceiver never hurts anyone especially those who have bought apple IR remote. I was using it when teaching tango for controlling music remotely so I do not have to run to the machine each time I wish to say something. It was so convenient, now for the same thing I had to make custom dongle with arduino.<p>There is no need for huge trackpad, the previous size was good enough and calming because you do not worry about  palm faulty touches.<p>Half sized left&#x2F;right keys where better then full sized, so you would not confuse them with alt-key. Why there is no ctrl on the right side? It inconsistent with left side and inconsistent with full-sized keyboards for muscle memory. And do not dare to remove it from big ones, please.<p>Oh yes, and  bring me back my line-in as separated socket! \nBig thanks to one ’smart genius’ who removed it in 2015 model, combining it with phones port. Also this ‘genius’ made sure to activate it _only_ automatically with Apple headphones to create as much troubles as possible to connect my guitar on the go.<p>More then that, when you connect phones to listen what you are recording, and already agree to stupidity of recording sketch through the mic instead of a proper line-in you cannot choose what mic to use. \nThus you cannot choose one built-in , so you end up recording with mic on the phones wire near your neck hitting your shirt or guitar as you play. ‘thank you very very very much’ for that. It has spoiled many good moods.<p>I wander about those who design those Mac Book Pro’s ... did they ever tried their creations or thought forward about real life situations and applications ? Or after Jobs there is no one who can do it and see how laptop should function?<p>If they so wish their touchbars, why not to put them _above_ function keys ?! Make option to turn them off completely if required so they would not disturb at night or stand on the way. \nThey never heard of people with muscle memory? It is that hard? Goodness, it’s so obvious. I can go on and on ...<p>I feel I was robbed really with this 2015 model, I wish I could use those money for something more useful ...')
