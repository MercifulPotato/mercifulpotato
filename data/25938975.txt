Item(by='tga_d', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611816519, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25935640, text='&gt;scientists who study Earth&#x27;s climate call themselves meteorologists<p>This is just incorrect. Meteorologists don&#x27;t study Earth&#x27;s climate, they study weather. Meteorologists don&#x27;t use ice cores or tree rings for their research, they study much shorter-term fluid dynamics. Climate scientists do study climate, and not weather. The disciplines are related (specifically, they&#x27;re under atmospheric sciences), but to dismiss either one as being less scientific is picking favorites despite all evidence to the contrary. I suppose you could use the synonym &quot;climatology&quot; if you want a word without &quot;science&quot; in it, but it seems like a pretty silly heuristic regardless.')
