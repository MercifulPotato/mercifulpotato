(Unless every single polling station with machines does a recount by hand for all elections from now on. But then it might put into question why we have the machines at all.)<p>This is similar to the common argument about voter fraud. Of course there was almost certainly basically no fraud to speak of in this election, like usual. (And that&#x27;s important to emphasize, especially right now.) But the way this overall topic tends to be approached in general is very odd, to me:<p>There&#x27;s a routinely used argument that concern about voter fraud is ridiculous because there&#x27;s essentially been no significant incidence of it in modern history. This isn&#x27;t unreasonable to bring up, but I think by itself is a very poor approach to risk assessment that&#x27;s reminiscent of early COVID predictions and 2016 election odds from many of the same people. Especially when some foreign intelligence agencies appear to be getting increasingly brazen, and when considering that for most of the history, voting was a lot less digitized.<p>There was almost no incidence of jets being deliberately flown into buildings as a form of WMD, until some people pulled out all their cards and exploited a &quot;0-day&quot;, doing as much damage as they could in a single effort before a &quot;patch&quot; could be deployed. And sometimes it&#x27;s simply a matter of no one making a serious, motivated attempt to do something until one day someone finally does.')
