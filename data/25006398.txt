Reviews of many such tools are filled with other issues like insufficient domain-filtering,lack of personalized content &amp; being distracting-eventually missing the purpose.<p>My question for you is if x were the ideal tool which made your tech news reading life easier,what features would you like to see in x ?<p><pre><code>  - Do you feel that the curated newsletters are a good for saving time OR despite having subscribed, you always found yourself lurking on news sites like Hackenews, Hackenoon, subreddits etc ? \n  - How do you keep tabs on the latest trends in your domain?\n  - How much of cynicism do you want in x? Should you just be served the meaningful content for your domains of interest OR you want to explore all the content to find something new &amp; interesting once for a while?Is it really worth the time &amp; effort?\n  - How do you feel about being charged for reading the otherwise freely available content?if yes, how much would you consider a moderate amount?\n  - Please give your suggestions &amp; pros&#x2F;cons for the tools which are you using for this currently, if any?\n</code></pre>\nThe HN community is brimming with wiser, experienced folks and being a novice, I&#x27;d love any kind of feedback form you.\nCheers!')
