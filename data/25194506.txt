Item(by='thomastjeffery', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606183864, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25176816, text='&gt; You&#x27;re asking for a different instrument, which would reduce hand spans to half their size when compared to an orthodox keyboard. This would change completely the tonality of the instrument such that it would be barely recognisable.<p>Nonsense.<p>This is a &quot;different instrument&quot; &quot;barely recognizable&quot; from the traditional piano? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=cK4REjqGc9w" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=cK4REjqGc9w</a><p>Having a different interface does not make something a totally different instrument. It&#x27;s still an assortment of keys that are pressed to swing hammers at an assortment of strings. We change the shape of the string assortment all the time, yet no one complains that an upright isn&#x27;t a piano because it&#x27;s &quot;barely recognizable&quot; when compared to a grand.<p>This also stretches well outside the realm of the piano. Everything from synthesizers to xylophones take on the traditional piano keyboard shape.<p>&gt; You need NO theory or notation to become highly proficient. This is no excuse.<p>I wasn&#x27;t presenting an &quot;excuse&quot;. I both know musical theory and am proficient. This isn&#x27;t about me. I was presenting the similar inefficiencies that exist in piano keyboards and western notation.<p>This is about every person who wants to learn a piano. They are all confronted with an antiquated and inefficient interface for no reason outside tradition.')
