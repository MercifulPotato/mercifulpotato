They don&#x27;t clog. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I don&#x27;t tend to wash baked-on lasagne from myself in the shower as happens in a dishwasher. I think it would largely be dust and the like if it wasn&#x27;t left to build up.<p>I&#x27;m guessing no one in your household has long hair. my hair will clog any shower without a decent drain grate in a week or two.')
