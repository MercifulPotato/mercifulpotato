Coal is getting on for 1 gram per watt-hour. (Usually this will be stated as 1000g&#x2F;kWh). So 793g is indeed very bad, but it&#x27;s not unusual for a country that&#x27;s burning so much coal. Poland likewise, big coal mines, coal power electricity dominates.<p><i>But</i> notice that this is proportional. Queensland is a pretty big place, but it&#x27;s only making about 4-5GW of electricity. Whereas a power district in the US might have 20+GW of coal power stations, so even if it&#x27;s also got 10GW of wind or nuclear or whatever, that&#x27;s many times more actual pollution.<p>Warming doesn&#x27;t care how efficient we are, the totals matter. So in that sense getting from 5GW of coal in Queensland to 1GW of coal in Queensland (an 80% reduction) would make less difference than MISO in America going from 25GW to 20GW (just 20% reduction).')
