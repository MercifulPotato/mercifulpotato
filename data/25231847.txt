Item(by='kazinator', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606505361, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25230093, text='&gt; <i>It&#x27;s difficult to justify a bike that&#x27;s thousands when an annual bus pass might be a few hundred.</i><p>- A bike is not <i>annually</i> thousands. A good quality bike will last you a decade or more. Not with $0 maintenance, but not hundreds per year.<p>- Commute times on a bike are shorter than the bus. I&#x27;m not even talking e-bike now. Due to traffic congestion effects (that hardly affect bicycles at all), you can beat even automobile commuting on a plain human-powered bike. With the e-bike in the equation, it can be no contest. You can go 40-50 km&#x2F;h for most of the commute, and zip around bumper-to-bumper traffic like it&#x27;s not there.<p>- Convenience: hop on it and go anywhere you want, at any time. No waiting. E.g. go out for lunch in the middle of the workday.<p>- Transit is a good place to catch viruses from people. Complete non-starter in this pandemic.<p>- Transit is a good place to be assaulted, robbed and exposed to cigarette smoke.<p>- The bike offers freedom from irritating and depressing exposure to people from socially incompatible classes. (Well almost; there are some drivers out there: but you&#x27;re not sitting next to them for 30 minutes.)')
