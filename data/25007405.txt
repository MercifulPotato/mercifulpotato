It&#x27;s a technical course in a management school, it&#x27;s not for programmers. It&#x27;s not as in depth as it could be because that&#x27;s not what it is intended for. This should be exactly what the people complaining about bosses making bad technical decisions should want, but I think people just want to complain instead.')
