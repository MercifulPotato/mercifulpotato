Item(by='maccard', descendants=None, kids=[25499265], score=None, time=1608581936, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25498891, text='&gt; You&#x27;re right, drivers should simply pause physics and magically stop their vehicle or wear nightvision goggles at all times.<p>You&#x27;re being ridiculous here. Nobody is asking for that, they&#x27;re asking for sensible road design and sensible rules.<p>&gt;  because a woman was illegally crossing the road around a bend, covered by trees, with a kid being dragged behind her, 40 feet from a crosswalk that clearly indicated DO NOT WALK.<p>That&#x27;s shitty road design (if the crosswalk is 40ft from a blind blocked corner in either direction, someone might not see it travelling at speed), and arguably careless driving - blind corners could have a deer, pedestrian, broken down car, etc.<p>&gt; Having the right away is not the same as being impervious to being struck by a moving vehicle.<p>Right of way or not, you are the operator of the dangerous machine,not the pedestrian. The onus is on you to pay attention to your surroundings. It doesn&#x27;t matter whose fault it is if you clip a child at 40mph, they&#x27;re dead.')
