Complexity breeds bugs, including security bugs, and memory safety doesn&#x27;t change that. Your example is a good one - here&#x27;s another: doas once failed to limit the environment variables which are passed to the child process, which could be used to nefariously influence the program running (e.g. with LD_PRELOAD). How would Rust prevent that oversight? It wouldn&#x27;t.<p>A simpler program will generally be more secure than a complicated one, no matter what language either is written in. Furthermore, <i>rewriting</i> an established program from one language to another will <i>always</i> introduce more bugs than it fixes, and more severely the more complex the program is. The single best way to improve security is to reduce the attack surface, and the single best way to do that is to reduce the complexity of your system.')
