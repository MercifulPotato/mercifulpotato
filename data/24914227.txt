But I want to share this story that happened. In 2005 when I started my first job, our first project was building a case ticketing system. It took us 6 developers, 2 testers and 1 PM to deliver the first iteration of the project after 3 months. Those were the waterfall days.<p>Recently I taught my wife how to write HTML. Last month she completed designing a pretty functional ticketing system working alone for 1 month on Microsoft Sharepoint. The system is complete with provisions for case escalations, teams &#x2F; emails alerts, reports, groups etc.')
