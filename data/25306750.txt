Median GDT_TS went from 68.5 (CASP13) to 92.4!!!! Cf. their 2nd best CASP13 struct scored 92.8 (out of 100). Median RMSD is 2.1Å. I think it&#x27;s over</i> [0]<p>and<p><i>“I think it’s fair to say this will be very disruptive to the protein-structure-prediction field. I suspect many will leave the field as the core problem has arguably been solved,” he says. “It’s a breakthrough of the first order, certainly one of the most significant scientific results of my lifetime.”</i> [1]<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;MoAlQuraishi&#x2F;status&#x2F;1333383634649313280" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;MoAlQuraishi&#x2F;status&#x2F;1333383634649313280</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-03348-4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-020-03348-4</a>')
