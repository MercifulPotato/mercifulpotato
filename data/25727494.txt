If you have the space and can fit one, something like the Sunpower 400W rated panels which are composed of expensive, ultra high efficiency monocrystalline Si cells would be ideal. You&#x27;re looking for the greatest ratio of watts per square meter in STC test conditions.<p>What I would recommend is first calculating the watt-hours per day consumed by your projected load, versus what the PV system could be expected to produce.')
