Sentences were usually a mix of Greek and English in my youth. This forced me to be right brained and assign meaning to words through imagery. I still visualize a lot and in fact it continues to hobble me in certain areas of physics (quantum) where mechanistic thinking and visual models are not sufficiently descriptive.<p>Perhaps the most amazing thing about ancient Greeks is that they used letters to represent digits. I still cannot wrap my brain around the fact that a word like &#x27;spiti&#x27; could have a linguistic as well as numerical interpretation that every ancient Greek would know.<p>Today, all computation with language uses unicode to represent letters. I tried once to make an ancient Greek number to arabic number(the numbers used in English today) converter but failed miserably.<p>Claude Shannon actually made a calculator that used Roman numerals.')
