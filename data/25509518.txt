Item(by='novok', descendants=None, kids=[25510993, 25509590], score=None, time=1608661980, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25509234, text='Honestly if I could play smash bros on my macbook with my friends and relatives I&#x27;d sell my switch today.<p>The switch screen is too small for local multiplayer and hooking it up to a TV w&#x2F; power is too bulky and annoying because they&#x27;re picky about adapters unlike laptops.  You also need a case to transport them because they turn on too easily when their buttons are exposed.  A 13&quot; laptop is way better.<p>(I&#x27;m not doing local multiplayer today because COVID, but I know I will in during future trips)')
