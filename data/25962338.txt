Also if they said wear a mask when you leave the house it would have been interpreted as &quot;it&#x27;s ok to go on with normal events as long as we have masks&quot; which wasn&#x27;t the message they were trying to send, either. The message was stay home, and at the time it was probably the right message, and not a lie.')
