My company conducts a similar series of assessments for all roles; and as a hiring manager I am able to see how applicants score across a battery of indicators from agreeableness, deferential nature, leadership ability, along with how individuals do in raw aptitude testing.<p>Became curious one day and asked HR if I could view my scores and was told no. Furrowed my brow a bit at that one.<p>I furrow it even more knowing the company doesn&#x27;t expect hiring managers to actually <i>use</i> these scores with any meaningful weight, nor does recruiting actually rely on them during the screening process-or so I was told when asked-they merely ship them direct to the decision maker, forcing me to wonder why we put candidates through them <i>to begin with</i>.<p>Certainly the common refrain is that giving candidates their results could open companies up to liability if they pass on a candidate, which causes a further reaction on my part &quot;all the more reason to do away with them and find another means of assessing talent. Maybe this is a process that doesn&#x27;t require the reduction of humans to a few data points and indicators n a scoreboard for the privilege of a friendly career conversation&quot;.')
