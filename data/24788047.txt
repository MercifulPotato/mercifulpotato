It is well-suited for embedded, hard-realtime systems.<p>However, this article says that ORC, a non-deterministic and non-hard-realtime GC system, is likely to become the new default GC in the future.<p>Perhaps they found that the &quot;systems language for hard-realtime&quot; wasn&#x27;t as compelling a value proposition as they originally thought?<p>Or perhaps the tradeoffs of ORC and availability of manual memory management give them confidence that it won&#x27;t materially harm hard-realtime systems use-cases in practice?')
