They didn&#x27;t just make GTA5 in a vacuum. They had all those previous games to draw on. They&#x27;ve been working on police chase AI since the games were top-down with 2D car sprites.<p>There was no chance that CDPR could do something comparable on their first attempt. They tried to do way too much new stuff all at once in one blockbuster game. They should have made several smaller games with those different mechanics first before trying to pull it all together in one game.')
