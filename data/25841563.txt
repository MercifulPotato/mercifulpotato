He &quot;called for violence&quot; against people who attempted to physically disrupt his rallies, and I would go so far as to call the &quot;violence&quot; that ensued in all of those cases (forcible removal from the venue) justified.<p>You keep moving the goal posts to try to justify abhorrent behavior.  First he didn&#x27;t call for violence, until I provided proof he did.  Then the violence was justified because &quot;they rushed the stage&quot; - which they didn&#x27;t.  Now it&#x27;s OK to advocate assault because someone is peacefully protesting?<p>I&#x27;ll be honest: it&#x27;s pretty sad the lengths you&#x27;re going to in order to justify actions that wouldn&#x27;t be tolerated in a kindergarten classroom.<p>&gt;Using this standard, I could accuse anyone against the Capitol &quot;protestors&quot; as &quot;calling for violence against their political opponents&quot;, except we both know that characterization omits a great deal of critical context. So it is here.<p>No, you really couldn&#x27;t without the same mental gymnastics you&#x27;ve been going through to ignore reality.  The Capitol &quot;protestors&quot; physically assaulted badged police officers while breaking into a federal building.  The protestors at Trump&#x27;s rally paid for a ticket to enter a place they were lawfully allowed to be - peacefully spoke out in protest, and then left when they were told to.  In the process they were assaulted.<p>The fact you&#x27;d try to equate the too shows a complete lack of honesty and integrity on your part.<p>&gt;He literally told the people assembled there to go home.<p>Hours and HOURS after the damage had been done, and the police had the situation back under control, he issued a taped message telling the rioters that he loved them but they needed to go home.<p>At some point it&#x27;s obvious you condone physical violence against people that have different political views than you do, and you should just own it.  But you also should take a long, hard look at history.  The founding fathers didn&#x27;t agree with your point of view.  The constitution doesn&#x27;t agree with your point of view.  The majority of Americans don&#x27;t agree with your point of view.  Our Democracy is founded on a peaceful transition of power, and intelligent thoughtful discourse on policy.  Your violence has no place in America.')
