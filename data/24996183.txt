Item(by='Kliment', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604559297, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24995803, text='Can confirm - I tried growing all sorts of things in an awful north-facing garden with varied success but am now mostly focusing on two things - leaf vegetables and small fruit. Chard and raspberries are my primary outputs, and being able to go out and pick a handful of raspberries for dessert is a way superior experience to buying them - better taste, more varieties, better quality, and they store longer than store-bought. Same thing with leaf vegetables - unless I buy frozen (which I still do in winter) you can&#x27;t get decent spinach or chard outside the peak of the season. They store for months on the plant though unless temperatures get too hot, so I can just pick as much as I need for a meal and not worry about spoilage.')
