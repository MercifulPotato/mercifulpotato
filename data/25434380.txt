Let&#x27;s assume you&#x27;re a $10 million company with 10% monthly ROE&#x2F;growth. Paying an additional 9% in California corporate tax rates will result in the loss of <i>a billion</i> in market cap within five years. Literally a third of the terminal value of the startup.<p>Point taken about diminishing marginal returns. But you can see that even taking that into account, the impact of lax tax planning for shareholders is humongous. (Plus many startups are in winner-take-all markets, and effectively have <i>increasing</i> returns to scale.)<p>The opportunity cost is real. Tax arbitrage will take some amount of bandwidth. But it often takes much less effort to raise cash by minimizing taxes than it does to raise additional equity funding. The former can mostly be done by the CFO in the background, whereas the latter requires the attention of the founders.')
