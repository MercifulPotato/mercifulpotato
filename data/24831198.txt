Those tests are different from tests which check to see whether someone currently has Covid-19.<p>If someone dies without having already tested positive for Covid-19, in many places they won&#x27;t be counted as having died from Covid-19. So it&#x27;s likely that many Covid-19 deaths haven&#x27;t been counted - especially in places where most people can&#x27;t afford the tests that check whether they currently have Covid-19.')
