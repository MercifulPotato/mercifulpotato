The titular sentence is  great advice, one I&#x27;ve been following all my life.<p>Meanwhile a lot of time went by, I&#x27;m almost 40, and I have worked at 8-10 companies (incl. FAANG, my own startup). His later advice, from the book &quot;Deep Work&quot;, was not in line with my work experience [2]. The problem is, Cal doesn&#x27;t have a regular 9-5 job as a tech worker, at a tech company. He&#x27;s in academia (and self-employed), which is very different --- I know, I also worked in academia! And this shows.<p>For example, I was reading his book Deep Work while I was at Facebook, where the whole company is on Workplace&#x2F;Workchat internally, with frequent notification&#x2F;mention&#x2F;chat interrupts, and the culture is to have quick response times. So no Deep Work, yet velocity and productivity is very high. It&#x27;s not true that you need a lot of focused time to get things done, you can manage it in smaller chunks. It&#x27;d be convenient, but it&#x27;s not realistic.<p>Reflecting on this article, in my experience, the key thing to focus on for companies is not personal productivity but team organization. The topline differentiator between high-velocity and high-productivity organizations versus the rest is that these are a collection of self-sufficient cross-functional product teams. The rest, which is most organizations, usually run &quot;projects&quot; instead of products, and multiple departments and teams, with different reporting lines, goals, OKRs&#x2F;KPIs, etc. are exptected to work together to make it happen --- the result is the organization becomes one big waiting&#x2F;blocking graph, with 80% of projects being blocked at any given time. This also makes personal productivity harder, because more &quot;sync&quot; and &quot;alignment&quot; type email threads and meetings are needed. In this model people have to work with more people they don&#x27;t know&#x2F;trust, so more people are communicating with each other who don&#x27;t know how to communicate with each other, they may not even know the other person&#x27;s exact job description or timezone location.<p>Having said that, I appreciate Cal&#x27;s perspective, and I&#x27;m happy to support him by buying his books.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1455509124" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You&#x2F;dp&#x2F;14555091...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1455586692" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted&#x2F;...</a>')
