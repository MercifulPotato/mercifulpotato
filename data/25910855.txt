Item(by='yters', descendants=None, kids=[25910889], score=None, time=1611620788, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25910666, text='Are the specific votes public record?  If not, it is impossible to verify votes were recorded correctly.  But the addresses being public record is interesting.  If that information is public record then it would be easy for citizens to randomly verify enough records to ascertain whether enough votes were dumped to make a difference.  If what you say is correct then I can try verifying it myself.  Why has no one publicly done this?  Would be an easy way to put the matter to rest.<p>UPDATE: I just checked the GA website, and all it gives me is voter IDs and whom they voted for.  No way I can verify vote fraud did not occur from that information.  No addresses or names.')
