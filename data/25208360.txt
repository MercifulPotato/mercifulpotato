And banning those channels will just garner more outrage and discord. Its a win win situation for them. Even if there is an indian alternative to tiktok there is nothing stopping them from posting ridiculous divisive stuff there. Its quite clear that is already happening with America (done by Russia is the suspicion).<p>If this is your solution to fight against stuff like that, then GoI has brought a knife to a missile fight.<p>(BTW, its not like they don&#x27;t understand this playbook, BJP uses it itself.)')
