In the same vein, I love the bar scene in Inglorious Bastards where Michael Fassbender&#x27;s character orders 3 drinks and holds up 3 fingers the English&#x2F;American way (index, middle and ring) as opposed to the mainland European way (thumb, index and middle) and it&#x27;s a dead giveaway. I don&#x27;t know if that had been used in literature before, but whoever wrote that scene (Tarantino?) really picked up on a subtle difference that&#x27;s a dead giveaway.')
