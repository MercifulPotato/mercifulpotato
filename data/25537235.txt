Break out of the soundbites and take a moment to think about what&#x27;s happening in historical context.<p>If you want a serious and reasoned analysis of the worries, concerns and threats under these circumstances (at least from a UK perspective) I firmly recommend you view Lord Sumption&#x27;s thoughts on this matter (recently retired judge from the supreme court of the UK with a long and highly respected career in the judiciary) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=amDv2gk8aa0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=amDv2gk8aa0</a><p>Unfortunately under circumstances such as the covid-19 mess we all live under (and thank your lucky stars you are in a 1st world country, the 3rd world will suffer at unimaginable levels, highly likely considerably moreso due to covid-19 aid cuts than covid-19 itself) things are considerably greyer than &#x27;conspiracy theory nuts vs. just asking to put a mask on&#x27;.
