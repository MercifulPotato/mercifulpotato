Like stealing all your phone contacts list, without your permission.<p>Without informed consent maybe, but without permission? I doubt it. Please enlighten me on how the facebook app is able to bypass the android&#x2F;ios sandbox.<p>&gt;By your logic, since Facebook is an American company, then by extension, this shitty behavior is reflective of all of America.<p>If facebook has a mandatory CCP err- DNC&#x2F;RNC member on its board, I&#x27;d be inclined to agree with that.')
