This is not a loophole, open to interpretation or in any way anything except plain old fraud.<p>Now you can fault the authorities for not having better checks in place (I personally blame, in the Danish case, a previous government for firing ~2000 “IRS” employees due to them being unneeded when a new IT system was put in place. Funny thing is the IT system had just been funded, when they were fired), but it is still outright fraud.<p>In the end I hope this will be a PR win for EU, as we can hopefully agree to heavy sanctions if he is not extradited.')
