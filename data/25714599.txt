I think with a commentary you risk reading someone else&#x27;s opinion, without challenging yourself to form your own.  It&#x27;s more-or-less equivalent to doing the exercises in a math text rather than just reading the chapters and letting the author convince you that you understand.<p>Obviously the ideal is the read the source material and then read commentaries after once you&#x27;ve had a chance to reflect on it for yourself.<p>Of course for me, I have only ever managed to read Plato and Karl Popper.  Other &quot;Classics&quot; like Hume or Kant I can&#x27;t make heads of tails of the source material without some guidance.  I haven&#x27;t even tried the most notoriously \ndense authors like Nietsche or Hegel.')
