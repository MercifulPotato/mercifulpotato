If society becomes more productive overall, as a matter of fairness I think that “should” result in the minimum wage being increased. The lowest-paid workers “should” enjoy better living conditions today than they did in the 1980s. Productivity gains across the entire economy are easier to quantify than “living conditions,” so I think the article makes a good case that the minimum wage “should” be significantly higher than it is now.')
