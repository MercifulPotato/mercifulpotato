At all. We have one single black person in the 50ish management roles because that is all that we could hire. Our problem isn&#x27;t with them being rejected or discrimination during interviews, but simply that we cannot hire a person who doesn&#x27;t apply for an open position. Black people are not applying to our company. Does that make us non equal opportunity or discriminating for hiring 98% non-black workers?')
