The individual impacts seem small, but the fact they found so many instances in one little function is beyond worrying.<p>For a little quantification, letâ€™s extrapolate the number of such benign bugs (I make it about 1 per 30 LOC), to get about 500 in the whole codebase. Suppose each bug, charitably, has a 1&#x2F;1000 chance of catastrophically distorting the result. The chance of no such bugs is a mere 60%. For an imho more realistic probability of 1&#x2F;100, the chance drops to 0.7%.<p>If the code gives the right answer, it is by pure coincidence.')
