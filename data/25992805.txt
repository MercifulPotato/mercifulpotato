Most business users have inboxes that are filled with emails to do with various processes they work on - sales, hiring, fundraising, deals &amp; support. Streak lets them be successful at those processes because it&#x27;s built right into where they spend most of their day - the Inbox.<p>The Support Specialist will become a product expert in Streak and the ultimate source-of-truth for our users. You will help us answer questions, troubleshoot issues, and engage with our users via chat. Beyond chatting, you will also have time to learn and pursue projects that improve the customer experience in meaningful ways (learning SQL, creating documentation, testing new features, etc)')
