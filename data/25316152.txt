So not really unique to Apple. To the article&#x27;s benefit, it did say &quot;possibly&quot; :)<p>I&#x27;m using Win 10 myself with an HDR display, and HDR white appears brighter than &quot;desktop&quot; white just like in the article photo.<p>There is also a slider in Win10 HDR settings that allows you to bring SDR&#x2F;&quot;desktop&quot; white up if you wish to oversaturate SDR.')
