It appears all factual allegations here are true (he presented the talk, he used bits from another talk, he called a speaker wrong), and everything else is an opinion based on those facts. So it&#x27;s not libel.<p>And any improper employment termination suit would be against the employer, not a conference organizer, because in a very direct sense, it&#x27;s your employer that chooses whether to fire you or not.')
