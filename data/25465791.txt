It seems like such a random goalpoast. Why does it matter if the computer is better? If you&#x27;re an 1800 rated player, you&#x27;re still so far behind the best humans that it&#x27;s irrelevant. Or why care if a computer has examined some similar positions before? As an amateur the positions won&#x27;t be novel in qny way anyway. \nNo more human innovation is blatantly false. If anything, computers have led to lots of new ways to play. And humans play humans, what a computer would do in a position is irrelevant.')
