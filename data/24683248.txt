The drivers are fighting as hard as ever against each other when they get a chance.<p>Pit stop tactics are not a secret sauce. You can predict the pit stop strategy pretty well before the race even starts.<p>It has always been as much about cars as drivers. E.g. McLaren won 4 years in the row 1988-1991 and then Williams won 3 years in the row. Ferrari won 6 years in the row from 1999 to 2004.<p>I really don&#x27;t think remote engine tuning added any excitement.<p>There have been proposals such as reverse-grid races or qualifications that would have added a lot of excitement but traditionalists are against them. Maybe having a couple restarts would also help. The cars are now much more reliable than in the past so there is less random chance.')
