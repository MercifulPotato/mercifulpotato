And beyond that, yeah, Spanish words you might need to know about Greek and Latin morphemes but my point is those exact same ones are all over our language already so they&#x27;re familiar.  I already know that &quot;geo-&quot; means &quot;Earth&quot; and &quot;co-&quot; means &quot;together&quot; from my native language.')
