Sam Harris never claimed the Iraq war was noble or well-intended. He never supported the Iraq war, though Greenwald initially did. From Greenwald&#x27;s preface in <i>How Would a Patriot Act?</i>[1]:<p>&gt; I believed then that the president was entitled to have his national security judgment deferred to, and to the extent that I was able to develop a definitive view, I accepted his judgment that American security really would be enhanced by the invasion of this sovereign country.<p>Greenwald was also rather supportive of US foreign policy in 2005.[2]<p>What you&#x27;re most likely referencing are Sam Harris&#x27;s arguments about morality and intentions. In his 2007 book <i>The End of Faith</i>, he discusses the Iraq war in a few paragraphs:<p>&gt; What we euphemistically describe as “collateral damage” in times of war is the direct result of limitations in the power and precision of our technology. To see that this is so, we need only imagine how any of our recent conflicts would have looked if we had possessed perfect weapons—weapons that allowed us either to temporarily impair or to kill a particular person, or group, at any distance, without harming others or their property. What would we do with such technology? ... A moment’s thought reveals that a person’s use of such a weapon would offer a perfect window onto the soul of his ethics.<p>&gt; ... How would George Bush have prosecuted the recent war in Iraq with perfect weapons? Would he have targeted the thousands of Iraqi civilians who were maimed or killed by our bombs? Would he have put out the eyes of little girls or torn the arms from their mothers? Whether or not you admire the man’s politics—or the man—there is no reason to think that he would have sanctioned the injury or death of even a single innocent person. What would Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden do with perfect weapons? What would Hitler have done? They would have used them rather differently.<p>Later in the section, Harris uses the reversal test:<p>&gt; Consider the recent conflict in Iraq: If the situation had been reversed, what are the chances that the Iraqi Republican Guard, attempting to execute a regime change on the Potomac, would have taken the same degree of care to minimize civilian casualties? What are the chances that Iraqi forces would have been deterred by our use of human shields? (What are the chances we would have used human shields?) What are the chances that a routed American government would have called for its citizens to volunteer to be suicide bombers? What are the chances that Iraqi soldiers would have wept upon killing a carload of American civilians at a checkpoint unnecessarily? You should have, in the ledger of your imagination, a mounting column of zeros.<p>None of this is expressing support for the Iraq war. Harris is simply arguing that different societies have different levels of ethical development.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bookbrowse.com&#x2F;excerpts&#x2F;index.cfm?fuseaction=printable&amp;book_number=1812" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bookbrowse.com&#x2F;excerpts&#x2F;index.cfm?fuseaction=pri...</a><p>2. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;glenngreenwald.blogspot.com&#x2F;2005&#x2F;11&#x2F;myth-of-international-wisdom.html?m=1" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;glenngreenwald.blogspot.com&#x2F;2005&#x2F;11&#x2F;myth-of-internati...</a>')
