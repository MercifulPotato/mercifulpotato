It&#x27;s not terribly hard to do by hand with rudimentary 3D modeling skills (i.e the most generous way to describe my own 3D modeling capability), if you know the height from the floor and shooting angle at which the camera took the picture. I&#x27;ve done it with 360 photos (therefore shooting angle didn&#x27;t matter) in Blender with a VR headset to aid in positioning vertices. You can get results like this in about 15 minutes.<p>Complex scenes obviously take longer, but results can be extremely convincing for a limited range of view angles.<p>I learned the technique from this video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;RSC40B8kHT8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;RSC40B8kHT8</a>')
