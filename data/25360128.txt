There were reasons for this: that piece of the UI had to work in all nationalities, for all languages and currencies, in every browser on every device under the sun.<p>But here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m thinking: I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if every single tab in the Google Cloud UI had its own team, with their own practices, dependencies, resources that need to be loaded, etc. And I wouldn&#x27;t be  surprised if there&#x27;s nobody in the organization whose job it is to consider the Google Cloud Dashboard as a whole product, in terms of making it a cohesive experience, eliminating redundancies between independent pieces, doing cross-cutting optimizations, getting everybody on the same page. Given how many different things are stuffed into the interface (just look at the navigation menu), that would certainly lead to some bloat.')
