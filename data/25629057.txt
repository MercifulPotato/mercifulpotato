So for example I might write a project all in a single file, or entirely without classes, or with wildly too many classes, or with weird fp-trickery for no reason. There&#x27;s a million weird ways to write a project badly, and in practice you&#x27;ll discover it&#x27;s almost never a <i>real</i> hindrance to progress compared to best practices.')
