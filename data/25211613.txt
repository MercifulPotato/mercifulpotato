Your argument is basically the same one used last time.<p>We just don&#x27;t know what we don&#x27;t know.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t bet that &#x27;this time&#x27; we do actually know our stuff. It sounds too much like an elementary-school kid who has no conception of calculus and thinks once they&#x27;ve finished geometry they&#x27;ll have learned all there is to know about math.<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve made tremendous progress in math since learning multiplication. Surely this time I&#x27;ll have figured it all out.  I already know division and exponents. What more could there possibly be after geometry?&quot;')
