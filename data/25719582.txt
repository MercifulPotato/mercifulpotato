It&#x27;s amazing how little people in the USSR knew about the rest of the world as late as the 1960s. Anatoly Dobrynin wrote in his 1995 autobiography that, when he came to the US in 1962 to be Ambassador to the United Nations for the USSR, he was amazed to see traffic jams. He&#x27;d been brought up to believe those were American propaganda. No country could have that many cars.<p>(That&#x27;s a fun read, by the way. He got to be a diplomat in a very strange way. Stalin had a meeting in 1946 with some of his diplomats and grumbled that those old guys were out of touch, and they needed young new Soviet men like aircraft designers. The next day, Dobrynin, a young aircraft designer, was ordered from his job designing aircraft to Moscow to attend the Higher Diplomatic Academy and learn to become a diplomat. He turned out to be good at it.)')
