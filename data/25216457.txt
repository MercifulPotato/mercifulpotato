Item(by='gregmac', descendants=None, kids=[25216514, 25217943], score=None, time=1606359578, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25212541, text='I see there&#x27;s several &quot;captcha solving services&quot; (Google the term, I don&#x27;t want to link any) that charge in the $1&#x27;s per 1000 solves. This makes me wonder how effective captchas <i>really</i> are. Do they just raise the bar high enough so only spammers actually making money attack the more lucrative sites?<p>Can anyone talk about their experience running a (large) service with a spam problem where adding a captcha helped? How about still battling bots&#x2F;spam&#x2F;abuse <i>despite</i> having a captcha?<p>Supposedly these services have humans solving these. I remember hearing about a bypass in use where the attacker would pass-through captchas and present them to users on their own pirate&#x2F;torrent&#x2F;porn&#x2F;etc sites, and then when the user solved it, they&#x27;d get at the content and the spammer would do whatever they were doing on the original site. I wonder if that technique is still in use, or if there are people specifically sitting there solving captchas all day being paid fractional pennies per solve?')
