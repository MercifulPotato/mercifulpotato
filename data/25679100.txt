Two acknowledged that they did not wear masks, and the airline did not require mask-wearing in the lobby before boarding. Nor did it require preflight testing, although five of the seven passengers who later tested positive had taken a test, and received a negative result, in the days before boarding.&quot;<p>Unfortunately they don&#x27;t show&#x2F;say what two opted not to wear masks, but If I had to guess, it&#x27;s probably the two at the front that got infected?')
