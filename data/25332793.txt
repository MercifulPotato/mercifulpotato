I am a huge fan of the base styling and components they offer. I even splurged on tailwind-ui, I am super happy with it, and I highly recommend it to others. It is such a refreshing experience to have something other than Bootstrap derived personal projects and MVPs.<p>To anyone from Tailwind that may read this, please keep up the great work. The easily apparent thoughtfulness and taste that went into tailwind and tailwind-ui are what drove me to try it out, learn it, and incorporate it into projects. Iâ€™m excited to see what else gets added to tailwind-ui and the progress on headless-ui as well! If you need any contributors on the front-end side, especially with accessibility, let me know who to reach out to.')
