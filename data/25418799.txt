My setup is very simple. `dat share` running on my laptop and `dat &lt;hash&gt;` on all of my servers. The servers are running inside docker&#x2F;k8s in a daemonset so every server in the cluster has a recent version of the files. Some benefits of this over say a shared NFS mount hosted in the cluster:<p>- I can use my local editor online or offline in the same config<p>- my editor doesnt hang as it saves over a network connection<p>- live reload apps running on the servers will pickup the changes immediately. inotify doesnt work on nfs mounted drives.<p>One main disadvantage in some cases is it doesnt currently support multi-writer. the servers mounting the dat are read only. I&#x27;m pretty sure this is changing in newer versions, but I&#x27;m not sure on roadmap.')
