Cameras may (probably) don’t have hardware video encoders for the best codecs, so the processing on the CPU would use quite a bit of power. And on the servers, depending on what you’re doing, there’s a lot of mixing and reprocessing that may need to be done on the streams. My own laptop isn’t that old, and the fan spins up often enough on calls that you know the CPU is chugging more than usual.')
