Item(by='pron', descendants=None, kids=[25317123, 25316894], score=None, time=1607190856, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25316095, text='GPT-3 does not pass the Turing test. \nThe Turing test is not about making a person think they&#x27;re talking to another person while, in fact, they are talking to a machine. The reason is that such a result may depend on the expectations people have of machines&#x27; capabilities. Rather, the Turing test, in the &quot;standard&quot; interpretation (rather than Turing&#x27;s original formulation) has an interrogator interviewing <i>two</i> subjects via text messages, <i>knowing</i> that one of them is a machine and the other a human, trying to distinguish which is which. The machine passes the test if it can trick interviewers sufficiently often.')
