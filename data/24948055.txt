I&#x27;d never suggest it.  I&#x27;ve met several masochists (the m in bdsm) who live with chronic pain and participate in the kink community because, as far as I can understand, it&#x27;s a way to reframe the chronic pain that they experience.  Or maybe, it&#x27;s like getting out of a boiling hot car into the relative cool of a blazing summer day.  The people I&#x27;ve met under these circumstances have had extreme pain tolerance, to the point where their sadists tread a fine line of giving them enough without doing damage.  I know that many masochists experience (and seek) a significant endorphin response, and I&#x27;ve long wondered if exercising that somehow increases their endorphin production capacity -- and if that would provide an enduring benefit to those who live with chronic pain.')
