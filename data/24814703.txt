As performance stop increasing just by shrinking transistors, other options will have a chance to prove themselves.<p>&gt;&gt; but the computing model of C is inherently sequential and it&#x27;s quite problematic to make proper use of increasingly more parallel machines.<p>IMHO  Rust will help with that. The code analysis and ownership guarantees should allow the compiler to to decide when things can be run in parallel. Rust also forces you to write code that will be easier to do that. It&#x27;s not a magic bullet but I think it will raise the bar on what we can expect.')
