This was, and remains, controversial (as noted in the WSJ link), and poorly understood (I&#x27;m still not certain I grasp it well, let alone fully, myself).<p>My understanding is that the Fed&#x27;s goal isn&#x27;t profit, but of buying money into, or selling assets, and hence money out of existence.  The Fed&#x27;s asset-buying targets are better thought of as liquidity-injection targets (where liquidity is money created by the Fed to be injected into the economy).  The Fed stabilises asset prices as a buyer of last resort, incidentally to its primary goal of both ensuring sufficient money in the economy and in creating greater ceertainty in asset values which allows banks to function.<p>The Fed can always buy assets or lend money, as it has the sole power (save the US Treasury) to <i>create</i> money without restriction.  And in practice, it makes profit on these transactions (which is contributed to the US Treasury).<p>The distortionary effects on risk and incentives ... remains fuzzy to me.<p>This is largely my own conceptualisation, it seems generally to agree with other explanations, and smells strongly of MMT.<p>I may be badly mistaken, however.')
