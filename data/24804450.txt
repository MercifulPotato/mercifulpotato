Item(by='makomk', descendants=None, kids=[24805738, 24805706], score=None, time=1602878350, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24804155, text='What makes Section 230 a complicated and contentious issue isn&#x27;t the actual details of the law - as you say, that&#x27;s quite simple - it&#x27;s the consequences of such a broad, powerful, simple, thing as protecting &quot;interactive computer services&quot; from almost all kinds of legal action for content created by others that they keep up, regardless of what they remove, with few caveats, across a vast swathe of causes for action, business models, moderation policies, etc.<p>For example, suppose you&#x27;re an online service Twitbook used by a vast swathe of the world to communicate, and you decide that you want to allow calls to murder politicians you dislike but not (obviously) ones you like. Section 230 gives you pretty good protection from liability over your decisions as to which political figures get threatened with murder. Probably even if one of your users gets inspired and puts a bullet in the head of someone you&#x27;d like to see dead.<p>Or suppose you&#x27;ve got a nice legalized extortion racket seeking out negative claims about people or businesses, getting them to rank highly in Google, not allowing the original posters to remove them, and demanding money from the targets to take them down. Section 230 offers pretty much ironclad protection for your business model by making it nearly impossible to get a court order forcing you to take the content down, meaning you can ensure the only way to make it go away is to pay up, and you can even literally call the fee a charge to remove libellous or defamatory content and there&#x27;s not a damn thing the court system will do about it. There&#x27;s a long-running website Ripoff Report that has this as their business model, and they&#x27;ve won every case trying to get them to remove defamatory content without paying them money for the privilege thanks to Section 230. There&#x27;s also plenty of imitators going after individuals, seeking out (say) claims they&#x27;ve cheated on their partners and charging money to remove them - again, solidly protected by Section 230.')
