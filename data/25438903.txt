Outside of times of war, where you again are likely to die or get seriously injured to protect the interests of the owner class.<p>Also, criminals are generally not prosecuted very often because it&#x27;s not that important to the system that you get justice, really. With police, it&#x27;s different, because it&#x27;s not a question of not caring, but instead of actual accountability.')
