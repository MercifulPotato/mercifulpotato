Especially the 80386DX with its 32-bit memory bus.  It took a while for software like Desqview, EMM386, and Windows 3.1 (in 386 enhanced mode) to take advantage of the 80386&#x27;s advanced features.<p>The poor little 8088 had to squeeze both its instruction stream and the data stream through a tiny 8-bit bus, so it&#x27;s really not <i>that</i> much different from say the Z80 (widely considered an 8-bit CPU) which nonetheless can do (limited) 16-bit operations on some of the internal registers.')
