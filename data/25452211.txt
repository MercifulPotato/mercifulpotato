Item(by='ashtonkem', descendants=None, kids=[25459520], score=None, time=1608176763, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25446757, text='&gt; Having had two kids in the age where they needed large car seats, trucks are no help at all and even fairly decent sized SUVs don&#x27;t handle more than two well.<p>Nonsense. They don&#x27;t fit <i>your</i> seats maybe, but that&#x27;s not the same as it not being possible. 15 seconds of Googling finds tons of lists with car seats that&#x27;ll fit 3 across, including tests for a <i>Honda Civic</i>. Some on the list include convertible ones that&#x27;ll work up to 120lbs.<p>Bigger SUVs might be more convenient, especially when loading and unloading, but the idea that you <i>can&#x27;t</i> fit three car seats into a larger vehicle is simply not grounded in reality.<p>&gt; Young children don&#x27;t necessarily have a big impact on housing costs (they can share some easily), often because of the structure of health insurance costs don&#x27;t have much impact on healthcare costs after the first, and education costs are largely deferred if you aren&#x27;t going private&#x2F;homeschool. Day care costs &#x2F; career impacts are probably more significant than any of those given the frequency of two-working-parent families, but car transportation logistics are quite palpable.<p>My understanding, at least from people I know with 3 or more children, is that daycare and career costs dominate, depending on your location. All my colleagues had to decide between paying out the nose for city daycare, punching an even longer gap in someone&#x27;s career (obviously reducing earnings), or simply not having a third.<p>Well, except for that one colleague who had five. According to him logistics got <i>very</i> expensive very quickly. Even &quot;cheap&quot; flights for a family of seven hits the $1K mark very quickly.')
