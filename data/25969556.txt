One (the standard for everything except macos) is used in terminal and the other in every other app.<p>This is completely backwards.<p>In Linux, Copy&#x2F;Paste is Ctrl+Shift+C&#x2F;V in various terminal programs, but Ctrl+C&#x2F;V in other GUI programs<p>In MacOS&#x2F;OSX&#x2F;macOS since 1984, Copy&#x2F;Paste has <i>always</i> been Cmd+C&#x2F;V. ...because Copy&#x2F;Paste are OS&#x2F;GUI shell actions, and Control characters are <i>not the same thing</i>.<p>Microsoft broke this separation in Windows 1.0, and Linux has stupidly aped Microsoft ever since.<p>See also: Microsoft&#x2F;Linux dialog boxes where the &quot;Continue forward&quot; option is located on the LHS (which in most locales notably including the original context, means &quot;move backward&quot;).')
