Where every progressive policy can be short circuited -- reviled by the very people it would benefit the most -- through some simple racist gyrations.<p>Universal healthcare -- illegal immigrants!<p>Robust social safety nets -- the classic &quot;black welfare mother with a Cadillac&quot; canard that comes up every time, where trillions in corporate welfare get a pass by angering people about some hypothetical minority &quot;taking advantage&quot;<p>Universal income -- black mothers with lots of babies taking advantage<p>It&#x27;s incredible, but the modern GOP plays it like a fiddle.
