It would be impossible to legislate that away. It&#x27;s been a while since I read the law (I&#x27;m an Oregon resident, so I read it before I voted for it), but I&#x27;d imagine that the law doesn&#x27;t give any particular discretion in enforcement, but in the real world an officer can always choose not to issue a ticket&#x2F;make an arrest.')
