If a client buys and holds and volatility increases and spreads widen, when the client closes out the trade, Rh will eat the difference in the spreads. If a client opens a short position and spreads widen, RH will make a net gain when the client closes out. I think this is why they halted people from buying and probably why they closed out the trades for clients, I would guess it was during periods of lower volatility.<p>I don&#x27;t know how legal it is for them to do that but when volatility is high like this that&#x27;s when a broker like RH can really go under.')
