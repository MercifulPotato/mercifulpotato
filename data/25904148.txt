It also has a lot of water:  e.g. it wandered in from the outer solar system where most bodies have water as a major constituent.<p>Compared to the composition of the solar photosphere planets like Earth are poor in hydrogen,  carbon,  nitrogen and such -- Mars and the Moon have the advantage of gravity such that all our industrial processes work and we are familiar with them.  But the real resources for life and industry are volatiles -- science fiction is still obsessed with iron asteroids,  but lacking a knowledge of what form of hydrocarbons you will find on asteroids means we can&#x27;t start designing the head end of an asteroid mining system.<p>In most ways the O&#x27;Neill colonies have aged badly,  but very large structures (e.g. 1000+ miles across) look possible with fiber-reinforced rotors.  If we ever want to get serious about asteroid mining I&#x27;m imagining that we may need to get 50 or so people on site because there is some R&amp;D and maintenance work you can&#x27;t do if you have to wait five minutes for light to go back and forth.')
