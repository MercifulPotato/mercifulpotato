They don’t avoid the low cost segment. $20k is low cost these days, even though the absolute cheapest US car is $14k.<p>Toyota just discontinued its Yaris that was $17k and Honda still sells its Fit for $16k.<p>There’s a ton of cars to be sold at the $25k level, profitably. The upsell of new versions down the road is just gravy.')
