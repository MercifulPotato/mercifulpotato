This post and the original cited work is very much about one-shot waterfall development. This is not what is done today and has little bearing.<p>How much of the effort in fitting a new requirement into an existing system is due to choices in the way it was decomposed and structured? I&#x27;m convinced there are much better than 2x better ways of keeping this effort low by choosing seams carefully and putting in the work when some are found to be in messy places.<p>Another way to say this might be, any system could (for sake of argument) be built with 2x essential complexity, but an evolved system typically has a much higher factor due to its lineage. Finding ways of keeping this near 2x should be the focus.')
