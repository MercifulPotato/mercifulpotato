This looks like a great project and I&#x27;m sure you learnt a lot from building it.<p>Some first impressions:<p>1. You used Pinterest as an example link in the guide, and it wasn&#x27;t immediately clear how this was differentiated from Pinterest. If you could think about why it&#x27;d be better to use SeeLink rather than an existing tool, I&#x27;d be more interested in it<p>2. I think the red block colour you&#x27;re using is too much (#FF0004). I&#x27;d consider changing it to a lighter red, or even white background with black text (it&#x27;d be easier to read)<p>3. It wasn&#x27;t clear to me what the bookmark icon does â€“ haven&#x27;t I already bookmarked the link by adding it to my board? Is this feature for further filtering?<p>Overall, great job! It looks quite polished and I didn&#x27;t see any bugs.')
