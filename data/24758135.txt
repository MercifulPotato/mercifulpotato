The East Asian examples show that with some discipline the conventional plan can also work. The isolation of vulnerable individuals is not an easy task - there are lots of them, and the isolation would require a lot of cooperation from a huge part of the whole population. If we cannot follow the conventional plan - then we cannot follow this plan, at least if we are serious about the part of isolating the vulnerable part of the population.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why the Western civilization fails so profoundly at this task - even when we have good examples showing that it can be done. But it is a subject for another discussion (also why the antigen tests have been used so far in such a limited fashion? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@zby&#x2F;it-is-9-months-now-why-we-have-no-mass-testing-for-sars-cov-2-yet-27b5f409c7d2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@zby&#x2F;it-is-9-months-now-why-we-have-no-ma...</a>) - for now we need a plan that would be adjusted to the individualism of the Western world. I believe that it needs to be more bottom up, we should give people more power to self organize and devise new arrangements. For that we need one crucial technology - rapid at home tests (like those proposed at: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rapidtests.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rapidtests.org&#x2F;</a>, though I am a bigger pessimist at using them in grand top down schemes).<p>In the spring there were ideas about building &#x27;safe bubbles&#x27; - by limiting contacts to a few, who would also limit their contacts. This can work much better than it seems - because most of the contacts that can bring us the virus, the long and close contacts, come from our stable social network. These are the people with whom we can negotiate rules and procedures. There were examples of this being done - but the only successful cases were of whole teams who totally isolated themselves. Now with rapid tests this can work for less strict isolation measures - as any intrusions of the virus inside the bubble could be quickly detected.')
