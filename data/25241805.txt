I now think it&#x27;s reasonable to find a comfortable spot on the spectrum with more resilience, and then use Marie&#x27;s principles to stay in that spot vs. getting rid of almost everything. Of course, one&#x27;s comfortable spot changes over time and in the face of other factors like local climate risks.')
