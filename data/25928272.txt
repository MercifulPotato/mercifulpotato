This, of course, does not have to mean doubling down on the welfare state, but as Friedman said: &quot;cash assistance to only the most vulnerable and more investments in infrastructure that improve productivity and create good jobs.&quot;  But the tricky part is to do this without unfairly rewarding&#x2F;propping up anti-consumer monopolies.  We need a new era of trust-busting!<p>My main measure for the long-term success of any economic theory is whether or not it causes a distribution of power across the middle class. If the middle class does not grow in size (relative to the whole population) and in its percentage share in the total wealth&#x2F;power then I don&#x27;t think you have a very good system.')
