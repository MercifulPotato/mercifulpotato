Spin it up when you get requests. It will handle X queries per second (you can set limit). If more than X, scale it up to this many replicas.<p>I pay about 10 cents for my site. Zero maintenance. I push code to GitHub, GitHub builds an image, pushes to GCR and tells cloud run to use new image.<p>This is how things ought to work for simple web server like functionality. “Here’s a dockerfile and source tree, build it, run it and auto scale it with this https domain” Boom!')
