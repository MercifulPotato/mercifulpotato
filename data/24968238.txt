Here are a few suggestions:<p>1. If you want people to read what you wrote and give you feedback, conciseness is important. We have a general rule of thumb that it takes people 30 minutes to read 4-6 pages of terse material, and it takes roughly an hour to then discuss it. As a result, pretty much all our docs are 6 pages (in the main body; appendixes might be added but are written in a way so that the doc stands on its own without them).<p>2. For many forms of (non-fiction) communication, the inverted pyramid is a helpful way to structure your thoughts. People are most likely to read the beginning of something, When we read the whole thing, we&#x27;re more likely to pay more attention to the beginning. It&#x27;s important then to get the most important information in the beginning, with supporting details as you go.<p>3. Know the audience, and focus on why the audience should care. If it&#x27;s not clear why the audience would care, try rephrasing or restructuring to focus on the part they actually would care about.<p>4. Do lots of iterations. Get feedback from others. You can also iterate on your writing yourself: I find that when I write something and come back to it later, I&#x27;m better at finding issues. In order to do a lot of iterations, that means you need to plan out your time. In my company, we often kick-off the doc writing process with a &quot;working backwards&quot; schedule: we&#x27;re presenting to such-and-such VP on Day X, so we have to have a rough draft of the whole doc on Day Y, so we have to have drafts of individual pieces by Day Z.<p>5. Be aware of what kind of thing your writing. I&#x27;d say 75% of my writing, my audience is myself: I&#x27;m writing in order to work through thoughts. I approach that differently when I&#x27;m writing something for review by teammates, which I again approach differently from a doc written for other groups.<p>6. Maybe a bit controversial in some circles, but: Strunk and White (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Elements-Style-Fourth-William-Strunk&#x2F;dp&#x2F;020530902X" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Elements-Style-Fourth-William-Strunk&#x2F;...</a>). It&#x27;s a short book, and even if you don&#x27;t do everything in it, the focus on clarity and succinctness is still useful.')
