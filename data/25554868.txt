So your proposal is instead of thoroughly interviewing, just give jobs out randomly and then fire people?<p>That works aside for the fact that it&#x27;s horrible for everyone:<p>- The employee: they presumably quit another job to take this one and now they are out on their ass because the employer didn&#x27;t bother to test for proper fit.<p>- The team: they invest in training the new person, get to like them, only to have them fired. Meanwhile they are short a person as hiring effort has to be restarted so they lose a ton of time understaffed.<p>- The company: dealing with all this terrible churn, stopping and starting the hiring effort, is there still severance in this world? How does unemployment work?<p>This is just the craziest proposal I&#x27;ve ever heard. It&#x27;s like saying &quot;dating is too onerous, people should just marry randos and not hesitate to get divorced if it turns out the other person brushes their teeth in an annoying way.&quot;')
