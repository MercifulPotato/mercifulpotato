By virtue of being a project that&#x27;s used by RedHat and Ubuntu, it&#x27;s the closest thing to the standard DE that desktop Linux has at the moment.<p>Worse yet, its developers consciously make design decisions that make it hard to write applications that play well with GNOME without taking a dependency on it - their take on it seems to be that GNOME is a <i>platform</i>, and their main interest is supporting &quot;GNOME apps&quot;, even to the detriment of all the rest.<p>Between these two things, deficiencies in GNOME affect a lot of people who didn&#x27;t necessarily choose to be affected.')
