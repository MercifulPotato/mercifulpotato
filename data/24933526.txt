I AGREE!<p>&gt;Second, you&#x27;re missing the &quot;garbage&quot; part of &quot;garbage story&quot; in the line you quoted.<p>What&#x27;s the &#x27;garbage&#x27; part of this &#x27;garbage story&#x27;?<p>&gt;and avoid publishing stories that can&#x27;t be vetted.<p>Who vetted the NY Times story?

How about the Steele dossier, initially an unverified, and later found to be a fabricated document, put out by the Russians and paid for by the Hillary campaign ... it served as a basis for YEARS of reporting.
