It was a &quot;shut up&quot; proposition - because when, to the surprise of the censors, it was built and was successful, they took all possible measures to destroy it. They were never for &quot;we will have our own and you can have our own&quot; - it always was &quot;we will control everything and you will shut up and do what you told&quot;.<p>Whatever are your political leanings and whatever you think of Trump or Parler - if this thing - total and absolute control of a handful of corporations over what can be spoken on the internet, and their willingness to ruthlessly exercise this control to suppress any non-censorious companies - if this thing is not scaring you, you&#x27;re delusional. You probably think you will never commit wrongthink so it doesn&#x27;t apply to you. Read some history, it never worked this way, it won&#x27;t work this way this time either. Censorship, allowed to run free, always gets worse.')
