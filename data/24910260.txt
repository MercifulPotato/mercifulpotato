There are examples in dark and even areas with leafs covering parts of an unmarked road. It doesn&#x27;t look at all like the detection system is struggling.<p>The only thing is, that things seem to &quot;float&quot; a bit, or cars and pedestrians disappears when going behind other cars and reappears again on the other side. The sides of the road also seems to float&#x2F;shift a little bit from time to time.<p>I wonder if they are not using a temporal filter of some sort (like assume a car continues in the same trajectory when goes behind another object), or if the UI only displays an &quot;unfiltered&quot; value.<p>In any case, I still haven&#x27;t seen examples where the cameras didn&#x27;t pick up anything relevant&#x2F;critical.')
