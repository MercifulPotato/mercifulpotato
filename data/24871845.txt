Item(by='jkrems', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603474408, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24870918, text='Ryan definitely deserves credit for the initial development of node.js. But that phrasing makes it sound like he moved from node to deno - which isn&#x27;t the case. He moved from node to other projects. Over the total lifetime of node, Ryan was _not_ involved for far longer than he _was_ involved (even when only counting the time before Deno was created).<p>The top-level comment seems to suggest that Ryan was an integral part of node development before deno and that &quot;getting him back&quot; was relevant. Which isn&#x27;t what happened. There are people who worked on node and moved to deno. But Ryan isn&#x27;t really one of them.')
