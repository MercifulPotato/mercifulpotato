It&#x27;s been a bit over five years since I had to run it, but this is what I remember.<p>If you run multiple webservers, upgrading is extra fun, because when you upgrade, it assumes it can update the mysql schema (which is pretty much totally insane; a www-user writable php script shouldn&#x27;t be able to create&#x2F;remove&#x2F;alter tables). The best way I found was to make a copy of the database, install the new version of Wordpress pointing at the new DB, thoroughly test, and then deploy new version pointing to new DB; then kill the old DB.<p>And woe is you if your webservers are geographically distant, because there&#x27;s no way to send reads to a nearby DB mirror; and there&#x27;s no way to run in read-only, because pingbacks still write to the DB even when they&#x27;re disabled.<p>One of the best weeks of my last job was when I was able to finally convince my boss to replace Wordpress for our static company blog with a series of Makefiles and simple PHP to smoosh in all the translations.')
