This is just more conspiracy theory nonsense. People reacting simultaneously to an emergency doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s a conspiracy, it&#x27;s what people do when there&#x27;s an emergency. If you want to make an argument of conspiracy, particularly in this case where simultaneous action is <i>expected</i>, then you should present actual evidence of conspiracy.')
