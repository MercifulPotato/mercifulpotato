Item(by='wpietri', descendants=None, kids=[25367145], score=None, time=1607527430, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25356074, text='I don&#x27;t think I said any of the things you are objecting to.<p>My point wasn&#x27;t that status goods are worse. A Louis Vuitton purse is objectively a good purse. But people don&#x27;t buy a Louis Vuitton purse because they&#x27;ve done a careful study of purse quality and just happened to end up with an LV one.<p>My point was that with status goods, it&#x27;s hard to have an objective conversation about quality, because people invested in the status part of it generally won&#x27;t talk about it in those terms. If you say, &quot;Gosh, $3450 seems like a lot for a small bag,&quot; [1], they won&#x27;t say, &quot;Yes, but it makes me look important&quot;. They&#x27;ll talk about how well made the bag is, how long it lasts, etc. They in effect become suddenly and specifically irrational. And if you push, they can get defensive. They might, for example, imagine you said a bunch of things you didn&#x27;t actually say. Or accuse you of being dismissive and snide.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;us.louisvuitton.com&#x2F;eng-us&#x2F;products&#x2F;bella-mahina-nvprod2410007v" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;us.louisvuitton.com&#x2F;eng-us&#x2F;products&#x2F;bella-mahina-nvp...</a>')
