Item(by='AndriyKunitsyn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609773804, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25625652, text='I can&#x27;t say for sure, I&#x27;m not a linguist.<p>But it&#x27;s probably because of a declension choosing process which I described. Take &quot;ра́дио&quot;, for example - it has this &quot;ио&quot; thing in the ending that is really not typical to Russian, so it made people think &quot;hey, this word is weird, we probably shouldn&#x27;t touch it when speaking&quot;, and since a lot of people thought this way, this became codified.<p>Now, some other loanwords are not that weird, for example &quot;пальто́&quot; - it&#x27;s not that different from &quot;окно́&quot;, or &quot;весло́&quot;, or &quot;ремесло́&quot;, and in fact, rarely people do decline it, like &quot;пальта́&quot;, &quot;у меня есть два пальта́&quot;, &quot;у меня есть пятеро па́льт&quot; - but it&#x27;s rare, and &quot;officially&quot;, it also has no declensions, probably to make things simpler.')
