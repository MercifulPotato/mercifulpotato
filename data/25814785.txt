If as an inventor you&#x27;ve only got one idea, you&#x27;re screwed. You need to be able to innovate repeatedly.<p>But the concise way of responding to this is: markets already reward innovation. We do not need state controls on information to &quot;stimulate innovation&quot;. The incentive exists as a natural effect of markets.')
