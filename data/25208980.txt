If &#x27;voting with you wallet&#x27; is the measure, increasing levels of income inequality, stagnant wages, weakening employee rights through the gig-economy, etc. are effectively taking away that choice, as most market participants cannot <i>afford</i> to make the choice.<p>Also, what is the paid alternative to Apple or Google photos that allows me to have the same end user experience, without giving up my privacy? &quot;the market&quot; doesn&#x27;t even have such an offer that I can see. The closest I can find (and that&#x27;s through here) is photostructure.com, and even that&#x27;s lacking all the local-ML-foo that makes Apple&#x2F;Google photos a compelling option over anything else.<p>&gt; Take Samsung putting ads on their &quot;smart&quot; TV&#x27;s UI and screenshotting what people are watching for profiling, that&#x27;s been known for a while now.<p>Known by who? I&#x27;d wager a year&#x27;s salary that &gt;50% of Samsung TV owners (and bump that number up to &gt;75% of Samsung TV <i>users</i>) do not know this is happening.')
