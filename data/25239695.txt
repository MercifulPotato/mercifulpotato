There’s never been a company that has climbed to the top, and stayed there forever.<p>You’re effectively worrying that “this time is different,” which isn’t a good thing to worry about when it comes to humans.<p>The issues with Amazon’s treatment of labor can’t be solved by a few wealthy consumers like yourself deciding out of guilt to not shop at the place with the cheapest prices and best customer experience.<p>Workers all over the US are treated exactly the same way, but we don’t shed a tear for them because they don’t work under a big brand with tons of media attention.<p>Killing Amazon won’t solve the fundamental issues with the US’s lack of worker protections.
