Facebook didn&#x27;t censor the story completely, Twitter did. Twitter is arguably one of the most valuable (if not the most valuable) platforms for news in the entire world...yet they can barely make any money. This isn&#x27;t the first time Twitter has massively botched something so simple. It really comes down to a detached CEO, and incompetent leadership.')
