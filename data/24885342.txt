Item(by='stevefan1999', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603623407, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24884092, text='Actually I found the statement &quot;guns don&#x27;t kill people, people kill people&quot; very oxymoronic.<p>Sure one might argue that if you have the intent to kill, it&#x27;s not necessary for one to use a gun, you have alternatives such as grenades, knives, chainsaw or even your bare hand if it&#x27;s lethal enough. This is how you derive that &quot;the gun is not evil, it&#x27;s the people who are&quot; statement.<p>But guns, under the category of firearms (not only guns, what about rocker launchers?), are almost-certainly designated to kill, and what is the top priority of firearm? Aim to be the most efficient killing machine.<p>So if you use a gun, it&#x27;s not necessary that you are going to kill people, but it is very likely that you are imposing a threat to do so, regardless of if you&#x27;re attacking&#x2F;defending.<p>Therefore, trying to apply the gun analogy to current state of youtube-dl is an injustice to youtube-dl, as you compared an intrinsically evil entity to another.')
