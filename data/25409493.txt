But sound money is a necessity for a thriving economy.  Gold standard prevented bad monetary policy that leads to runnaway inflation.  Its not a perfect system but it stops power and greed from destroying the economy.<p>Addition: Every historical case of a government switching to fiat currency has resulted in runnaway inflation.  The reason that gold and silver are the only constitutional money is it forces the government to do the right thing.  No gold standard permits those in power to manipulate the currency for whatever reason they wish.  The rules should force the wrong people to do the right thing.  Relying on people in power to do the &quot;right&quot; thing will always fail.')
