Most consumer phones (especially outside the US) <i>ship</i> with malware installed. Often worse than consumer PCs especially since even someone with little skill can install completely free OSes.<p>Also: Almost every popular OS has FDE as an option (often the default one) which was the main feature (other than sand boxing, which browsers do well enough) that supposedly made phones secure.')
