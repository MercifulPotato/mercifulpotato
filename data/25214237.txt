Or when I try to click a ticket and it just doesn&#x27;t open.<p>The not being able to type fluidly has to be the worst though.<p>Our team has as well at least brought up the idea of potentially trying other products.<p>Some of it&#x27;s probably me not really wanting to get involved with JIRA in the first place (who wants to manage tickets), but in the interest of being a better employee I&#x27;ve been trying to make sure I&#x27;m squaring out my work properly for tracking, etc.<p>And there&#x27;s certain things, that I&#x27;m sure are there, but I just can&#x27;t find sometimes. Like... how to add an epic easily. There&#x27;s at least three different views for each ticket (when you create it, when you click it open into the modal, and the full screen view), and things are apparently in different places on those different views?<p>I&#x27;ll take some of the blame, but it&#x27;s a mess.')
