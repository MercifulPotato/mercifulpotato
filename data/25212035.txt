Item(by='sonotathrowaway', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606326993, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25211501, text='&gt; There was notable involvement in the abolitionist movement among northern Protestants, and civil rights activism among catholics, Jews, and northern Protestants.<p>I meant those as two discrete times, civil war era abolitionists and civil rights era Jewish and catholic activists. I didn’t claim that Catholics and Jews were active against abolition. I’m fairly comfortable with the history of immigration of different ethnicities into America and the ‘whitening’ of certain immigrant populations, so I doubt I’m ignoring their timelines.<p>Additionally, rereading my comment you’ll see I try to distinguish between northern (mainline Protestants, but also catholic) and southern Christians, as I mostly associate (possibly incorrectly) evangelicals as tracing their lineages through southern baptist &amp; Midwest fundamentalist denominations.<p>I never mentioned atheism so I’m not quite sure how you constructed a position from my comment, but that’s not really applicable to any view I hold.<p>My point in the comment was to disabuse readers of the revisionist idea that Christianity, in particular American evangelicals, are natural champions of oppressed people - and if we measure their net effects on minorities in America in the aggregate, I’d wager it’s mostly been a tool to justify and propagate oppression and segregation more often than not. You are correct that my argument was centered on American Christianity, as even British Christianity (particularly quakers) had a markedly different relationship to abolition than their American southern Baptist counterparts.<p>I wholeheartedly agree with your argument that the battle lines have been drawn through Christianity, but I don’t think that it split the population into 50&#x2F;50 proportions.')
