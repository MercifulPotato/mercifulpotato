If that&#x27;s the case, I would assume the doctors know what they are doing and would list the ultimate cause of death properly, which covid may have aggravated. What if they would have survived their bus injuries if it was not for covid?<p>Regardless, this hair splitting doesn&#x27;t matter because it&#x27;s a very small portion of all cases that end up in an odd case like the above.')
