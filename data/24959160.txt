Yet if you looked at Twitter or Facebook, you would be convinced Labour would win with complete dominance in posts upon those platforms.  That day I learned that social media is not representative of the populous at large and only a slanted snapshot and polls are equally not that great.  See with polls - people lie, why - many reasons, some tactical, some not bothers and some just to avoid confrontation from easily agitated oppositional types.<p>AS for America - last visit I made was over a decade ago but I learned to avoid political debate with a passion as people don&#x27;t do debate and more argue you to death.  Even then in the office had a chap come in and almost interrogated me upon political views, even worrying was others warned me of that and I dismissed them.  You live you learn and I&#x27;ve found that the older people are - the more they are inclined to avoid such debates as they more often than not become toxic.')
