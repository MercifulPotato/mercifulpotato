I don&#x27;t have the latest hardware, since I mostly built it from parts I had lying around, but it&#x27;s not bottom of the barrel.  8-core AMD FX-8350, 20GB of DDR3, GeForce GT 720.<p>One problem I&#x27;ve had with KDE is that after running it for a few hours, it would get really really slow.  It was so slow that I could actually watch the title bar redraw when I would switch windows.  Turns out that a 1GB graphics card isn&#x27;t enough to do compositing at 4K when you have more than a few windows on the screen.  Fair enough.<p>So I turn off hardware compositing in firefox, chrome, and plasma.  I boot the computer, and check memory usage in nvidia-settings.  With just plasma running and a few docked widgets, I&#x27;ve already used 342&#x2F;978MB.  Perhaps the widgets are at fault, but I&#x27;m pretty I was able to run fvwm and gkrellm on my S3 Virge back in the day, and it had far less than 1GB of video memory.<p>I also notice that sometimes I lock my computer for the night, then I come back in the morning to login, and the hard disk churns for minutes before I can type my password.  I never had this problem with xscreensaver.  There&#x27;s plenty of RAM available.  I know my 5400rpm RAID 1 setup isn&#x27;t the fastest, but this is absurd.<p>Then there&#x27;s the K gear menu.  Why is it so slow?  I click the icon, go to Applications, then go to Utilities.  Then I wait a few seconds.  Eventually they all show up.  Then I go back to All Applications.  The menu stalls for a few seconds.  What is it doing?  I don&#x27;t know.  The fluxbox menu never stalled like this.<p>The default picture viewer seems to be gwenview.  I&#x27;ve imported a bunch of pictures from my phone and they are stored on my HDD.  I double-click on an image, and then I want.  And I wait.  And I wait.  No indication that it&#x27;s doing anything; maybe my double-click didn&#x27;t register.  So I double-click again.  I wait some more, and suddenly I see two gwenview windows.  After a few seconds neither one has fully initialized the UI or loaded the image.  I close one of them, wait some more, and eventually the image shows up.  Why is it so slow?  I don&#x27;t remember images loading this slow in xv or eog.  Should I be using digikam?  I just used the default.<p>The apps in the system tray are terribly slow.  Let&#x27;s say I want to change my volume while a video is playing.  That should be simple enough.  So I click on the volume control.  I wait for it to show up.  Then I drag the volume slider.  It is slow enough to respond that I overshoot.  Oops, too low.  Bring it back up again.  Overshoot again.  I really need to set up some volume up&#x2F;down key bindings so I don&#x27;t have to mess with that thing.  Oh, and my headphone volume always starts out muted after I boot the computer.  No idea why.  The slider doesn&#x27;t show up in KDE, but I can adjust it just fine in alsamixer.  I blame pulseaudio.  If I were young and without kids I might have time to figure out how to go back to OSS.  I remember when sound was as simple as running sndconfig and then listening to that wonderful voice say, &quot;Hello, my name is Linus Torvalds, and I pronounce Linux, &#x27;Linux&#x27;&quot;.  The good old days.  Life was simple.')
