None of those countries have returned to &quot;mostly normal&quot;. Maybe people aren&#x27;t trapped in their houses by police, but that&#x27;s &quot;normal&quot; only if you have a twisted view of normalcy.<p>All of them have stopped international travel and closed their borders. Vietnam has a mandatory quarantine -- in government-run centers -- for most people who <i>do</i> enter the country. Singapore is similar. Thailand has a two-week quarantine, and their economy is devastated, as essentially all tourism has stopped.<p>All of those countries have extensive restrictions in place, and have only recently begun to re-open their own businesses. For example, Vietnam just started re-opening businesses in mid-September:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vietnam-briefing.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;vietnam-business-operations-and-the-coronavirus-updates.html&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vietnam-briefing.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;vietnam-business-opera...</a><p>Singapore, while much better than before, still has widespread community transmission:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scmp.com&#x2F;week-asia&#x2F;economics&#x2F;article&#x2F;3103353&#x2F;singapore-turns-corner-covid-19-fight-experts-warn-battle-not" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scmp.com&#x2F;week-asia&#x2F;economics&#x2F;article&#x2F;3103353&#x2F;sin...</a><p>It still has restrictions on group gatherings, people can&#x27;t to to restaurants in groups larger than 5, and alcohol can&#x27;t be sold after 10:30. I guess this counts as &quot;mostly normal&quot;, right?<p>So basically, all of those countries are still locked down, or have just barely re-opened, and even then, there&#x27;s no suppression, just a lower level of community transmission than before. It&#x27;s far too early to be declaring victory.<p>You can control the virus for a time when you trap your society inside, deprive them of their livelihood and otherwise accumulate huge social and economic costs. Then you stop, and the virus comes back.')
