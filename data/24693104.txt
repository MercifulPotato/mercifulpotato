Surround a town with pasture as mentioned and it rarely jumps the gap.  California is in the odd situation of building next to high risk areas that burn without a buffer.  It then adds a lot of ignition sources, like old high voltage power lines, into the mix.<p>If you think of wildfires as a denial of service attack, you realize firefighters simply can’t solve the issue.  Controlled burns don’t work well in California for the exact reasons wildfires are such so dangerous.  What’s left is infrastructure of one type or another.')
