It&#x27;s pretty much an open double standard at this point, because political leftism is seen as the only true ideology a rational person can have. The rhetoric about conservatism is increasingly casting conservatives as vulnerable to irrational forces like fake news or algorithims that can override their will and make them believe patently absurd things.<p>If you are conservative or lean to it, its incredibly disheartening. You have to consistently justify to these people you aren&#x27;t brainwashed, because their default idea is that you are. Sort of the same way about serious religious belief if you have one; people default assume you are nuts and at best you can work your way up to &quot;he&#x27;s nuts but he is our nut.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s scary to me, and to be honest my political views are starting to move towards &quot;limit the power other people can affect you as much as possible&quot; because its now evident how people will happily deplatform any unpopular person beyond the real justification.
