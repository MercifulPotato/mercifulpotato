From wiki:<p>“A general hospital, the predecessor to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, was located at the post from 1898 until 1909. Major Walter Reed found the area&#x27;s marshlands an excellent site for his research on malaria. Reed&#x27;s work contributed to the discovery of the cause of yellow fever. Reed died of peritonitis after an appendectomy at the post in 1902. The post dispensary and the visiting officers&#x27; quarters now occupy the buildings where Reed worked and died.”')
