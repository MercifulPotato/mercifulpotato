If you get there too soon, then at some point, you must have been speeding.<p>Uk has a combination of:<p>* Average speed cameras (as per the Norway example)<p>* Variable speed cameras (where the speed limit varies depending on the conditions of the road and congestion)<p>* Fixed speed cameras (traditional speed cameras dug in next to a road)<p>* Mobile speed cameras (as per the bbc article, with a purpose to make sure the position changes each day so locals don’t know where the cameras are).<p>&gt; These systems are safer for police and drivers as there are no traffic stops for speeding.<p>Traffic stops in the U.K. are very rare, and even mobile cameras just send the documentation to your registered address with no stop. A stop would only be done in the U.K. if there was a belief that the driving was putting others at immediate risk (eg appears drunk).')
