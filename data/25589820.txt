Software is a tool, and you almost always need other tools to build and maintain tools.<p>Compare large construction projects, which often require separate construction projects, like building temporary roads to move all the material. Or drilling a long tunnel through a mountain: Frequently, entire factories will be built close to the tunnel entrance, which process the excavated material into concrete to be used for encasing the tunnel walls.<p>Another example: To produce huge numbers of screws in a cost-effective way, you need large, highly specialized machines, which serve no other purpose. And you need people who maintain those machines. Is that a fake problem, or are those fake jobs? Hardly.')
