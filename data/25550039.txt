In URIs, part following `&#x2F;&#x2F;` is called authority, which is essentially a host with some optional additional stuff (like port number).<p>According to RFC 1123, hostname could legally be entirely numeric, and web browser shouldn&#x27;t attempt to &quot;correct&quot; it (as it is a valid URI) for schemas it doesn&#x27;t know anything about - as it doesn&#x27;t know the rules for hostname for a given protocol. This is also not a valid IP address according to RFC 3986 (which specifies URI syntax), as this specification requires #.#.#.# format with three dots.<p>That said, using authority for something that isn&#x27;t technically a hostname is misusing the field. I think using `&lt;scheme&gt;:&lt;integer&gt;` would have been a better idea.')
