The Flash runtime itself is not particularly interesting, and in fact it’s full of undesirable problems. If you ignore the tooling of Flash, very little about it is appealing. If you even just ignore Flash itself and include Flex, Haxe, and other authoring tools that can deal in flash runtime, it <i>still</i> isn’t that appealing.<p>These arguments get confusing because HTML, SVG and JavaScript are human readable and writeable. But that doesn’t mean the way someone should make animations in HTML5 is by typing coordinates into a text editor.<p>If there really is a gap in the web runtime that Flash fills, what is it?<p>Edit: also, I believe they are directly and indirectly arguing for the existence of such a tool:<p>&gt; 1) For 95% of applications you can just distribute a single SWF file<p>&gt; 2) You have a robust authoring tool that is animation&#x2F;graphics-first and newbie friendly<p>The first one is 100% technically possible with tooling; though admittedly better embedding of assets would be nice. The second one is just literally directly asking for such a tool.')
