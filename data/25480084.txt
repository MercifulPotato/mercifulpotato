I&#x27;ve always thought the government should be a refuge for the sick and the poor and the downtrodden in society.<p>But the best way to describe CA is mismanaged. Accidentally giving out $2 billion to fraudulent unemployment claimants? Spending more money on social issues like drug abuse and homelessness only to have record after record smashed in levels of both.<p>It&#x27;s sad, but I really wonder if the compassionate thing is to resist the policies that sound compassionate because clearly, visibly they don&#x27;t work.')
