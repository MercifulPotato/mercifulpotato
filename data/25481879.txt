(TAS) They then sell contracts to get them to a flat position so they don&#x27;t actually have to take physical stock.<p>This part is very routine. The unusual thing is that the price actually went negative so when they &quot;bought&quot; to cover they were actually paid nearly $40. So they profited both off the short position and again to buy to cover.')
