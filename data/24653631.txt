But- as an employer, am I mandated to hire a pedophile for my software developer job? I just object morally, and the company is my private property. Is this really a good use of state power, to compel me to hire an evil person?<p>Anyways, it&#x27;d be impossible to enforce, because I could just say the pedophile failed my coding test. Even if he sued me, it&#x27;d be very unlikely to prove his case, and he&#x27;s probably starting at a deficit with a court.<p>The issue is that people here are confusing levels of analysis- &#x27;society&#x27; should help ex-offenders find gainful employment, but I am not &#x27;society&#x27;, I am just one company. Society should also clean up pollution, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that I&#x27;m personally obligated to scrub a Superfund site myself')
