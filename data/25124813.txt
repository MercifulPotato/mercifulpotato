Why would you?<p>More typically, I will &quot;git fetch origin&quot; to fetch the current integration branches, then &quot;git checkout -b &lt;feature branch&gt; origin&#x2F;master&quot; to start a new feature branch from a given integration branch, then push that once the change is completed.<p>If I need to update a local copy of an integration branch, then I might well use &quot;git pull&quot;.  But I would never have any local changes made there which would require stashing, since all changes are done on feature branches.')
