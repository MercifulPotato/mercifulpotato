See also: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hrsa.gov&#x2F;vaccine-compensation&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hrsa.gov&#x2F;vaccine-compensation&#x2F;index.html</a><p>Example 2: War on Crime &#x2F; Safety<p>Another example would be the war on crime. Liberties and lives are sacrificed in the name of safety for others. Unfortunately, the liberty&#x2F;lives sacrificed fall disproportionately into one group, and those protected fall disproportionately into a different group group. If you look at the 2nd order effects (impoverishment, single-parent households, effects on education and future) lots more lives are lost, again in a subset of society.')
