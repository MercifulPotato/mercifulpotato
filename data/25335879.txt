In its heyday it was uncannily good. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;d guess my object 80% of the times in 20 questions and 90% of the time within 30 questions. The weights would update if different people gave different answers for the same object, etc.<p>In its current incarnation, it is fairly poor as I mentioned in another comment. It couldn&#x27;t even come close to guessing a screwdriver, for example.')
