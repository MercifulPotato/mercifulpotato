We cannot say based on current information if withholding some virus particles at the cost of delivering a few in a more long-lasting form is better or worse.<p>Since we cannot test all possibilities here, it is then left to intuition and &quot;wisdom&quot;.  I have to believe that significantly reducing the number of virus particles in the air while allowing a few to linger longer would be preferable to the opposite.<p>As I have observed, people are terrible at judging distances.  I am probably more likely to get infected by a spray of cough droplets at close range than a few individual tiny droplets floating in the breeze.  If I had my way, most people would be wearing masks permananently (and also not allowed to come within 3 meters of me), virus or not.')
