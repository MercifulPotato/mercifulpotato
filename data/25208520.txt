Item(by='siraben', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606307491, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25203802, text='Nix has had a progress indicator for a few years now[0].  It doesn&#x27;t provide any time estimates but it does show which part of the build it is on (unpack&#x2F;patch&#x2F;configure&#x2F;build&#x2F;install), how many dependencies it has built or fetched from a binary cache and how many remain.  The full build log is accessible with the nix-log command as well, so it&#x27;s nice from the both a user and dev viewpoint.<p>For long builds I have stopped watching build logs live altogether and append `; tput bel` to the command to get audible feedback at the end.<p>For graphical applications, especially on mobile, I wish progress bars got out of the way more.  Users ought to be able to continue using an app while a task occurs in a separate thread, and whose progress bar doesn&#x27;t take up the entire visual field.  Many apps, especially on iOS, seem to still be guilty of this.<p>[0] The creator shows it off here, to applause: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;XVIKScU7Uf4?t=420" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;XVIKScU7Uf4?t=420</a>')
