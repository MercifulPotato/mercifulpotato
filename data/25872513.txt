Not legally, but morally.<p>&gt; There is nothing wrong with what Amazon is doing ethically.<p>You&#x27;re responding to something he didn&#x27;t say, and it&#x27;s telling. He was referring to morals; you&#x27;re talking about ethics. There&#x27;s a difference, and it matters. MOST of the discussion on this issue seems to miss this distinction, and what the difference implies, and that&#x27;s telling too.<p>As someone else pointed out above, Amazon owes the entirety of it&#x27;s BAZILLION-dollar AWS business to open source. You&#x27;d think they could find it in their hearts to acquiesce to a simple request that they not muddy the waters around Elastic&#x27;s registered trademark. That was immoral. Everything else that has now followed, whether legal or ethical, is based on an immorality.')
