In my opinion it&#x27;s more likely that in the future it will remain a niche, but never become really a hit in the general population. A bit like flight sticks or wheels are mostly for people who like to play simulators and have a small but very dedicated public.<p>There&#x27;s still some room for growth as better products come out for better prices, but I don&#x27;t see everybody adopting it, it&#x27;s too much of a hastle.')
