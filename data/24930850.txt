It&#x27;s what happens with Kindle books. I remember having this very same conversation and debate on the Magic: The Gathering forums 18 years ago when Magic: The Gathering Online came out.<p>If you&#x27;re buying a digital good and don&#x27;t get a copy that you can download onto your drive and interact offline, go ahead and assume you rented it.
