Audio CAPTCHAs help, but as HN user miki123211 pointed out [1], they&#x27;re only useful to blind people who aren&#x27;t also hard of hearing and can understand the spoken language being used (usually English). And I assume that for the sites that use CAPTCHAs, just dropping them isn&#x27;t an option. So, since there&#x27;s no solution, I&#x27;m glad there are services like Be My Eyes to help.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25011654" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25011654</a>')
