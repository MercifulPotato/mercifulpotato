Besides them being Electron apps that throw every single system UI idiom out the window and behave like they&#x27;re something else, they are just too easy to misuse and suck tremendously if they aren&#x27;t something you use every day but only check occasionally.<p>One thing that I don&#x27;t like in Discord in particular is that if you haven&#x27;t launched it for a month, you&#x27;re in for a bad time. First, it&#x27;s going to update like 7 times. Then, everything has a red badge on it. EVERYTHING. It&#x27;s absolutely impossible to navigate through this mess of useless &quot;server announcements&quot; and other crap with @all in it.<p>Also message replies are about as awkward as one could&#x27;ve made them.')
