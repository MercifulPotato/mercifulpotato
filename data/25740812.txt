Instead, Stoicism encourages you to focus on maximizing the good within yourself, as that is all that is within your control.<p>The only thing that Stoicism decries as pointless is lamenting or lauding the <i>actual</i> outcomes of your actions or those of others. It is not the belief that all of life is meaningless, or that &quot;world views&quot; are pointless. It is kin to neither Nihilism nor Hedonism.<p>&quot;Maximizing the good within yourself&quot; does involve considering what outcomes you believe your actions will yield. Stoicism begs that you understand the distinction between predicted outcomes and actual outcomes, and detach yourself emotionally from the latter.')
