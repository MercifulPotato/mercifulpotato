It&#x27;s really the only way to negotiate, pretty common. The wording is important here. If you word it as &quot;Do X or I&#x27;ll quit&quot; it sounds childish, if you word it as &quot;I believe the company should X, otherwise I can&#x27;t see myself working here comfortably and will have to consider my resignation&quot; it sounds professional, but the idea is the exact same.')
