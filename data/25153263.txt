Both of us working in cluster management (google etc.).<p>I feel service mesh provides good value in application layer policy control traffic management (routing, rate limiting etc.), security, deep observability. But it nonetheless still only provide the mechanisms at this point. I.e., one can implement to a high degree of flexibility whatever policy for their applications running on k8s clusters. But the complexity is exposed naked to the user.<p>A solution is to provide more abstraction, but it&#x27;s not clear what that abstraction would be.<p>My friend said similar thing. And he said unless there are thousands of applications to manage, service meshes does not worth the investment. Or the break-even point for service mesh today is very high, probably only makes sense for orgs that is at or beyond Uber&#x27;s size.<p>Would love to see how others view the value prop of service mesh, and what additional investment could make it easier to get value from service mesh.')
