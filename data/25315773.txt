I like the way buildroot handles it (I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re not the only ones, but that&#x27;s the one project I&#x27;m most familiar with):<p>- The buildroot buildbot fetches third party packages dependencies and archive them.<p>- When you build your buildroot image locally, it attempts to fetch from the third party directly. If the file doesn&#x27;t exist anymore, it falls back onto the buildroot cache instead.<p>You could also easily add your own caching layer in there if you wanted too. I think that&#x27;s distributed computing at its best: simple and robust, with a clear and easily understandable architecture. No blockchain-based proof-of-stake distributed storage, just a series of wget. And of course since everything is authenticated with a strong hash it&#x27;s always perfectly safe.')
