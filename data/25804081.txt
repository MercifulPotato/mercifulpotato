I do agree you can have flaky network, but the biggest give of the laziness behind the argument is not inspecting error codes at all. In this particular case 508 for example is clear indicator of some error status. Why would you even keep blind retries in place? I hate the argument of devs arguing for &quot;dumb clients&quot; and server &quot;taking care of everything&quot;. Even for network failures IDK how having a retry within millisecond will actually help. It will be more detrimental to your infra, bandwidth, battery than a once or twice snappy experience argument.')
