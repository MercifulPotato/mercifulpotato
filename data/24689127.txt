Item(by='klodolph', descendants=None, kids=[24691093], score=None, time=1601914828, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24688483, text='Dunkin’ Donuts barely has a presence on the west coast, you are probably better off looking for local chains.<p>Just playing around with Google Maps I could see about 10 Dunkin’ Donuts in the SF bay area (pop 8 million), and about 20 Dunkin’ Donuts within the Kansas City limits (pop 500,000). I couldn’t find any Dunkin’ Donuts in the Portland or Seattle areas but I didn’t look very hard. My impression is that the folks living in the PNW would regard Dunkin’ Donuts as some kind of foreign intruder.<p>There are plenty of coffee shops open at 5am, speaking from experience living on the west coast, but if you are particular about getting Dunkin’ Donuts specifically you will usually have to drive farther, on account of them not really being a west coast phenomenon.<p>Now that I live on the east coast I can see a Dunkin’ Donuts spaced about every quarter mile, and I can only imagine what kind of hysteria led there to be so many of them so close together.')
