That is, they are ruthless and destructive, and claim doing so was necessary, but it&#x27;s only because there was a very very simple alternate approach (often requiring some modicum of social awareness) that could have yielded something even better at a fraction of the financial and personal cost. Their approach is often presented as &quot;harsh but necessary&quot; when it&#x27;s anything but.<p>Also, they tend to deceptively take credit for progress, in the sense that things that would have occurred regardless, even without them in that position. Often things were already in progress before they attained their position, and often the people who were responsible for that are actually eliminated by them so as to remove threats to them getting credit. This is part of the problem: that they tend to manipulate others and the system for their own gain. In fact, I&#x27;m a bit suspicious of attributions of success associated with dark traits, even in a research context, because of this phenomenon. I wouldn&#x27;t say I think the association isn&#x27;t there, but I think it&#x27;s a serious research design problem that isn&#x27;t completely addressed (e.g., let&#x27;s say you have a company whose profits are starting to increase with acceleration, and a psychopath who wants to gain from that. if they move up in a leadership position as they see it as profitable personally, are subsequent institutional gains due to them or the pre-existing conditions the psychopath appraised? It will look like the gains occurred after the psychopath entered the position, but in reality, the causal direction goes the other way around -- that the psychopath was attracted to the position because they saw it as something that would reflect well on them).<p>I think there&#x27;s some kind of bias in play with these sorts of social-personality characteristics, where people tend to have a blind spot to the opportunity costs of this behavior (akin to survivorship bias but different). It probably has an established name, but I don&#x27;t know what it is.')
