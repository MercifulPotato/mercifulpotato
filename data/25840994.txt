Which I&#x27;m not sure how to even respond to comments like that since my opening line states the opposite. That just I don&#x27;t like the conventional alternative. But I guess this is the problem that we&#x27;re talking about (and seems to becoming increasingly more common), that we&#x27;re removing the nuance from problems and trying to apply overly simplified solutions. All that results is in continued problems and continued infighting. I&#x27;m not sure how to break the cycle when people on HN are forcing a position on me that I explicitly stated I did not hold.')
