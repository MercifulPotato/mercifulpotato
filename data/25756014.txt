How large is the gap? If the gap is small, it means the algorithms as currently used for optimizations are inherently expensive (i.e. a &quot;good&quot; compiler &quot;must&quot; be slow). if the gap is large, it means a much faster implementation is theoretically possible (i.e. a &quot;good&quot; compiler &quot;can&quot; be fast).')
