But even this is often misunderstood. The big mistake people make about it is to think of it as a merely negative quality. The language we use reinforces that idea. You&#x27;re unconventional. You don&#x27;t care what other people think. But it&#x27;s not just a kind of immunity. In the most independent-minded people, the desire not to be told what to think is a positive force. It&#x27;s not mere skepticism, but an active delight in ideas that subvert the conventional wisdom, the more counterintuitive the better.<p>I&#x27;ve found quite a lot in my career that often people mistake understanding someone elses line of thought as acceptance of such a thought. This invariantly upsets someone that to be quite frankly isn&#x27;t mentally equipped (and no I not using that a euphemism for stupid, I mean they literally cannot have conversations about ideas and that maybe due to a number of reasons that have nothing to do with their intelligence) will become upset and then you end up in an argument and the conversation is derailed.<p>Also simply examining pre-conceptions of why a problem exists also seems to upset some. Normally because you are undermining their authority in one manner or another or they have accepted the initial pre-conception cannot be incorrect because it is normally considered to be inevitable.')
