(I haven&#x27;t tried user-user encryption), but the verification popups are annoying.<p>- I don&#x27;t want popups or notifications, but whenever I use it, I&#x27;m greeted with one.<p>- Once I click &quot;Verify&quot;, it&#x27;s not clear how to proceed. It indicates to use a mobile phone etc with the app installed to verify. There are two clickable things: A big red &quot;Skip&quot; that appears to be the default button: This takes you back. A green hyperlink showing &quot;Use recovery key or passphrase&quot;. Is this the &quot;continue with verification and making the popup go away&quot; button? It then asks for a passphrase, which I can only pass because it&#x27;s stored in Firefox. What does this have to do with phone? Is the phone picture supposed to be clickable?<p>- Once I get past this, it still show a popup every time I open the page; this time, it asks me to review where I&#x27;ve logged in.<p>- Once I click review, I&#x27;m sent to a &quot;Welcome to Element&quot; page. The popup shows again next time I refresh or open the page.')
