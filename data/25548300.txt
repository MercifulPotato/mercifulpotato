Think enabling quick conversations around popular topics.  There&#x27;s no user registration so no tracking necessary. Think of it almost like IRC for the web in a clean format and easy to share.  I&#x27;m considering this a public beta so people can try it out and give me their honest feedback.  I&#x27;m hoping this is something that people would find really useful so they&#x27;re not communicating on platforms that require a bunch of hoops to get through.  Would love to hear people&#x27;s thoughts!')
