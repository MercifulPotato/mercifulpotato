I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re saying that was at one time a popular moral action, so I&#x27;m not sure what you mean about Weinstein learning that one day&#x27;s popular moral action is the next&#x27;s reprehensible mistake. Is there some position on controversial issues he took that I&#x27;m not thinking of, that at one point was popular but no longer is? Or what do you mean about Weinstein making a mistake by taking a controversial political stand?')
