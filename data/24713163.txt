The set that kills people, doesn&#x27;t save people.<p>You think it&#x27;s ok to sell the set that kills people because they have a set thats save people.<p>I know it&#x27;s not ok to sell features that kill people and don&#x27;t save anyone. It&#x27;d be one thing if it could save people, but it doesn&#x27;t. The other set does that.<p>This set just kills people. Doesn&#x27;t save anyone.<p>Stop selling it.<p>Simple as that.')
