Everyone gets 24 hours. Take off about 8 hours for sleeping. That&#x27;s what you have to play with. How you choose to divide that up is up to you but it&#x27;s always used in full, no matter how you choose to use it. In this day and age the amount of time you need to dedicate to just surviving is close to zero. It&#x27;s your choice to work more and not have enough time to play chess.')
