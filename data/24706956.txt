In a high pressure situation like a penalty it&#x27;s so easy to get under it and send it soaring over the bar.<p>I think it&#x27;s more about going with what you are confident with, and having the resolve to not change your mind just before you hit the ball. I had a pretty solid right footed drive, so I&#x27;d just crack it low and hard into the bottom left. That way I didn&#x27;t have to be particularly accurate to get a good chance of converting it (it didn&#x27;t have to be tucked JUST inside the post) but the keeper had to:<p>1. guess the right side<p>2. know I was going low<p>3. dive very quickly<p>4. dive quite far<p>I know that any time I missed I doubted myself or changed my mind at the last minute and tried something different or fancy. I was not a famous footballer facing an opponent who had studied my stats though - so I doubt this is a strategy that works outside Sunday League :-)<p>edit: I went back to check Beckham&#x27;s penalty against Portugal to check my memory wasn&#x27;t misleading me ... man that was some shootout: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=WlEUdZgH0gc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=WlEUdZgH0gc</a><p>- David Beckham kicks his penalty over the crossbar, out of the stadium and into orbit<p>- Rui Costa kicks his penalty over too, not quite as high<p>- Nuno Gomes (I think?) does a Panenka<p>- Ricardo saves a penalty for Portugal without his gloves, then proceeds to take penalty himself ... and scores, winning the game')
