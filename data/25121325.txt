The real trick is that the forced exercise catches data errors (1 copy is missind&#x2F;bad) long before they become corruptions (multiple copies are missing&#x2F;bad). The bandwidth to read all of your flash disk in the space of a week is also much easier to come by, because flash has a much “better” ratio of bandwidth:storage size. The advice is very much rooted in being a “one size fits all” for both spinning rush and solid state - Spinning rust needs the checksums, flash can simply afford the waste.')
