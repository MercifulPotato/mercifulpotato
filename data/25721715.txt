We ban accounts for that, regardless of which ideology they&#x27;re for or against, and regardless of how wrong other people are or you feel they are. You&#x27;ve been doing this a long time, you&#x27;ve been using the site primarily for it, and we&#x27;ve asked you many times previously to stop.<p>HN is a site for thoughtful, curious conversation. There&#x27;s no substantive and interesting discussion that can&#x27;t be had that way, and accounts that are unwilling to stop setting fires and attacking others are not cool here. Ironically, the people destroying the commons this way have far more in common with their enemies than they do with the bulk of the community, who come here to find interesting things to read and to escape this sort of ragey shitfest.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to be banned, you&#x27;re welcome to email hn@ycombinator.com and give us reason to believe that you&#x27;ll follow the rules in the future. You&#x27;ve posted some good comments in the past, but the damage caused by the abusive ones unfortunately far outweighs the benefit of the good ones.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>')
