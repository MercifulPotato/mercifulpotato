I&#x27;m growing less and less fond of HN&#x27;s tendency to push people to the thin ice.<p>I do believe that the average person has a higher chance of being impacted by any of the big techs causing pain, then getting sick from something at a Cargill plant.  Cargill isn&#x27;t a delta away from the problems other companies experience.  Heck, salad companies seem to be the biggest offender.  I was never worried about beef.  Turkey on the other hand seemed to show up a lot in the news.<p><i>Not to mention their rampant chemical dumping.</i><p>When I think rampant chemical dumping, I think of 3M poisoning the ground in various places.  There was a real case of politicians letting a company off.')
