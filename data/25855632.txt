I don&#x27;t think you considered the reasons for Chrome&#x27;s dominance in the market, which is more to do with other issues such as Google&#x27;s position of power than the issues you brought up here.<p>Chrome on Android has never supported addons, and now with Google spear heading changes such as manifest v3, I would consider these worse than decisions Mozilla have made with Firefox. You fail to mention decisions such as Mozilla&#x27;s continued investment into tracking protection, which have been inheriting protections originating from the Tor Browser project.<p>I think the reasons why Mozilla have decided to slowly reintroduce addons to their new Android release should be considered. Their efforts to work with uBlock Origin to create a better mobile interface seems to point towards a desire for quality control, one that Google avoids with Chrome on Android altogether.')
