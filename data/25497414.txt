If you look at the startups of the late 90&#x27;s-- the time when people learned that stock options could be very valuable-- it took a lot of engineers and infrastructure to make a tech start up.  As you point out more services and frameworks exist now.<p>The reason why it takes more employees is the reason cited in the paper, companies stay private longer to make more money for growth investors.<p>I agree completely with your point about the impact on employees.  It&#x27;s just that its not because the product requires it, it is because investors want the private growth.')
