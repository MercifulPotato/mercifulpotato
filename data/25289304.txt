I&#x27;m not able to find a year-by-year comparison for pay bands at Google on levels.fyi, so I&#x27;m not sure what your point is with that site.<p>I don&#x27;t work at Google, so proving that Google specifically is cutting wages isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;m able to do. At the same time, I don&#x27;t think you need to prove that Google&#x27;s incentivized to maximize profits. They&#x27;re a publicly traded company; there will always be motivation for them to reduce costs. If you&#x27;re in search of proof, the anti-poaching lawsuit[0] is not something to take lightly.<p>And either way, I don&#x27;t see you bringing up any strong arguments against collective action. Just because Google might not be doing something to reduce compensation right this second doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t have the power to do that in the future.<p>[0]:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnet.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;apple-google-others-settle-anti-poaching-lawsuit-for-415-million&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnet.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;apple-google-others-settle-anti-po...</a>')
