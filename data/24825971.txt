Great read when the discussion got into the CLEVR data sets and hybrid system.<p>Hybrid AI has been a keen interest after I retired from almost 5 years of work with deep learning. I just took a job on a knowledge graph team and it feels great to be working on a different approach to knowledge representation and reasoning. My personal opinion is that Hybrid AI is the future and I wouldn’t be surprised to see an exponential growth of practical results, similar to what happened with deep learning around 2013.')
