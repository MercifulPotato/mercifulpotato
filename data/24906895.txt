Why else would my opinion matter here?<p>I know very little about HR departments and bias training. I <i>do</i> know a lot of academics who study race in fields like history and sociology and I do know that people scream at some of them and call them anti-white even though their scholarship is very rigorous. So I would expect there to be a range of quality among bias training and that both high and low quality bias training causes certain groups of people to lash out. But I also have basically no information here.')
