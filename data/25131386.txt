This generates a bunch of work not visible to management and the company as a whole. The author suggests looking at programming sprints as a time where we define the work to be done and just let people do it without being interrupted. I would leave it up to the programmers to respond if they&#x27;re actually left alone to do their work or if they&#x27;re sitting in the same amount of useless meetings as the rest of us.')
