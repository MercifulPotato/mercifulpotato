Item(by='hncommenter13', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612187954, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25986320, text='It&#x27;s trivial to prove that naked short selling doesn&#x27;t exist the way the author thinks it does.<p>a) Take my word for it. I am a former VC now working as a professional short seller (for the past eight years; my first really great short idea I found from a comment on HN). When I instruct our prime broker to short a stock, I must provide a matching locate id that corresponds to a specific block of borrowed stock. No locate id, no trade. Can&#x27;t locate the stock to borrow to obtain a locate id? No trade.<p>Get a margin account and try it yourself.<p>b) Borrow costs. If I could short sell anything I wanted without having to borrow the stock, there wouldn&#x27;t be such a thing as a borrow cost. I could short anything in as much size as I wanted for free. (And retail traders wouldn&#x27;t get paid for lending their shares, which happens all the time.)<p>c) Recalls. If naked shorting were a thing, there would be no such thing as stock borrows getting recalled. Again, take my word for it, they happen.<p>d) Margin. Would I have to post cash collateral to our prime broker to borrow a stock if I could naked short? There&#x27;s no stock I need to return, as I wouldn&#x27;t have borrowed it from anyone. I mean, I guess I could still lose money short a stock and they&#x27;d want some protection against that, but I doubt we&#x27;d have Reg T margin rules if naked short selling were a thing.<p>And nobody could make me close the short, unless the company got sold. I could just stay short forever, as I haven&#x27;t borrowed anything that ever needs to be returned.<p>So if interest rates were &gt;0%, I could just naked short at no fee, let the cash from the short sale sit in my account collecting interest, and never have to cover the short. I&#x27;d also pay no dividends on the borrowed stock, as I presently must, as I hadn&#x27;t actually borrowed it.<p>In other words, riskless profit for everybody. Let me know if you find one of those.<p>e) There are dozens of stocks out there that I (and lots of other people) believe will likely be worth zero one day, but it&#x27;s uneconomic to make that bet as the borrow cost is 90%+. If I could naked short, I&#x27;d make a huge fortune shorting them to zero. Other people would make huge fortunes. Neither I nor other short sellers have such fortunes. If short sellers made fortunes, there&#x27;d be hundreds of short-only funds. There are barely a handful remaining.<p>More broadly, I&#x27;ve worked on hundreds of shorts over the past eight years. In some cases, the company was perfectly legitimate, just overvalued by an enthusiastic market. I&#x27;ve also helped expose companies that were screwing people and lying to investors, in several cases resulting in SEC investigations and criminal indictments. And I&#x27;ve lost money when companies got bought by other companies that later wrote off the entire investment. I&#x27;ve also been straight up wrong on plenty of them, and exited the position when that became clear.<p>An important function of the market is price discovery, and my job--like that of a long-oriented analyst--is to express the reasoned view that the current price is wrong. It&#x27;s not a market if there&#x27;s no way to express a contrary view.<p>Nothing I say or do can keep a company from raising capital or succeeding if the bull case is more convincing than the bear case. (Again, if I could destroy companies based on shorting them--even if I had to borrow the stock--I&#x27;d never lose money. So everyone would do it.) Netflix has had short interest forever and ever, and proved all the doubters wrong.<p>And if you don&#x27;t believe that overly high prices lead to misallocated investment in nonsense projects, take a good look at the amount of money sloshign around Silicon Valley these days.<p>The fact is, it&#x27;s a lot more fun and profitable to be a venture capitalist than it is to be a short seller, and there&#x27;s a lot more VCs as a result.')
