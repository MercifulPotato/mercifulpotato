All the suffering I endured during these years just because suits didn&#x27;t want big pharma to lose money... I am bitter about this that justice won&#x27;t be done. I hope one day karma will reach those people who block access to medicine. I am not saying cannabis is a miracle, but it has changed my life for better.')
