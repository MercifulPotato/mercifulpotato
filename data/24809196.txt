But it isn&#x27;t.<p>If I am in the middle of something, and put my laptop to sleep at the end of the day, I absolutely do not expect it to wake up in the small hours, reboot itself, and lose all my work.<p>The &quot;active hours&quot; is irrelevant.  Unconfirmed reboots at any time are completely unacceptable.  Look at how MacOS does it.  Or Linux updates.  Let the user have some modicum of control in scheduling them at their convenience.  It&#x27;s their computer.  It&#x27;s their work.  It&#x27;s their schedule.  Computers are supposed to empower us, not enslave us, but it seems increasingly the other way around.  They give others control over us.')
