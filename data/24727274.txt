Item(by='hakfoo', descendants=None, kids=[24727675], score=None, time=1602223329, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24725049, text='Couldn&#x27;t much of this be scaled back if we removed some of the layers and intermediaries?<p>If we had a single state-run bank (even if it were just as the fulfillment &quot;back end&quot; behind different consumer-facing servicing organizations), then a transfer would occur on a single ledger in a matter of milliseconds, rather than waiting for the East Podunk Bank, Trust, and Pork Cannery to pull a batched update file over a T-1 they put in in the first Bush administration.<p>Fraud could be handled better than it is now.  We have terrible security&#x2F;convenience compromises (Chip + Signature, anyone?) and when we try to improve matters (3-D Secure) it is presented so badly and clumsily that it basically dies on arrival (it&#x27;s coming back, but mostly because the EU is cramming it down people&#x27;s throats)<p>Chargebacks are a weird case.  It feels like they come from two places-- either as the first response to a fraudulent transaction, or as an escalation for when there&#x27;s no other way to get satisfaction.  If you&#x27;re fair with your refund policy, your chargeback rate should be close to nil.')
