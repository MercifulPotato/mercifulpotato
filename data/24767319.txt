Japan was the target of massive immigration from China. Modern Japanese people are of Chinese descent (&quot;yayoi&quot;), with aboriginal DNA. So it is not simply the case a writing system having an influential effect. Foreigners brought their language, mixed it with the local language and evolved a new one out of that.')
