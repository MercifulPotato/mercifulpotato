To say accept 50% of the claims, rather than 100%.  You should accept 0% of claims that you have not verified.  This is also known as the scientific method.  (But don&#x27;t look to science to be upholding it...)<p>The elites govern us.  They have always governed us.  One of the methodologies is that is to sell us on stories from the cradle that allow them to operate in reality, while we are living in unsubstantiated stories.<p>When we take no action to verify, when we trust our experts, politicians, anyone apart from ourselves, when we accept the authority of another over our own experience, we are badly lost.<p>Do you recollect when it was going to be 2 weeks to flatten the curve?  Do you think the curve will be flattened?  Do we need to &#x27;mask harder&#x27;?  Get vaccinated?  Why didn&#x27;t we have cold vaccines previously?  Do we need to isolate healthy people, is that how it works?  The contradictions in the current narrative are impossible to resolve if you are a thinking person with authority over your own thinking.<p>McCain is clearly from the governance clique.  His father was an admiral.  He then does a dog and pony show in the intimidating country of &#x27;Vietnam&#x27;, and comes back into governance and plays his role.  He is an actor.  We get indications of this, eg the broken leg that changes legs!  Here&#x27;s the explanation:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dailymail.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;article-5113233&#x2F;John-McCain-solves-riddle-moveable-leg-brace.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dailymail.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;article-5113233&#x2F;John-McCain...</a><p>He says:<p>&quot;Finally on Thursday, McCain himself took to Twitter to put the conspiracy theories to rest.\n&#x27;My left leg was doing extra work to compensate for the boot, so I&#x27;m giving it a break,&#x27; the senator tweeted.\n&#x27;I still hate wearing this boot, but it won&#x27;t slow us down from frying 7 turkeys today!&#x27;&quot;<p>That explanation explains nothing.  NOTHING.  But the headline says it &quot;solves the riddle of his moveable leg&quot;.  Maybe you read it wrong?  Perhaps you had better doubt yourself, and trust the experts!  And then you have to read a load more soft spin and fluff about how wonderful man, what a wonderful family, etc, etc, and nothing about him being a criminal that should have spent most of his time in jail for being an enemy of humanity - being part of the governance system.<p>The reality unfortunately is that no one is checking anything, and that people&#x27;s brains are turned off.  Especially well educated brains.  They have fully accepted the stories, and are better at filling in the blanks, rather than letting the evidence do the talking.<p>All the best.')
