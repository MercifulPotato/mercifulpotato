Before then, he was an acerbic jerk writing with moral clarity about the persistent overreach of the US security state.  His writing had crunch and specificity, and his targets were all over the political map.<p>But post-Snowden, he took a hard partisan turn.  He&#x27;d enter regular tiresome disagreements where really the only argument was over who was being more hyperbolic or hypocritical.  And he... ignore stuff you&#x27;re really expect he&#x27;d care about.  He spent years flogging the media for overemphasis of Russian interference because it was a &quot;crazy conspiracy theory&quot; but I swear he never once said a peep about Q.  Really, if you knew nothing about the guy&#x27;s history and just read his 2016-20 writing, you&#x27;d just figure he was an oddbally high brow Trump fan.<p>And very notably: this was true ONLY in his writing about US policy.  His Brazil stuff was widely regarded (by others -- I don&#x27;t speak Portuguese nor am I an expert on Brazilian politics) as just as good (and acerbic) as his earlier work about the Bush administration.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just branding.  Maybe he figured he&#x27;d do better career-wise selling his work into a right wing market than he would continuing to criticize everyone.  But... that doesn&#x27;t sound right to me, because he&#x27;s not exploiting typical right wing audiences nor using right wing platforms to do it.<p>Something happened to Greenwald c. 2013-14')
