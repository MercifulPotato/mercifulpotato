First they wired up city offices&#x2F;departments, schools, etc, in a traditional fiber network.  They had a few years experiance with it.  Then added a few commercial customers, and then a few apartment buildings downtown near their core.<p>Once they decided to do municipal fiber, it took at least 2 years to see anything.  They had to:<p>- Test offering video&#x2F;phone, and setup contracts to become a telco and TV provider with the state, regulators, etc\n- Negotiate video rebroadcast rights, find upstream telephony providers, etc<p>- Hire some consultants to help them plan out their GPON network, and decide what equipment to buy, and where to locate it to cover the entire town.<p>- Build the initial short fiber run to a brand new neighborhood that was getting built, and have them &#x27;beta-test&#x27; the setup.<p>- Hired some contractors that specialize in running data cables to do the runs through town, but they had to wait at least 7 months for them to be free of other major projects before they could get started<p>- start building out the network from the central locations out to the suburbs.  This meant larger building near downtown get first shot at access, as they are the first ones passed.  Tunneling under streets, sidewalks, etc, rather than digging it all up is pretty spendy, and slow.')
