However, this is complicated by a few facts: DOS support was dropped in Windows a long time ago (DOS binaries don&#x27;t load on Windows 10, for example), and DOS programs use a completely different execution environment.<p>&gt; This repo builds a single .exe file with a &quot;polyglot&quot; MZ header which allows it to load one program (the original DOOM) when running inside DOS, and a different program (a custom static build of Chocolate DOOM) when running on Windows.')
