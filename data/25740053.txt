To the extent it is met, perhaps there are imports of material goods or domestic labor (nurses?)<p>I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to worry about &quot;domestic debt&quot; in the same way, given the non-liberal political economy. Of course that doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t limits, but the limits maybe would take the form of e.g. rising discontent and decreased productivity if it feels like an old-people-focused service economy with nothing in it for the workers.')
