If cost were only partly a constraint, how good could we build a CRT today?<p>I am still mesmerized by new display technologies &#x2F; display technologies that I haven’t seen in a long time. Like the vector CRTs that exist in old Asteroids cabinets. The phosphors are really bright—brighter than you can imagine an LCD being.<p>I also remember the first time I saw e-ink and being shocked to see something so inert looking shift to a new image.<p>This article really captured my imagination. I’ve not seen a modern GPU driving high frame rates on a CRT, but now I’m very curious to do so. I’d imagine the experience would defy my intuitions the same as it appears to have done for the authors here.')
