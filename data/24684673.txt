The CTO begged for them to go through with the aqui-hire.<p>If the employees don&#x27;t have faith in your big plans, and you turn down 4.5 million to make the transition smooth, is it really illegal for the employees to go work for someone else?<p>Hooked had these folks as at will employees and could fire them with 1 hr notice, and then is pissed they ended up going to work for Apple. Come ON! If you wanted them long term sign them to a long term contract.')
