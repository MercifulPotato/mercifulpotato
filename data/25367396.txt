The institutions and laws we inherited from the British are one of the few functioning parts of Bangladesh. When my parents were growing up, school instruction was still in English. That&#x27;s proven to be a huge leg up in the global economy. And culturally, my mom still cherishes the education she received in classic American, British, and Russian literature.<p>What would you be left with if you &quot;disentangled&quot; Bangladesh from the &quot;institutions&quot; and &quot;legal infrastructure&quot; of British colonialism? What&#x27;s left wouldn&#x27;t be a society fit for modern people. And what&#x27;s so good about what was there before the British, anyway? The Mughals were colonizers too. I have a Muslim last name despite being born thousands of miles away from the Middle East. How far back do we have to go?<p>There is a good essay by a Bangladeshi art historian on the subject: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.collegeart.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;programs&#x2F;international&#x2F;haque.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.collegeart.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;programs&#x2F;international&#x2F;haque....</a><p>&gt; Decolonization, as we call it, is rather a modern phenomenon that has been bubbling up since the late twentieth century. There are calls for decolonizing everything, art history included.<p>&gt;  In the postcolonial condition, the main challenge was to break this cycle or to create a process to rectify these influences. Indeed, such influences either denounced or distorted the precolonial ideas and elements of the society and culture. To many, this is what decolonization is, looking back to precolonial ideas.<p>&gt; But, where to start? To reshape the curriculum of art education, the first thing needed is literature for the students. The problem is that formal art education was institutionalized here during the British period.')
