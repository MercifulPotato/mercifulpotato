But many people gives high value to money and high status.<p>&gt; China lacks the West&#x27;s ability to draw, retain, and assimilate foreign talent en masse<p>That is probably true for now. I have seen the USA loosing that appeal, China may gain it. Hong Kong is going to be a test bed on China capacity to keep foreigners in the country as the region is already diverse.<p>China lacked the money to be multicultural, people was not willing to move to a poor country. That may change and Western democracies need to stop thinking that are the best in the world and work more to improve education, health care, inequality reduction and quality of life if we do not want to be surpassed in the future.')
