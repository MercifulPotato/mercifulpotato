One category I&#x27;ve thought about is videos as a few people submit those and I&#x27;ve been rejecting them because they don&#x27;t seem like webpages.  Putting them in their own category might solve that though.<p>As far as upvotes, there is currently a heart button you can click next to the website on the history section. Not very discoverable (looking at the metrics about 1 stumble in a thousand is getting a heart).<p>Right now the hearts don&#x27;t do anything but serve as a reminder for a user that they liked a page. I&#x27;ve thought about possibilities to incorporate that into the algorithm (e.g. more likely to get websites that have higher like rates) and having a leaderboard is a good idea too, though I worry that it would give an incentive to manipulate the like buttons. Creating a new user right now is as easy as just generating a random string, so a bad actor could easily cause infinite likes to a page.')
