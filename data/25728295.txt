So perhaps I&#x27;m not well positioned to cast judgement there.<p>Anyway, any claim that an operating system is intuitive is subject to much discussion.  I endorse the early 90&#x27;s (perhaps predating even then) claim that the only intuitive interface is the nipple, beyond that the necessary interactions are learned.<p>And - hello again, yes - I&#x27;ll weigh in on the somewhat plaintive &#x27;if we want normal people to use free software&#x27; rejoinder with a marginally cynical observation.  Normal people <i>can</i> understand how computers work, and adjust their expectations, behaviour, and workflows to suit - worst case they&#x27;ll acquire the necessary skills to file bug reports or fix it themselves.<p><i>Average</i> people, on the other hand, are less likely to be satisfied.')
