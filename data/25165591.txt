We&#x27;re using IPv4 at this point. We haven&#x27;t looked much into IPv6 yet. That&#x27;s a good thought that configurations could be different.<p>2. The free scan runs all of the same scans as the paid plans (you can just run more volume on the paid plans). The one scan mentioned on that page that is not set up yet is the SSLyze scanner.<p>3. At the moment, additional pages of the same site would not be separate risks, the different instances are listed together under the same risk. We&#x27;re looking at adding more flexibility in accepting risks, such as rules applied to all targets or groups of targets, maybe we can provide an option to break out instances separately when doing this. If you scan multiple sites&#x2F;addresses we do create a separate risk for each.')
