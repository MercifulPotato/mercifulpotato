It&#x27;d probably be worthwhile to just scrap whatever they&#x27;ve been trying these past few decades and adopting methods used by almost any other country out there.<p>And I know this is an incredibly unpopular statement in HN, but the lax attitude towards drugs is a big contributor to the problem. I don&#x27;t think people should be in prison for smoking or swallowing whatever they want, but I don&#x27;t think public intoxication should be permissible either. When I lived in a certain large west coast city, it wasn&#x27;t uncommon to see someone sitting down on a street corner and pulling out a syringe. It wasn&#x27;t uncommon to see someone who clearly just took a solid hit of meth and decided to start stripping off their clothes on the streetcar. It was just part of city life there.<p>The attitudes towards this behavior are known pretty far and wide. Some people actively move to west coast cities because they know they can just give up on everything and abuse drugs all day without a care in the world. Treating drug addiction as some unavoidable pitiable disease hasn&#x27;t been helping. Sometimes people do need a kick in the butt to get up and get their life together, and I think some cities are afraid of perpetuating the equally harmful effects of the drug war and end up doing nothing at all. Some have legitimate mental illnesses and can be treated in other ways, but most of the people I encountered were people living a completely carefree life in a place with good weather.')
