And most Muslims in France don&#x27;t either as the wearing of burqas and niqabs was quite uncommon in the first place (some estimates placed the number of women wearing them at around 2000).<p>We can argue on the merit of forbidding full-covering or whether there was really a need for all that noise but there is a reasoning and much public debate on the matter.<p>From your original comment, you seem to disagree, but in France people are free to practice any religion they wish, as long as it is done within the boundaries of the country&#x27;s values and laws. So your statement of &quot;Religion is already banned in places such as France&quot; -without further characterisation- is clearly inflamatory and false.<p>[1]: Deepl makes a decent translation of this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.legifrance.gouv.fr&#x2F;dossierlegislatif&#x2F;JORFDOLE000022234691&#x2F;?detailType=EXPOSE_MOTIFS&amp;detailId=" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.legifrance.gouv.fr&#x2F;dossierlegislatif&#x2F;JORFDOLE000...</a>')
