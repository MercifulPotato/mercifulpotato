I&#x27;m not making any claims here. Not about Russia being behind it, nor the opposite.<p>If Norway publicly accuses Russia, then it better have some very credible (and independently verifiable) evidence for it (just an IP address from within Russia certainly won&#x27;t do).<p>After having seen a long chain of blatantly flawed and clearly political attribution to alleged Russian wrongdoings (in all kind of matters), I&#x27;d say not a single EU country (let alone the USA) still has even remotely enough credibility left for granting them any benefit of a doubt, whenever they come with yet another finger pointing exercise  towards Russia. I&#x27;m not saying Russia isn&#x27;t doing anything bad, they may very well be, but that&#x27;s no excuse for making accusations without credible evidence.<p>It should pretty clear by now that both the EU and USA aren&#x27;t much interested in ever providing actual proof. That alone should worry anyone, considering their own shoddy track records. When will people finally demand to either put up (the evidence) or shut up (with what mostly likely is rather dirty politics). Or maybe Russia should just start with somehow reciprocally deal with countries that make such accusations without a willingness to provide their proof. Maybe this game would stop, once it actually starts to hurt.<p>Sure, their email system was very likely hacked .. but what better way than to blame it on Russia, instead of the many other possibilities (probably including the possibility of embarrassing personal incompetence or a royal screw-up in their security setup). &quot;I&#x27;m not to blame, it was Russia that ate my homework!&quot;')
