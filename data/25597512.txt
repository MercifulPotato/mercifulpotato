I&#x27;m not remembering it fondly...I just remember it and thought it was funny that it was being renovated into an office at the time.<p>If I&#x27;m going to remember something fondly it will be the smaller music venues like Liberty Lunch and old Emo&#x27;s.<p>Honestly...most of the changes are good.  More smart people is always good. More VC attention is (mostly) good. Some of the new buildings are good.<p>What I don&#x27;t appreciate:<p>People that can&#x27;t stop talking about how awesome SF or NYC is.<p>Cookie cutter condos.<p>People that don&#x27;t appreciate what they&#x27;re moving to and trying to get the best parts shut down -- i.e. Don&#x27;t move to a condo next to a well known live music venue and try to get it shut down or at least quiet after 9 pm.  Not cool.<p>Cheap places to live are disappearing for people who don&#x27;t make a lot of cash.<p>Straining already struggling infrastructure (traffic and water, in particular).<p>Lame cookie-cutter architecture in general being thrown up as quickly as possible.<p>And, generally, bringing bad attitudes into what has been a very chill, very accepting culture.<p>But those are small things, all things considered.  Most of the people moving here are smart, cool people that acclimate quickly.  To them, I say Welcome!  To the others I say...maybe Dallas or Houston would be a better fit.')
