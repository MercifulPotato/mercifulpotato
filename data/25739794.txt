Item(by='u801e', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610408285, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25739080, text='&gt; Why does it have to be in the US or Canada, places known to have extremely few protected bike lanes, and almost no protected intersections?<p>Because then you can make a direct comparison in terms of crash rates, counts, etc. between roads that have these facilities and those that don&#x27;t, or compare the data before and after facilities have been put in place.<p>&gt; Now, how many six year olds do you think can safely &#x27;take the lane&#x27; on busy American arterials independently from their parents?<p>How many 6 year olds do you see traveling independently around places outside their immediate neighborhood? It seems you&#x27;re using an example of a need that simply doesn&#x27;t exist. As a parent and knowing other parents, I&#x27;ve and they have never sent a 6 year old child to travel independently to some destination that requires they ride their bicycle for a couple of miles to get to.<p>In contrast, how many 6 year olds understand where to look for approaching traffic when cycling in the pedestrian position. Do they understand the risk of a right hook, left cross, or drive out? I tried asking my 9 year old and she wasn&#x27;t able to figure it out even with me showing a picture of a barrier separated bike lane approaching an intersection and asking her leading questions about where to look for approaching vehicles.<p>That being said, I would never let my children ride in a barrier separated bike lane because they don&#x27;t understand where they need to check for traffic when crossing an intersection.<p>As for taking the lane, one must understand the rules of the road for drivers of vehicles prior to doing that. I&#x27;m still working on that with my 9 year old. I don&#x27;t think that most 6 year olds are capable of that.')
