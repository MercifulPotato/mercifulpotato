It arrived... and was a CD. I contacted support, they sent out the record again. It was a CD. This happened twice more, and eventually the support person called me and said they&#x27;d de-listed it due to stock issues, and that I could keep all four of the CD copies that I didn&#x27;t want if I liked!')
