With the pandemic and all, UPS and USPS are obviously straining in general. It&#x27;s not like Wal-Mart, Kohl&#x27;s, or any other online stores are any better. Despite their advertising, everyone knows you shouldn&#x27;t be expecting UPS&#x2F;USPS packages to be reliably arriving on time since March.')
