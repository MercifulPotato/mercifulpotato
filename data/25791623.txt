Coming from an SPA, it feels just like your average react&#x2F;redux app, except you put your redux state on the server. Your server now maintains the state of all active clients, and you get network lag on all stateful UI interactions.<p>Now that Google will index SPAs, I&#x27;d strongly consider a SPA where the server just generates meta tags (for SoMe link previews etc)')
