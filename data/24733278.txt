Item(by='rmason', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602270356, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24733214, text='Ponyride was both the first coworking space and maker space in Detroit.  In Corktown, just west of downtown of Detroit it was relatively safe area.  It was a potpourri of software firms, hardware firms and clothing companies.  I&#x27;ve got friends who started their companies at Ponyride.<p>They lost their building and the move to Core City didn&#x27;t make any sense.  Ever see the movie Fort Apache the Bronx?  That describes Core City.  Most of the successful startup accelerators and maker spaces are in the downtown area like Bamboo, not in marginal neighborhoods.<p>Sounds like a crazy idea sharing space with the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts.  It might in the end not work but in Detroit people aren&#x27;t afraid to experiment, to try off the wall kind of stuff.')
