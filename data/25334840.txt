I should be able to cheaply add networked sensors<p>I think you&#x27;re going the wrong way. These problems were caused by trying to artificially exert control over a complex environment. Similar to trying to &quot;manage&quot; a natural environment, each effort results in 2 more side-effects which each then need their own &quot;management&quot;. On the other hand, some modern &quot;management&quot; techniques are to simply re-introduce nature to an environment and letting it self-manage. This ends up with better ecological health as well as less cost and complexity. But we have to let go of whatever weird human-specific desire caused us to mismanage it the first time.<p>Why do we need carbon monoxide monitors? Because carbon monoxide builds up, because gas-powered devices and heat exchangers live inside the sealed home. Put them outside the home and the problem is solved, no technological solutions necessary.<p>A properly designed home can also avoid things like vapor barriers, reduce dependence on air conditioning and heating, avoid mold and mildew, and require less maintenance. But if we insist on working within existing home designs, there&#x27;s a constant requirement for new fixes for the new problems we introduce.')
