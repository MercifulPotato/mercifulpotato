In contrast, when I moved my Windows 10 box to a 4K monitor, everything was unbelievably tiny until I set the system scaling to 300%.  Which then broke some apps (far too large text, etc.) that I had to go through the &quot;run in this scaling compatibility mode&quot; debacle.  Except some other apps still had small text and icons (looking at you, Chitubox!) which required the &quot;run in this other scaling compatibility mode&quot; finagling.  Imagine having a &quot;mature&quot; OS where people are still dealing with this after <i>years</i>.<p>(and this is just one of the pain points I get from Windows 10 every day that I don&#x27;t get from macOS.)')
