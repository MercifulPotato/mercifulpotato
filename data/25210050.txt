Nowadays it seems you folks worry too much about semantics &amp; ideology (on both sides) and will keep electing the next populist in hopes it&#x27;ll fix all problems, just like Latin America lol.<p>Your opponent nowadays is a very pragmatic autocratic regime, with it&#x27;s own issues, but this corona-crisis at least showed they can keep their mandate of heaven.
