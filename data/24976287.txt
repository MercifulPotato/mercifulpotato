I am not aware of any instances of an &quot;illegal prime&quot; that was prime because it was the private part of an RSA-based DRM cryptosystem. As far as I know, all of them were either encoded as primes deliberately, or just coincidentally prime.<p>Edit: except for this one, I guess. This one wasn&#x27;t about DRM, but rather just a locked down device. TI sent bogus DMCA notices for that one, but as far as I can tell there is no solid legal theory under which those primes were illegal, and nobody ever got sued, so we can file this one under &quot;manufacturer upset they no longer control their users&#x27; devices throws a legally meaningless fit&quot;.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Texas_Instruments_signing_key_controversy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Texas_Instruments_signing_ke...</a>')
