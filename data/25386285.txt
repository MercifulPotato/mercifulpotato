They also test against a single target: ms-windows.  If it works there, they are done.  Linux compatibility is not even an afterthought.<p>And as each makers various models all seem to also have slightly different ways to perform sleep&#x2F;hibernate and subsequent wakeup, the result is that Linux kernel dev&#x27;s are playing a continuous game of catch-up.  One thing I&#x27;ve found is that upgrading the kernel to a later release sometimes fixes the issues (assuming patches were supplied by someone in the interim to fix them).<p>[1] Very few makers have any laptops that ship, from the maker, with Linux preinstalled, the few that do (one or two Dell models, the aftermarket &quot;Linux Laptop&quot; vendors, maybe a sliver of others) will more than likely work properly for sleep&#x2F;wake.  The reason why these work better is because the maker should, in theory, test for Linux compatibility and help fix any bugs (or simply build with compatible chipsets from the outset) since they are selling these with &quot;Linux pre-loaded&quot;.')
