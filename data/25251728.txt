So decrease your input or increase your exercise - or both. There&#x27;s no shortcuts. Speak to a specialist, they tend to know what they are doing.<p>A few additional points to consider:<p>* First weight you lose will be water (it&#x27;s why most of these diet programs make big claims in just a few weeks)<p>* As you burn fat, you&#x27;ll need to drink more water and you&#x27;ll flush out your electrolytes - take supplements<p>* If you don&#x27;t workout and eat a certain-ish amount of protein (not too much or less) you&#x27;ll lose muscle mass instead of fat<p>* Fasting helps you burn fat rather than food intake<p>* It&#x27;s better to consume fats than carbs - if you can get your body into ketosis then you&#x27;ll burn almost exclusively fats<p>* Don&#x27;t underestimate the importance of exercise, even walking (for a heavy person, you&#x27;re burning a lot more to move the additional mass around)')
