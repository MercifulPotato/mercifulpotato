But again, I think consumers will subconsciously estimate the likelihood of this to be extremely low.<p>&gt; Not caring about this now is like not caring about government or corporate privacy invasions because &quot;I have nothing to hide&quot;.<p>What? I thought we were talking about the immediate user-visible bug here, where some third-party apps could not be opened on some Macs for some period of time today. Sure, there are separate potential privacy concerns any time an OS phones home for any reason. But the problem here is just a blatant bug that manifests when the OS phones home and the servers are having problems. Macs continue to work fine when they&#x27;re not connected to the internet, so it&#x27;s pretty clear this is just a bug that&#x27;s not actually related to the privacy concerns with phoning home.')
