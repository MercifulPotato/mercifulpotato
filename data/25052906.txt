Those won&#x27;t be anything we&#x27;re recommending for production. Our goal is to have an early alpha in our own cloud environment by the end of Q1. I stress alpha. But we&#x27;ll also have a bunch of tooling around it (which we&#x27;ve already built for the other parts of our cloud product) to backup data out of band, monitor it, shadow test it against production workloads, etc.<p>We&#x27;re also building on top of the work of a bunch of others that have built Arrow and libraries within the Rust ecosystem.<p>When the open source GAs, I don&#x27;t really know. But we&#x27;re doing this out in the open so people can see, comment, and maybe even contribute. Who knows, maybe after a few years you&#x27;ll be a convert ;)')
