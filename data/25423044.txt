It&#x27;s found its way in many languages, so I think most people are used to its idiosyncrasy but it&#x27;s not great if you try to take a fresh look at it.<p>I think the best defense of this syntax is that it makes writing basic iteration a bit nicer without having to add boilerplate (the iconic `for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)`) but then I would argue that the real problem is that C is severely lacking in the iteration department and this is a rather obvious hack (that languages like Javascript felt the need to copy wholesale, for some insane reason).')
