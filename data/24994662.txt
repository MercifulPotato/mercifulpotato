Item(by='wahern', descendants=None, kids=[24994691], score=None, time=1604537572, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24994541, text='Unless you&#x27;re a broadcast studio, aren&#x27;t most videos client-encoded one way or another? Does YouTube even let users upload  raw, uncompressed video? Speaking of which, IME (mostly with audio), exploits more often seem to relate to encapsulation--container format, framing, etc--than to the low-level compressed blocks themselves; and those parts certainly are controlled by the client, at least at ingest. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s simply because more people (albeit still small in absolute terms) are capable of understanding and breaking encapsulation implementations as opposed to the math-heavy block (de)compression routines, or because the (de)compression algorithms natural bound the scale of the output--e.g. a compressed 44.1khz AAC frame is not going to expand to more than 44.1k samples, and each sample won&#x27;t be larger than the parameterized bit size. Either way, anyone distributing multimedia <i>should</i> account for this stuff. Alas, most don&#x27;t seem to bother; they just pass off files to an ffmpeg binary or wrapper and hope for the best.')
