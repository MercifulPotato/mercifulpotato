A poor by definition doesn&#x27;t own much. They probably have no house, no easy way to eat, no way to transport if the system collapse and the merchants aren&#x27;t interested in the little fiat they have. All in all I&#x27;m having a hard time to defend the idea that it would be harder for the wealthier to go through a collapse of the currency.<p>As for bitcoin, well, you can audit the commits on github if you want. There&#x27;s plenty of things added lately. Miners or other entities like nodes can decide to fork the protocol into another chain (already happened, the protocol is then developed differently in those chains). Rules are subject to a consensus. Also if a user is not happy with a change, he&#x27;s free to stop using it or to exchange his bitcoins for something else. All in all there&#x27;s no reasons for participants to refuse modifying and improving the protocol over time.')
