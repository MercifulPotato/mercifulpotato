Bootstrapping also, in my opinion and experience, requires a lot more appreciation of accounting and finance on the part of founders, and a lot more questioning (&quot;do I really need to hire another person for this or can I find a way to keep costs down?&quot;).  I can definitely see a different curriculum and skillset building that is separate from the VC track.')
