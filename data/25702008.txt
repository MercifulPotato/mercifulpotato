Right now, I’m building DNA toolkits for engineering every different organism (it’s expensive, but I’m doing it in collaboration with other companies). All open source, too.<p>Imagine if you could get a toolkit to engineer literally any life form for less than $100. It’d be super cool!<p>The “money maker” here is that my DNA foundry can build DNA together from my toolkits quicker and cheaper than anyone else, which is attractive for new companies who want to engineer stuff using my toolkits.<p>It’s a work in progress, but I’m actively working on it, and I’m ramen profitable from my B2B part. Good times ahead!')
