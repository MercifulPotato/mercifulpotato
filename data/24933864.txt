Capitalism can work just fine. The reason we&#x27;re in this situation in part is because the skills and resources you garner for delivering journalism happen to overlap with those needed to deliver political tabloids. We don&#x27;t worry about air conditioner manufacturers magically becoming insurance companies, because its hard to do so. So ultimately if you align incentives enough I think you can make it increasingly unlikely a specific &#x27;truth seeking&#x27; organization will slide into tabloids. But I don&#x27;t know the formula. It might boil down to re-baking the culture which awards good journalism and bootstraps itself off of valid credentialism.')
