Their support was _terrible_ both times; at no point were we ever in touch with anyone who seemed like they understood the product, cared about our issues, or were in any hurry to fix them.  We were locked in year long, 6-figure support contracts in both cases, and issues dragged on for months until we basically gave up.  We got better answers out of random Google searches and a 20 minute conversation with a friend of a friend.<p>AWS&#x27;s hosted ElasticSearch only recently is able to handle the data set sizes we were dealing with, and their enterprise support on this (and other products) is vastly better than anything we ever got out of Elastic.')
