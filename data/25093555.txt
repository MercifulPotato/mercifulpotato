Managers were constantly jockeying for position at the expense of manufacturing processes.<p>Just one anecdotal story, one of the wafer guys had an idea to improve a process. He went to his boss who shot it down instantly. Wafer guy knew he was right so went to another manager who liked the idea and implemented it. It ended up working and being a great idea. Instead of being rewarded for his idea, wafer guy was fired by his manager for failing to follow the chain of command.<p>It&#x27;s built into the culture at Intel to be territorial to advance. It&#x27;s been that way for at least 30 years. I personally don&#x27;t see it changing any time soon.')
