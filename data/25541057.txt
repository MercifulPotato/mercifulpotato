Just choose &quot;the best&quot; for the user.<p>So Linux software usually doesn&#x27;t hide stuff to users (liberty?) and this quickly translate to a worse beginner&#x2F;intermediate experience, having too many choices in audio software is usually something to combat.<p>And Ardour is the perfect example of this: upon opening it asks several questions to the user in a pop-up, while virtually all other DAWs will reopen the last session. There is a significant divide in terms of UX, and I see a bit of this everywhere I go when booting under Linux.')
