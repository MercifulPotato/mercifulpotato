Item(by='mschaef', descendants=None, kids=[25839108, 25838757], score=None, time=1611088268, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25838065, text='Around this time there was another significant CPU architecture in play at Intel, the iAPX 432.  The 432 was the intentional follow on to the 8-bit series (8080) and suffered from a number of the usual second system effects - it was big, complicated, and slow. The 8086&#x2F;8 was a stop gap measure while the 432 was being sorted out, and my understanding is also that the 8087 math chip was essentially a 432 component that had been redesigned to work with the other chip series.<p>Viewed in the context of the 432, it&#x27;s not hard to imagine Intel viewing an 8086 follow on chip as a niche market CPU while their would-be-anointed successor takes the more mainstream PC market.<p>What&#x27;s maybe more interesting to consider is the role of the 80386, and how its design process might have gone. By the time of the 80386, Intel built in features to the chip explicitly useful for the purpose of bringing multitasking to the PC space. One of the 386&#x27;s many noteworthy features, was &#x27;V86&#x27; mode, which was designed to allow it to easily multitask multiple real mode 8086&#x2F;8 apps at the same time. This was essentially a &#x27;run several DOS programs at once&#x27; feature, and there were a couple major PC &quot;OS&quot;&#x27;s that used it - most notably Windows&#x2F;386 and DesqView&#x2F;386.<p>(You should also note that this is not close to the first time that Intel tried to get away from x86 - the iAPX 432, i860, and Itanium all represent varying attempts to achieve that goal.)')
