It&#x27;s difficult to attribute all the untimely deaths to FSB activities, but given they want exactly this, we probably should do the opposite.<p>Schekochikhin, Kara-Murza poisoning. \nZhvaniya in Georgia.\nYuschenko, Babchenko, Sheremet in Ukraine.\nBerezovsky, Perepelichny, Patarkatsishvili, Skripals, Litvinenko in UK. \nTsepov, Manevitch in Putin&#x27;s native Saint Petersbourg.\nNemtsov, Politkovskaya, Navalny in Russia.<p>Also some bad guys, like Khattab, who was killed via poisoned letter.<p>By no means it&#x27;s an exhaustive list.<p>Not Nosik, though. He was a well-known addict and kind of had it coming, so there&#x27;s no commonly shared suspicion around this.')
