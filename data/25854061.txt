It has evolved tremendously over time. It&#x27;s now almost completely passive, and by adjusting a few levers could be profitable. But it does not - and likely will not - have scale. It also has vulnerabilities that I &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; (read: won&#x27;t) address while also working FT.<p>So it&#x27;s hard to say objectively whether it&#x27;s successful. But as a learning experience it has been worth its weight in gold. The diverse hard and soft skills you accumulate in the course of keeping your side hustle afloat while spending minimal money are endlessly valuable. Most of them come from learning the hard way. But that&#x27;s what makes them stick. I&#x27;ve applied some of these skills and lessons learned to newer projects with positive results.<p>A few takeaways:<p>1.) If you can sift through the mountains of B.S., there is extremely high-quality, free content available to learn about building and scaling startups (e.g. YC Startup School, books, etc.). So not knowing what to do, per se, is not the issue. The real issue is knowing what hard-but-necessary things you should probably do, but not doing them.<p>2.) So, about those hard-but-necessary things. Working a &quot;day job&quot; and coming home to your side business can be exhausting. This exhaustion can further discourage you from doing the necessary things to grow your startup. To overcome motivation draughts and other mental hurdles, it&#x27;s helpful to have some combination of the following: A.) a co-founder to share the load, B.) added accountability, e.g. employees, investors, C.) a valuable network with the resources or knowledge to pull you past certain plateaus, and&#x2F;or D.) extreme passion and enthusiasm for the category &#x2F; business.<p>3.) The ultimate challenge is finding balance. Yes, you will need to make sacrifices. But the experience forces you to be acutely aware of how you allocate your energy and attention. For example: Does spending a few hours per week exercising actually provide a net-positive affect on overall productivity? Does 20 minutes of clear-headed morning work before commuting accomplish as much as 1 hour of exhausted, post-commute work? While we&#x27;re at it, is there &quot;dead time&quot; you could be using to work on your side business (e.g. commuting, watching Netflix, sitting on your phone waiting for food, etc.)? Are you already over-committed and stretched at work? Could you talk to your boss about your workload, find someone to delegate to, or negotiate a more flexible work arrangement? Are you spending an hour most nights with your significant other but your mind is elsewhere, or are you spending forty-five min where you&#x27;re totally present? The list goes on. This exercise in itself is valuable even if your startup ultimately fails.<p>4.) Finally, in my experience, you can build a profitable product and achieve PMF while working a day job. These things require mostly a good tactics and knowledge (see #1). The true hurdle becomes scale. Scale requires resources - you could throw money at it, but that&#x27;s rarely sustainable. It&#x27;s better to use your time, ingenuity, sweat equity, and enthusiasm and hope the flywheel starts turning. But these are in short supply when you&#x27;re already contending with a day job and other priorities. You can optimize your days (see #3). You can put controls in place to contend with inevitable hurdles (see #2).<p>5.) Ultimately, you need to define what success looks like for your side-business. Whatever your goal, day job or not, value comes from finding and solving the most interesting and commercially viable problem you can. Without this, the challenges of running a side business while working FT grow exponentially.')
