Cows aren&#x27;t native to North American mountain ranges and are tremendously destructive. Also, native predators get hunted to protect the non-native cattle which causes an even bigger environmental mess.<p>&gt; On the flip side, that same 2 acres if farmed can easily feed about ~2 cows.<p>Yes? But it&#x27;s a terrible practice. The cows end up piled atop each other in big barns waste deep in their own shit. Then they end up draining the barns into massive shit ponds which have to be filtered with large RO systems. The densely packed cattle are in such poor health they are over-medicated to prevent disease and that medication ends up in the food chain.<p>Pasture raised beef is just much better. I&#x27;d just as soon we limited how much total beef was raised and did it in pastures rather than corn-fed barn raised beef. Its more humane and while it&#x27;s not been proven, the large amounts of antibiotics in barn raised beef is almost certain to have effects on humans who eat that beef.')
