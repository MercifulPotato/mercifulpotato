That meant all of these areas in blue: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;French_colonial_empire#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Scramble-for-Africa-1880-1913.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;French_colonial_empire#&#x2F;media&#x2F;...</a> are french, with the entire population being french citizens.<p>So this means that someone who is algerian could have french parents, but not be eligible for french citizenship. However if I as an EU citizen wanted to live in france, there is nothing stopping me.<p>In the same way that up to the 70s an english &quot;colonial&quot; had the right to a british passport.
