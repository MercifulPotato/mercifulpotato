The vast majority of people who have died have been over 60. There have been young people who died, yes. But young people die all the time of things that often kill very few: fungal infections, respiratory disease, bicycle wrecks. Now the narrative is &quot;Long Covid&quot; which comes from very limited case studies and papers that depend on web surveys and lots of other questionable research that falls flat once you start diving into the papers.<p>Meanwhile, all the things people are doing are about as effective as TSA Security Theater. The lockdowns simply do not work. We can see that in the numbers between California, South Dakota, Sweden and others. Every nation or municipality that takes a hard approach is no better off, and often much worse, than places that did substantially less. The masks are a placebo at this point and the numbers show they probably do next to nothing (except contribute to massive pollution, waste, shame and make us fearful of each other).<p>In 50 years, the only way I think historians will look back upon this ear is pure mass hysteria; global mass hysteria on a scale never seen before. This is not a time of honor and should never be returned to.')
