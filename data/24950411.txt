We do not put invisible societal cages around people, we encourage them to be what they are and let them realize their full potential while elsewhere, people are doing busywork to do as society expects them to do. (This is exaggerated - of course there are also a lot of things that societally unacceptable here but it does not seem as limiting as elsewhere.)')
