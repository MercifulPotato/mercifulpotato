If remote workers in cheaper countries can really get the job done as well as local employers, why would a company decide to lose money on local workers?<p>Of course, the corollary to this is that maybe remote worker&#x27;s aren&#x27;t always as good a choice as local workers, which would explain an otherwise puzzling market inefficiency.')
