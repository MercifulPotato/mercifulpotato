He called Joe Biden’s claim that he never played a role in Hunter Biden’s foreign business endeavors &quot;a blatant lie.&quot;<p>But the Journal reported that the text messages and emails Bobulinski shared from 2017 &quot;don’t show either Hunter Biden or James Biden discussing a role for Joe Biden in the venture.&quot;<p>The venture in China &quot;never received proposed funds from the Chinese company or completed any deals, according to people familiar with the matter,&quot; the outlet reported. &quot;Corporate records reviewed by The Wall Street Journal show no role for Joe Biden.&quot;<p>The Journal also quoted Gilliar, the British national involved in SinoHawk, as saying he was &quot;unaware of any involvement at any time of the former vice president.&quot; Gilliar added that &quot;the activity in question never delivered any project revenue.&quot;</i>')
