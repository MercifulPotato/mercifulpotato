The 1&#x2F;r^2 term for light intensity is cancelled by the r^2 for the number of stars.<p>It&#x27;s interesting think what an experimental result you describe would imply. It either contradicts the nature of light or that we&#x27;re in the center of a cloud of stars where the density of stars falls with distance from us.')
