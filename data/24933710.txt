Why not make counter-arguments to the actual piece, when it comes out?<p>I&#x27;d argue that all of the rampant censorship about any conceivable questioning or criticism of Biden is the thing that history is likely going to look back on in a few months, and perhaps years, as unethical and irresponsible journalistic conduct.<p>I disagree with some of Greenwald&#x27;s stances, but he and Matt Taibbi seem to be the only actual journalists left in the country, that I&#x27;m aware of. It&#x27;s mind-boggling.<p>I strongly dislike Trump as president and as a person, I think he&#x27;s probably the worst president we&#x27;ve had from a domestic perspective, and I couldn&#x27;t disagree more with him and his party&#x27;s agenda, but as of the past few days I almost want to see him win due to all of this recent censorship tipping the scales. Almost like an Oedipus-style prophecy ironically fulfilled by the attempt to prevent it. I don&#x27;t actually want him to win, but I want these people to have this blow up in their face.<p>The cover-up is probably a lot worse than the allegations (which don&#x27;t seem that damaging, going by the leaked emails, but I&#x27;m curious to see Greenwald&#x27;s analysis), and I bet this is turning many more people further from media outlets and closer to Trump or at least further from the left. Even if he loses the election, I think the past few weeks have shown he might have already won. Not due to anything he did, but solely due to an entirely avoidable  shooting of oneself in the foot. This could have ripple effects that last longer than the next 4 years.')
