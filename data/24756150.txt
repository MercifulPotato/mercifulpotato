We are talking about deeply intolerant, bad faith actors, and you substitute this with &quot;censoring opinions outside the mainstream&quot;.<p>NO U.<p>That aught to be enough for the argument to be closed, but since we like to pretend we&#x27;re better than that: how can you tell that someone holds bad faith views? I do not have a machine to peer into the soul of man, neither do you. People can believe horrible things and think themselves good people, just wait 30 years and you will be one of them. That your views happen to be ascendant doesn&#x27;t mean we should ban everyone who isn&#x27;t.')
