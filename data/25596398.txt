Even a low-paying job is better than no job.<p>That said, don&#x27;t get caught in the trap of waiting around for the perfect counter-offer. If you want to negotiate a higher salary, it&#x27;s not helpful to delay months and months to find the perfect other job. If you&#x27;re not getting counter-offers soon, you can skip straight to negotiating. Don&#x27;t let yourself get stuck in limbo forever.')
