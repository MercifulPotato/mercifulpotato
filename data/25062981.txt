Item(by='vorpalhex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605128815, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25062003, text='&gt; I would also prefer zero trust as a first choice, but for now would be happy to settle for trusting companies that just seem decent.<p>It&#x27;s an incentives problem. If the company can always make a bit more money by harvesting data, then why would it not? Especially if it could avoid getting detected or at least avoid getting in trouble.<p>That&#x27;s the benefit of E2E - I don&#x27;t have to trust the middleman. I still have to trust the other end (and that has a whole can of issues to be sorted) and I have to trust myself (and again, that has plenty of problems) but it at least removes an entire vector.')
