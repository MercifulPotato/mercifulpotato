In fact, reliable data indicates that as many as 57 percent of all fatal car crashes occur on rural roads. Another surprising statistic is that 62 percent of fatal accidents do not occur on curves, but on straightaways, especially at night.&quot;<p>So, while very good autonomous driving on interstates is definitely a convenience win and doubtless could save lives, accidents on those roads are not the leading cause of auto fatalities. (Which sort of makes sense. You&#x27;re often going almost as fast on those two lane roads and there are far more opportunities to have a head-on collision or to veer off the road and road maintenance&#x2F;plowing&#x2F;etc. is often quite a bit worse.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sutliffstout.com&#x2F;faqs&#x2F;where-car-accidents-happen&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sutliffstout.com&#x2F;faqs&#x2F;where-car-accidents-happen...</a>')
