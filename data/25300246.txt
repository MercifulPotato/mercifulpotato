But with gamma particles, you might need yards of lead...<p>Well, same thing, but with air and heat... The air blocks the particles being radiated by the heat, and the reason they aren&#x27;t being detected as &quot;radiation&quot; is because they&#x27;re at a different wavelength (infrared?).<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s the case for looking at heat and fission as the same pattern, the same thing, but each is just relative to a scale...<p>Disclaimer: All of the above -- is a <i>crackpot theory</i> only(!), and should only be treated as such. &lt;g&gt;<p>(In legal terms, it would be considered rampant &quot;conjecture, speculation and hearsay&quot;. &lt;g&gt;)')
