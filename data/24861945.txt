I could not bear the slow speed though, so I suggest everyone who hasn&#x27;t tried yet to use it with Mitogen. I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back and in fact I expect upstream to eventually adopt it.<p>Major issues with Salt: lots and lots of bugs and quirks. I have had my fair share of those in Ansible over the years as well, but Salt is just not good enough for my taste. A strong NIH is perceived all over its design.')
