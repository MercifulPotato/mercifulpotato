Then randomly choose half the country and have them give their dollar to a specific person in the other half. Repeat this process with the remaining people until there&#x27;s only 340 people that each have a million dollars, then talk to those 340 people: You&#x27;ll have 340 stories of how they personally overcame the odds and beat out everyone else to become a millionaire')
