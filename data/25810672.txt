And if my favorite chair is used by my cat, I can sit on the other side and plug the cable on the left. On the other side of the cable is a third-party charger that I&#x27;m using to charge my iPhone (with damn Lightning-USBC cable, when will Apple drop Lightning?), iPad and Nintendo Switch. And when I sit on my desktop, I connect my laptop to the monitor with just one (USB-C) cable.<p>Previously, I had to have two separate proprietary chargers and hope that the cable don&#x27;t break; now I can just buy another USB-C cable anywhere.')
