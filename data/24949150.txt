Naturally, months of chronic pain will contribute to feeling poorly rested and &#x2F; or an altered mood, fibromyalgia or no.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to disparage your assertions, and fully agree with your ultimate point of not letting it get to you. That said, I look forward to the FM&#x2F;a test being more widely recognized.<p>The thing that surprised me the most about this conversation (and the quick research it forced me to do) is that there is a curiously high level of co-incidence between psoriatic arthritis and fibromyalgia. One of the more annoying effects I suffer (most frequently when I was younger, less so now) was a heavy &quot;fibro fog&quot; cognitive decline typically triggered by high levels of stress.<p>Maybe I have both? Who knows.
