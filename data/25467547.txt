I would want to know 100%.<p>EDIT: in the absence of antibodies the biopsy would still show:<p>-Crypt hyperplasia with a decreased villi&#x2F;crypt ration. Crypts are grooves between the villi, which are the small fingerlike projections that line the small intestine and promote nutrient absorption. Crypt hyperplasia is when the grooves are elongated compared to a normal intestinal lining which has short crypts.<p>-Blunted or atrophic villi. This is a shrinking and flattening of the villi due to repeated gluten exposure.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;celiac.org&#x2F;about-celiac-disease&#x2F;screening-and-diagnosis&#x2F;diagnosis&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;celiac.org&#x2F;about-celiac-disease&#x2F;screening-and-diagno...</a>')
