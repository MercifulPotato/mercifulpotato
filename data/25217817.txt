It basically means that for the &#x27;cost&#x27; of sharing a part of my home internet with a passing stranger, I can get a WiFi connection in most any built up area from someone else sharing. As the person using my WiFi also has to be a customer of the ISP for WiFi and sharing it, too, the only sharing use case is when you are looking for something faster than 4G on your cell phone and you connect securely to a fellow ISP customer&#x27;s WiFi.')
