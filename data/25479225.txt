Instead, your question really was used as a <i>search query</i> — but instead of searching a pool of documents, it would search a pool of <i>experts</i>, matching you with an expert who knows about similar things†, then facilitating contact with them (and forwarding them your initial query&#x2F;question to start off the conversation, like a Helpdesk system.)<p>† Not sure how they did this part — for academic experts, they could “just” fulltext-index their corpus of published journal papers, to build up a “knowledge fingerprint” of the expert. Not sure what they would do for people in industry without a stream of publications, though.<p>Sadly, Google bought them, shut down the Aardvark product, and probably just put the engineers on regular SRE code-slinging tasks. It almost seems like Google felt threatened. And — hint hint — nothing’s stopping anyone from building something like this again :)')
