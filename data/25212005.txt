Entrepreneurship is not a spectator sport. You have to participate and not cheer from side lines. You have to get onto the base plate and start swinging. The more you bat, the more you maximize your chance of hitting the ball and making that home run. You can keep reading books all day long(and there is no shortage of shovels these gold rush days) but unless you make something and put it out there you wonâ€™t learn. Launch and learn.
