In the end RISC won, it just took a while to get there.<p>What exactly do you think is the fundamental limitation of x86?  Most chips do lot and lots of crazy logic to go from instruction set to microcode, it&#x27;s hard to imagine that the variable nature of x86 instructions are the limiting factor.')
