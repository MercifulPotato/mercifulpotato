Is Facebook unfairly preventing the success of other social networks? A good example of a monopoly was 90&#x27;s era Microsoft, which prevented its OEMs from shipping competing operating systems.<p>Terminology aside, I completely agree with you that we need far, far more choice in the marketplace.')
