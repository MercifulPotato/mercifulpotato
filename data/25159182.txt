We all know that we&#x27;re going to die at some point, but we live with attitude - &quot;but, not today&quot;. So when we find out when we&#x27;re going to be dead, we change our perspective.<p>What I would&#x2F;will do? First of all - say goodbye to all people I know. If we were in bad terms for whatever reasons - I would try to say my farewell knowing I apologised for what I did and forgive for what was done to me. I&#x27;d like to have clean head from human affairs on my last breath.<p>Then - I&#x27;ll go to reconcile with God. Maybe first time in my life truly and honestly. I&#x27;m a believer in Jesus Christ so this will be best and last time for it.<p>After that - I would spent all the left time on being with my dearest one. Talk to them, hug them, take tons of photos.  And also - this is what I plan for some time - write a long letter to each of my dearest, telling them how much I love them, how much I received from them, how much they mean to me, how wonderful people they are in my eyes.<p>And when the time comes, when it&#x27;ll be the last breath - I really hope God will came for my soul and we all meet once again.')
