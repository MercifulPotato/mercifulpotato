And Parler is using that system by filing a suit against AWS.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean that I can help someone load a body into his car, then tell police later &quot;Well, I wasn&#x27;t sure if he was legally killed or not, so I was just trying to help out, it&#x27;s not my job to determine legality, I was going to come in later today and ask you guys about that. You can probably still catch him if you want to, I got his contact info: he said his name was John and his car said he lives in the Ukraine&quot;')
