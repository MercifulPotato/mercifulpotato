They have full access to the resources they need. The interface with the SRE team is minimal in these cases.<p>and<p>&gt; Custom features lose the SRE team support.<p>is something that sounds great in a small team, but I do not think it would scale. It lends itself to the platform just being a loosely coupled collective of independent fiefdoms of Not Invented Heres, which then means each product team needs its own SRE specialists that can then constantly engage in infighting, which IMHO would lead to the reliability as the system as a whole go down rather than up.<p>Personally, I think there is much value in a &quot;platform&quot; where infrastructure (compute, storage, queues, monitoring, alerting, auditing, etc) are provided in a centralised fashion, owned and operated by platform teams which provides self-service touchpoints for the service teams but not provide full independence to run their own thing')
