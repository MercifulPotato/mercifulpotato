I do these setups all the time, so it&#x27;s like doing the dishes for me.<p>K8s may not be the best option for every project, but my original point was that choosing it ought not blow out the budget or delivery window of a project. Maybe, you might shave a week or two off a greenfield project by going with something like Elastic Beanstalk, but in the scheme of things that&#x27;s a rounding error.<p>To put things in perspective, a typical deployment for a small app requires 3-4 short configuration files specific to K8s plus your Docker container.<p>Furthermore, you&#x27;d generally still use the cloud managed services like Elastic Cache and RDS when developing K8s applications. I was merely using a Postgres as an example in my mini-not-quite-a-tutorial before.<p>So yeah, if Elastic Beanstalk is working for you and you think the tradeoff between flexibility and simplicity is right for your project, then keep doing what you&#x27;re doing.')
