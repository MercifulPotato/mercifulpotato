The APFS drive wouldn&#x27;t mount. Carbon Copy Cloner couldn&#x27;t clone the drive either. I started to dd, but realised it wouldn&#x27;t update the BootROM. I made a Catalina installer with createinstallmedia, to install 10.15.<p>Migration Assistant still failed to copy over the keychain, because I&#x27;d installed 10.15.3 or something on the destination, instead of 10.15.7 (the source Mac Mini). Most files worked, but without the keychain, many passwords and software licence keys weren&#x27;t available.<p>I needed the standalone updaters to make both computer run 10.15.7, so I could run Migration Assistant and get the files over (finally!)<p>It would be a big problem if Apple stop making these available.')
