Item(by='cletus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601942157, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24691173, text='There&#x27;s no better measure of how far out of line this guy is than the fact that the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which is about as pro-patent holder as any court can get, so much so that the Supreme Court has routinely been reversing its ruling... is overturning this guy&#x27;s rulings.<p>I actually don&#x27;t understand what this guy&#x27;s motivation is, however. The article doesn&#x27;t really address it. I kind of get the sense he is a True Believer [tm] in patent holder &quot;rights&quot; and is using his position to advance that view.<p>It&#x27;s kind of scary that a big part of why patent litigation is so out of hand comes down to just 2-3 people who happen to be Federal judges.<p>I really thought by now that this situation would&#x27;ve been so out of hand that the Supreme Court would&#x27;ve been forced to put a stop to it but no, the Supreme Court has done everything it can to avoid taking a stand on patent issues despite the glaring evidence that they need to.<p>It&#x27;s kind of disappointing that the Oracle Google case wasn&#x27;t decided in the last term when RBG sat on the bench. Who knows what will happen now? And yes I know that&#x27;s a copyright case (now) not a patent case but it fits into the whole IP nonsense.<p>Other commenters have mentioned random assignment of judges. That already happens. In this district this just happens to be the only guy. In the Eastern District at a certain time there were two judges. Patent holders preferred one. I remember reading that they would employ a law firm that employed the son of the judge they didn&#x27;t like so he&#x27;d have recuse himself and they could get the judge they want.<p>This forum shopping crap has to stop.')
