In local politics in the US, your level of representation is roughly equal in proportion to your property tax bill every year.  If you&#x27;re renting, or otherwise in a situation where you don&#x27;t directly pay (significant) property tax, your voice doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>The rest is pretty much true, but would be worth noting that the only options for the US are for every city to have extensive sprawling underground metros interlinked by high-speed rail, or to have most people own a car and have highways everywhere.  Any middle ground or half measure is untenable in our current society without causing direct, real, dire consequences to the very people you&#x27;re trying to champion.')
