Much easier to try to do something and iterate quickly learning what&#x27;s needed to do the job. That&#x27;s how people learnt programming on 8-bit computers - type a sample program and change stuff to see what it does. Then find something you want to achieve and try to change the sample program to do that. Eventually you understand how basics work and can learn everything else.')
