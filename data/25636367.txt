Namely, Lightspeed-webrtc uses the extremely popular &amp; robust Go library Pion[1] for webrtc. It&#x27;s a little over 500 lines.<p>The Rust Lightspeed-ingest[2] server is also ~500 lines of code, and primarily handshakes the FTL protocol used to communicate with OBS.<p>There is a Pion port to rust[3] that is in progress. I am not sure the state of this work. Pion is used quite extensively by many many projects; I&#x27;m not sure if the rust webrtc-rs port has any notable users yet. As I began by saying, I expect the trustability &amp; extensiveness of Pion is what lead to lightspeed-webrtc being written in Go.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pion.ly&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pion.ly&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GRVYDEV&#x2F;Lightspeed-ingest" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GRVYDEV&#x2F;Lightspeed-ingest</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;webrtc-rs&#x2F;webrtc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;webrtc-rs&#x2F;webrtc</a>')
