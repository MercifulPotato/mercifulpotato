It does not make sense in a strategic way - what on earth is the goal here, if you want to reduce Chinese sales tell Walmart buying the stuff. It makes no tactical sense - there is not current trigger and the administration is outgoing in a few weeks. The only sense I can see is salting the ground for the incoming administration&#x27;s diplomacy and there I think they underestimate the ability of the Chinese to pursue long term goals.')
