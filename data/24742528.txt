Also sugar (or rather glucose) makes you hungry because of the blood-sugar spike and crash. So while one type of food makes you full, another with the exact same amount of calories can make you hungry and hence eat more. Also the body burn different things in different ways (glucose vs. fat). That is why some (like me) will feel awful if I take a long walk while in a period of eating what is considered normal today but can stop eating for a few days with no problems at all (and add a few long walks on-top of that no problem) if I eat low carb high fat.<p>You can say it is the same in basic physics or chemistry if you want but if calories from X does not give the same amount of energy for the body as Y, then X != Y.')
