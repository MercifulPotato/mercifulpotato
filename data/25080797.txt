There are many examples in history of where this road <i>can</i> lead, but not only are we not exhibiting caution, the overwhelming sense I get is <i>enthusiasm</i> at this development.  One probably shouldn&#x27;t judge the general public in this regard too harshly, but <i>thinking</i> is what the HN crowd is supposed to be good at.')
