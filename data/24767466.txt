Whenever I get an idea from the SQLite source code for example, I have never for even a single moment ever considered plagiarizing it.<p>If public domain were really treated as you say, then movies and TV shows about Sherlock Holmes wouldn&#x27;t begin (or end) with &quot;Based on the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.&quot; They&#x27;d just say, &quot;Sherlock Holmes was conceived, written and created by Foo Johnson.&quot; But of course nobody does that, because plagiarism is unethical.')
