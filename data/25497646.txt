I moved my whole family&#x27;s email setup from google. Fastmail is based in Australia, which is a five-eyes country so I ruled it out (sadly, as would have loved to use it). I wrote all of this up here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gtf.io&#x2F;musings&#x2F;moving-away-from-google-email&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gtf.io&#x2F;musings&#x2F;moving-away-from-google-email&#x2F;</a><p>Spoiler: ended up using Runbox (www.runbox.com). I disagree with them on this but I think the webmail UI is pretty crap. I don&#x27;t use it though, and instead use neomutt (on Linux) and Apple Mail (on iOS).
