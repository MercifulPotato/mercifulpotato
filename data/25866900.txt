Item(by='zamadatix', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611277131, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25866589, text='I don&#x27;t think suppression of thoughts based on regional majority opinion is a net good or a reliable method of dealing with extremism, violence, or people we just don&#x27;t like. Not only does what&#x27;s acceptable vary by region but each region is unlikely to agree with itself from 100 years ago. That&#x27;s not a knock on popular opinion it&#x27;s just a knock on using it to decide what&#x27;s acceptable to discuss as it&#x27;s clearly not consistent. Some say violence is the separator except there seems to be plenty of acceptance of &quot;good violence&quot; whenever it&#x27;s not the minority opinion doing it so again it doesn&#x27;t seem like a consistent way to decide what&#x27;s good to discuss.<p>I hold the opinion that the only successful way to navigate to stability is education, open discourse, and constant discourse. The more in society that ignore other thoughts because they are convinced they are unequivocally correct on what&#x27;s right or wrong (minority or majority) the more unstable society is going to be as they are driven to view everyone who thinks differently as the problem instead of searching for better answers.')
