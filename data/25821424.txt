You&#x27;re free to use and customize Matrix, but your argument that people using Signal is <i>no progress at all</i> based solely on being a centralized service is zealotry that is blinding you to the experiences of laypeople.<p>Starting with your root comment - most people use centralized services that have gone down at some point. In many cases they are still using those services, not because they&#x27;re foolish muggles who can&#x27;t program, but because it&#x27;s worth more to use than it is to switch to something else. Centralized or not, people don&#x27;t really care. This entire thread has been an effort to convince you that <i>most people</i> don&#x27;t have the same values you do, hence the <i>argumentum ad populum</i> that you so despise being actually a valid metric of success for a project. Popularity is a flawed argument if you&#x27;re in a formal debate, but it is useful to nearly every other venture.<p>So is Signal the best possible messenger it could be? No, probably not. I, too, would like to see a decentralized, federated protocol take off. But is it measurably better than plaintext SMS or Facebook Messenger? Yes, probably.')
