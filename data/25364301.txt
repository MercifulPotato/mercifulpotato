Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607545585, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25363974, text='&gt; The Texas Attorney General likely has short circuited this process by filing a claim that can only be resolved by a federal court.<p>Having read the claim, there is no chance that SCOTUS will do anything other than deny it per curiam.<p>&gt; And now 11 other states (at my last count) have joined on as plaintiffs<p>They have not joined as plaintiffs. They filed an amici brief. And it&#x27;s actually 17. And reading the amici brief, they don&#x27;t even attempt to justify why Texas has standing in the case, which is the biggest reason to dismiss the case.<p>&gt; and the U.S. Supreme Court has placed it on the docket.<p>You&#x27;re aware that means absolutely nothing? To be refused to be docketed is an exceptionally high bar that requires the court to think you a vexatious litigant. Several thousand cases are docketed a year, and yet there&#x27;s only around 200-ish that are even considered petitions worthy of commentary, and only 70-ish are actually heard.<p>The actual bar you&#x27;re looking for is if SCOTUS accepts the petition which, (for a leave to file motion in original jurisdiction) requires 5 justices to agree to hear the case, and will not be decided before the reply brief is filed tomorrow. I suspect it will be discussed at the regular Friday conference, and likely disposed of in the Monday orders list, although the justices may decide it&#x27;s important enough to release in a Friday orders list.<p>I&#x27;ve said elsewhere why the case is likely to be go absolutely nowhere: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25353139" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25353139</a>.')
