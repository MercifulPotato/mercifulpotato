It perfectly captures the look of every standing desk I’ve seen. It’s amazing how much the four legs changes the look and feel of the desk.<p>Since you seem to be in the know: Do you see any of the more B2B type companies (or designers) focusing more on the consumer market in the future or is the opportunity in selling to corporate offices going to keep things as they are? It seems like a lot of the design talent is focused on the corporate office space and needs. For example this C9 looks to have a rail system line etc built around the desk, which makes me wonder if different design choices would be made if the focus was more for a home office setting.')
