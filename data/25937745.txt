Item(by='smabie', descendants=None, kids=[25937865], score=None, time=1611804084, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25937340, text='the bulk prices developed countries in Europe are paying is still much greater than some countries that have a truly free market system. For example, I lived in Tanzania and all drugs were imported and all of them over the counter. Drugs that literally cost thousands of dollars a month in America without insurance would usually come to around $5-10.<p>I doubt the American people (or American industry) would ever allow such a truly free market system to transpire, but I know for a fact it can work.<p>Labor is cheaper in Tanzania obviously, but even if you adjusted for the more expensive labor, a free market system (vs the crony capitalist system we have now) would probably be 10-100x cheaper.<p>Also, even controlling for median wage, the drugs are vastly cheaper in Tanzania vs America. A median worker there might make around $5-10 in wage, so most drugs for a month supply would be only a day of work. Median hourly wage in America of $15 would correspond to drug prices between $60-120 dollars, much cheaper than most medications without insurance. In reality, it should be much cheaper, as the marginal cost can be reduced a lot through online pharmacies (remember that $5-10 cost in Tanzania not only factors in product cost and labor cost, but a staggeringly inefficient distribution network).<p>In short, I don&#x27;t believe there&#x27;s any theoretical reason why generic drugs couldn&#x27;t be dirt cheap and affordable by all in a free market system. After all, capitalism has done a stellar job at reducing the cost of consumer goods over time, and medication should be no different.<p>If everyone could buy lightly regulated pills from alibaba, it would definitely be a win from a utility standpoint. But of course such a thing would never fly, as maximizing total utility doesn&#x27;t get people elected. Everyone might win except one guy who died from bad pills and the whole gig would be up, even though the total utility function of every citizen in aggregate was being correctly maximized.<p>The strong needs of the few always trumps the weak needs of the many. If everyone paid one $1 dollar per day in order to prevent one death, I&#x27;m sure some politician would call it a massive win, even though that&#x27;s an aggregate loss of 100bn dollars annually and the money saved generated more utility than the utility lost by that one guy dying.<p>Unfortunately, human beings are unable to make correct statistical&#x2F;utilitarian decisions and support so many policies that are a net negative utility wise.')
