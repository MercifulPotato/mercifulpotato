Don&#x27;t even have to search through menus or the ribbon, it&#x27;s right there to the left of the formula bar.<p>I&#x27;m well aware that the vast majority of Excel spreadsheets don&#x27;t use named cells&#x2F;ranges, but you can&#x27;t really blame Excel for that. It couldn&#x27;t be too much easier. Lots of Python programmers don&#x27;t use comments or descriptive variable names either.')
