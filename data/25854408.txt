I really hope you can grow sustainable and profitable while facilitating Matrix. Kudos!<p>Tulir&#x27;s been doing fantastic work, but it does seem that to ~80%, all the significant bridge maintenance&#x2F;development for public IM networks is a one-man show... Makes me a bit concerned that such a key piece of the Matrix ecosystem (and IMO a crucial component for eventual success) is underfunded, neglected and relying on a single person. Keeping things working with potentially hostile changes in undocumented or unsupported APIs is not trivial.<p>Also, how does your roadmap for new protocols look (if you have any)?<p>I&#x27;d love to promote this, but without LINE it&#x27;s pretty much uninteresting&#x2F;useless here in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. I heard it&#x27;s also one of the top IM apps in other countries, like Thailand.')
