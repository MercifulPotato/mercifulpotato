Item(by='nendroid', descendants=None, kids=[24880528], score=None, time=1603558693, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24880292, text='&gt;Are you justifying China for eradicating a whole culture and its people due to some extremist attacks?<p>The US tried to justify over a decade of slaughter of terrorists and innocent bystanders abroad as a reaction to one terror attack on US soil.<p>Don&#x27;t try to play word games here. None of this is actually justified. All countries are guilty of crimes.<p>The question I am posing people to consider is this: If several 9&#x2F;11&#x27;s happened on american soil. Buildings toppled, hundreds slaughtered by terrorism in multiple events with no end in sight and we find that the origin of these attacks rather than being instigated by one man from abroad is instigated by parts of a cultural community within US soil.<p>What is the action that should be taken here to completely shut down this problem once and for all?<p>Not a rhetorical question. I want some serious answers, but at the same time I also know that there is likely no solid answer and every action taken has a compromise.<p>Also keep in mind this is not a justification of ANY chinese action. None of it is justified.')
