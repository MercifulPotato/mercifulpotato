A handful (or heck, even hundreds) of people coming into the country won&#x27;t make any difference when we have thousands of new cases a day regardless.<p>There&#x27;s a reason Epidemologists don&#x27;t put much stock in travel restrictions once a pandemic is well underway around the world - they don&#x27;t do much good.<p><i>But</i> - generally, having widespread (ideally very sensitive) COVID testing for <i>any</i> type of travel outside of the home is a good thing.  We should have it universally available.  Ideally &lt;$10, something that everyone could do weekly, or even daily if they travel a lot.<p>Just unclear what the focus on international travel is all about here.')
