I have heard that clove oil helps toothache pain. After an excrutiating day with tooth pain I noe have a worsening situation of tooth abscess. I have heard that clove oil is one of the top home remedies. I just so happen to have a bottle of AVEDA clove essential oil. When I typed in &quot; is Aveda&#x27;s clove essential oil good for toothache, google COMPLETELY DISREGARDED  the brand name Aveda, even when I used the word Aveda 3 times in the search question. Sooo moronically obvious. Dropping google completely and have convinced 18 friends to follow suit. How do ya like them apples google? And I&#x27;m just getting started.')
