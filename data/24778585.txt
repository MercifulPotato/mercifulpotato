When I type out &quot;To: foo@example.com&quot;, I&#x27;m directing my email provider to send my email to the example.com server. That&#x27;s fundamentally different than the Facebook model, where some information is public and anyone at all can request it, even if they&#x27;re not in my address book.<p>I agree that you could probably make Facebook with no public pages work, or something like Twitter where there&#x27;s minimal public information in the first place.')
