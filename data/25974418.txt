I vape marijuana every day. After college I became an alcoholic after having stayed totally sober until age 21. Binge drinking college parties left me and my friends binge drinking well after college. It was bad, though I never lost a job.<p>I’d tried marijuana several times and often felt overwhelmed with it. It would take me more than ten years to realize why those incidents happened - group pressure to take huge hits of marijuana left me feeling way too high. A deeply uncomfortable feeling.<p>But marijuana helped me quit alcohol. I do not consider it the healthiest option nor do I recommend to anyone that they consume marijuana. But I would push back that it is always a bad idea. For my health I only vape marijuana and I keep the doses very small. I know it may still lead to health problems and I hope some day I don’t feel the need to do it. But it seems to help. I’ve stopped for weeks at a time and it’s fine. But I seem to prefer having a bit of marijuana every day. And I really don’t think that’s bad for me personally. I’m a successful robotics engineer. I worked for two years at Google X robotics while consuming marijuana daily and they filed two patents for my work during that time. Since then I’ve gone off to co-found a farming robotics organization that is about to announce our open source farming robot that I designed and built pretty much all myself.<p>I think we should take a more open minded approach to drug use. Some people may find that certain drugs work for them. Certainly I am achieving my life goals while vaping marijuana daily. I don’t really think it’s best for me long term, but it seems to be what’s working for me now.')
