I doubt Elastic execs thought AWS would just fall over and discontinue something that&#x27;s probably billions in revenue at this point. If AWS actually starts contributing code beyond trivial bug fixes, code Elastic can legally fold into their own Elasticsearch (via the ASL2-licensed fork) if it&#x27;s good enough, then ... good for both?')
