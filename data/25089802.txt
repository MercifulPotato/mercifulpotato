The liberal narrative that we&#x27;ve reached the end of history because of their &quot;failure&quot; is absurd in the extreme, particularly given the outside pressures and violences they (usually) weathered.<p>Instead of, &quot;what&#x27;s wrong with communism!?&quot;, we should be asking, &quot;if communism doesn&#x27;t work, why was it necessary for capitalist countries to direct the entirety of their foreign policies into violence and sanctions against communists in their own communist countries and anyone who so much as requested aid from them, despite capitalist countries refusing to supply such aid?&quot;<p>The reality is that communist countries actually did work and worked <i>better</i> than the prior state those countries were in, but were targeted for systematic erasure by the rest of the planet. When communist countries fell, life did not get better for those who lived there. It got worse. Pensions were privatized or canceled. Public programs eliminated. Promises of multi-party democracy were amended to disclude communists or anyone like them, with violence. Quality of Life indicators plunged and with no option to return to the former system (a certainly authoritarian condition imposed by the newly-in-power, Western-supported governments), these countries languished for decades and were and continue to be subjected to new depravities and exploitation even as they claw back some semblance of dignity.<p>Look at polling in the former Eastern Bloc. In Russia. In China. It&#x27;s still very popular and it&#x27;s not because of the chauvinist (and often contextually racist) idea they&#x27;re all brainwashed goons. They <i>saw</i> the changes and often have a critically supportive view of a return. They say that most things were better, but acknowledge those that were worse, and when they say they&#x27;d support a return it&#x27;s not to an identical state, just a similar one. But their political systems prevent this. One must wonder why.')
