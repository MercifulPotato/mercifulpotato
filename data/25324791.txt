That’s not the selling point. The selling point is the development paradigm&#x2F;runtime. It’s dead simple.<p>I recently started a small web project using the SAFE stack:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;safe-stack.github.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;quickstart&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;safe-stack.github.io&#x2F;docs&#x2F;quickstart&#x2F;</a><p>I urge you to follow that QuickStart yourself (it only takes a minute or two).<p>Assuming you were actually able to build the project, now, look at your project structure. How many directories do you have (11)? How many files (15510)? Think about how much <i>knowledge</i> is required to understand what’s going on (if you’ve never touched F# you are probably lost).<p>What does this QuickStart app do? It is, I kid you not, a “Todo list”!<p>I could write an almost <i>exact</i> clone of this app using PHP in exactly 1 file. No configuration scripts. No build suite. No 3rd-party packages. No CLI commands. Just 1 PHP file. <i>Thats</i> why people choose PHP.')
