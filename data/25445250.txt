It&#x27;s always extremely convoluted and unless something has changed it&#x27;s more of a 1-time &quot;trial&quot; for a period of time rather than a &quot;tier&quot; like GCP. Also their &quot;free-tier&quot; lasts different periods of time for different products. Like EC2 is 1 year but this is 3 months.<p>A baseline &quot;free usage&quot; everyone always gets and then if you go over, you pay, would be so much easier to understand. I understand it&#x27;s not in Amazon&#x27;s financial interests to make such a change but it always leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth.')
