That specific book is actually about ways to improve electoral results (while abandoning some traditional notions of democracy). There are many other books which discuss voter ignorance, and you can take your pick, any of them will give you the same idea.<p>&gt;&quot;If the average voter is poorly informed, the obvious solution to me would be to work on that issue directly, not on chipping away at what little power they have.&quot;<p>If someone is capable of doing a great deal of damage, the first step is to limit that damage, before teaching them how to do things properly. Educate the marginal and non-voters before you let them wreak havoc on an already troubled system.<p>&gt;&quot;It&#x27;s kind of counter-intuitive, but getting people to turn up to elections is often the first step in getting them to build informed opinions, read up on issues, and take their civic duty seriously.&quot;<p>This is actually a variant of one of the first philosophical cases for democracy (though I can&#x27;t remember who originally made that argument); the only problem is that it isn&#x27;t true. Just read some of the books on voter ignorance, and you&#x27;ll see exactly how wrong it is.')
