The point of an external report is not having to take Coinbase&#x27;s word for it. What&#x27;s funny is paying for an external report, then <i>not showing it to anybody</i>, or <i>even disclosing who did it</i>, and relying on that external report as evidence.<p>Here&#x27;s a reasonable question: is the reason Coinbase won&#x27;t disclose the external reports they commissioned because they can&#x27;t, because their investigators won&#x27;t allow them to, because neither are willing to stake their reputations on the interpretation Coinbase drew from them? If not, how do you know that?')
