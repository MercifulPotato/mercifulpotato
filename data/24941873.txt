I am curious though. But after browsing the docs of actix-web and rocket, it seems a bit of a reach to say you could use these solutions in place of monolithic frameworks Django or Rails.<p>Maybe if they had said they could take the place of an Express&#x2F; Slim &#x2F; Flask app I wouldn’t have rolled my eyes as hard. Wouldn’t these battle tested ‘micro’ frameworks be a better comparison?<p>Anyway, since I really know next to nothing about Rust, what would be the benefits for me to pick say, Actix-web over Slim to start a new project?<p>I get the feeling the best reason would be I’m already an experienced Rust developer and want to leverage that domain knowledge. Or maybe a team that already writes a lot of Rust wants to keep consistency over their repos.')
