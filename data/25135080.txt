I&#x27;m saying that carbon dioxide should help trees grow.  That we have a natural buffer against too much.<p>Did you know that some farms, pump carbon dioxide into their greenhouses to improve their crop.  It seems self-evident that any extra would be mopped up by trees, bushes etc in the wild.<p>I hear what you are saying about snow and your experience.  But you should also ask the older generation what their experience was of the winters there.  There may have been times that there wasn&#x27;t always snow.
