Item(by='graynk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602324746, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24737438, text='Some channels on Telegram show up as not accessible to Apple users because they &quot;distribute pornography&quot; even in cases when that was not the main purpose of the channel. There were cases when some users reposted porn gifs to group chats, admins did not delete them, then the whole chat got banned after user reported the chat. Notice: it&#x27;s not even the _app&#x27;s_ main purpose, they police the content down to specific channels, so the apps may _not_ show NSFW content it seems. I wonder when they&#x27;ll start blocking specific websites in Safari.')
