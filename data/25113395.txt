I put this transition off for a long time because i&#x27;ve used Linux (Desktop) in the past and it was rough, so i knew i&#x27;d have some hills to clime... but.. my life on Apple was rough, too. Ultimately i didn&#x27;t switch because i could get a better UX on Linux, i switched because the huge market i&#x27;d pay Apple for a beefy Tower was not worth the degrading user experience i was receiving.<p>In my past experiences a big frustration was configuring&#x2F;debugging some random thing and ending up with a solution that - given 12 months of time - i needed to tweak and cannot remember what i did. Or worse, i upgrade software and something breaks. I identified that this effort was wasted if i couldn&#x27;t roll back easily, or incrementally document my steps through the OS.<p>To tackle this i chose to go with NixOS. It&#x27;s got a lot of rough edges, but a few days of dedicated learning time was enough to make me feel mostly productive. I still have a lot of hanging questions, but with NixOS + Flakes + Home Manager i have a system that i feel confident about stability and my ability to roll back as needed. This softens the blow for me personally of needing to figure stuff out that i otherwise wouldn&#x27;t of had to on OSX.<p>Since my focus is building a beast PC <i>(that i don&#x27;t want to pay Apple for)</i> i <i>might</i> still use Mac Laptops, and as a bonus my Nix setup can still be applied on Apple. From NixPkgs to Home Manager dotfiles i plan on using my setup on both Mac and NixOS.<p>I switched fully ~4 weeks ago, and my only real complaints are <i>(as a Linux Desktop beginner)</i>:<p>1. X11 seems awful. Notably i have one 4k Monitor and two 1080p Monitors and .. it&#x27;s annoying to setup. I&#x27;m using XFCE because it was notably faster than KDE and <i>especially</i> GNOME, and so i set XFCE to 2x Window Scaling but that scales all 3 monitors. So i have to use xrandr to tweak the scalings, and that has been a chore. Lots of experimentation for a janky experience, but i&#x27;ve got it working good enough for me. Wayland will hopefully improve this, but that&#x27;s a long ways out it seems.<p>2. Basic features like scaling seem hit or miss. On KDE i recall it working pretty well with all my normal windows. On XFCE if i set 2x Scaling, Spotify and Zoom don&#x27;t recognize the scaling. Resulting in very small text. I&#x27;m willing to overlook a lot of the Mac &quot;pretty&quot; - but i really wish Desktop Environments would perfect the basics.<p>3. Discoverability on Linux (any distro, imo) is .. bad. We all know the trend of immediately going to Google for everything if you&#x27;re unfamiliar with the toolset or the domain, but i feel like there&#x27;s got to be a better way to navigate a OS from both CLI and UI. Linux has the same discoverability problem that Windows has, it&#x27;s just easier to Google things.. and that feels bad. For a hacker friendly OS i think we could do better here. NixOS, while equally terrible on this front, strikes me as something uniquely fit to be discoverable - given that nearly the entire experience is immutably configured.<p>All in all, so far i&#x27;m quite happy with my switch and looking forward to buying a Zen3 to build a new workstation. Hope this summary of my month long journey is of use to someone lol. It&#x27;s far from over.')
