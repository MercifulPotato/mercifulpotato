Item(by='robocat', descendants=None, kids=[24770786], score=None, time=1602534792, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24758774, text='&gt; Past 55? 98th percentile<p>Reference? Are you implying that developers over 55 are unemployed against their choice?<p>I suspect sampling bias: Any half competent 55 year old has lived through some golden opportunities to make bank, or decide on a career change by choice. Also the intake cohorts results in not many over 55 as a % of total. My experience in New Zealand is that older devs are doing fine as a cohort, although I also can see poor performers who stuck with old tech who may have bitter anecdotes.<p>&gt; You need to own the economic value of your output as early as possible<p>I disagree. I have plenty of 50+ acquaintances doing <i>very</i> nicely on their boring salary without the stress or risk of trying to get a slice of equity. Plenty of people do not have the traits required, or their personal circumstances are not flexible enough to allow for risk, or they just want a 9 to 5 and a comfortable retirement (which they will get, and their rockstar friend might not).<p>Edit: Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The outcomes for the first cohort of developers is very unlikely to be anything like the latest cohort who you are advising - “as early as possible” doesn’t apply to 55+ year old developers?! We haven’t had 30 years of hindsight bias to know what the successful path for a current 20 year old will be.')
