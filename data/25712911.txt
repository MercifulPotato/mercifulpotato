Then this will strengthen them a little so they may become 0.0011% or whatever.<p>Any large social movement should be able to support a share of the economy commensurate to its size, complete with their own journalists, printing presses, leaflet distributors, radio stations, TV shows, phone factories, app stores and social media apps, or whatever communication infrastructure they want to use.<p>Of course that requires lots of work, but if that work is divided by the number of people involved, it becomes manageable again (after all, the whole rest of society manages just fine).<p>If people want to skip that work and instead rely on others to provide them with everything, they shouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they don&#x27;t get exactly what they want.')
