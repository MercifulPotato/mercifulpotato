It&#x27;s that if you&#x27;re going to use an open source tool in your business&#x27;s codebase, you&#x27;ll inevitably need support, upgrades, and bug-fixes, which translates into you putting pressure on the maintainers to do more work. By all means, use those people&#x27;s <i>previous</i> work to put something amazing out into the world quickly. However, when you inevitably need help, be prepared to either: 1) Have people on staff ready and capable of contributing to the project in non-trivial ways; 2) be willing to either hire or pay the maintainer(s) market value for their time, just like with actual employees.')
