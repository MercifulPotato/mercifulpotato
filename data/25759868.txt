Meaning super fast loading on a web page.<p>Same size of the project in React will take 100Mb of drive space, and something more serious in industrial environment goes easily over 1Gb of disk storage, although I love React I find that insane. Even &quot;Hello World&quot; build of React will range between 2MB and xxMb depending on config.')
