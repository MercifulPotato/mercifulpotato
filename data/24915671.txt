Examples are Lotus 123, Oracle forms, Excel without macros. There are no loops, no dictionaries, classes are simple objects mapped to a database table. Functions are inbuilt and most you can do is to compose them. The premise of &quot;No code&quot; is that there will come a time where people will simply declare and compose what exists instead of creating some new code. Take from that what you will.')
