At that point, it would &quot;just&quot; be changing the front-end.<p>There are a lot of good books, but eventually you&#x27;re on your own if you want to reach the functionality of languages in daily use. It&#x27;s fun programming challenges and a lot of rabbit holes.<p>Not making any assumptions that the code will be lean and clean. But at least it is code that I understand better than any ready-made publicly available code.')
