Have you made the determination yourself? At least a significant number of people I know personally say otherwise and stick to dumb phones. They are well paid and it doesn&#x27;t seem they are doing this to save money. So I don&#x27;t think what you say is objective truth as you try to portray it.<p>If I leave out the bad parts then the rest is mostly what I need to use because of external demands or because of technology itself (ie. problems that only exist due to technology itself)<p>I don&#x27;t need to be available on communicator. My team and my family expects me to be or I am marked as unhelpful. That wasn&#x27;t a problem when there wasn&#x27;t expectation to be constantly available.<p>I don&#x27;t need to have Uber installed, but it seems to be the only way to get a cab where I live.<p>I don&#x27;t need navigation, but roads and intersections got so complicated and I got so reliant that I would not be able to reach my destination without it.<p>Etc.')
