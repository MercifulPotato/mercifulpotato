It’s better.<p>Feynman had a funny story about this. I’m no Feynman, but he invented new ways of writing sin, cos, etc. He said he disliked the way it looked, since cos(x) looks like cos multiplied by x. And of course the story ended with the same punchline you outlined: when you want to talk to others, you need shared vocabulary.<p>But the thing is, it’s extremely easy to remember to say “loss” instead of “penalty” when I’m talking to someone. But it was extremely hard for me to even understand what the heck a loss <i>was</i>. What is it, exactly? What’s it doing and why? How should I think about it — and more importantly, how can I extrapolate that thinking to take advantage of it?<p>Maybe it’s a personal quirk, but I simply couldn’t understand loss. I know penalty though. Ditto tor learning rate vs step size. So it’s more of “internal advice” rather than me saying that you should rewrite your papers with the new names.')
