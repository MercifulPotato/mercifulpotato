Item(by='schoen', descendants=None, kids=[25590665], score=None, time=1609373102, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25587471, text='I think it would be helpful to indicate what language the person in each recording is speaking. For example, the site has a sample of someone saying his own name &quot;Zachary&quot; as something like [&#x27;zaxari] but in American English it would be something like [&#x27;zækʌɹi]. This is especially significant for names that occur in multiple languages.<p>In English names that begin with &lt;J&gt; are usually &#x2F;dʒ&#x2F;, but in French they&#x27;re usually &#x2F;ʒ&#x2F;, in Spanish &#x2F;h&#x2F;, in other European languages very often &#x2F;j&#x2F; -- even if they&#x27;re spelled exactly the same way and have the same historic origin! &quot;Jan&quot; could easily have three different pronunciations depending on what country Jan comes from. (I know a Jon who pronounced it with [j] in his native country but consciously chose to encourage the American-style [dʒ] pronunciation after he moved to the U.S.)<p>Another interesting question is how much people expect&#x2F;prefer foreigners to attempt to pronounce their names in a native way. For example, most Brazilians named Thiago would probably pronounce it something like [tʃi&#x27;agu] but might not be upset if English-speakers pronounced it like [ti&#x27;ɑgoʊ]. (They might think &quot;well, that&#x27;s progress over [θi&#x27;ɑgoʊ]&quot;.) My name is pronounced [sɛθ], but Brazilians don&#x27;t have &#x2F;θ&#x2F; (let alone &#x2F;-θ&#x2F;!) and they normally say [&#x27;sɛtʃi] instead. (I&#x27;ve gotten to be OK with that and even joined in jokes about how it sounds very similar to the name of the number seven in Portuguese.)<p>Mandarin has the sounds &lt;zh&gt; [ʈʂ], &lt;j&gt; [tɕ], &lt;c&gt; [tsʰ], &lt;ch&gt; [ʈʂʰ], &lt;q&gt; [tɕʰ], &lt;sh&gt; [ʂ], &lt;x&gt; [ɕ] which are all not present in English and which will probably sound to English speakers like &#x2F;tʃ&#x2F;, &#x2F;ʃ&#x2F;, &#x2F;dʒ&#x2F;, or &#x2F;ʒ&#x2F; (the &lt;zh&gt; in &quot;Zhang&quot; on your site sounded like &#x2F;dʒ&#x2F; to me as an English speaker but I&#x27;m imagining it&#x27;s probably [ʈʂ]). So it&#x27;s an interesting question what will happen if I speak to a person named Zhang and refer to him as &#x2F;dʒaŋ&#x2F; (which is what I would probably say by naively imitating the recording on your site), as opposed to my non-pinyin-literate intuition of &#x2F;ʒæŋ&#x2F;. Can we assume that people generally just prefer if we get as close as possible as the phonologies of our own native languages allow?')
