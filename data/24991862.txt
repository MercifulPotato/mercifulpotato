Item(by='JabavuAdams', descendants=None, kids=[24992876], score=None, time=1604516036, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24991360, text='The problem is that for the vast majority of people religious beliefs are instilled while they are children, within a cultural context, and are empirically harder to change than things like programming language preference. For many, they&#x27;re not even open to discussion.<p>That&#x27;s in fact why there are religious protections. It&#x27;s simply unrealistic to expect people to give up their upbringing just to get a certain job.<p>You identify the problem in your paragraph re: Haskell. Suppose I want to set up some organization working to start a new polity. Let&#x27;s say that as a baseline, I want to recruit people who think it is wrong to resort to violence over say cartoons that are offensive to their religious beliefs. Or maybe I want to recruit people who have no desire to bar people of different sexual orientations from fully participating in love and social life. I can&#x27;t do that in the current legal system because religious beliefs are a protected class. I understand why we got here, historically, but now that we&#x27;re not burning people at the stake, I don&#x27;t see why their religious beliefs should supersede the larger societal norms (of a new society).<p>It&#x27;s a matter of how strongly those beliefs are held and the futility of trying to convince people to abandon such deeply-held and meaningful beliefs. Better to tilt the scales by not inviting them to the party, regardless of which way things evolve later.<p>EDIT&gt; For any given religion I recognize that there are many possible doctrinal and individual interpretations. But how to measure the individual&#x27;s preferences as a filter on admission? It&#x27;s easy to fake answers to a questionnaire. How to establish an org without inviting the griefers, and without running afoul of protected classes? I mean you could do it the old-fashioned nudge-nudge-wink-wink way, but that&#x27;s a huge legal vulnerability.')
