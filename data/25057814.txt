Why have you sticked with windows or mac os when they released 20 versions of their software? NT and 98, windows server, etc.? Because it does it&#x27;s job, who cares that there are other versions that also works! I run influx stack in production for two years and had (almost) zero problems with it. Everything works, is being maintained and on the side the new cool stuff is being rolled out, what&#x27;s the problem with that? Paul, as a happy user of influx, let me say - thank you guys for what you are creating!')
