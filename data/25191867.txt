Let&#x27;s say you have one colleague that speaks his mind all the time. Sometimes he says dumb stuff, sometimes suggests useful ideas. And another colleague, who&#x27;s very nice and polite, agrees with everything you (and others) say, but he only does it to get optics points and is actually plotting how to replace you with someone cheaper.<p>This is happening here and now. Tech monopolies are commoditizing human labor, and social justice&#x2F;immigration policies use noble excuses to bring in lower bidders into the commoditized market. This hurts everyone&#x27;s well-being, this creates unnecessary tension between groups that are forced to compete directly instead of operating in separate market segments, but hey, the figurehead behind the operation sounds like such a great guy, when he reads his speeches from a teleprompter.')
