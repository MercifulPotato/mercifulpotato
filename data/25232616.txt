I was not personally attacking you, or trying to quash your 2 cents. You gave your 2 cents, and I disagree with the main thrust of what you said, so I gave my 2 cents on the topic. That&#x27;s all that&#x27;s happened, you&#x27;re not being run out of town on a rail for speaking outside the overton window - you just suggested that this research was a waste of time and I argued that it does not seem to me to be a waste of time.<p>It seems like you have some resentment because you don&#x27;t feel your personally acquired knowledge is being valued correctly? That may be the case generally, but it&#x27;s not the case here, I assure you.')
