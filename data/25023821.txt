Trump has clearly been planning to call the election illegitimate since long before it happened - casting doubt on mail-in ballots, etc. He hypocritically advocated continuing counts in some states and stopping them in others depending on whether he was ahead. He claimed without evidence that dead people had voted, late cast ballots had been counted, etc. And he falsely claimed that only votes counted by election night were legitimate.<p>Do you honestly think once his claims relating to poll observers go through due process, everyone will be satisfied?<p>Pragmatically, there is such a slim chance that any of his challenges change the outcome of the election, that it&#x27;s reasonable to consider Biden President-elect at this point.')
