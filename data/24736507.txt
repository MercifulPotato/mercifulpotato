Occasionally I will page back through looking for something I remember I wrote down, but most of it is just to help myself in the moment.<p>As an extension of this, when someone comes and asks me a question I start with a verbal explanation.  If it isn&#x27;t clicking for the person I quickly reach for a pen or a whiteboard marker and start drawing diagrams while I talk.  This usually leads to a quicker &quot;aha&quot; moment for the person; a picture is worth a thousand words.<p>For a long time it was not something I considered much; it&#x27;s just been an extension of how I think for as long as I can remember.<p>Sometime back I ran into an ex-colleague; we hadn&#x27;t worked together in about a decade.  After the usual chit chat of catching up she said to me, &quot;Do you still doodle when you work?  I will always remember how you constantly drew pictures of everything and how it made things so much easier to understand.  I hope you still do that.&quot;.  I laughed and told her how surprised I was that someone would even remember that after so many years, but that yes I continued to draw pictures of my thoughts like I always had.')
