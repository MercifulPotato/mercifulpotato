I have been envious of their prodigious production. I think, often, those folks solve problems by adding more code.<p>I think, sometimes that mountain of code starts to become a liability. I&#x27;m a little better at reading a lot of code, consolidating, and fixing bugs. Importantly, fixing bugs without breaking other stuff (usually. coding is hard)<p>if you buy the adage &quot;make it work, make it right, make it fast&quot;, you&#x27;d probably buy that most people fall into one of those categories and excel (there are rare jewels that are amazing at all three. Carmack maybe is a good example).<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m not a top performer. I have my moments of glory, and I think I deliver good value. I try to avoid git stats. I peek from time to time, and I&#x27;m super pleased that I&#x27;ve deleted about 2x the amount of code I&#x27;ve added but, that&#x27;s maybe me protecting my ego.<p>Everybody needs code, some people need code to be right, even fewer people need code to be fast. Different people bring different skills to the table. Be real careful about how those different aspects play into reaching goals.')
