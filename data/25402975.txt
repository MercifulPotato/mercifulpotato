(Also don&#x27;t forget Nissan!) Tesla still competes on the higher end of the scale.<p>Yes, I know, &quot;average&quot; new car price and all - but for ICE vehicles, most expensive vehicles are trucks and they bring the average up. Sedans&#x2F;hatchbacks tend to be below that average. SUVs are right around that average, but higher for electric versions.<p>So vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E and VW&#x27;s ID.3, ID.4, etc. will get siblings and provide consumer choice. Vehicles like the Cybertruck, Ford F150 electric, whatever GM makes after the Hummer, etc. will compete in the electric pickup race.<p>And between all these traditional manufacturers and governments, enough alternative charging networks will exist to be reasonable competitors to Tesla.')
