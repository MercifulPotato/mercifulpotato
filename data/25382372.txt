When I applied to a new Clojure shop in Germany, the first step was a lengthy take-home assignment that was time-consuming and vague. After spending a couple days on it, I never got a reply.<p>A second Clojure startup in Italy did the same to me.<p>In both cases, there was zero guidance and it felt more like a guessing game about what they were looking for than an actual coding evaluation.<p>I have never experienced this in any of the other langauges I&#x27;ve used professionally. I&#x27;ve had to do simple, short technical screens, but only Clojure companies seem to expect that you give up big amounts of your time for no pay for the honor of applying to them.<p>That really needs to change.')
