Item(by='duckfang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610937127, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25817338, text='&gt;  But I have a hard time visualizing RF light.<p>The best things I can recommend is to play with GnuRadio, IQ data, false color representation of a freq or set of frequencies bound to color&#x2F;decibel strength, and ParaView and importing said IQ data for graphing.<p>Think of the frequency of light as its color, and dB strength of how bright it is. However at cm and m wavelengths, voids happen much more regularly. That light can &#x27;bend&#x27; around, and go through objects.<p>&gt; There aren’t any good videos out there of just a straight forward visualization of RF light.<p>There&#x27;s quite a few false color images. If you look at hydrogen line radioastrometry, there&#x27;s a ton of false color images. There&#x27;s also this HackADay that mapped wifi for a wide area covered by their CNC gantry  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackaday.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;02&#x2F;17&#x2F;mapping-wifi-signals-in-3-dimensions&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackaday.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;02&#x2F;17&#x2F;mapping-wifi-signals-in-3-di...</a><p>&gt; And also, why can visible light pass through other visible light without causing interference?<p>EM primarily only directly affect things with an electric charge. EM radiation itself doesn&#x27;t have an electric charge, therefore EM usually doesn&#x27;t affect other EM. However, if we include gamma (+10^19 Hz), then if those collide, they can create an electron and a positron. But that&#x27;s only theorized with energy vector diagrams and not actually seen.<p>&gt; Why can’t they make visible light with an antenna?<p>You can... You just have to pump enough energy in it to make it glow! &#x2F;hahaha<p>&gt; Why are large arrays of RF receivers not more widely used for small-scale RF imaging?<p>That&#x27;s primarily a cost issue. Go look how much a single RF frontend chip and an a&#x2F;d chip costs. (Price gets to stupid levels at, say 24 bit A&#x2F;D).<p>Now instead, lets look at human vision. Humans can see (eyes are receptors of radio from 380nM to 720nM). When converted to Hz, we&#x27;re talking 372.55 THz wide spectrum vision.<p>My SDR on the table can see 112 MHz, or .0000112 THz<p>Now, in order to replicate what&#x27;s going on in the eye, you&#x27;d need millions of antennas AND data acquisition (of some sort). And then, even with current SDRs, these generate 60GB&#x2F;min - you need the disk, memory, and CPU to do stuff with that. It&#x27;s NOT a trivial problem.<p>Now there are some RF arrays out there. KerberosSDR is one such array. However, its max bandwidth is 3 MHz @ 8 bit. And it can only do 4 inputs, which is enough to do geographical tracking of radio signals (within 24MHz to 1.7GHz). I know of one person who&#x27;s trying to do some VR work with a KerberosSDR.<p>The other problem, once you have the millions of antennas and data acquisition, is a matter of synchronization. Timing is also another stupidly hard area, which increases geometrically with more sensors. And remember that 1nS = 11.8 inches deviation.. So whatever processing you&#x27;re doing had better be time consistent and local to the device.<p>Eventually, we&#x27;ll get to what you&#x27;re proposing. A lot of us are wanting that. But we&#x27;re decades away.')
