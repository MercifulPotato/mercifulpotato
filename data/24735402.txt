Item(by='chmaynard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602285658, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24729697, text='This a fascinating account of Gordon Moore&#x27;s early years at Shockley Labs, Fairchild Semiconductor, and Intel. He contradicts the conventional wisdom that the so-called &quot;traitorous eight&quot; were somehow disloyal to Shockley. As Moore tells it, he and others tried very hard to convince Arnold Beckman, who had provided the seed funding for Shockley Labs, that the company could not succeed unless Shockley was relieved of his management responsibilities. This group of eight scientists and engineers decided to go elsewhere only after Beckman refused to take action. I wonder if Beckman later regretted this fateful decision? In hindsight, Beckman Semiconductor probably would have done very well.')
