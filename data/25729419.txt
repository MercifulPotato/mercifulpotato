Most of our &quot;bike lanes&quot; are nothing more than narrowed painted lanes on the road sandwiched between fast moving traffic and parked cars (with potentially opening doors). Non-experienced cyclists will rightfully not feel safe using these lanes because they <i>aren&#x27;t</i> safe. But build better infrastructure and even children can use it safely.')
