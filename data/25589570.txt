If I put that there, people don&#x27;t have to actually think about the comment and what I meant, or their own reaction to it. Using &#x2F;s tells them automatically, and allows a reflexive response for&#x2F;against the comment that short-circuits actually thinking about it. I&#x27;ll risk the downvotes, they don&#x27;t bother me.<p>But I am curious about <i>why</i> people downvote, hence my follow up. Clearly some people will downvote a thing they disagree with, or is flame bait. But will they downvote a thing they might agree with, but it also worded as flame bait? That sort of thing. I really am curious about the various behavioral patterns involved in awarding internet points.')
