It still suggests there is no apples to apples comparison between the real world and simulation though, and that those numbers can&#x27;t really be considered equivalent or even compared in a useful way.<p>If you&#x27;re saying the simulation should&#x27;ve revealed more problems than the real world, wouldn&#x27;t that mean there&#x27;d be more contacts through simulation (because that&#x27;s where you discover them) and then you&#x27;d hope the fix exists before rolling it out to the real world, so you&#x27;d expect to have less contacts there?  What they&#x27;re reporting is the opposite of that though.<p>Obviously I don&#x27;t have enough information to draw a scientific conclusion here - I&#x27;m just pointing out there is an <i>enormous</i> discrepancy between their simulated miles and their real miles.')
