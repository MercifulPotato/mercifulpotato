I have used the LTS releases on my laptop for 5 years without reinstall or any major issues (I&#x27;m a student, so the complexity of what I use increased gradually), but the latest update f*cked a lot of things up. Didn&#x27;t have time to do a reinstall yet, but i sense it&#x27;s highly needed. So Debian might be a better option at the time, especially as stuff is expected to be tinkered with more (switch to Wayland etc). Oh, and don&#x27;t get me started on the Ubuntu Python installation :&#x2F;')
