You can buy plenty of PCs in that middle category of high-but-not-extreme performance without the certifications, Quadros and vendor markup that a full-on &quot;workstation&quot; model has. And they&#x27;re perfectly fine choices for many professional use cases.<p><i>For that market</i>, the Mac Pro is overpriced (the high-end Dell&#x2F;HP workstations are too), and Apple doesn&#x27;t make anything more suited for it. That&#x27;s the criticism. That the Mac Pro is acceptably priced compared to the Dell&#x2F;HP workstations doesn&#x27;t matter if that&#x27;s not what you need.')
