You can contrast a walled garden to a community garden as you did. That&#x27;s about controlling who comes in.<p>Anyway.. the &quot;garden&quot; part has is rich too. What&#x27;s the contrast to garden? Wilderness? I think what makes a garden is being artificial. The gardner makes the garden. Everything <i>in</i> the garden is natural and the garden itself is inevitably an ecosystem. But, if the gardner abandons it, the garden will quickly evolve into something else. In that sense, the garden is an moderately unstable state being maintained by a gardner.<p>Besides biodiversity, that&#x27;s my way of quantifying wildness. What will happen if people leave? How different will it be? I think that&#x27;s why we associate forest so strongly with wilderness. The forest will remain a forest. The amount of tension between what a garden is now and what nature would like it to be.')
