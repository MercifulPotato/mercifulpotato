Item(by='geofft', descendants=None, kids=[25797075], score=None, time=1610745638, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25796402, text='What did informing the cops about the burglary do, precisely?<p>One specific feature (at least in the US) is that a police report is required for an insurance claim - but there&#x27;s no fundamental reason this system requires a <i>police</i> report, as opposed to, say, a sworn statement to a clerk of court or a public prosecutor. And even so, that&#x27;s about getting some form of recompense after the crime happened, not stopping the crime (the burglary still happened to you, did it not?).<p>Along the same lines, I don&#x27;t believe that the presence of the police prevents people from killing others. I certainly believe that the presence of <i>the legal system</i> does, by imposing strong penalties against murder. I&#x27;d believe that detective &#x2F; investigative work (which a small fraction of the work the police do now, yes) aids the legal system by making those penalties actually happen. But I think you will find that there are very few potential murders where a cop is around and able to respond (by shooting first, I guess?) in time to prevent the murder from happening.<p>Even if you think of the favorable portrayal of cops in, say, <i>Law and Order</i>, they&#x27;re generally investigating a crime that already happened, and it&#x27;s pretty rare that they end up in a position by the end of the episode to stop a crime in progress and find themselves in a shootout.')
