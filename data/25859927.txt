His motivation appears to be purely money, but he and those who voted for him don&#x27;t appear to have a problem with the cost of that being democracy and racial unity.</i><p>No offense, but this seems like a narrative straight out of the left-wing playbook.  Fomenting racial divisions around the World? Seems a bit of a stretch.<p>As far as the motivation being &quot;purely money&quot;, I&#x27;d say his presidency cost him a bunch of scrilla, though I bet he earns it back in the long run.  Is that any different than, say, Bill Clinton, who has made millions of dollars doing speeches around the world after his presidency?  I&#x27;m not sure.<p>&gt;<i>USA seemingly can&#x27;t be trusted to keep even a semblance of Rule of Law</i><p>Turn off the TV.  The US is still great.
