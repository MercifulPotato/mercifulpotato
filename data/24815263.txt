Part of that is that families can operate totally without policies, that they are having horrible dynasty lawsuits because nothing is written on paper or litigated that way. Yet as long as they don’t sue each other, the lack of policy friction - a “liquidity” that may not show up as a dollar amount but as something else - makes the family dynasty surprisingly competitive.<p>Wouldn’t it be ironic that policies - specifically the hundred+ page markdown output kind of policies, not something succinct like I don’t know, the Ten Commandments or the Bill of Rights - make the corrupt family dynasty more competitive?')
