Take a look at dang&#x27;s comment history[1] and you&#x27;ll see a lot of warnings before ban but also plenty of bans and references to previous bans, usually for substantive, not spam, reasons.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;threads?id=dang" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;threads?id=dang</a>')
