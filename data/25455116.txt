Which sounds like completely reasonable thing to do!</i><p>the BSL is not an open source license,  but I can see where they are coming from, and I don&#x27;t have a problem with it. With the one exception than I bet it will slow adoption, which is really just selfish on my part, because I want to use it and it will be an easier sell the more people are aware of it. Honestly I&#x27;m hoping that postgres just adopts the best parts of cockroach and i won&#x27;t need to keep bringing it up to grossed out managers.')
