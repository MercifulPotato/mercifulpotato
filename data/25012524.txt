The warehousing items for future runs mechanic was neat, it was fun to set yourself to win up down the line by leaving something powerful behind to use again.<p>Games like DC:SS have more depth and choices, but are also harder to just pick up and play. I played crawl at a fairly high level (took 3rd in a tournament and had an 8 or 9 streak) but games like Shiren are more ‘fun’ to me now.')
