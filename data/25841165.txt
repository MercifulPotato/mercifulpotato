When you realize only a very small minority of people will adhere to this ideal, that people crave snippets and soundbites inside of bubbles, the next step is realizing that democracy is rule-by-mass-media, which disseminates a message carefully crafted by a small intellectual elite; that the opinions of voters are largely crafted for and distributed to them; their opinions are not their own.<p>Even this, what I&#x27;ve written, is just feelings and intuition. So that&#x27;s basically my answer: long-form exposition and the skills for evaluating an exposition&#x27;s soundness. But it&#x27;s an ideal that doesn&#x27;t play out.')
