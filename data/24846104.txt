Instead of automating a difficult stage of a process as-is, you redesign the entire process, possibly including the final product, to make it automation-friendly.<p>This is how we deal with problems in general. If we can&#x27;t solve them on their own terms, we change the terms. For example, designing an all-terrain vehicle is hard, so instead we&#x27;ve been beating the terrain flat, and paving it so that it stays flat, to allow a simple box with wheels to work, and we&#x27;ve been doing that since beginnings of recorded history.<p>(And speaking of paving - we&#x27;re not placing random stones in the ground anymore; we&#x27;re either pouring liquid, or laying stones pre-cut to standard size. Both are much easier to automate, and to some extent they already are automated.)<p>I can&#x27;t think of a job so specific that wouldn&#x27;t yield to competition from equivalent but normalized job.')
