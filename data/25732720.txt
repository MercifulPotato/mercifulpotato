Item(by='JPKab', descendants=None, kids=[25737586], score=None, time=1610387347, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25732322, text='&quot;I think perhaps you are correct, but I think we have come to the realization that people like your brother are gone and not likely to come back without serious help (medication, therapy, etc.) Just being exposed to other points of view does not seem to cure them.&quot;<p>This is exactly part of the problem:\nThe hyper-dramatic reaction to a mob of political extremists that forcibly took over a public government building that occurred when the mob was right-wing, and when the building was the DC Capitol, that didn&#x27;t at all occur when entire neighborhoods, court houses, police precincts, and Federal Courthouses had the exact same occurrence, with a minimal reaction from the press.<p>My brother isn&#x27;t mentally ill, anymore than the people dressed in black shooting green lasers in the eyes of Federal officers guarding the Federal Courthouse in Portland are mentally ill. If anyone had bothered to focus on the dangerous radicalization when it was people who they happen to agree with politically, maybe we&#x27;d be a bit further ahead on countering it.  Instead, we waited until it was people on the other side of the spectrum to notice how dangerous the echo chambers have become, and will label these people members of a cult, without acknowledging the absolute nut jobs on our own side.  I was in Portland over the summer, and the crowds around the courthouse were mirror images of the crowds around the capitol.  The amount of derangement on display was equivalent.  Instead of MAGA gear, it was all black bloc gear, but that&#x27;s about the only difference.<p>You are clearly a part of this sectarian viewpoint, because I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re going to tell me numerous reasons why ONLY these people are terrorists, and not the people who occupied several city blocks of Seattle with assault rifles for months over the summer (with no permission from the residents).  I view them all as lunatic, dangerous terrorists, whether they have a MAGA hat or BLM shirt on, provided they are engaging in destruction of property or violence.')
