All the other ones that I&#x27;ve experienced were horrifying. Merging subversion branches was a nightmare compared to git. Perforce was better than subversion but still pretty bad compared to git.<p>I&#x27;ve also reverted merges many times in git with no issue. You just choose which parent you&#x27;re reverting to and then it just works.<p>The only time I&#x27;ve seen branch merges in git really fuck up is one time when a novice git user at my company unstaged a file from the index before committing the merge. That was a disaster and took me hours to figure out what the hell was going on with that file.')
