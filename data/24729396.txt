The ability and need to do that aren&#x27;t specific to memory unsafety, we do that all over software engineering.<p>Second, empirically, my experience has been that the design of these abstractions can be safe, but moreover that the cordoning off of unsafe blocks makes 3p auditing for memory unsafety _much_ easier to do. It can be orders of magnitude faster than reviewing an entire C or C++ codebase.')
