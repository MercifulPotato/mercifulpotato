Item(by='croissants', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606054846, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25159943, text='+1 for Lucky Peach. It&#x27;s been out of print for a few years now, but you can pick up issues from eBay and used bookstores for $5-10 each if you&#x27;re patient and willing to buy multiple issues at once.<p>Each issue is about one topic (Chinatown, Summer, All You Can Eat, Plants, etc.) and has some mix of recipes, travelogue, art, fiction, memoir, history, etc. If you&#x27;re interested in food, this is some of the most &quot;fun&quot; food writing around. A personal favorite of mine is the &quot;Fantasy&quot; issue, which is written around chefs and dishes that don&#x27;t exist, and kind of doubles as an affectionate parody of food writing.')
