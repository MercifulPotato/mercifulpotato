Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606201273, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25195242, text='&gt;&gt; If someone challenges a status quo that you like (&quot;makes something political&quot; in your parlance), then actually defend that status quo. <i>Don&#x27;t gripe about how those quarrelsome people ruined your nice &quot;apolitical day.&quot;</i><p>&gt; Incidentally, that right there is a good illustration of how being apolitical is different from supporting the status quo.<p>&gt; Going to a protest to defend the status quo from change is defending the status quo. Not having an opinion about some particular detail of how society operates is being apolitical.<p>Not really.  You&#x27;re trying to restrict &quot;doing politics&quot; to certain overt political rituals (&quot;going to a protest&quot;), which I think is false restriction.<p>However, you missed my point in your incomplete quote: the act of griping that things should be kept &quot;apolitical&quot; is itself a kind of protest for the status quo, just a disguised one.<p>Now you might have a point that someone&#x27;s ignorance of an issue could make them in some sense &quot;apolitical&quot; in relation to it.  However, once the issue has been articulated to them in a way they understand, they&#x27;re no longer ignorant and have taken some position, even if that&#x27;s <i>tacit</i> approval of the status quo.')
