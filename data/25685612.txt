It used to be widely available to desktop class hardware (I used to have some), but it was slower and more expensive than non-ECC RAM.  None of the marketing-types made a good case for why normal people should pay more money for less-performant hardware, so the market disappeared.<p>Even the security issues only meaningfully impact servers.<p>People like Linus can buy server-class hardware if ECC is so important to them.')
