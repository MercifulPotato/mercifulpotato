Item(by='Geminidog', descendants=None, kids=[25370525], score=None, time=1607578812, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25368473, text='Right I understand we&#x27;re introducing new hypothesis, but it still stands.<p>By controlling the causative factor no new hypothesis can undermine an established causation assuming that there are no side effects when we trigger a causation event. Think about it.<p>This means that causation is actually established versus the other method which is a flimsier verification. Another way to look at it is that rather then introducing a new &quot;hypothesis&quot; you had to introduce assumptions about causation.<p>You&#x27;re thinking in terms of math where you can control your primitives and set a domain and range. In science none of these can be fully controlled and a &quot;new hypothesis&quot; does indeed apply.<p>Think about it. If I introduce a new hypothesis in the real world that actually lends good evidence in support of say the cancer outcome I cannot just discount it and say it&#x27;s not good science. You can only restrict your universe like this in the world of math and logic, in the real world you have to except any reasonable evidence that comes your way.<p>In practice however, most scientists make a bunch of assumptions and will likely test things using your method because it&#x27;s just 100x easier and more realistic in terms of setting up an experiment that&#x27;s possible.<p>Also I mentioned in another comment that your experiment does not actually rule out the genetic factor. Both genetics and smoking and tar could all logically be causative factors for cancer. If the previous statement was true all your correlations established in your post would be exactly the same... there were many assumptions made. So in short your experimental evidence lends support for multiple conclusions that cannot be discounted.')
