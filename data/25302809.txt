Item(by='yodsanklai', descendants=None, kids=[25303029, 25305069], score=None, time=1607093510, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25302521, text='This is also one of my concern.<p>Most of the interviewers were in their 20&#x2F;30s and so is everybody on their &quot;career&quot; web pages and presentation documents. However, in the team I&#x27;ll join, at least two people are about my age or older.<p>What I can tell is that never in the recruiting process did I feel discriminated against. Once you&#x27;re in the loop, their main concern seems to be how well you perform in the interviews. I feel I was at a slight disadvantage compared to to my younger self in term of thinking speed for the algorithmic questions but this can be compensated by a better preparation.<p>EDIT: not sure why you&#x27;re down-voted. Ageism is a thing and a legitimate source of concern.')
