Both of them seem a little ambiguous to me: they both clearly ban the city&#x27;s use, and ban the city from allowing corporate use in public places, but do they ban the private use of facial recognition by individuals on public property?  Does failing to specifically ban this constitute authorization?<p>It&#x27;s been reported that protesters in Portland OR and other places have been using facial recognition to identify police who don&#x27;t have visible badges -- so I am wondering if this is banned.')
