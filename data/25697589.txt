More importantly, are you willing and able to convince enough of your network to pay for it?<p>Otherwise, any system will asymptotically look like Twitter&#x2F;Blah. You could very well use your group chat feature on regular cell phone as a start (takes care of the payment aspect). But soon you or your friends will want feature X. So, cough up more $$ again.<p>Another option is to cultivate real life friends&#x2F;family that you can hang out with, chat, share photos in the privacy of your home&#x2F;blah (wait till covid passes please).')
