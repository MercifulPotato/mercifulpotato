What about putting a GPS tracker or similar on each animal and just let it roam. I&#x27;m not sure, but maybe it could work.<p>2. Zoo&#x27;s can profitably contain Rhino&#x27;s and Elephants. My local zoo lets people pay the zoo to feed some of the animals! So maybe a tourism angle could help move the needle on profitability.<p>3. What if it was a government-run operation with out the need to be profitable? Current anti-poaching operations don&#x27;t bring in any profit, so maybe this angle of attack doesn&#x27;t need to either.')
