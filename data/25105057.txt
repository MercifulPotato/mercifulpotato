I am under the impression that in most parliamentary systems a ballot normally has one race for MP. That&#x27;s it -- or maybe one other issue, under extraordinary circumstances (e.g. Brexit).<p>A typical U.S. ballot may have 20 or 30 issues on it.<p>Even if one assumed that all other factors were equal (they aren&#x27;t), even the raw counting might be expected to consume 20 or 30 times as much time.<p>We vote on a LOT of things here, and it becomes quite complicated.<p>A U.S. voter may well be voting on issues related to the sewer district, and the school district, and the library district, and the city council, and (this is important) those various districts might be overlapping or <i>even disjoint</i>. Just because both Bob and Alice are in Sewer District 5 doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re both in Road District A. Far from it.<p>It takes time just to ensure that everyone has been given the proper ballot, much less count and combine the figures from various polling stations (Sewer District 5 may cover multiple polling stations, as may Road District A, but they may not be, and probably aren&#x27;t the same stations).<p>It&#x27;s a mess, granted, but we prefer voting on stuff rather than electing a council or MP who takes care of everything for us.')
