They&#x27;re doing a great job. They&#x27;re not perfect.<p>I&#x27;m in the same boat as you and the other OP up-thread. I&#x27;m amazed by what M1 has accomplished, but less so because of what it represents for itself (and for Apple) and more that it shows <i>ARM is capable of</i>.<p>As an architecture, ARM is impressing the Hell out of me as of late. Sure, it&#x27;s not touching Intel and AMD in terms of raw performance, but once you start looking at the performance-per-watt, the story is absolutely different. x86&#x27;s power budget is looking awfully bloated by comparison.<p>What happens if NVIDIA&#x27;s acquisition of ARM goes through? Do they start producing their own CPUs?')
