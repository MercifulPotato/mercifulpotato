It should be possible for any company to ban bots but then for a person with a account on the website to say: I am giving this tool my cloud power of attorney (best if signed through a digital govt id system, e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;BankID" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;BankID</a>) and I take responsibility for what it does; you may not block it or erect CAPTCHAs for it, it scrapes&#x2F;takes actions on your website on my behalf for my personal needs. This would make running a bunch of scripts on your own NUC or Pi an inalienable right while still allowing companies to fight unfair competition and plain simple DoS attacks.')
