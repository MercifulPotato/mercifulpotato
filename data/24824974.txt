You didn&#x27;t go to toy stores to buy computers, we had a number of Electronics retailers and department stores that sold them. They were in Dixon&#x27;s, Curry&#x27;s and Comet (all electrical retailers, the former two still exist in some type of form), but also places like Boots (mainly a chemist&#x2F;pharmacy), WHSmith (mainly a book, stationary and newspaper retailer), Department stores like Debenhams. There were no &quot;mom and pop&quot; computer stores. They were usually all on display, and all very accessible. We had a massive programme to learn about computers in schools so we all knew how to write some basic, and kids would walk up to them and code little demos (some version of &quot;10 print &quot;this store stinks&quot;: goto 10&quot; was common). The computers on display differed, but you&#x27;d see ZX Spectrum, C64, Oric Atmos, Amstrad CPC range and other lesser known players. But Apple was unknown. Not one, ever. If you wanted an Apple you needed to go to a specialist dealer, and generally they were few and far between and super expensive.<p>By the time the 16-bit computers came about, they were mainly in stores like Curry&#x27;s and Dixon&#x27;s, and very accessible. I had an Amiga 500, and most of my friends did too, except one poor chap with an Atari ST.<p>There was a one &quot;mom and pop&quot; type store in my town by the time I got to my late teens. They sold a lot of the big box Amigas, some PC&#x27;s and import consoles like PC-Engine. But they closed in the late 90&#x27;s. I remember buying a used black and white TV from their closing down sale for Â£10.')
