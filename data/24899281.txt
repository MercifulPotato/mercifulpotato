The point was to crush them, to <i>avoid</i> anyone in the political sphere questioning deindustrialization and financialization.<p>Four years later, we know that trying to silence populism while also giving Trump, a populist, 24&#x2F;7 earned-media coverage <i>did not work</i>.  At the time, though, people expected it to work.')
