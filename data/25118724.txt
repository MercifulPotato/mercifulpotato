AI as we know it is a tool. It does not have a way to think for itself. It can simulate and improve many specialized tasks. So, it does not have a way to scape and take over the world on its own.<p>My fear is that ALL new tech is eventually turned in to a weapon that we as humans use to dominate other humans. AI is used and will be used as a weapon and that scares me for the future.')
