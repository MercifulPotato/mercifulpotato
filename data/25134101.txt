Stockpiling enriched uranium after stating a desire to wipe a particular country &quot;off the map&quot; seems to imply that there was more going on than civilian nuclear weapons.<p>So still zero evidence that they&#x27;ve had a nuclear weapons program post 2009, just you think they must really want one because they keep getting attacked by a nearby nuclear power.<p>&gt;What&#x27;s your point?<p>That your reason for wanting Iran to be forbidden from refining uranium is basically a fear that someday they&#x27;ll be able to treat the US (or other western ally) how we treat them. If you object to that treatment, stop treating other countries like that with labels like &quot;rogue state.&quot;')
