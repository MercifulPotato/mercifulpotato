Margin lending occurs when part of the funds put on the market are funded by a debt mechanism. \nClassically I might invest say $10,000 and the debt facilitate would say provide a $10,000 loan and I’d have $20,000 invested in the market in my name, with a 50% loan to value ratio.<p>If the investment dropped far enough.. say to $12,000, the margin call facility works like this.<p>It considers the remaining money is always the lenders, so now the lender is exposed for $10,000&#x2F;$12,000 eg 83% of the exposure is theirs.<p>They then ask you to top back up your contribution so they are less exposed (within 24-48hrs), or they auto-sell stock to ensure they are not exposed further.<p>In the case of Robinhood, the margin lending arrangement is always fully backed once the cash is processed. Which I’m guessing is always reliably a few days after it’s deposited.<p>So it’s crazy to trigger margin calls as all the debt is quickly fully backed.<p>It would be expected that Robinhood would have negotiated an instrument that never left them with margin calls on cash contributions like this. This is totally on them.')
