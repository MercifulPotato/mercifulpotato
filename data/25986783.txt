I don&#x27;t buy it.  Even if the medical community listened (which isn&#x27;t guaranteed and which I find unlikely), the public at large wouldn&#x27;t.  It was far more beneficial to have someone publicly walking a fine line, not lying but refusing to endorse the Trump administration&#x27;s lies, than to have a unified government leadership telling us all to go out in crowds to Starbucks to buy hydroxychloroquine lattes.')
