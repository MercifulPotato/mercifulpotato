For example, many protein features (signal peptides, GPI anchors, transmembrane domains, glycosylation sites, phosphorylation sites, E&#x2F;R retention signals, etc.) can be modeled as formal languages or as probabilistic formal languages. Literally, that&#x27;s what they are, amino acid codes.<p>In order to help people with rare diseases, it is very important to identify which variant is knocking off one of those features. In most cases, that&#x27;s the cause. For example, haemophilia (which is the archetypal rare disease) arises due to a mutation that abolishes a signal peptide in either Factor VIII or Factor IX. Furthermore, it has to be done as quickly and as automatically as possible. Otherwise, it doesn&#x27;t scale.<p>Most research funding agencies are sadly quite uninterested in rare diseases.')
