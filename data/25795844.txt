Imagine that instead of accidentally destroying police records, you destroyed the paperwork showing people had a legal right to live in the UK. And imagine that you then instituted a policy of deporting the people who couldn&#x27;t prove they had a legal right to live in the UK. And imagine that all happened under the person who would go on to become prime minister, and that it would all come to light whilst she was prime minister....<p>And that <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> the thing to cause her to resign.<p>This is just a minor blip for the home office, and your ideas of back ups are quaint, but that&#x27;s not he problem here.')
