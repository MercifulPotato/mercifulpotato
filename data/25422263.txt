I&#x27;m not convinced one could tell the difference.<p>It&#x27;s also not clear that the needs being met by these AIs all have to do with sex or gender.  I&#x27;d bet plenty of them have nothing to do with sex and are gender-neutral.<p>For example, just having someone&#x2F;something listen to you and show the they care (even if they actually don&#x27;t) is a need that&#x27;s not tied to sex or gender.')
