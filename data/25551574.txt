Apparently it achieves good results as it can find discrete solutions for complex, well defined problems.<p>Reinforcement learning is something I know even less about. But from what I gathered it is also most successful in well defined problems and systems (such as games).<p>So my question is: How do they relate? Is there overlap and what are the most significant conceptual differences?')
