SV has lots of angel investors whose expertise is valued by the next generation of founders. So lots of founders go to SV in search of capital and guidance. If successful founders were just &quot;lucky&quot;, they wouldn&#x27;t be so sought after, and SV wouldn&#x27;t be so appealing to early-stage founders.<p>Disclosure: I live in SV, am the founder of a mostly-bootstrapped startup, and by most measures am not a successful founder.')
