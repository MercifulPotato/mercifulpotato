Let me expand:<p>If you can afford to spare part of your income and invest that for long term buy and hold, that&#x27;ll work better (ex. ETF).<p>If you can&#x27;t spare anything, focusing on leveling up trendy skills, then you can land a better job on the short term.<p>However if you just want to trade for the fun of it, yes crypto can be simpler than stock, mainly because the API are better. Set up a maximum budget as a safety net and enjoy :)')
