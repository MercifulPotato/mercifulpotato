If it&#x27;s former, we can somehow prevent it, right? The translation code is known.<p>&gt; Anything with a JIT compiler (including most web browsers) needs special handling.<p>I guess this is something Rosetta 2 does.<p>From what I can tell, the listed reasons are mostly alongside how hard or challenging it would be but there is no actual technical limitation. It&#x27;s just no one really made the effort, I guess because of QEMU since it works for most cases albeit with a performance penalty since it&#x27;s emulation rather than translation.<p>Do you think it&#x27;s feasible to implement a translation software that similar to Rosetta 2 but open source and covers other ISAs like RISC-V? I understand that it&#x27;s hard but it&#x27;s also surprising that while we see the barrier for different ISAs to be the compatibility but at the same time we settled for only runtime emulation.')
