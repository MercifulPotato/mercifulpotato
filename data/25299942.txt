They may simply not be stellar at the examination process used by FAANGs to assess candidates.<p>As much as many folks at those companies might want to partake in some fart-huffing and call that a predictor of engineering excellence, it’s not. It’s an optimization to shovel candidates at scale, and intentionally throws out ton of exceptional and even over-qualified individuals to instead hire a predictable style of engineer with as little investment as possible.')
