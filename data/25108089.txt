The truth is the advantages and disadvantages of various authentication systems are subtle, and hard for a lot of technical people to understand, much less care about.<p>Apple is a commercial corporation, and one of the biggest (by market cap) companies in the world.  That gives me confidence that they&#x27;ll be around for a long time, have sufficient resources to invest in security and reliability, and they have a well-established reputation for a focus on security.  They do other things I don&#x27;t like[1], but I think this is one area where they&#x27;re setting really good precedent.<p>In addition, it&#x27;s going to be difficult getting any sites (outside of maybe the crypto&#x2F;grey-market) to adopt an auth system that doesn&#x27;t let them contact their users.  This is also I think a big failing of IndieAuth.<p>[1]:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sneak.berlin&#x2F;20201112&#x2F;your-computer-isnt-yours&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sneak.berlin&#x2F;20201112&#x2F;your-computer-isnt-yours&#x2F;</a>')
