Looking at [1] (an earlier post in the series), it looks like their workload is WordPress + VBulletin forums, and &quot;pets&quot; not &quot;cattle&quot; -- I wonder how much more they&#x27;d be able to get from separating their stateful and stateless layers more cleanly, and using some of the more powerful (and cheaper) AWS primitives for serving traffic that involves the latter. Why do they need such beefy instances for essentially serving content?<p>The truth is, it&#x27;s because the platforms they&#x27;re using (vBulletin + WP) exist, they&#x27;re very powerful and they get the job done. This leads me to believe that the operational UX for running these kinds of common applications (which compose most of the internet) on AWS without highly technical supervision is not great.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.servethehome.com&#x2F;falling-sky-part-3-evaluating-amazon-ec2-vps-dedicated-colocation-options&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.servethehome.com&#x2F;falling-sky-part-3-evaluating-a...</a>')
