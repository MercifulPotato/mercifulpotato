You are right there&#x27;s an increase in cost, although then the question becomes by how much.<p>There&#x27;s the option to make the same packaging but one having an empty space where another has that space filled with these items.<p>Even if they had to make two separate boxes, I&#x27;d like to think that given Apple&#x27;s volume, the additional costs in managing SKUs and packaging production wouldn&#x27;t have too big of a hit on overall production costs. Especially when offsetting the decrease in cost of goods provided. I however don&#x27;t know their numbers enough to knowledgeably argue this point. Though overall my point I think still stands regardless of the exact dollar amounts being discussed, I can&#x27;t see those amounts being too serious an inpact on overall costs.')
