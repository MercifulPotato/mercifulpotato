The various CA companies would have to include the general public in their public relations. We&#x27;d see CAs advertising for users to trust their roots.<p>The mozilla CA program for instance, requires potential CAs to go under audits. Is what you&#x27;re proposing (requiring CAs to hire an advertising&#x2F;PR department to convince users) really an improvement? Bad companies can lie in either case, but at least the former feels like less waste of resources. Furthermore, forcing the user to make this decision significantly increases the social engineering risk. If the average users have to add a few dozen CAs every time they get a new computer, it will be very easy to social engineer them to add one more. See for instance, social engineering users into downloading and running malware payloads by saying they need to &quot;update their flash player&quot; or &quot;install a codec&quot;.<p>&gt;If a CA ever screwed up, they would feel it.<p>Nope, the too big-to-fail problem will still exist. Facebook fucked up, yet we&#x27;re all still using it. Consumer boycotts rarely work. At least with browser vendors there&#x27;s a unified bargaining group for users. Good luck getting measures like distrusting symantec or limiting certificate validities to 398 days via grassroots action.')
