(The gloves and shoes&#x2F;socks are only 10secs hence his burns there).<p>He was out of the car within 18seconds.<p>I highly doubt if he had been stuck in or knocked out they would have been put the fire out in less than a few seconds more.  They only had one person with the right fire extinguishers there at the time.  The rest all add ones for smaller fires.<p>I don&#x27;t know how long it took them to put it out, but all the drivers could still see the fire driving back to the pits so probably a minute or so.<p>In short of the many things that save Romain sunday, being able to get himself out was probably the key one.')
