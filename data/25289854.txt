Apple sells their non Intel macs with Thunderbolt and there are some ryzen motherboards with thunderbolt support [1]. That being said, Thunderbolt is a lot less common on AMD boards probably because it is a lot more expensive then it would be on an Intel board. And Laptops so far have always received the budget treatment for ryzen chips (want a better screen? intel only, etc).<p>So I think lack of thunderbolt comes down to manufacturers not wanting to pay as much for their AMD R&amp;D and keep costs down with simple, budget motherboards.<p>Or, if you needed Thunderbolt 3, you could just wait until USB 4 is commonplace, which is basically Thunderbolt 3 + some more.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.asrock.com&#x2F;mb&#x2F;AMD&#x2F;X570%20Phantom%20Gaming-ITXTB3&#x2F;index.asp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.asrock.com&#x2F;mb&#x2F;AMD&#x2F;X570%20Phantom%20Gaming-ITXTB3...</a> (there are more, and even ATX boards, first one I could find).')
