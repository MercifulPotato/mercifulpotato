From a systems perspective &#x27;it doesn&#x27;t matter&#x27; what OS is running on your refrigerator.<p>But it&#x27;s moot: there is no inherent morality in &#x27;free software&#x27;. Software is just another good, with different means to distribute, one of which is FOSS, which is really great, but it&#x27;s only one piece of the puzzle.')
