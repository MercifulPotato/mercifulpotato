I doubt the situation is any different with any other language. You can also write it yourself from scratch. It&#x27;s not that hard to read the specs and make a working library in a day or two. I know this because I was recently looking into live video streaming so I learnt quite a bit about codecs, containers, protocols and so on.<p>Though, obviusly, I am not talking about transcoding one codec to another.')
