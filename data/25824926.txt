I can get by only using spectacles. My prescription isn&#x27;t really too bad. I can get acceptable correction in my good eye and still have passable 3D vision with correction in my bad eye. On that basis I&#x27;ve opted to stay w&#x2F; spectacles. (I can get markedly better correction for my bad eye with some more axial tilt. I tend to easily lose convergence with that additional tilt and get massive headaches, however.)<p>I tried soft contact lenses, prior to my keratoconus diagnosis, when I was much younger. The foreign body sensation simply would not go away. It was a massive distraction, to the point that I couldn&#x27;t really think about much else. Then I start fidgeting with my eyes and end up with swelling and tears. (Hard, balled-up fist eye rubbing from severe childhood allergies is probably the root cause of my keratoconus. The animal allergies are mostly gone now, and the hay fever is only a mild irritation. I can still, however, induce foreign body sensation and massive itchiness just by touching the skin around my eyes. There&#x27;s probably a bit of obsessive compulsive disorder going on there.)')
