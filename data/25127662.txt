Item(by='usr1106', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605638098, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25124429, text='&gt; I think of log, cherry-pick, stash &amp; blame &quot;quarterly use&quot; commands<p>At work we do care that our git history makes sense, is free of random nonsense, but contains only self-contained commits with reasonable documentation. So I call git log many times every day, I would not know how to do it without.<p>Cherry-pick probably depends how may maintenance branches you maintain. We don&#x27;t have many, so I don&#x27;t need it very often. I guess that could be very different for someone required to support long product life cycles. Sometimes when I need to split or unite development branches that need major reorganization I use it.<p>Blame I need soon when I try to understand others code. Sometimes even on my own. Also when you get bug reports form the field, to understand how long certain bugs existed. Not always to be able to blame the author, but just understanding how long a line has been unchanged.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t use stash a lot because I&#x27;m not afraid of committing anything to my working branch. I can always fix the code or the history later. Or  I make a temporary branch with a descriptive name than just stash. Some use stash more frequently I have noticed.')
