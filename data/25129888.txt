Something informal like a comment thread, I write a lot closer to the way I actually speak. Though...I probably swear a lot less.<p>Formal writing though is something totally different.<p>Whatever kind of writing you have to think of the audience and the tone you want to convey.<p>When I want to write conversationally, I try and emulate the way I talk, when I want to write in a different way, I change the tone of my writing.<p>This comment went more towards the formal, explanatory style in the end I suppose.<p>I&#x27;ve always found context matters the most for the tone of writing though.<p>Sometimes a natural, conversational style emulating the way you speak is good, sometimes not.<p>But it&#x27;s the same for speaking as well. Speaking in front of people or in some kind of formal situation is a totally different kind of speaking than chillin&#x27; with your friends at a party.<p>You don&#x27;t speak the same way in those two situations, it&#x27;s the same with writing. It always depends on the audience and the context.')
