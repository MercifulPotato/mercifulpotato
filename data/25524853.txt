Apple thrives on convenience - the overall experience.  You also completely disregarded the point he made that <i>for him</i> the value Apple brings now that they have discounted their fee to 15% for small developers far outweighs the 15% they charge.<p>Paying for convenience.  It&#x27;s the key to their success and also the thing that many  geeks seem to discount the most (just like you completely glossed over); hence the continual geek mystification of how Apple can be so successful.<p>I sincerely doubt he&#x27;s going to loose that many sales by being Mac app store exclusive.  These days for the vast majority of apps I&#x27;m interested in I&#x27;m more than willing to buy them from the Mac App store.  The only time I avoid the app store is if the sandboxing restrictions limit the app I want in some way; and there are very few apps that fall into that category - mostly utility or audio apps.  So I buy them outside the store - which is a PITA to track all the relevant bits (payments, updates, keys, etc.).  1Password helps significantly with the license&#x2F;payment tracking and thankfully more Mac developers are adding 1 click import of all your license details into password managers like 1Password - but it&#x27;s still more stuff to track that you don&#x27;t have to do when using the app store.')
