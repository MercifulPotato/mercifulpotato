Beyond that, I&#x27;ve experienced or read about many negative things.<p>a) I ran into an issue with changes in startup scripts in Debian which meant I could no longer hit ctrl-c to stop network initialization on a laptop when it couldn&#x27;t get a dhcp lease (it was either not connecting well to wifi , or trying to get a lease on a disconnected wired NIC; it was a while ago, I don&#x27;t quite remember)<p>b) there have been many secuirty issues in systemd and systemd-* utilities. Quite a few of which were repeats of issues existing daemons had been through, that shouldn&#x27;t have been repeated.<p>c) I have read that in default configurations a user&#x27;s programs will be terminated after the user logs out; that&#x27;s not acceptable for me, and a large change in default behavior<p>For me, systemd is yet another churny subsystem that drives aggrivation, so since I was already exposed to FreeBSD through work, it made sense to me to go in that direction at home, instead of sticking with Debian and accepting systemd.')
