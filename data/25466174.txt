It&#x27;s not really related to sqlite it&#x27;s just that expectations of file system behavior (locking, operations having completed when the system says they have, etc) are just flimsy fo many network file system implementations. All SQLite can do when it can&#x27;t map the file as it would normally is basically upload the new version of the file, and not write it in place anyway. That behavior is just as easy to create by the application developer.')
