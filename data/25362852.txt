The &quot;denominator&quot; is not the most important part. In other words, it&#x27;s not so much that his campaign won 1&#x2F;51 cases or if it was really 1&#x2F;10 cases. I only care about how many his campaign won (1).<p>And are you being honest, or are you being technically truthful while trying to deceive me? In other words, if a case was brought by Rudy Giuliani or Sidney Powell, but not some legal entity called &quot;The Trump Campaign&quot;, then it&#x27;s all the same to me.')
