Competition, and<p>2. Property rights.<p>This article does effectively slam Amazon for violating both of those capitalist tenets. But it doesn&#x27;t effectively say anything about capitalism; the whole problem with Amazon is that it&#x27;s violating <i>capitalist</i> tenets by being an anti-competitive monopoly, with enough power that it can steal intellectual property with impunity. If there was meaningful competition, and Amazon was forced to respect intellectual property rights... At least as presented by this article, there wouldn&#x27;t seem to be a problem.<p>Capitalism isn&#x27;t anti-government â€” it relies on governments so that businesses don&#x27;t have their property stolen.<p>Amazon&#x27;s business practices do indeed suck though, and seem (to me) to be illegal. The US government should step in forcefully.')
