We are contributing (and I think you&#x27;ll see us increase our contributions), but we are one of many contributors.<p>And, I should add, the real contributors are the engineers who do the code. AWS is committing credits&#x2F;cash&#x2F;other, but when it comes to the engineering, we are hiring committers so that they have time&#x2F;resources to continue to do so. But it&#x27;s those engineers (and engineers from other companies) who are doing the work.<p>I&#x27;m very, very grateful that Facebook and others have also been hiring Rust committers. It&#x27;s better as a community, not as one company&#x27;s programming language, even a great company&#x2F;org like Mozilla.<p>So, no, don&#x27;t worry about AWS taking over Rust. We couldn&#x27;t and don&#x27;t want to. Rust has done so, so much right as a <i>community</i>-led project: welcoming, inclusive, kind. We hope to contribute to that, not commandeer anything.')
