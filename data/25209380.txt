They mostly fail because the vast majority of women are not looking for a date.<p>Reapply whats happening to real life. Vast majority of women don&#x27;t engage men on online dating.

It&#x27;s about self-esteem or new choices. Say she&#x27;s in a relationship with a guy and it&#x27;s not exactly working out. Well she can join online dating and look at the options.<p>There&#x27;s a break point around age 25-30 though. That&#x27;s the age where women lose the driver seat in dating and men get the seat. Yet women don&#x27;t know it or something. This creates a divide that really confuses women, they&#x27;ve enjoyed their control. They still see tons of connections. Surely they are still driving? nope.<p>This is what leads to historic low marriage, fertility, and birth rate.<p>So bumble was created to reverse it. women have to make the first move. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bumble_(app)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bumble_(app)</a><p>Everyone knows how that&#x27;s going.
