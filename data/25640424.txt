Anything built right next to the ocean is temporary, and if you were dumb enough to put millions into a fancy house there, that should be taken as an expensive lesson<p>Everything is doomed in the long run. Most of those houses look like they could withstand the &lt;=1 meter sea level rise expected by 2100. That is generations of owners enjoying them and making profits. I imagine at some point the home value will start to decrease, but that could be gradual and a long way off.<p>The &quot;expensive lesson&quot; for the next several &quot;dumb&quot; owners could be that they owned a beautiful house and sold it for millions more than they bought it.')
