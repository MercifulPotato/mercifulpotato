Something like that is way easier to optimize than a finger tree which require type polymorphism to be even remotely workable.<p>Of course finger trees do allow for easier insertion and deletion, so they&#x27;re superior if you need that (although it&#x27;s surprising how much you can get away with by just rebuilding the whole structure when necessary).')
