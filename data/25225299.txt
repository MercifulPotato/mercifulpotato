Item(by='_peeley', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606447127, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25224931, text='Unfortunately the upcoming legislation doesn&#x27;t make psilocybin available to casually try out - it won&#x27;t be available for over-the-counter purchase like marijuana&#x2F;alcohol, but rather during therapy sessions with a therapist specifically licensed to administer psilocybin. Possession of small amounts of it have been &quot;decriminalized&quot; (you need to pay a fine or go to rehab, but you don&#x27;t go to jail) along with cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, etc. but it still isn&#x27;t fully legal to purchase and possess per se.')
