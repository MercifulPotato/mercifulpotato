Search for a story about how every JR station in Tokyo has its own special theme melody for when the train doors close?<p>Also, side story, I remember there was some road in Nevada or maybe near Sacramento (?) where GM (?) sponsored a melody road with the lines cut in the pavement.  The song was the Lone Ranger (William Tell).  However, maybe it was just me being a stickler, but I felt it was horribly out of tune when I heard the video.  I think they got the spacing of the lines wrong.')
