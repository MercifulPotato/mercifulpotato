It&#x27;s an unfalsifiable immeasurable diagnosis. I appreciate that most everyone means well, but academia is not some city on a hill with saints wielding an omniscient peer review process. Incredibly elementary statistical errors make it thru peer review process in even the highest impact journals somewhat frequently - so no I don&#x27;t have any faith that academics would criticize an unfalsifiable diagnosis even if they could. That&#x27;s really the basis of my opinion in the first place - if you can&#x27;t prove something is true then you can&#x27;t prove it&#x27;s false. That being the case, what&#x27;s the point of the label to begin with?')
