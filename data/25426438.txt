Item(by='ezrast', descendants=None, kids=[25427435, 25427442], score=None, time=1608000726, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25425994, text='ReasonML is merely an &quot;alternate syntax&quot; to OCaml, meaning it&#x27;s a separate language that parses to the same AST. Traditionally it&#x27;s been used along with Bucklescript, an OCaml-to-Javascript compiler developed by the same people, to do web work, but it&#x27;s well-supported in the native OCaml compiler ecosystem as well.<p>Now that ReScript has superseded ReasonML+Bucklescript, the only niche remaining for non-legacy ReasonML is native development work by folks who just don&#x27;t like the normal OCaml syntax, or want to target both runtimes with the same code.<p>Basically, the permutations are like this, with &quot;ReScript (backend)&quot; referring to the thing formerly known as BuckleScript:<p>OCaml&#x2F;native: What normal people think of when they hear &quot;OCaml&quot;.<p>ReasonML&#x2F;native: Uncommon, but supported for folks who&#x27;ve bought into the Reason syntax.<p>ReScript (frontend)&#x2F;native: Nobody does this since ReScript is strictly worse than ReasonML when targeting native. I don&#x27;t even know if it&#x27;s possible.<p>OCaml&#x2F;ReScript (backend): Should be possible, but nobody does this.<p>ReasonML&#x2F;ReScript (backend): Sort-of-deprecated in favor of the new syntax, but still supported, and most pre-existing projects are probably still using this.<p>ReScript (frontend)&#x2F;ReScript (backend): Now collectively known as &quot;ReScript&quot; and the focus of the team going forward. New web projects are expected to use this.')
