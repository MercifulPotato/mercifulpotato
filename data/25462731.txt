Also, there is a built in assumption that taxes have been paid. This is almost always not true, see step-up cost basis.<p>Estate taxes serve a purpose, though I would argue that a lack of will has caused them to not serve that intended purpose. That doesn&#x27;t mean that estate taxes aren&#x27;t the right tool, just that it has been sabotaged. That also doesn&#x27;t mean that they are the correct or best tool, but until we can see what the full force of estate taxes are, it is impossible to say.<p>The type of tax that you just described is called an inheritance tax, and I am perfectly ok with them as well.  Income is income, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether it comes from your employer, a rental company, self-employment, or otherwise.<p>Something I would be against is both an Estate and Inheritance tax being levied by the same entity. That doesn&#x27;t serve any real purpose.<p>I&#x27;d actually prefer an inheritance tax combined with a more progressive tax system over an estate tax.')
