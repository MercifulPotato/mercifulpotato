Firefox is in no way obsolete, so the comparison is entirely inapplicable.<p>Polyfills are available for most things but they’re <i>not</i> trivial, and they have a meaningful cost in two axes: developer effort, and performance. Things like CSS Flex, CSS Grid, SVG, and ECMAScript 6+ functionality can all be made to work in IE (with a few exceptions, like grid auto placement), but only by making things heavier, typically for <i>everyone</i>. Other things that are <i>really nice</i> to be able to depend on like CSS Custom Properties and more recent ECMAScript syntax (e.g. modules) either can’t be used outright, or require much more extensive working around which still restricts what you can do in all the other browsers.<p>Speaking as someone who has had to maintain IE11 support for a couple of things within the last few years, it seriously is a real drain that contributes more code, bugs (not just for the offending browser) and simple complexity than many realise.<p>IE is <i>not</i> receiving mainstream support. The effort <i>is</i> too much. You should either ignore it, or, if people are trying to get support on specific issues in it, strongly consider actively scuppering it.<p>IE is dead. Let it stay dead.')
