As for unambiguous human-readable names for regex features used, tools like this (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;regexr.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;regexr.com&#x2F;</a>) are available and very effective.<p>I might prefer Java Verbal Expressions over java.util.regex, but to me that&#x27;s more of a knock on Java and its lack of proper, first-class regexes than anything else.')
