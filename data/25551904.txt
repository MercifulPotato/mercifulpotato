After the &quot;golden age&quot; of the early 2000&#x27;s the player base organized and formed voobly, which had it&#x27;s own competitive scene and even game patches for the original game (a group of developers reverse engineered it and fixed stuff like pathfinding)<p>And I think the game is hands down played mostly by casual players. As of today there are over 40k people that have played at least a rated multiplayer match (how many more that never hit the multiplayer button?), and from those more than 75% have an ELO lower than 1200 which is on the lower end of the spectrum (best player of the world has 2500 ELO and one starts with 1000)<p>The game is still pretty challenging for newcomers, my 12 year old nephew loves watching me play, but whenever I offer him a chance to play he is &quot;scared&quot; because it looks to difficult, and says he prefers to just watch. When I was 12 (or even younger) I loved playing. Nowadays it seems games are designed intentionally to <i>not</i> being too difficult to play&#x2F;learn')
