In addition to better teacher interaction, there&#x27;s just way too much meta-learning that goes on at school - how to behave around other people, how to be away from your parents, how to form relationships, how to deal with authority, how to speak in front of people etc. I would feel like I&#x27;m socially crippling my children if I restricted them to online schooling.')
