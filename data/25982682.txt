It does not lead to a meaningful speedup.<p>How can it not provide a meaningful speedup? If I have 3- or 4-element vectors a,b, and c, with scalars u,v. I want to compute:<p>a = u<i>b + v</i>c;<p>These should be first class data types, passed by value, and that line of code should take 2 SIMD instructions at most. That should also not require a fancy vectorizing compiler to do the analysis to find the parallelism because the data types map directly to the ISA vector registers.<p>GPUs have this, the benefit should be very real.')
