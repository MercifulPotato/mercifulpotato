Tons of fun.  I used THREE.js for the 3-d effects.  It includes a (really inefficient!) solver.<p>There are radio buttons that select from among eight sub-problems that progress through levels of difficulty, culminating in the full cube.<p>The 3-d graphics aspects of the implementation were interesting - I wrote an alternative &quot;change camera position&quot; function that suits the symmetry of the Rubik&#x27;s cube better than the default one in THREE.js.  It was very interesting implementing mouse-based face selection and movement in the presence of a perspective projection.<p>I added a &quot;Record&#x2F;Rewind&quot; feature, which is in fact a big hint on the key idea for solving the cube:  commutators.  (If two top pieces are similarly wrong, fix one of them and record the fix.  Then, move the other one to where the first one was, and &quot;rewind&quot; your fix!)<p>Future ideas:\n 1 - add a scroll bar so that users can explore solutions one move at a time, and go backward and forward.<p>2 - add links to a text-based web page with hints and suggestions.<p>3 - add more intermediate sub-problems, with &quot;scramble&quot; options.  I.e., have a sub-problem with only the top face and one corner cubie out of place.  Have the &quot;scramble&quot; put that one cubie somewhere else, but leave the rest of the top level in place.<p>4 - HN:  any other fun thoughts, suggestions, or ideas?')
