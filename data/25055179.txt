We rate limit accounts when they post too many low-quality comments too quickly and&#x2F;or get involved in flamewars. I&#x27;ve looked through your recent history and it seems fine, so normally we&#x27;d remove that restriction from your accountâ€”but you just said it was helpful, so maybe I shouldn&#x27;t? You&#x27;re welcome to email hn@ycombinator.com if you want it removed.')
