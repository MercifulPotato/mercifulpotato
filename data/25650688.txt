Iran <i>temporarily</i> suspends certain nuclear activities (not all of them - for example, researching enrichment is fine). In return, Iran gets an economic boost and a permit to do whatever it wants, like supporting terrorists or mass murdering Syrians or trying to destroy Israel.<p>The latter part may surprise you, but it&#x27;s obvious when one thinks about it. What is the West allowed to do when Iran commits those things? It&#x27;s not economic sanctions, since removing sanctions and then placing them on again for different reasons would leave Iran no reason to comply with the nuclear deal. And of course, war is undesireable (the entire point of the deal was to avoid war). So Iran can do whatever, and if the West does anything serious, well, nukes.<p>Since the rest of the ME isn&#x27;t going to meekly submit to Iran, things get done in the ME way, which means mass amounts of refugees. Iran&#x27;s involvement in Syria directly led to Brexit (Leave would have lost without an immigration crisis on) and played a key role in Trump getting elected (is it a surprise the most anti-immigration R candidate won the primary with that background?). If this restarts under Biden, the result would probably be Trump mk2.<p>If you think that&#x27;s an acceptable result for <i>temporary</i> restrictions, well, that&#x27;s a very unique perspective.')
