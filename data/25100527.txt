The vast majority of the time it’s a lonely, thankless effort.<p>The problem is that after several years and thousands of people and businesses using the software every day, very few actually take part in improving the project. Or even saying &quot;thank you&quot; to be honest.<p>I’m happy to work on my project and fix issues, but please don’t abuse it. Being open source means that you can change the code if you want to, not to get a developer to work for you “out of love”.<p>That’s why for my most recent project [3], I have decided to no longer start with an “open core” product. Instead it&#x27;s a SaaS with a generous free tier. Price goes up the more value a customer gets out of it. Yes, people have already given me crap about not being open-source, but I do feel that so far it&#x27;s a more sustainable model.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;anthonynsimon&#x2F;bild" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;anthonynsimon&#x2F;bild</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;traduora.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;traduora.com&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;panelbear.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;panelbear.com&#x2F;</a>')
