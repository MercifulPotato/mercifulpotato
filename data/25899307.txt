Make the access to a banned thing too hard and then you get smuggling and contraband, make it easy and then its a joke. The right way to go about banning these things is to put them just outside the reach of ordinary person&#x27;s living wage.<p>The think should be accessible, but its supply reduced and price a little high so that people begin to measure the pay off between buying and the pleasure they get from it.<p>These things happen with Sugar too.
