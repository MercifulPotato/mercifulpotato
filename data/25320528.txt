Smoked for 30 years, switched to vaping, mixed my own e-liquid and tapered down to zero. Each time I dropped the nicotine level, I would get a headache for a couple days. But once it was down to zero, I picked up the vape a few times out of habit then noticed I was picking it up less and less. Like yours it sits on my desk and I might take a drag on it once or twice a week for the flavor, but there&#x27;s no <i>need</i> like there was when nicotine was part of the equation.')
