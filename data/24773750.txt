I&#x27;ve always found the mainstream understanding of neurotransmission to be annoyingly one-dimensional. E.g. AFAIK dopamine is very ubiquitous within the brain, and has as much to do with reward as it does with motor function, so the way we only equate it with reward seems so limited. Seems we&#x27;re slowly, but promisingly, moving beyond the age of &quot;poking&quot; the brain with random inhibitors and observing mere relations.')
