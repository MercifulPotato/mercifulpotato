They get paid for the clicks, not the impressions. Serving ad impressions costs money, the clicks make money. I don&#x27;t quite follow your line of reasoning here.<p>&gt;<i>Transparency shouldn&#x27;t matter for people bidding for conversions</i><p>Why wouldn&#x27;t it? How do we know the bidding process is fair and the clicks we&#x27;re paying for are valid? We don&#x27;t and that&#x27;s the problem. We wouldn&#x27;t tolerate this type of behavior from companies in other industries. We need to quit giving tech companies a free pass and start holding them accountable.<p>&gt;<i>If anything fraud (really misclicks for FB and Google search since there is no fraud incentive) is also bad for them as well as it provides false signal of intent to their algorithms.</i><p>It only has to be good enough to convince people to keep using it. There&#x27;s no financial incentive to eliminate fraud completely, or even try, without regulation.')
