I&#x27;ve seen similar things the other way around.  Someone didn&#x27;t use Facebook.  People didn&#x27;t switch; they got left out and forgotten.<p>Another one was Google Groups (a type of mailing list).  Someone didn&#x27;t want to use a Google account.  They couldn&#x27;t figure out how to subscribe.  Was the group willing to switch to another provider?  No of course not.  In the end an admin manually subscribed the person with their non-Google address, but if that hadn&#x27;t been possible, the group would have let them go rather than switch service.<p>I think it depends on how much the group wants to accommodate everyone who wants to be in it, and what the mix of people is.  Also whether it depends on additional tools such as Facebook Events.<p>If it&#x27;s a fun social group that you&#x27;re interested in joining, where the people don&#x27;t particularly care who is in it, they&#x27;re probably not going to change what they do.  That&#x27;s fairly obvious when the group aren&#x27;t your friends (yet).  Less obviously, I&#x27;ve seen it happens among friends too, where someone not on Facebook gradually gets left out and forgotten from things like party invitations.<p>&gt; Over the last half-year of online academic events, I&#x27;ve seen at least half a dozen different online services used (Zoom, Zulip, Gather.town, google hangouts, Cisco Webex and probably a bunch I don&#x27;t remember). Most of us users don&#x27;t particularly like to, but can (without serious tears) learn a new tool when it comes up and turns out to be more suited.<p>I&#x27;ve seen the same thing this summer.  (Some of those tools have awful data protection issues and permissions to do things they shouldn&#x27;t on your computer, yet I&#x27;ve installed and used them anyway.  When it&#x27;s a job interview you don&#x27;t really have a choice.)<p>The above list shows us Facebook doesn&#x27;t have a monopoly.  But I don&#x27;t count them as great examples of freely leaving behind walled gardens either.  It&#x27;s more like, there are more walled gardens.  <i>You</i> don&#x27;t get a choice which tool to use.  You must use whatever tool the group has chosen before you join it, and they are very unlikely to change tool for a new joiner.<p>&gt; As it comes to reach, don&#x27;t forget that email has probably the greatest reach of any service around.<p>Yes and no.  Everyone uses email, but many only use it inside Gmail, which is a bit of a mess if you&#x27;re subscribed to a bunch of mailing lists, and trying to keep track of events you&#x27;ve been invited to.')
