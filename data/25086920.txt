Item(by='kllrnohj', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605298519, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25086717, text='&gt; the fact that these devices now run close to current gen discrete GPUs is a big jump.<p>The 1050 Ti (4 years old) has about the same performance as a GTX 680. A card from 2012.<p>This comparison makes absolutely no sense. You&#x27;d want to compare the M1 against either the current generation integrated, such as the Vega 8 or 11 in the Ryzen 4xxx mobile CPUs or the Intel Xe-LP in the current tiger lake CPUs, or you&#x27;d want to compare it against last gen integrated.<p>Comparing it against a discreet card from 4 years ago with the performance of a card from 8 years ago is just... weird?')
