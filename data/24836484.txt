From my perspective it&#x27;s the inverse.<p>Quite a lot of us are, and have been for years, disagreeing with the concepts of trademark, patents, and legally enshrined IP.<p>This is nothing new. If anything the reason you see it increasing might be that over the years there have been more and more &quot;outsiders&quot; (not traditional US businessmen or entrepreneurs) in the startup scene than before.<p>Regardless of what you think of the above, as many others have pointed out, the particular way they played this (inaction for years, and then suddenly &quot;do all of these huge changes within two weeks or we&#x27;ll sue you out of business&quot;) is not easy to interpret charitably on them.<p>Just because you can, doesn&#x27;t mean you should. Either way, good on them for recognizing the mistake and making amends. Might not have happened without all the backlash.')
