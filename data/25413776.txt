But the past year has shown me that private car ownership has massive upsides. Public transit is wonderful in many ways, and I have used it as much as possible for a long time, but during the pandemic it has been very nice to have my own car. I would never be willing to go without one.<p>Apparently a lot of other people feel the same way, because used car prices have been unusually high this past year.<p>At the moment I would rather have a car commute than a bus or train commute, and that won&#x27;t change until the pandemic is over.<p>Don&#x27;t tell me to ride a bike to work -- this isn&#x27;t the 1800s. We are accustomed to living miles away from work, and modern public transit was built with that assumption -- if we all lived within a mile of work we would just walk. Cities are not spread out merely because of cars. Cities are spread out because people want space, and <i>all</i> modern transit infrastructure, including streetcars 100 years ago, was built to accommodate the fact that people were <i>already</i> living miles away from work.')
