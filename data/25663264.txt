The reality is, if you allow me to make a comparison, in the UK they had a similar situation in the Labor party with a leader chosen by the membership that was hated by &quot;The Party&quot;. &quot;The Party&quot; went and told the leader to stuff it and eventually got rid of him. In the meantime they&#x27;re on year 10 or 11 of continuous Tory rule, with at least another 3 ahead.<p>It&#x27;s really nice for left wing types to talk about Republicans doing the right thing and going to all out war with Trump for the health of the democracy, I want him gone too. But the Realpolitik for Republicans on that one is a bunch of self sacrifice while the Democrats enjoy their endless summer. I don&#x27;t really blame them for taking the path they did, even though I abjectly hate it.')
