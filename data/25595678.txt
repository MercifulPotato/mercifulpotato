If you what is happening in our country, the new constitution mandates gender equality. So, what is happening is this, tribes, such as mine, which do not favor men over women, have many highly educated women. Therefore, when government jobs are being distributed, I am at disadvantage. Men from other tribes are hired but to comply with gender equality, women from our tribes are hired to our exclusion. So, people like me have lost opportunities. This gender thing is kinda discriminatory. We need to think about it more carefully.')
