I managed to do it though and it basically looks like every other libGDX project. I can even create a single JAR file that works! I am pretty happy about that. Everything is up to date, and I am converting the codebase from Java to Kotlin. Still a long way to go, but we (my partner and I) will get there. :)<p>By the way: I also use `googleJavaFormat` and `ktlint` to format both Java and Kotlin files. I also pack textures before running the game.<p>In any case, my old hardware may be at fault here, or the fact that I also run multiple things in the background, or that I run a couple of Gradle tasks, or a combination of these things.')
