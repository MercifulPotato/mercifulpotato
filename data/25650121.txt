We can argue details but that gives us a pretty tight range.<p>How much is the harm, in dollars, of being grossly disfigured?<p>There is definitely harm there. Is it the loss of earnings of the prostitute assuming she would make less money? That&#x27;s some of it - the amount is at least that much. Yet presumably she also has less quality of life too - and how much is that worth? Is the basis for the quality of life of a prostitute less or more than a CEO? What if the prostitute really enjoys life and has a rewarding life, but the CEO is very drab and dislikes living?<p>That it&#x27;s hard to put monetary figures on a harm isn&#x27;t some failure in our understanding - it&#x27;s because we comprehend money is not a universal salve. You can fix a business with cash, you can&#x27;t fix a human life with it.')
