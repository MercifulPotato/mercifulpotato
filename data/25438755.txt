You are ceding control of your data for sure, but this isn&#x27;t quite the same as running a proprietary piece of software on your machine which you have no idea what it&#x27;s doing.<p>Ceding control of data is also worrisome I agree, but giving control of your data to a custodian you trust in exchange for said custodian promising its careful curation is a trade-off that most people would find acceptable.
