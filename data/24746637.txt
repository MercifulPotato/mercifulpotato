Is the equipment being sold at a massive discount to market, it seems so, but to what degree? Why does the Pentagon do it then,  does it boost military funding? Is this program effectively a mechanism to get updated equipment into the military? Are there line items on budget reports that say “we donated $1mm to local law enforcement so we need to be made whole”?')
