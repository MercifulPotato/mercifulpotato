Input? Applications job.<p>Applications don&#x27;t do more work to handle input on Wayland as opposed to e.g. X11. It&#x27;s still event-based, and the compositor feeds input events to applications that can process them as normal. Keyboard, mouse and touch input are part of the core Wayland protocol, and tablet input is part of an extension that all major compositors fully support.<p>&gt; Window decorations? Compositors job.<p>Kind of, it&#x27;s the job of the application (client-side decorations) <i>or</i> compositor (server-side decorations). The compositor can choose which to use. CSDs give more custom look-and-feels to applications that have them (think Firefox or Chrome); SSDs provide consistent looks across all apps. GNOME only supports CSDs, but is an exception in that regard.<p>&gt; Clipboard? Maybe compositor or toolkit.<p>Both: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emersion.fr&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;wayland-clipboard-drag-and-drop&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emersion.fr&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;wayland-clipboard-drag-and-dro...</a><p>Clipboards are (implementation-complexity-wise) scary in X11 as well.')
