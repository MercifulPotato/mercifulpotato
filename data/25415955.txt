If you or your children starve you will pay anything for food. Society&#x27;s stability depend of the supply and price of food.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean your country has to grow it.\nA much better solution for individual food security is food stamps.<p>If your country has problems with a temporary lack of food one of the easiest things to do is to import more and if nesacery subsidize it. Famines tend to come from broken economic and political systems like imperial UK in Ireland and communist USSR, they both refused to import more food during a famine and in fact exported a lot food')
