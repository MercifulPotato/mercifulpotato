Richard Feynman put it this way: science can only answer questions of the form &quot;If I do this, what will happen?&quot; Science cannot answer questions of the form &quot;Do I want that to happen?&quot;<p><i>&gt; hence falling into the “superstition and tradition” bucket she derides</i><p>I don&#x27;t think the author is using &quot;superstition and tradition&quot; to refer to ethical and moral beliefs. I think she&#x27;s using it to refer to erroneous <i>factual</i> beliefs, or methods of addressing problems that don&#x27;t work. For example, for millennia people tried to prevent disease using various superstitious rituals, none of which worked. Science discovered vaccination, which did. Both views <i>agreed</i> that preventing disease was a good thing; there was no ethical or moral difference there. The difference was between superstitious methods which didn&#x27;t work, and scientific methods which did.')
