The only real assumption is that &quot;there exists something as opposed to nothing&quot;, i.e. that there are some phenomena independent of the subject doing science.\nIt is a tenable position to argue that the theory of general relativity (or quantum mechanics, or anything else) is not what the world is, but merely a model of the world, that we accept because it&#x27;s useful and provides correct (or &quot;correct enough&quot;) predictions. \nRegardless of whether one agrees or not with that perspective, it&#x27;s entirely possible to discuss a scientific theory with no consideration of its ontological status; one may at the same time disagree with the interpretation and agree with the mathematical account.\nIt doesn&#x27;t seem to me like any kind of &#x27;naturalistic&#x27; assumption is required for science to work.')
