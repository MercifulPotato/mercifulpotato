The challenge with using the criminal statues related to &quot;domestic terrorism&quot; (and even &quot;foreign terrorism&quot;) has to do with intent. Because there is a legal element requiring behavior that is in furtherance of &quot;ideological goals&quot;, there is a pretty high bar to meet from a legal perspective.<p>This individual&#x27;s criminal defense could easily argue the individual had no stated ideological goal they were promoting (unless there is specific evidence to suggest otherwise, such as leaving a manifesto explaining rationale). It&#x27;s much easier to demonstrate probable cause and&#x2F;or prosecute via other criminal statues.')
