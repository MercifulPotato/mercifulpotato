What if you become the minority and the majority wants your speech limited?<p>The only reason why we have things like gay rights, women&#x27;s rights, civil rights, etc, is exactly because of free speech. The speech at that time were the minority but were protected by the Constitution.<p>If we don&#x27;t respect the rights of those that we disagree with, when (not if) they come into power, they will use those same rights to quash our free speech. And remember that almost half of the US voted for Trump who is demonstrably the worst president in US history. If there is a smarter, more palatable right-wing candidate (ex. Tom Cotton, etc), we really could see a Republican president in office by 2024. And they would use that hammer that the left have been trying to use to quash that free speech.<p>We have the Constitution and Free Speech for a reason. And it has worked for centuries now.')
