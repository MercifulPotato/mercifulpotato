At the end, Apple hired them directly.<p>The employees were literally put up to sale. Apple didn’t just wake up one morning and hire the hottest new techies, they were up for grabs, and this was clearly an at-will agreement. If the employees were working directly on stuff that competed with Hook, the noncompete seems to make sense. However, that’s a case against the employees, and not necessarily Apple. Not sure if this is really poaching.')
