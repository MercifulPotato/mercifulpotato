The music onboarding process typically starts with organizing metadata with Musicbrainz Picard then import the collection into Funkwhale&#x27;s DB via a cli admin tool. I have funkwhale hosted at home attached to my own music collection. There is an unofficial mobile client called Otter that makes listening to music on Android very pleasent. Admin overhead aside, this program has become a part of my daily life and I greatly appreciate the developers efforts.')
