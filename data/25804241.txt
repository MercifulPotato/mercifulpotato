What does it explain? What does it downplay?<p>I&#x27;m not currently seeing much value in it. I&#x27;ll explain why. Saying &#x27;just a method of solving a problem&#x27; comes across as reductive without being useful.<p>Imagine if someone said &#x27;flying is just a means of movement&#x27; in the context of studying a hummingbird&#x27;s agility. It says more about the speaker than the subject. It suggests the person is uninterested or focused on other things.<p>So with regards to your statement, it suggests you don&#x27;t care and&#x2F;or don&#x27;t appreciate what makes learning difficult.<p>I&#x27;m talking about learning theory. About generalization given data. This is certainly not easy. Yes, it can be encoded in an algorithm, but that does not make it less interesting.')
