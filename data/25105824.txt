In fact if you like you can just use the following mapping: 0-&gt;1, {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}-&gt;0. Also, for the starting representations you simply replace all expansions with an infinite tail of &quot;9999...&quot;, as for every such representation there exists a representation that does not end in &quot;9999...&quot;. This makes the decimal expansions unique.<p>All the name-able reals are obviously countable, this has a deep connection with the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;L%C3%B6wenheim%E2%80%93Skolem_theorem" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;L%C3%B6wenheim%E2%80%93Skolem_...</a>')
