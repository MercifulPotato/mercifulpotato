Also, it&#x27;s a bit muddy. I said that government has nothing to do with censorship, but I contradict myself.<p>Although censorship in the US is some kind of internal struggle between parties that is hard to understand for an outsider like me, but promotion of rusophobia in social networks and YouTube is probably endorsed by US government.
