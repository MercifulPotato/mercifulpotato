The imperfection comes from the way there is inevitably some mapping of things to other things by name. I can ask a load balancer whether clients of a service are being sent to a named capacity or not (i.e. is the thing I want to remove &quot;drained&quot;) but that doesn&#x27;t rule out the possibility that another service maps a different name to the same backend and I forgot to integrate that name with my automation. Also impossible to rule out that a client exists which bypasses or ignores the advice of the load balancer. Having visibility into caller identity helps a lot with this kind of problem but outside of Google there is a scary word called &quot;cardinality&quot; which prevents people from monitoring the whole caller√óserver space.')
