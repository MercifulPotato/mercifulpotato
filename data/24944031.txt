I get the focus&#x2F;creativity aspect for sure!<p>1. Medications have come a long way, and there&#x27;s more than just Ritalin (or Adderall) as options. I get the grey scale concept, but I don&#x27;t think it has to be that way.  There are varying doses and varying medications, and you might find something that is almost all upside with (possibly) no downside.<p>2. You might perceive yourself to be managing &#x2F; coping fine (and you might be, I don&#x27;t mean that in any disrespectful way!) but there could be vast undiscovered focus abilities you could access.  For me personally, the difference on and off medication is VAST.<p>3. You might not always have that manager&#x2F;environment. Or (what happened for me) someday you might (already) have a family, and fewer options for those bursts of focus. I used to work until 3am when I was on a roll, but now I can&#x27;t.<p>4. The distraction &#x2F; multiple threads stuff can have other impacts on your own self-image. Depends on how well it&#x27;s managed I guess, in the world and inside your head.<p>Good luck! :)')
