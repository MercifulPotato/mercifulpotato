Sure, it costs my company $13k&#x2F;year for the license but when you have a jet engine hoisted up for testing and its costing the company thousands of dollars of loss time, yep, commercial software or open-source software with solid support is a must.<p>Proprietary software sometimes is quite good if not the best in class. There is no need to pick up pitch forks and large brushes to pain everything red. If nothing else, it shows how misguided, immature and closed-minded some of the GNU folks are. Most of the open source contributors are nice though, and I don&#x27;t wish to ironically generalize everyone.')
