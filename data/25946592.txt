Related, money can&#x27;t be printed at-will.<p>Large banks and corporations can&#x27;t outright prevent transactions from happening.<p>The money can have value as a universal reserve currency without any specific political ties.<p>Removing big banks from the equation takes their hands at least partway off the politicians.<p>Seems like at least a decent upgrade to me.')
