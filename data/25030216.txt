Can you expand on this more? Currently we don&#x27;t have paper trails. We don&#x27;t have good ways to verify that our vote was counted and that it has the correct value to it. An immutable data structure helps solve this, especially if it is auditable.<p>I&#x27;m all for paper trails, and I think they are necessary, but our current system isn&#x27;t exactly transparent either. Logistically this is impractical. We&#x27;ve always relied on a subset of people to tell us it is trustworthy. I.e. the volunteers that count. If you can have that and do cryptographic arithmetic so that anyone with a computer can verify the results, that&#x27;s more transparent, not less.<p>I mean I think there&#x27;s this idea that people counting physical ballots in a rushed and hectic environment has high accuracy. That sounds like a naive assumption to me. But what is that error? 0.5%? 1%? For the most party elections are not won by that margin and when they are a recount is issued (and low and behold, numbers change slightly. Proving that the counting is imperfect but good enough).')
