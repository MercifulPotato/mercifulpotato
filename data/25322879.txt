Item(by='volongoto', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607254904, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25322399, text='&gt; That is a funny thing about young people. A lot of the time they want to find a silver bullet in area that they are interested in. It is not bad of course because maybe they can.<p>I agree with this; once upon a time, I used to be one of those young people. And I think, this unsubstantiated confidence is a good thing for young people. That was an important source of motivation for me when I was jumping into waters that were way deeper than I envisioned. If I knew &quot;better&quot; I would never do that. But I&#x27;m glad I did it. I did not discover a new continent, no, but if I did not have that courage (the courage coming from &quot;ignorance&quot;, if you will) I would not have learned what I have learned along the way. I am no longer that courageous young man, but I&#x27;m mostly happy he did what he did.')
