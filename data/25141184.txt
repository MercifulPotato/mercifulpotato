If one has acquired more wealth then one has more options available and more decisions to make, but still doesn&#x27;t get any direct say in how other people use <i>their</i> property, no matter how rich or poor they may be. This is far more egalitarian and in keeping with the ideals espoused by most democracies than the idea that every person&#x27;s freedoms and property are subject to a glorified opinion poll.')
