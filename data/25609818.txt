So most of the numbers do not even make sense.<p>Transmission within a masked &amp; lockdown population is still large. Does not even seem to change... Because there is no asymptomatic transmission. We need quarantine instead of sick people.  \nMasks have health side-effects, because 99% of people do not follow the OSHO safety standards.<p>The transmission within a household between partners has an average of 27%. Another extremely weird number. \nDid the tests give false positives? Is the disease misidentified?  \nOr did the others already have T-cell herd-immunity?<p>So the real question is: What is causing transmission?<p>And note the R does not show that at all, and focusing on that gives us the wrong solutions.<p>There may be other factors that create a high transmission. Some doctors listed an extreme long survival time of the virus (up to 16 days under good conditions). So maybe it transmits mainly via surfaces and not via the air.<p>That might explain why it can spread within a population under a military lockdown.\nBut that latter might also be explained with the false positives from a PCR test (or similar test). Or the natural immunity of most people creating partial herd-immunity within the population.')
