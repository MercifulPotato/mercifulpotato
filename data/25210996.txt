I’ve worked at&#x2F;with&#x2F;for many companies as both an employee and a consultant where the top priority wasn’t to have fewer security incidents, but to have fewer security incidents <i>that would require disclosure</i>.<p>Publicly disclosing an incident to a customer is embarrassing and potentially damaging but almost equally as damaging is telling other teams you had an incident. Now anything that goes wrong is your fault by default because “it’s probably related to that incident” and any new security policies are blamed on the other team: “we wouldn’t have to do that if Ops didn’t mess up last month”.<p>The answer to “is this service suffering an outage” is seriously complex and hard to determine. The answer to “is this a security incident” is 10x harder and 100x more political because the industry is still just so wildly immature.')
