Not in desperate times yet but trying to look hard to find something so I don&#x27;t reach desperate.<p>My best opportunities so far have come via LinkedIn recruiters, believe it or not. \nOne recruiter got me interviews with two companies before the end of December. I had a code challenge and second interview with one of them, so pretty far in the interview process.<p>Otherwise looking at job boards like Indeed and LinkedIn listings. Some good opportunities there but I feel like applying is almost a waste of time. I almost never hear back. LinkedIn has a feature where it emails you if your application was even looked at, and I rarely get those emails. I got one outright rejection but otherwise just ignored.<p>I&#x27;ve also been targetting companies in related work to my previous experience or companies I would be interested in working for but none seem to be hiring.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any single silver bullet answer to job hunting, just have to try every avenue you can to dig up opportunities.<p>I wish I was better at networking.')
