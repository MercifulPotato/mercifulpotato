Haven’t used Windows for years. Was purely Linux and FreeBSD for several years too.<p>Back when I left Windows, Windows 7 had just come out, and I switched over to Linux and FreeBSD because I learned about those at the university and I came to appreciate open source software.<p>Then came smart phones and I heard that Android ran Linux. So I was like wow finally a computer in my pocket where I can do everything I can on my laptop!<p>But I soon learned that this was not the case.<p>Mobile platforms are fundamentally different, and the terminal is not relevant for most things I want to do with a phone.<p>I want to record videos, watch videos, talk to people, read stuff. And I still have an SSH client on my iPhone for when I need to remote into my server to do stuff on it while on the go.<p>And iPhone is giving me the best experience, with the addition of being really tight on the security. And for my phone this is what I want.<p>I am staying with Apple until they take it too far. Then I will leave them in a heartbeat. But for all the years I have been using iOS, everything Apple has been doing has been a betterment of the experience.<p>The only one thing really that bothered me was I had a magazine subscription and reading those magazines is in theory only possible on iOS. Even though actually it’s just an app for reading PDF files. And I didn’t have access to the PDF files directly. But that was a minor thing anyway, and recently I jailbroke an old iOS device that I have had laying in a drawer that was running an old iOS version and I was actually able to extract PDF files from the app.<p>But that subscription or two that I had, those were an exception anyway. Mostly when I read something on the phone I read on the web. And all of the eBooks that I have ever bought I have bought on the computer and not locked down in an app.')
