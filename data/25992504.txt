It is <i>extremely</i> crucial to discuss shortcomings and criticize tools otherwise how are we going to improve if we all roll along singing the tunes of each other and never questioning anything?<p>This kind of attitude and softness towards criticism - &quot;All tools are great&quot; is not how we need to operate.
