I&#x27;m saying that I disagree with social media incentivizing the spread of lies and controversy. I&#x27;m not discussing what is a lie and what is not, I am just saying that by the nature of social media the content that gets more visibility is the content that generates more engagement, not necessarily the content that is more true or has more consensus.<p>In other words, do I think you should be able to say that &quot;the earth is flat&quot;? Yes. Do I think that social media should give more visibility to content that says &quot;the earth is flat&quot; than to content that says &quot;well it is not flat&quot; just because the first generates more engagement? No. It&#x27;s not the speech that&#x27;s harmful, is the selective amplification that social media does.')
