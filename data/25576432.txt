I&#x27;m pretty much completely migrated to Firefox&#x2F;DDG for most browser stuff, except for maps. I still use Google Maps on my phone because there&#x27;s so damn much information packed in there. Including ways to search for companies open til 11pm. I can instantly see which restaurants are doing curbside. It&#x27;s also on my phone (although I do plan on switching to iOS next year when my android gets a bit too old). We&#x27;ll see how my maps changes with that.')
