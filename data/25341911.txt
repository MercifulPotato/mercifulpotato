Item(by='fredophile', descendants=None, kids=[25345243], score=None, time=1607402546, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25341014, text='If the expectation is that the cops will come in with weapons drawn any time they execute a warrant then we have to realize that this will result in people accidentally being killed. Does the standard for evidence for obtaining a search warrant justify the increased risk of someone innocent dying?<p>Some people would argue that not having guns drawn in this type of case would result in more police deaths. I agree but don&#x27;t view this as a deal breaker. How many civilians will die with guns drawn vs how many police officers die without?  Should we count civilian and police lives the same in this situation? Police officers are compensated for the risks they take and have protective gear like body armour to reduce this risk. In the linked video I don&#x27;t see the police using any head covering other than ball caps. If they thought there was a risk why didn&#x27;t they put on helmets? I&#x27;m sure the Tallahassee police have access to that kind of PPE. The fact that they chose not to wear full PPE suggests to me that they didn&#x27;t believe there was a substantial threat in the home.')
