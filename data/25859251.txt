Even with the ability to synthesize full DNA molecules, we haven&#x27;t yet figured out how to make a living cell from scratch. If our best synthetic biologists still find it impossible to assemble a viable cell while having all the tools to do so in theory, I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to be likely to happen by accident, barring some quantum weirdness that makes the starseeder hypothesis seem positively banal.<p>As to deliberateness... I see the difference between starseeder and panspermia hypotheses that in the former; life happened once in a gravity well, became multicellular, figured out a means to escape the gravity well, and then spread throughout the galaxy while in the latter; life happened once in space, drifted a while, got stuck in a gravity well and then figured out how to be multicellular.<p>I suppose - particularly given the vastness of the places with no gravity wells compared to places with gravity wells - that it&#x27;s my own gravity-well bias that makes me reach for &#x27;starseeder&#x27; hypotheses before panspermia ones. But I think whether life was multicellular before or after the bulk of the interstellar spreading, the instinct of life to spread would be the motive force whatever its problem solving capabilities.')
