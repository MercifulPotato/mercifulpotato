There are no natural obstacles, and plenty of spaces with forest crossing the border. No-one but the military comes close to having enough man-power to enforce that border.<p>Sure, with actual army deployment we could get somewhere (it seems we have about 20 soldiers per kilometer of border). But the massive difference in effort between &quot;police airports and the coast with radar&quot; and &quot;Mobilize the army&quot; is huge.')
