If you&#x27;re standing watch and someone stands next to you and clicks a photo, is there anything you can and should do? Should you, as the officer, wrestle him to the ground, knowing there&#x27;s a riotous mob right behind him?<p>But even if it&#x27;s the case that the officer enthusiastically posed for the photo, it&#x27;s probably best not to understand police like a monolithic entity operating perfect information, but rather as a group of heterogeneous actors working in a fog that limits their awareness. Otherwise, if you extend the &quot;one officer did X therefore the motives of all officers are established&quot; logic you quickly get really stupid contradictions. Over the summer, I saw several photos of officers kneeling in solidarity with BLM protesters -- I guess that means all police everywhere support the aims of the BLM movement now?<p>Probably not, because police aren&#x27;t a monolith, and subsequent police actions contradict that solidarity. Likewise, police teargassing, manhandling, and shooting these other protesters also paints a more complex landscape than &quot;one officer took a selfie, therefore they&#x27;re all collaborating.&quot;')
