Brad asked about the fellow travelers occupation and discovered he was a computer programmer. Lifewise, Brad was asked about his life&#x27;s work and stated I am also a computer programmer. &quot;What do you do?&quot; Brad was asked. I wrote Objective-C. Astonished, the gentlerman said, &quot;No, Brad Cox wrote that&quot;. &quot;Hi, I am Brad Cox&quot;, was the response and the introduction.<p>Wonderful story. I wish his family all the best.<p>I love Objective-C and consider it a beautiful language. Back in the day I re-discovered my love for programming when I started to learn this language. This was when I was still in the Java world.<p>As a side project I tried to build a drone (unmanned navel vehicle) powered by objective-c. I have abandoned the effort but posted the code on GitHub - it was a joy to work with the language and the funnest side project I’ve worked with.<p>These days I work with python and golang for job&#x2F;hobby but I always am grateful to have spent time with objective-c. Reflecting back if I haven’t spent time with this language, today I would of not been a programmer.<p>Thank you Brad Cox for your work and positive influence.')
