Item(by='maybeOneDay', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605095078, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25057096, text='The &quot;mass&quot; of code is an API controller, not just a way to get settings. It&#x27;s an example of config use in real code. There are roughly 4 lines of code to get two variables out of the settings.json. This scales quite nicely - if we needed 8 different variables from settings then it would be 10 lines of code for 8 variables.<p>Sure, it could be done in one line. My point wasn&#x27;t to say that this is the most terse environmental variable code possible. My point was to say that it&#x27;s disingenuous to say &quot;look at the sheer length of that answer&quot; as a way to state that the way to get env variables is hugely bloated. It&#x27;s literally one ctor param and one private variable. If you don&#x27;t like that for stylistic reasons, that&#x27;s fine. I understand the argument saying &quot;there should just be a static class with a readonly prop per variable&quot;, I just don&#x27;t think that this particular code is in real terms actually any worse.')
