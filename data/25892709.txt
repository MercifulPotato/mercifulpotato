I didn&#x27;t know about that one, but they do also have a 100mm 2:1 for $450, which is surprisingly affordable - less new than I paid for my used 105.<p>Granted I&#x27;ll still (eventually...) go with a TC-20 E III since it&#x27;s only 10% more and I can also use it with my birding lens, but absent that constraint, I&#x27;d definitely be thinking hard about that Laowa 100mm.')
