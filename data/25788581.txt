I used to just soak up whatever new thing I found interesting, but these days I don&#x27;t have time to do this and so I have to make sure that every new thing I do learn &quot;pays rent&quot;. It has to not just be immediately useful (unless there&#x27;s no other way to solve the problem with my existing toolkit) but also to generate value in an ongoing manner for it to be worth the time investment.')
