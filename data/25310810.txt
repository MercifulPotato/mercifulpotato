I still appreciate the speed and ease of typing them, and like many other aspects of the CLI, it&#x27;s optimized for users who know it well and use it heavily. Once you&#x27;re familiar with the names, it&#x27;s not challenging to remove that mv = move, wc = wordcount, etc. Terminals of the era also still actually printed mechanically, so keeping command length short was a major ergonomic win for round trip speed.<p>As a sibling comment mentions, these commands were (are) commonly composed into scripts. As the name implies, however, a script is just a playbook for a series of commands to run. Given the terminals of the era, I&#x27;m sure short commands&#x2F;variables&#x2F;etc. were appreciated in scripts as well, but it seems to me that the primary motivation for optimizing input speed would be the use of these commands in an interactive environment.<p>A few examples of these core short program names: ls, cat, cp, rm, wc, uniq, cmp, diff, od, dd, tail, tr, etc.')
