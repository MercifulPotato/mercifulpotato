But when copying files to docker and building the image, you will have to take care that files are not written with root ownership in any stage of the build, which would make them inaccessible to the application running as non root.<p>That&#x27;s not the case, either. And root inside the container != root outside the container. A completely new user:group namespace is created inside the container. This is, in very large part, what Linux namespaces are for.<p>Further, you can certainly have a root-owned file accessible to non-root users, via chmod bits.<p>There are only a handful of excuses, ever, to run a privileged container. If you&#x27;re not 100% sure, then it is not one of those excuses.')
