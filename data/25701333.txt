I can empathize with this, but I also understand that is just because there are other stupid people around carrying guns. There would not be a problem if nobody around had a gun.<p>In countries like that there are outlets for people to be able to shoot guns. In Poland you can go to a shooting range and you can also get a permit for hunting or sport rifle. In either case the use of the gun is restricted so that general population doesn&#x27;t have to worry about being around people with guns.<p>I never felt a need to have a gun, ever. You don&#x27;t have to worry about stupid entitled people either, they are harmless.')
