I think not.  Tax evasion is legally tax avoidance that has been proven to be illegal.  What about tax avoidance that hasn&#x27;t yet been proven so, or maybe the charge has been thrown out on a technicality, or maybe it rests on exploiting a loop-hole? To me, that might not be tax evasion legally, but surely it&#x27;s tax evasion in spirit.  And since we&#x27;re not in the middle of some courtroom proceedings, in spirit is how we should understand these words.')
