I&#x27;m not sure what else to say.<p>We can also talk the fact John Oliver supports Jim Crow laws. Racially dividing American Blacks and American Latinos via boundaries, that&#x27;s pretty messed up. But I think the Left checked out a few years ago.<p>And I personally don&#x27;t think John Oliver supports the ear muff district. He obviously has writers and it slipped through. But it&#x27;s about a world he thinks it&#x27;s normal enough to let slip. He needs to take responsibility for his program.')
