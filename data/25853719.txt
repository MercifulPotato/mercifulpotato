They&#x27;re liquid, and enable people to upsize or downsize their living situations with relative ease. Businesses and people come and go and there&#x27;s an irrepressable energy to it.<p>(There&#x27;s a strong argument that the kind of risk, stress, and precariousness you rightly and richly describe are an effect of a NIMBY-induced housing crisis. The &quot;market rate&quot; and &quot;rent control&quot; dichotomy suggests that something is seriously hinky in the housing market at hand.)<p>Rent controlled areas are calmer, slower, more stable. They are better for people who are able to find a place exactly to their liking and whose lives are improved by their ability to hold the world at bay. Which obviously never lasts forever. Things always change.<p>As you say, both have long-term consequences. It&#x27;s perhaps worth considering that perhaps neither set is inherently better than the other. And, above all, it&#x27;s possible that the divide between the two could be underappreciated long-term consequences of policy.')
