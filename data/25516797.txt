The way we see it, there is a spectrum of functionality between &quot;freeform chat&quot; and &quot;expense management&quot; -- and every form of payment is somewhere on that spectrum:<p>* Expense management is the most sophisticated form of payment possible: it&#x27;s a complex transaction with coding, accounting, and legal ramifications, that requires documentation and auditing, that reconciles to various accounts, and goes through a complex approval workflow before reimbursement. It&#x27;s truly the most complex workflow a company will ever experience, and exists as a kind of structured chat: to submit an expense is to formally state &quot;I have made purchases A, B, and C in line with expense policy X, as demonstrated by documentation Y, and hereby formally request reimbursement from Z.&quot; Expense management is really just a kind of templated chat system, optimized for this highly constrained but extremely complex kind of conversation.<p>* Invoices are pretty much the same kind of complex conversation as expense management, but with a simpler approval structure (because your customer is expected to pay all or nothing) and more knowledgeable participants (removing employees who don&#x27;t care about the accounting).<p>* Corporate travel booking (a subset of procurement as a whole) is also like expense management, but simpler still: a structured chat between the employee and the travel manager to make purchases in line with a travel policy.<p>* Freeform chat is really just the same common structure, but with all the constraints and workflow removed.\nAccordingly, everything we&#x27;ve done to date is largely just research: we had to become a major player in all these separate industries in order to ensure we understood them at an incredibly deep level, as well as to lay down a technical and legal platform that enables us to operate freely in all of them.<p>But none of that was ever the goal; that was just a tool to learn -- and Expensify.cash is a from-scratch reimplementation of everything we&#x27;ve learned to date, atop the most thoroughly modern technology available, wiping away all technical debt in one fell swoop.<p>Interested in helping us build the future? That&#x27;s great! Here&#x27;s how:<p>1. Go to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;Expensify.cash" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;Expensify.cash</a> and sign in with your normal Expensify account<p>2. When prompted, provide your GitHub user handle<p>3. You will be immediately granted access to the web&#x2F;desktop \nversion of the app, and we will reach out to invite you to the TestFlight for iOS, or Google Play beta for Android<p>4. You will also be invited to a Slack channel to talk with our team in realtime (yes, I&#x27;m aware of the irony; help us move this to an Expensify.cash channel soon!)<p>5. Read CONTRIBUTORS.md to learn how to get started<p>6. Pick an open job in Upwork, and go!<p>7. So we believe payments and chat are the same thing, and we have been steadily building our product platform with that in mind, all along. However, there&#x27;s a second belief that is also important to understand:')
