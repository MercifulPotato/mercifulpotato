They are the vertex, unchanged for million of years, of a branch of evolution. It&#x27;s like nature said &quot;ok, I&#x27;m done here&quot;. They are the result of a subtractive process, not an additive process (somebody said you are done once there&#x27;s nothing left to remove!). They are able to survive in almost any biome despite being cold blooded. Symbolically, the snake is the creature that gave us the gift of consciousness, identity and self-reflection. Well, I&#x27;m biased, at a point of my life I had more than 30 pet snakes. I find them, especially the venomous one, the most fascinating creatures.')
