Item(by='H8crilA', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603417133, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24864652, text='P(X,Y), when integrated along all possible diagonals given by x+y=z where z goes through all real numbers, is what a convolution is (of P(X) and P(Y) generated by those variables). This gives you the distribution of the variable Z=X+Y.<p>So, we&#x27;re talking about the same thing, namely that multiplying two probability density functions pointwise roughly corresponds to a single point where X==Y (the same as X-Y==0), but otherwise doesn&#x27;t seem terribly useful.')
