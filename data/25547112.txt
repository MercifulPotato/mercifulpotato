When I eat my lunch with a fork, I expect the prongs of the fork not to fall off...   And so far, in my whole life of using forks, the prongs have <i>never</i> fallen off.  The fork has been 100% reliable.  It has <i>always</i> worked.<p>And before you say a fork is unrealistically simple, a metal fork is still the result of centuries of metalworking, casting, mining, etc.   I&#x27;m sure some early forks <i>did</i> fall apart.  But now, we have it refined, and they&#x27;re close enough to bug-free.<p>I think the way to achieve it is to have a fixed feature set that you never add to.')
