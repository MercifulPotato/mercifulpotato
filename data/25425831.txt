On shorter distances going from city center to city center by plane is only a few hours faster, but you can&#x27;t sleep much during this time as you have to get to the airport, go through check-in, wait for your plane, etc. With a good night train you can travel without losing a day.<p>Getting actual good sleep can be difficult at times, but it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;ll leave the cabin battered and bruised.
