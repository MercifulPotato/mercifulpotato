Item(by='studiocinematic', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605417293, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25097083, text='recording sound - is already working. Recording video is a bit more problematic (implementation wise). I have something experimental that is somewhat working if your screen is up to 1920x1080 resolution (if it&#x27;s 4k, it&#x27;s not working correctly yet). I do plan to fix this in the future.')
