After the initial stage of encorporating the rationality identity and arguing about everything with everyone, I tried becoming more of an applied rationalist when I realised the first approch isn&#x27;t leading me to winning anything. Shortly after I read: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lesswrong.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;ZbgCx2ntD5eu8Cno9&#x2F;how-to-be-happy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lesswrong.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;ZbgCx2ntD5eu8Cno9&#x2F;how-to-be-...</a><p>I made a series of life changes. I can&#x27;t attribute the blog post alone to these changes, but it was something that pushed me towards a more meaningful life. I stopped spending money on things and started buying experiences more often. I bought a bycicle (a thing but gives you many experiences) and started cycling to&#x2F;from work in an effort to a) exercise b) spend more time outside. I broke up with my girlfriend of 9 years because I figured it just wasn&#x27;t making me any happier. Cycling in London, UK for years made me very satisfied but I also got tired of the climate and I ended up finding a remote role and relocating to a climate where I can be outside every day. Finally I have started strength training - and now I am in a much better shape after doing it on a regular basis for a few years. It&#x27;s hard to say that I am happier exactly, but there is a sense of liberty I feel that is hard to describe. The life I am living feels like my own, I feel the sense of control and I am liberated. I would like to think many of these things count as &quot;winning&quot;.')
