Why is it so hard to upgrade in half a decade ?<p>The ideal situation is never having to upgrade: you buy your computer, install the operating system, and it works the same until you retire it. If your computer has a 5 year warranty, you expect to use it for at least 5 years before retiring it.<p>A 5 year LTS is only 5 years if you install the moment it&#x27;s released, but that&#x27;s not usually the case; for instance, there&#x27;s a new Ubuntu LTS release every 2 years, so in the worst case your LTS installation will last only 3 years. Now consider the &quot;10 year&quot; RHEL LTS: in the worst case (you installed RHEL 7 just before RHEL 8 was released), your LTS installation will last 5 years, perfectly matching the warranty period.')
