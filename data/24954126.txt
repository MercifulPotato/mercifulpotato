Humans included.<p>And the barrier to surpassing that problem has been hardware (now approaching solving) and calendar- &amp; person-time.<p>The problem with 1970s AI (ingnoring hardware) isn&#x27;t that we <i>couldn&#x27;t</i> build useful AI, but that we couldn&#x27;t <i>afford</i> to build useful AI in most domains.<p>Calendar time costs money. People time costs money.<p>Deep learning and derivates finally provide a solution where we can substitute machine time and data volume for calendar and people time. As a result, we can afford to do things in domains we couldn&#x27;t before.')
