Item(by='pilsetnieks', descendants=None, kids=[25296719, 25297257, 25298738], score=None, time=1607032324, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25294028, text='&gt; Yeah John Gruber has really become a shill over the last few years<p>I remember reading sentiments to that effect since 2004. I doubt he&#x27;s getting paid directly, so he could only be a shill in a very loose sense of the word. He does get paid in review units and access, though.<p>I think he&#x27;s maybe overly enthusiastic about the good stuff, and skews toward the positive when matters are questionable but he has called out Apple&#x27;s corporate malfeasance and pointed out technical shortcomings in the past. He&#x27;s biased but that&#x27;s a one man blog for a specific audience.')
