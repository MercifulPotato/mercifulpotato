Many providers have exactly this service already.<p>The difference seems to be that ProtonMail don’t allow you to use normal imap and your own client with pgp, but force you to use their client. This is probably a trade-off made to protect users against them selves in one way (disabling encryption for grandpa) and hiding the non tech-savvy from all the technical details.<p>Again, many assumptions here.<p>So, to me, mentioning proton here doesn’t make sense as the underlying tech: smtp &amp; pgp have existed and been industry standard for a long time. So there is not issue of adoption.')
