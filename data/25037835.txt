I don&#x27;t think most developers here have ever sent Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler any money for zlib&#x2F;gzip? And how many have sent checks to the people who&#x27;ve been contributing to the linux kernel? And gnu file utils and bin utils and compilers? And the openssl project? And OpenBSD for openssh? And any of the other hundreds of bits of code that they rely on on a daily basis to get their work done.<p>At the end of the day if you want to get paid for your work, don&#x27;t give it away under a free license. This is the second major story -- that I&#x27;ve seen anyway -- in the last couple of weeks about people wanting to be paid for the software that they freely give away. It reminds me of the time I went to Rome and a man came up to me and slipped a string bracelet around my wrist. When I told him I didn&#x27;t want it, he said &quot;no, no, it&#x27;s free. just a friendly gift.&quot; and when I said thanks and turned to walk away he got mad that I didn&#x27;t give him any money.
