Item(by='0xquad', descendants=None, kids=[24822001], score=None, time=1603058900, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24818172, text='I generally support the EFF and think netizens need far more protections than they have, and those need to come through legislation.  But I don&#x27;t get why this mandated interoperability is a good idea.<p>Mandating data portability is one thing, but having the government decide that a company must provide an api seems absurd to me (so far: it&#x27;s a new idea to me).<p>In the meantime, dear EFF:\n- Why hasn&#x27;t the EFF created boilerplate privacy agreement clauses that companies could adopt to prove their ubiquitously claimed &quot;utmost concern for user privacy&quot;?\n- Why isn&#x27;t there a vision of how companies could maintain the provenance under which each datum has been acquired (and therefore when they can&#x2F;can&#x27;t be shared&#x2F;sold&#x2F;etc.)?\n- What meaning does any privacy agreement have (no matter how consumer friendly) if it can be changed at any time?\n- Why do NO companies promise to protect user data in the event of an acquisition (in fact they promise the opposite).<p>These seem like action items right down EFF&#x27;s lane and I keep waiting year after year for the basics to be covered.  I criticize as a friend (and small donor).')
