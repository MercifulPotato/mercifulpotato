We walk 2-3 miles a day minimum, in the worst weather. She&#x27;s a terror, wants to eat everything in sight. She&#x27;s a lot to manage. I didn&#x27;t walk nearly this much daily without places to be before (though had no problem walking plenty when I did have places to be). I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything. Even with the complications of raising a naughty deranged wolf variant.')
