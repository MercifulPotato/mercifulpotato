There was a thread the other day of someone maxing out his credit cards to buy GME, and the comments were full of people calling him an idiot (albeit a lucky one), and imploring others not to do the same. If you read the comments on any big YOLO post, you&#x27;ll see people pressing the person about their job or their portfolio, and you&#x27;ll find out they&#x27;re already very wealthy, or working in a highly paid job. Or they started small and have made a number of good bets that ratcheted them up.<p>I think instead what has happened is that nihilistic <i>language</i> has become the currency of authenticity. It&#x27;s honestly not that cool to be an option trader or Wall Street guy, but by using this nihilistic language, you get some of that back. There is interesting analysis to be done about that, though I think it honestly leads back to some of the same conclusions found in this article, but at a different level.')
