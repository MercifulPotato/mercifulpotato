The Earth needs to reduce that number to sustainable levels. By humans disregarding the problems of global warming, there will be global famines which will reduce human numbers markedly.<p>Climate change is merely a symptom of TOO MANY HUMANS. It&#x27;s pointless trying to reduce climate change without trying to reduce human numbers.<p>We have a choice: reduce human numbers ourselves down to around 1-2 billion (possibly with a &#x27;One child per woman&#x27; policy which would do the task without trauma) or have the number reduced forcibly (perhaps via the global famines or water-wars which will occur when climate change causes droughts and low water supplies).<p>Being humans, we&#x27;ll do nothing and be forced to undergo the trauma of having our numbers reduced forcibly.')
