This means they have a very high chance of being rear-ended by the next car, and if the driver is not very experienced, then can lost control and hit other lane &#x2F; objects and people at the side of the road.<p>As a similar example, we don’t allow untrained and unprotected people into construction sites with heavy machinery. Saying “hey, let me walk under this pile driver, it is my life on the line!” isn”t going to cut it in the US.')
