It just means a system which is capable of running well.<p>The bugs in all this complex software are out of scope of the conversation. It&#x27;s a theoretical system, after all. The fact that the more complex and distributed a consensus-based system is, the more likely failure of the system is, isn&#x27;t mentioned. Presumably either because it&#x27;s implied that you should only ever use this when you have to, or because it&#x27;s actually elementary.<p>The most stable highly available consensus-based systems are dependent on highly available hardware and networks. As soon as either become flaky, bugs start coming out of the woodwork like a log on a roaring fire (and this explains why Jepsen is so effective at finding bugs). Othe other hand, HA systems that don&#x27;t depend on consensus can be smaller, and their software is typically easier to reason about, leading to fewer classes of bugs as well as a potentially smaller codebase which leads to less bugs.')
