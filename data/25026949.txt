Item(by='gst', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604854193, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25026050, text='One fact not mentioned yet here in the comments is that a very similar approach already exists in the United States: If you don&#x27;t pay off your phone your IMEI is blacklisted and (as far as I know) those blacklists are shared between the major providers in the United States. Therefore the device lock discussed here won&#x27;t make a large difference in the United States.<p>The primary use-cases are probably:<p>* If used in the United States prevent fraud where someone uses a stolen identity to obtain a phone and then sells it in another market (that doesn&#x27;t use IMEI blacklists) once it arrives.<p>* If used in other countries that don&#x27;t have IMEI blacklists to provide a similar functionality as those blacklists. One benefit of that is that it could reduce the credit requirements and make it easier for people with no or a poor credit to obtain a phone.')
