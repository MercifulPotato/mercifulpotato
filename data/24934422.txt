Beyond current technology but seems like a viable option a hundred years from now.<p>How? Because to me, that seems extremely far-fetched. My understanding as to why Earth has a magnetic field and why Mars does not (or has a weak one) is that Earth has a highly dynamic molten core surrounding a solid inner core, whereas Mars only has a molten core with not as much activity. It is my understanding that Earth&#x27;s geodynamo plus its rotation helps create the magnetic field that protects our atmosphere.<p>So unless humans are able to alter planets in such...planetary ways, then I don&#x27;t see how we&#x27;ll suddenly be able to give Mars a sustainable magnetic field.')
