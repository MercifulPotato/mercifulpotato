Their KPIs is how many users they have, and that only needs enough features&#x2F;price to convince the corporate buyer which rarely accepts feedback from larger set of employees.<p>As such, outside of certain older very expensive corporate videoconferencing setups that remember targeting inter-corporate meetings and the like, the actual feature set ossified. You get some things that are easy to demo in 1:1 call, you get locked down room systems that leave me weeping for <i>Webex</i> ffs, and you get omnipresent WebRTC in-browser setup that often murders your CPU unless you get lucky.<p>I find it really bad that the best video conference experience I ever had involved Cisco Webex hardware and Bluejeans, all interconnected with so-maligned SIP. And before that, the glorious days of wider ITU-T based video conferencing, like NetMeeting with its whiteboards and active screensharing.<p>Imagine if video conferencing solutions competed on top of common protocols, and you&#x27;d separately invest in infrastructure and clients? Instead of the rare enterprise cases where Lync&#x2F;Teams&#x2F;Webex&#x2F;other SIP is set on dedicated lines in large corporation, make similar setups common everywhere (WebRTC&#x2F;SIP bridges&#x2F;transcoders on the edge, with dedicated bandwidth bough by company, etc.?) with vendors competing on something more than &quot;you have to use our stack because we don&#x27;t interoperate with anyone else&quot;.<p>Sincerely, someone who has had enough keeping 3-5 video conferencing apps around.')
