It was the state public utility commission. My dad called on Thursday.<p>That Saturday, the district manager knocks on our door. He informs us of how sorry the entire Bell family is for the trouble we’ve had, that they have teams tracing lines from the central office to our house and will have the problem identified and fixed by Sunday, and that we will receive a rather significant  discount to our bill over the next year to help “make it right”. His only ask was that we call the PSC and let them know if AT&amp;T had solved the problem to our satisfaction.')
