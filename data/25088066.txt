Normal, well-adjusted people don&#x27;t like to make their colleagues feel bad.<p>Exactly this, and one of the things I eventually realised is you have to simply ignore the jackasses.<p>Realising that face to face these people are most likely not terribly formidable is certainly helpful but the main thing is to learn not to give a s### what they think regardless. This isn&#x27;t to say you should ignore everyone, or become proud, but that you should recognise peoples&#x27; behaviour for what it is and respond appropriately, which might include ignoring it entirely.<p>&gt; My gut says bullies key to subconscious signs of weakness, and the former is interpreted as such.<p>Without wanting to get too Homelander about it and, of course, I never would, but after a number of years of strength training it&#x27;s always nice to know that if push came to shove you could probably snap the bullies in half with your bare hands. More seriously, being in physically good shape is highly underrated: it fundamentally changes who you are, and will change the way you think about difficult or challenging situations, making you more confident and capable of dealing with them. I can&#x27;t really explain why this happens, but it certainly does - at least in my experience (one data point, I will grant you).')
