I had no idea Virtualization.framework was a thing. I&#x27;ve installed and tested vmctl&#x2F;vmcli out on my M1 MacBook Air. Your instructions worked like a charm.<p>Edit: I don&#x27;t see the option to list running VMs though. I was hoping to check that powering off the VM worked. The inability to ping the VM tells me it is off, but if I didn&#x27;t have the IP, I don&#x27;t know how I would check this.')
