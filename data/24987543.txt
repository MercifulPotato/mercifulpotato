I wish there is a standalone GUI ‘framework’ which builds on these primitives and leans on standard library to make the experience a bit more nicer when building standalone applications.<p>I understand this is not the goal of Dear ImGui. I may give it a shot in a few months time if I don’t come across any such project.')
