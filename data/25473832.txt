Spin is the easiest to understand. When you measure, the spin will either measure up, or down. The key though is you can measure spin against any angle. If you measure the spin of the two particles at the same angle, you will get opposite answers. And you can choose what angle to measure at* long after the particles have separated.<p>* There is one theory of QM that removes the possibility of choice from the universe.')
