And yet every time it&#x27;s mentioned online the only replies are along the lines of &#x27;it&#x27;s intentional, of course it makes sense to wait in case the service exits cleanly&#x27;. Was no one around before systemd to realise this was not an issue then?<p>It&#x27;s infuriating when your system won&#x27;t shut down due to some unknown service, which systemd gives [30 seconds remaining] to quit gracefully. OK, you think, I guess it&#x27;s reasonable to wait and see if it will close cleanly, so you wait. As soon as the timer hits 0, it jumps up again: [90 seconds remaining]. How are you supposed to know how long to wait? What are you supposed to do if it continues forever? All keyboard input is disabled so there is nothing you can do but hard reset your PC and hope systemd unmounted the filesystems before getting stuck.<p>It&#x27;s just an unpleasant software.')
