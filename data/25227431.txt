And when you do actually manually solve the captcha correctly, sometimes Google still thinks you&#x27;re a robot.<p>And sometimes it asks me to select all &quot;bicycles&quot; in the images and there are NO GODDAMN BICYCLES in any of the images whatsover. So I hit Skip and eventually google thinks I&#x27;m a robot.<p>Everybody please either switch to hcaptcha or..., although I&#x27;ve not seen a website use this yet, upgrade to ReCaptcha v3 maybe?<p>I read somewhere that ReCaptcha v3 is far less annoying than v2? Is that true?')
