When the central bank punches keys and creates money out of thin air this DOES come from your pocket and mine, but in a way that is not entirely as obvious as the way other costs are. It reduces the value of what was already in our pocket via inflation. The money in our pocket can no longer buy the same amount. That’s a cost.<p>God I wish we would go back to the gold standard so that the cost of government expenditures would be more obvious to the general public via payment from increased taxes or from allocation away from some other government expense. Instead, people are left thinking the government could magically solve all of our problems by printing more money, but for some reason doesn’t because it doesn’t care.')
