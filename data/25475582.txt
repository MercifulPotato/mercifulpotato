I&#x27;m forthcoming that I have an identity, and I&#x27;m even willing to prove that I&#x27;m a self-consistent individual. I&#x27;m acting like someone that has purchased a month-to-month phone, and have signed up for a free email account, and values their internet privacy. It&#x27;s become apparent to me that a number of companies discriminate against people for whom this is their only choice... heaven help you if you can&#x27;t afford a <i>proper</i> phone (or don&#x27;t have the credit to open a <i>proper</i> cellphone account).<p>As a transgendered person that&#x27;s been discriminated against, I do indeed have valid reasons for wanting my most personal conversations to be secure from being used against me. There are other aspects of my private life that that would be wildly misinterpreted if taken out of context. I would prefer to keep my private life wholly separate from my public persona, and that&#x27;s... harder to do in the age of COVID isolation where everything is online.<p>It&#x27;s astonishing to me how many people just... don&#x27;t care about their privacy these days. And that the bar is so crazy high to be anonymous. To the point that wanting to be anonymous for a few hours is indistinguishable from being up to no good?!<p>Hell, I&#x27;d have to _break_ the law and craft a truly new identity just to be able to be anonymous on some of these platforms <i>that don&#x27;t have real-world identities as a sign-up requirement</i>.<p>The argument of &quot;you&#x27;re not doing anything wrong, so why be concerned about your privacy&quot; is disingenuous.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lifehacker.com&#x2F;why-your-privacy-matters-even-if-youre-not-doing-anyt-1645884650" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lifehacker.com&#x2F;why-your-privacy-matters-even-if-your...</a>')
