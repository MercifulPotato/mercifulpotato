One question though, is any of this going to be open source? The on-prem-first focus you have is certainly a selling point for me as I already run my entire backend in Amazon&#x27;s ECS so adding another service for the wundergraph would be very simple - however, I&#x27;m always weary of using non-open source software that I can&#x27;t fork and patch, as I&#x27;ve had to do that many a time due to not being able to wait for patches to be upstreamed.\nRegardless, I think the points you make in your blog posts are spot on, and I&#x27;m looking forward to watching this project evolve.')
