I&#x27;ve been trying to teach Juniors that if the function itself has 4 levels of abstraction, even if the names are readableFunctionThatDoesXwithYSideEffect ..... it is harder to understand, Ctrl+clicking downards into each little mini-rabbit -hole.   Just keep the function as a 80-liner, not a 20-liner with 4 levels of indirection w&#x2F; functions that are only used once (inside parent function) ugh.')
