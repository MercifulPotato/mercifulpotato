If there were a malware extension in the Chrome Web Store today with 800K users, then Google ought to remove it today and doesn&#x27;t need to wait for Manifest v3 for that. In fact, Google seems to indicate that v2 will continue to be supported for at least a year, so extensions using that API will continue to be in the Chrome Web Store for quite some time.<p>The whole issue of transfer of ownership of extensions is a red herring as far as Manifest v3 is concerned.')
