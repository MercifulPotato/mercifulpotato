I spent 8 and a half years developing a CRM for mobile applications and it&#x27;s not like I haven&#x27;t poked my nose into the petabytes of data. The reality is that people(understand companies) are fighting for app time, that is how much time you spend in their app. Personally I&#x27;ve never used and never will use a dating app for a million and one reasons but I know plenty of people that do and have wasted money on them. Having spoken to them, they do spend most of their time on tinder&#x2F;okcupid. As far as minutes in app goes, the Match group is unmatched(no pun intended). I&#x27;m sure it would raise some eyebrows, if people knew they were spending that much money on one company. I have a friend who has subscription to all of those. I wonder if he realizes that he is spending more on somewhat twisted services offered by a single company than I am on the countless gcp services I use for my personal projects.')
