It&#x27;s not a strain.  A strain is a virus with a new biological property.  There have been no new properties ascribed to this isolate other than sequence differences, which is not enough to make a strain.. nor have we seen any other new strains of SARS-CoV-2 that anybody&#x27;s demonstrated to be biologically different.  None.  It hasn&#x27;t happened yet.  I&#x27;m not saying it couldn&#x27;t but it hasn&#x27;t.&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;Nobody&#x27;s done any experiments to determine the effects of these changes on any property of the virus.  Yet when a journalist calls up a scientist and say &quot;What do you think?&quot; and the scientist says &quot;These could have an effect on virulence or transmission or antibody neutralization,&quot; somehow that gets translated in to &quot;It&#x27;s making the virus more virulent&quot; and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s circulated and a dozen people this week said to me &quot;What do you think about these mutations in the UK that make the virus more virulent, more transmissible, more resistant to neutralization by antibodies?&quot;  None of that has been shown, folks!  It&#x27;s speculation.  There&#x27;s no paper on any of this.&quot;</i><p>[1] - Starting at about 54 minutes in to episode 696: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microbe.tv&#x2F;twiv&#x2F;twiv-696&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microbe.tv&#x2F;twiv&#x2F;twiv-696&#x2F;</a>')
