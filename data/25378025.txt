I get the logic, but think it is bad for society. Our system of innovation relies on continual competition. And when I look at big companies with big network effects (Visa, Facebook, Twitter, etc.), I find that I dislike all of them, wish they faced competition, wish customers had choice, and also wish employees had choice. I&#x27;m not sure what the right solution is here, because customers do derive value from social features that are executed well. But such a moat lends itself to a lack of real competition.')
