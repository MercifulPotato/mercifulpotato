Tbh this comment is a bit triggering for myself as a Ugandan and quite a misrepresentation of the country. Since this is right at the top, I feel like I need to respond.<p>All the skulls - That&#x27;s not a thing, I can&#x27;t recall seeing any growing up in Uganda. Sure there have been wars in the country but that was decades ago...<p>Bad things happened there and it has never recovered:\nThe country has developed significantly since the 70s just like most other places in the world. That statement is so far from the truth<p>Homosexuality: Definitely a strong opposition to it in the country. However, the media representation is an extreme versus the day to day. If you are gay in Uganda, I do agree that it is probably best to stay in the shadows<p>I urge you to please think about what you are going to write before writing such a comment. You haven&#x27;t lived in the country for 40 years. Can you really know anything about it&#x27;s present state?')
