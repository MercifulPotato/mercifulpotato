So far, <i>every single application</i> we&#x27;ve ported over to AWS has resulted in <i>reduced</i> costs. I&#x27;m not even talking about <i>total costs</i>, i.e. datacenter power costs, real estate taxes, staffing costs - I&#x27;m only talking about server costs, networking costs, storage costs and software licensing costs. So far AWS has beat on-premise <i>every single time.</i> Is it cheap? Compared to running on-premise Hell Yeah! Our average savings has been 60% (and like I said we&#x27;re not even looking at total cost, so the actual average savings is even higher). It&#x27;s ridiculous.')
