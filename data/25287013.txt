Are we trying to solve problems or we&#x27;re trying to be trendy? Is this a clothing industry?<p>I would have thought we should use mature technologies that have been vetted and gone through the trough of disillusionment and onto the ramp of productivity. Proven tech stack that I can rely on gives me peace. Older the tech, the more reliable it is.<p>The opposite of &quot;trendy&quot; is what we need to popularize and make it cool. It should be cool to use a 5 year old library in JS!')
