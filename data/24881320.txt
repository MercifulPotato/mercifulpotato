This is especially important when comparing multiple features to put on the roadmap because it&#x27;s easy for one idea to be simple to imagine and better than the status quo (hence asked for by many customers) but be nowhere near an optimal solution to whichever problem is being solved.<p>Having that kind of customer insight is better than not having it, as long as such data is used appropriately -- without additional data it can&#x27;t do much more that guide or refine gut feelings and insights, and attempting to do otherwise is a recipe for an inferior product.')
