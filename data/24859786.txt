But remember seeing a paper on hot springs. Typically you have a situation when water seeps down a deep fault and then comes back up. Would seem you are correct. Heat transfer via conduction will be really slow. Also know that the geothermal plants in The Geysers Geothermal plants in Sonoma County have lower output then they did decades ago because the rocks have cooled somewhat.')
