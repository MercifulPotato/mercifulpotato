It can exist in one of the following three states:<p>- belief, zero supporting evidence\n- fact, only non-contradictatory supporting evidence\n- paradox, supporting and disproving evidence exists<p>All states are valid, but only an idea classified as a fact should be relied upon as evidence for another idea.<p>Every idea starts as a belief.<p>A fact can change to a belief if the evidence brought to bear on it is proven to not be classified as a fact. Equally it can become a paradox if new evidence contradicts existing evidence.<p>Resolution of a paradox would require at least two new, more precise ideas to be created, likely with a clause defining the demarcation of the paradox boundary. The paradox entity remains unchanged.<p>Reliance on a belief to support an argument I consider ‘agnostic ignorance’, and reliance on a paradox is ‘wilful ignorance’.')
