You pretty much had to do things the Unix way or deal with a very limited program that mimicked its Windows counterpart.  That has changed.<p>I would argue that open source can be more pragmatic these days.  A lot of software offers the features people need.  Managing a system based upon open source software is significantly easier since there is no reason to impose restrictions on use or redistribution.  To choose an example relevant in this case, open source drivers can ship with a Linux distribution so you have functional drivers the moment you boot from the installation medium.  In the case of proprietary drivers, there is typically an extra step once the installation is complete.')
