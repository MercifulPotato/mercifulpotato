Item(by='9wzYQbTYsAIc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610649350, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25778604, text='I hadn’t thought of it from the perspective of historical data, thanks for that insight.<p>The existence of a law enforcement tool to watch the screen of a specific device at a specific set of times does seem more palatable than the existence of such a tool to decrypt any data stream.<p>1. Arbitrarily constrains the surveillance to taps on the device itself<p>2. Tapping the infrastructure would be unnecessarily redundant<p>3. Given the contemporary security landscape of vulnerable chip architectures and remote access vulnerabilities, the existence of an unpatchable vulnerability (“backdoor”) enabling a sophisticated attacker (“government office with the keys”) to get read-only, remote screen capture just seems like less of a security risk than other, non-hypothetical vulnerabilities that already exist.<p>Not sure how you’d secure those keys though, or what you’d do if they got stolen, but I imagine that it wouldn’t be dramatically different than secure boot key handling.<p>Anyone have insight to that side of things?')
