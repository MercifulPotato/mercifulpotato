I know they do it on their free time, so no gripes about them. The point is that at the current rate, I&#x27;ll be retiring before they finish.<p>r7rs-large also doesn&#x27;t fix issues where some SRFI <i>must</i> be in the r7rs-small spec to ensure cross-implementation compatibility. They need a r7rs-standard which adds these features over the minimalist r7rs-small while retaining r7rs-large as additional libraries.')
