IIRC it was an element in the events that destroyed Knight Capital in just a few minutes.<p>If there is something in your code that can put your system in an inconsistent state, and your testing has not covered that scenario, then it is irrelevant what percentage of the code was covered by that testing. This combinatorial complexity and history-dependence is the reason why code coverage is a misleading indicator of quality: 100% code coverage is very far from 100% scenario coverage.')
