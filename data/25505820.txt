I tried to use Voat a number of times after the subreddits and communties I liked online were censored one by one, but each time this happened I noticed Voat got progressively more extremist as it started to become one of the last places that allowed that type of speech on the internet.<p>While I never felt I needed to use Voat the problem because there are many alternative communities online, I do feel I HAVE to use Bitchute if I want to watch some of my favourite creators because YouTube banned them for reasons I can&#x27;t quite understand. I&#x27;m aware this is now exposing me to a lot more radical content than I would otherwise be exposed to if I was still watching on YouTube.<p>For example, just yesterday I shared a funny video I found on BitChute to a friend, but he wasn&#x27;t able to view it because it was deemed potentially illegal in his country. It was a fairly innocent parody video so I didn&#x27;t really get why it was banned until I took a look at the channel which was full of extreme and racist content.<p>I&#x27;m self-aware enough to know that exposing myself frequently enough to content like this could shift my views and I&#x27;m making efforts not to click on related views on Bitchute, but just to watch and support the content I used to enjoy on YouTube but it&#x27;s obvious to me how many people can become radicalised by communities that consist solely of radicals that have been banned from the more mainstream platforms.<p>Here&#x27;s the video btw, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitchute.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;AlSYTmkVfUFw&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitchute.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;AlSYTmkVfUFw&#x2F;</a> I love Bill Gates and don&#x27;t agree with all the conspiracies surrounding him but I did find this parody kinda funny. I&#x27;m a big South Parks fan though, and it reminds me a lot of that.')
