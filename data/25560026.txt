Which then raises the question of why are you using shared_ptr in the first place? You could use a custom allocator just for auditing that all outstanding references were released, I suppose, but actually releasing the memory anyway is just adding bugs. Which can be a fair risk to take, it just seems like shared_ptr is then not the thing you want to indicate appropriate &quot;running with scissors&quot; behavior.')
