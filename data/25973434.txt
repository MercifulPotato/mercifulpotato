Otherwise this seems like the typical false flag conspiracy we always hear when protests turn violent. The reality is even those acting peacefully are providing cover for those acting violently among their ranks. They also often incite that violent fringe to action, and condone or overlook their actions. Silence is violence, right? And remaining silent on those using violence to achieve political goals - the very definition of terrorism - isnâ€™t acceptable.')
