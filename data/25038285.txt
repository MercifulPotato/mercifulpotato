A regular citizen would know it&#x27;s a liePhone and would haggle hard or go where they sell them cheaper.<p>Anecdata: I was offered one of these liePhones at a Chinese airport, before going through the controls. They are very convincing at a glance, and the dudes offering them wear business suits, making it seem like it&#x27;s an emergency sale. Airport police lets them be as long as they don&#x27;t bother people too much.')
