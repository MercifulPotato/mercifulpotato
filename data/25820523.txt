(mainly because its slower to do any of that from an eink)<p>im using a firefox extension that saves articles to epub. i think there are android apps where you can do something similar through the share menu. but i might just try out wallabag next which is like pocket&#x2F;read-it-later and then install the wallabag app on my ereader<p>anyway, I&#x27;ve only messed around with it for a few days but I&#x27;m liking it so far, i just have to figure out why syncthing isnt syncing in the background. resilio sync or others like dropbox, google drive might work either. for the moment i just need to open them syncthing app to activate a sync')
