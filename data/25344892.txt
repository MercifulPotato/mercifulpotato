Everyone knows that they will be checking that everyone gets out, so we all leave and gather in our assigned locations and enjoy a paid break outside. They schedule these for good weather so getting outside is a nice break.\nThis way people take it seriously, but don&#x27;t panic. We know from experience that someone will be outside with a checklist to make sure we all leave.<p>There are scientific practices behind the above.
