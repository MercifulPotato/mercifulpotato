The author makes sweeping generalizations about his audience, he doesn&#x27;t clearly explain why the comic is bad (he makes accusations but they&#x27;re never really deduced), and it&#x27;s so hyperbolic it&#x27;s just ridiculous but it&#x27;s clearly not satire.  And as far as I can tell he doesn&#x27;t even understand the comic he&#x27;s criticizing so harshly.<p>It feels like something an enthusiastic redditor would cobble together in 30 minutes to win an argument against someone.')
