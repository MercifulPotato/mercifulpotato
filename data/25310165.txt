Indeed, I can&#x27;t think of a time.<p>I&#x27;ve lost to smurfs occasionally.  I&#x27;ve lost because people have tilted and abandoned or chain fed.  I&#x27;ve lost because internet has died.  I have even lost despite playing at my best and having a good game...<p>Mostly, 8-9 times out of 10, I&#x27;ve lost because I did not have enough impact on the game.  I did not do enough to win, and to help my team win.<p>But yeah. Wide spreads in matchmaking really only happen with very extreme skill levels, on rare game modes &#x2F; timezones, and where explicitly playing as a party (and thus forcing it)')
