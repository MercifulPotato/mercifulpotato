This is because for a 30yo with good career prospects, your future career is probably worth an amortized $5 million dollars.  If you have $200k in savings, that is only 4% of your true net worth. If you lose it, you still really have $5 million dollars. Therefore playing loose with it is pretty reasonable.<p>If you&#x27;re 63 and will retire in 2 years, your amortized future career earnings are probably $200k and your assets $5million, and then you should be conservative.')
