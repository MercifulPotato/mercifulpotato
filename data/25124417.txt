My faith in humanity is already hanging by threads.<p>I know this is my problem. It&#x27;s really hard for me to not flip the Bozo Bit. To take both the good along with the bad every person has to offer.<p>Story time.<p>I worked near &quot;Chris&quot;, a tech lead senior architecture fella. Same product group, different code bases, thank god. I disagreed with pretty much everything Chris said, but I accepted that we&#x27;re all opinionated and it&#x27;s more important to be consistent than to be right (correct). So long as his team kept shipping, Chris could do whatever he wants.<p>Until.<p>Because Chris was loud, large, older, and a boar -- exemplar of mansplainer -- he was influential. He convinced most of the people within ear shot (half of the floor) that password wallets were a terrible idea. I kept listening, to hear the rationale. Maybe he had a legit reason and I was the clueless noob.<p>Nope. &quot;Single point of failure. If someone cracks your wallet, you&#x27;re fully pwned.&quot;<p>Chris is why that product group could not, would not adopt any credentials (secrets) management strategy. It was all wikis and PostIt notes.<p>Reflecting back, it now occurs to me that hoarding the credentials may have been Chris&#x27; gatekeeping power move. Hmmm.')
