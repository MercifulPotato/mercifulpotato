If that doesn&#x27;t get pulled down, I get a warning about it in the monitoring system. When a client with a client certificate connects, I check against my local cache of the CRL, and if it&#x27;s been revoked, it can&#x27;t connect.<p>What problem do you have on your private CA internal network that CRLs fix but browsers don&#x27;t? Are you that concerned that your server certificates get compromised? You should be working to massively reduce the time those certificate are valid.')
