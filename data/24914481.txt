It&#x27;s a modern equivalent of making an brief announcement to the press or sending out a very sparse press release.<p>And the tweets that you (and I) hate to see reported, those of random people and especially headlines like &quot;Twitter goes mad about (whatever)&quot; somehow making an entire article out of quoting 6 random Twitter users... it&#x27;s a digital form of voxpops on TV or reader&#x27;s letters in newspapers. All of them can be a nice addition at times, but in my opinion the vast majority shouldn&#x27;t be part of a &quot;news&quot; medium.')
