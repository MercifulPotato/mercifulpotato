However it&#x27;s really easy for large companies with mountains of patents (many of which will never be products) to strong-arm smaller companies into cross-licensing (anything you build will surely breach some patent). So they would only get paid by their patents and hardly ever have to pay anyone else due to the patent system.<p>By this principle, only a company that produces nothing could ever hope to sue the technology behemoths for patent breaching.<p>Point here being that it&#x27;s not the eastern district of texas that&#x27;s at fault, nor the patent trolls (because other companies use the patent system in very similar ways). It&#x27;s the patent system that&#x27;s complete utter bullshit')
