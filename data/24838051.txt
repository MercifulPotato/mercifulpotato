Item(by='throwaway0a5e', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603205863, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24836866, text='The GP didn&#x27;t imply nearly the level of judgement that you&#x27;re projecting on him.<p>&gt;this is a very unsubstantiated claim, even if you know personally 10-15 people who are just bumming around and living on benefits that is a very small portion of benefits claim in society and this kind of behaviour will always exist.<p>I know a little under ten people who do the same.  Nobody so far in this thread is claiming they aren&#x27;t a small portion of benefits claims.  Nobody is claiming they won&#x27;t always exist in some number.  You&#x27;re the first person so far to even use the word &quot;fraud&quot; here.  Nobody is even saying they should be cut off.  People are only saying that they don&#x27;t fit cleanly into the existing unemployment metrics.<p>&gt;Do you really believe that someone who lives with handouts from the government have very little incentive to get better?<p>What good is the incentive if you don&#x27;t really have the life skills to work towards that end.  It&#x27;s the same kind of incentive that a plumber has to start the next Google and retire as a multimillionaire.  Sure it would be nice but all of these people I know are not in a practical position to improve their situation through work.<p>&gt;Do you believe that this almost less-than-baseline level of living is enough to make a significant portion of the populace unwilling to work?  To the level where participation rate would become unfair? Have you ever lived on that lifestyle to check your assumption that they have &quot;very little incentive to try and find a job&quot;?<p>Unwilling is a strong word.  It&#x27;s not so much an unwillingness in that their existence is stable and they&#x27;re not gonna rock that boat too much let alone run the rat race just to get inches ahead.  These people, in my observation tend to do under the table work or deal drugs to increase their income since those paths are readily available whereas entry points into a career are far more foreign to them.  (And before anyone projects their own biases on me, I consider small time drug dealers to be legitimate businesses and I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything unethical about an under the table wage laborer job.)  It&#x27;s foolish to expect these people to get McJobs in light of their options and how their benefits tend to interact with income and how little that would improve their situation.  The money goes right back out anyway.  The value proposition of constantly working harder just isn&#x27;t there.<p>These people&#x27;s incentive to work a job is a lot like a middle age upper middle class white collar professional with a family and a mortgage&#x27;s incentive to start their own business.  Sure you can do it and you might make substantially more money doing it but it&#x27;s a hell of a lot of work compared to what you&#x27;re doing now and it comes with risk and since you&#x27;re stable in your current situation you&#x27;re probably gonna stay there.<p>I&#x27;m not sure whether there&#x27;s enough of these people to be an issue for unemployment numbers but there&#x27;s definitely a lot of them out there (which is regrettable).')
