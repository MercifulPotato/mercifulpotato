The teams want to mask the exact tyre wear amount&#x2F;patterns, which they do by covering the surface with scraps.<p>&lt;edit&gt;\nActually this seems less clear cut than I thought.  I&#x27;d heard from David Coulthard&#x27;s commentary that the reason for picking up was to cover the wear from other teams&#x27; eyes.  A quick search suggests many people believe it&#x27;s to do with weight.  The weight explanation seems odd, since if the officials think the tyres are masking the true weight of the car, they can demand a different set are used for the weigh-in, but I can&#x27;t find an authorative source either way.<p>So it may be to do with weight, or it may be to do with hiding tyre wear.\n&lt;&#x2F;edit&gt;')
