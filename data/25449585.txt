The two exceptions I&#x27;ve found are for RSS readers that operate as browser extensions and for substack podcasts, which come with a dedicated RSS address for each subscriber. I like to read newsletters on my Kindle via Calibre and it would really make things much simpler if substack just did what they did for podcasts for all newsletters without exception.')
