This isn&#x27;t like the Saturn V where the plans were mothballed.<p>Sure, if you killed all semi-conductor engineers, and everyone at Intel and TSMC and Samsung I&#x27;m sure there would be problems. But realistically chip manufacture is one of the things I&#x27;d feel more confident about being able to recover.')
