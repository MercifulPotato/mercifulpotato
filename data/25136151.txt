Unfortunately, Mozilla has to keep an eye on its income, thus it&#x27;s not as free to make decisions to the extent that it ought to be.<p><i>&quot;…core JavaScript has the Date object, which accesses the current date&#x2F;time; I thought that the ability to access the current date&#x2F;time shouldn&#x27;t belong in core JavaScript…&quot;</i><p>I agree here too, one can think of various solutions perhaps even &#x27;firewalling&#x27; JS code and so on.  Irrespective of the technical solutions, given my first point, how does one overcome the impediments and make it happen?  Reckon this is the biggest question as Big Tech won&#x27;t take it lightly (given its potential loss of income if such features were implemented widely). That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t hold much hope for a satisfactory solution anytime soon.')
