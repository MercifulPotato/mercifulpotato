Which only\nshows how many people don&#x27;t look at a single review if the score\nis good enough.<p>The other trick that Amazon doesn&#x27;t give a damn about is using\nthe mechanism meant for different product colors and sizes to\ncombine multiple products into a shared entry, which mixes all\nthe reviews together and makes it basically impossible for the\ncustomer to see the score for each individual item.<p>As far as I can tell Amazon&#x27;s only reaction was to start banning\ncustomers who returned too many products. I wonder why.')
