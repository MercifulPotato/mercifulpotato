I searched for a version for my cousin to use (she doesn&#x27;t have the money and won&#x27;t make money from using it, but she was taught how to use it in school).<p>The warez scene nowadays have pre-patched *.iso versions of the whole Creative Suite (last years version I believe). No need for a keygen, messing with your hosts file or manually replacing files after install.<p>Not that I trust those, I didn&#x27;t run them on my PC, just tried it out in a VM.
