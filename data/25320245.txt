The value of a bitcoin doesn&#x27;t come from the work performed. Otherwise recently mined bitcoins would be more valuable than early mined bitcoins, due to different hash difficulty level.<p>Anyways, currency is not value. Currency represents value. It is symbol. I feel like confusing the symbol with what it represents is the source of much of the misunderstandings of how money works.')
