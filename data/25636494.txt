The first is empirical. It It appears that one dose of Moderna _is_ highly effective, perhaps 85% or more. Note the treatment-control divergence after about fourteen days  [1]. The second is theoretical. From our ample medical experience with other vaccines, there is strong prior reason to think that one dose is likely to work well, and that a second shot in the distant future would be even better than a second shot after three or four weeks. Booster shots are given a.) as backup for people who don&#x27;t seroconvert after one dose b.) to trigger a secondary immune response. In light of a.), we shouldn&#x27;t be surprised by the 85% number (most people seroconvert; there&#x27;s no partial immunity, you either seroconvert or you don&#x27;t). In light of b.), we should be very skeptical of the four week interval, especially since the secondary response takes about two weeks to develop. It&#x27;s shorter than the interval for every other vaccine.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;fda-releases-data-on-modernas-covid-vaccine-it-looks-good&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;fda-releases-data-on...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccines&#x2F;schedules&#x2F;hcp&#x2F;imz&#x2F;child-adolescent.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccines&#x2F;schedules&#x2F;hcp&#x2F;imz&#x2F;child-adolesc...</a>')
