Patheticly small amount.<p>IAG has £23 billion of revenue last year. Over the last 9 years their total profit was £10,000 million, partly driven from slashing IT costs.<p>A £1 billion fine wouldn&#x27;t massively hurt a company that&#x27;s made ten times that <i>in post tax profit</i> in the last decade, but it would cause companies to take information security more seriously.<p>This is the equivalent of someone on an average UK salary being fined £20.')
