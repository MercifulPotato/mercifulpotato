If i have a successful local business, it&#x27;s not hurting me that others do as well.<p>Well, in this case, Google would leave billions of dollars in revenue and hundreds of millions of users on the table. Not only would it hurt their bottomline, it would also hurt their products as they train on user data, which has quite strong network effects.<p>This is really a different scale than a local business. If you have that with a single owner, she&#x2F;he might be content with what she has and choose not to expand further. Google, on the other hand, has multiple of layers of management which need to report to thousands of owners, quite a few of which expect constant growth. This is really not one person who can be content with the size; it&#x27;s multiple people who get their salaries based on growth and report to thousands of investors, which, for the most part, care about increasing their shares value. Leaving so much money on the table just for the sake of it is a hard sell in this structure.<p>&gt; This is not aimed personally at you<p>No offence taken :)')
