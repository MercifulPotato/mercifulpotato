But it seems to me that actually tying it to a single server, with local storage on that same server, in production, is irresponsible. I sure wouldn&#x27;t want to have to explain why the application went down, and will come back running a possibly out-of-date DB backup, if that single server suddenly disappears. SQLite may be faster and simpler, but to sleep well at night, there&#x27;s no substitute for stateless application servers in front of a managed database.')
