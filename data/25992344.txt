When I took modern foil fencing classes, it wasn&#x27;t dangerous in the slightest. The training foils (the long thin bendy swords that people usually think of when they think of fencing) are extremely flexible and have a button on the tip. You score a point by pushing that button against your opponent in a score zone of their body. You wear an electrified vest over your torso with a long wire leading back to the score machine, and when the opponent&#x27;s sword tip touches your vest it completes an electric circuit. If that circuit is completed at the same time the opponent&#x27;s foil tip button is depressed, they score a point. Both people have full cage facemasks, and there&#x27;s almost zero chance of injury short of tripping.<p>Epee fencing, on the other hand, uses a heavier, stiffer sword, so when you poke somebody it can bruise.<p>Sabre fencing is the third modern fencing style, and allows you to score points with the blade (slashing) instead of just the point as with foil and epee. I&#x27;ve never done it but have heard it is the most physical style of the three.<p>This photo is of an epee match, but displays the still considerable flexibility of the weapon and the electrification wires that trail behind each combatant. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;%C3%89p%C3%A9e#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Final_Trophee_Monal_2012_n08.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;%C3%89p%C3%A9e#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Fin...</a>')
