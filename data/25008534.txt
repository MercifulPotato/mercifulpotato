No way. While the Monorail episode is extremely good, I still have entire dialogues of &quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot; memorized, and I haven&#x27;t watched the Simpsons for over 10 years now. It&#x27;s perfect in every way until the very last second (&quot;Change the channel, Marge!&quot;), has an extremely economic and concise narration (just think of all the sub and side plots: the factory, the school contest, the quest of Homer to get Grimes to like him) and just delivers one memorable line after another, non-stop.<p>&quot;This is my son Bart. He owns a factory downtown.&quot;<p>&quot;Simpson, you&#x27;ve got a 5-13!!!&quot;<p>&quot;You went into outer space? <i>You?</i>&quot; -\n&quot;Sure. You&#x27;ve never been there? Would you like to see my Grammy award?&quot;<p>Also, the overall best TV show episode surely is Breaking Bad&#x27;s Ozymandias, although I admit that you can enjoy &quot;The Monorail&quot; and &quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot; as standalone episodes, whereas to fully appriciate &quot;Ozymandias&quot;, you need to have watched the entire series up to that point.')
