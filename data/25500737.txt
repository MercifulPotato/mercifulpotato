Item(by='rconti', descendants=None, kids=[25500983], score=None, time=1608591641, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25499968, text='BMW did this, too, starting with the E90 3 series, if I remember correctly. It&#x27;s awful, because in almost every car I drive, and especially in BMWs (E92 and the E70 X5 I own now), the steering wheel blocks the top of the speedometer and the turn signals entirely. The &quot;modern&quot; turn signal sounds are too soft to be heard over music, and the switch itself is stateless. I think BMW finally gave up on it for their newer models, but I&#x27;m not positive on this.<p>Both the Tesla and the X5 annoy me when I can&#x27;t tell the state of the switch by feel. Which is funny, because, IMO, BMW has some of the best-feeling and best-weighted stalks in the business. It sounds silly, but I positively LOVE the way engagement on the steering wheels stalks feel on my X5, and every other BMW I&#x27;ve owned or driven.')
