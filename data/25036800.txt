Can we do the math on how we&#x27;ve nearly blown ourselves up many times over, are destroying the environment, working 40+ hours&#x2F;week and so on?<p>Worth it for everyone to be &#x27;productive&#x27; for a collective increase of 1 or 2 years within your lifetime, assuming we don&#x27;t destroy the planet or blow ourselves up?<p>You decide, keep your productivity if you wish, I&#x27;m going for a walk and enjoying my life :)')
