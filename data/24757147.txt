I haven&#x27;t done it in a bit, but I think when you get to the disk partitioning step, you need to click &quot;custom&quot;, which then shows your disk layout, and you can have it create the partitions in the empty space. The installer will make the Windows bootloader the default that loads after a reboot, but this can be easily switched back either in your BIOS or using a tool like efibootmgr.')
