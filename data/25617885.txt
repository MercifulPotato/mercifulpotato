I&#x27;ve long wondered if the growth line of EVs would end up being yet another example of an S-curve rather than linear as so many seem to expect. It definitely seems like there are potential tipping point factors on both sides of the equation, because fossil fuel infrastructure has a ton of capex and opex that works due to massive amortization across a big enough fleet. And simultaneously justification for huge EV infrastructure investments, and the mass manufacturing necessary to keep prices marching down, faces some level of bootstrapping and amortization issues too. Plus, lack itself is a hindrance if people aren&#x27;t confident about charging up.<p>But it&#x27;s easy to see how that could flip, and then in a surprising hurry go in reverse. At some level of shrinking ICE usage a lot of gas stations themselves become non-viable. And then suddenly it starts to get harder to fuel up, in turn driving the dynamic even faster right? It seems probable that there will be some inertia due to lagging specialized applications, demand amongst niches like collectors, etc for a while. But it seems possible the new equilibrium might get reached non-linearly. And that&#x27;s ignoring and political tipping points that could happen too, if a majority of people have EVs, or even a very sizable minority (say 20-40%), what happens to political support for current extensive systems of explicit and implicit subsidies fossil fuels enjoy?')
