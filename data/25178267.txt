Second, if we were talking on-premises, you can get into a NetApp controller for FAR less than $40k a year, but that&#x27;s not really relevant to OP.<p>There are two options in AWS: one where you get an entire virtual storage system to yourself but also need to have some NetApp expertise (although less than on-premises).  You can find pricing here:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.netapp.com&#x2F;pricing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.netapp.com&#x2F;pricing</a><p>And one where you just consume the NFS&#x2F;SMB shares more akin to EFS (pricing at the bottom of the page):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.netapp.com&#x2F;cloud-volumes-service-for-aws" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.netapp.com&#x2F;cloud-volumes-service-for-aws</a><p>In both instances you can get better pricing than what is on that page by working with a partner, but if you don&#x27;t want to you can buy directly through AWS and pay a slight premium.')
