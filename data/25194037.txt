It&#x27;s the removal of property without due process. I&#x27;m not on team &quot;taxation is theft,&quot; but if this isn&#x27;t theft, private property doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>(I&#x27;d be totally okay with seizing property from <i>convicted</i> criminal enterprises <i>with due process</i>. Excusing this because it happens to mostly affect people who turn out to have been criminals seems about as defensible in my mind as excusing vigilantes who happen to be mostly accurate.)')
