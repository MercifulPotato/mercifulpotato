As someone that has gone through something similar about two months ago, and who is still grieving, I can tell you that I share the same thought - &quot;Part of me knows that death wasn&#x27;t something my Grandma feared&quot; - and I believe we are right. That generation of people is extremely strong - they went through much more than we did. Your Grandma stoically handled the nursing home and every conversation with you, but so did you. In a way, I believe she was preparing you for her death. When my other Grandma passed away she told me that I should not worry or stress, but just grieve and reminisce, and that change of generation is required for the world to function properly.<p>I know the last few conversations you had with your Grandma were at times extremely hard to handle for you, as mine were with my Grandma. I&#x27;m making a lot of assumptions here and I apologize if they are off in any way. Grieve, reminisce and once again, I&#x27;m so sorry for your loss. I had to comment as this resonated with me on multiple levels.')
