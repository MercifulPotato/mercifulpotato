Let&#x27;s think on the reasons Gmail is so popular:<p>1. It&#x27;s very easy to get to.<p>2. It has incredibly fast search that has 0 setup.<p>We have never really even tried to address problem 1 as an open source community. Networks, name lookup, and VPNs remain incredibly complex topics that beginners cannot hope to wrestle with. The best we have is .mdns which either works magically or perversely refuses to work.<p>Similarly for free text search, the software world simply hasn&#x27;t delivered a lego-like solution for email search. You CAN rig up any number of open source projects but it is neither easy nor instant. And even other professional products like Apple Mail struggle with a mere gigabyte of email.<p>Despite the fact that it&#x27;s 2021 and every successful email provider aggressively solves these problems, the open source world still debates about the utility of ubiquitous search or pretends that local networking isn&#x27;t a pressing problem.')
