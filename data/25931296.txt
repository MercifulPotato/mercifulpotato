Half the time, meme-status will make you a lot of money, too.<p>A more-sophisticated investor than I could also hedge against undesirable long-tail events.<p>To me, with a long-term&#x2F;value perspective, these transients are a bummer because they distract from efficient price discovery. But, with a long-term perspective, these transients are mostly irrelevant. If a quality company&#x27;s price drops precipitously, it is then on sale and worth buying. If it becomes quickly inflated, I can either hold with a smile or, if it is just too insane, sell with the expectation of buying in again later. The only real risk is of a meme-driven fluctuation shorting an otherwise-okay company into bankruptcy.')
