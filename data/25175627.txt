That&#x27;s a positive externality that&#x27;s worth the government making sure happens, as it wouldn&#x27;t necessarily happen without government involvement.<p>Similarly, public schooling (or publicly paid school) provides externalities: a literate society, a basic level of civic and cultural knowledge that people can assume as a baseline, opportunities for social mobility. None of those exist with a voluntary system.<p>This proposal doesn&#x27;t seem to pass that test: at least, nobody has proposed positive externalities that come out of this.')
