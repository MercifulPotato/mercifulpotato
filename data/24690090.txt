It&#x27;s become almost a meme that CSS is hard and a badge of honor to be ignorant of it, but it&#x27;s not that bad. I will concede that there are some annoying design decisions (like margin collapsing) but overall, I think it&#x27;s a well-designed and evolving solution that has stood the test of time. That we&#x27;ve been able to so easily add things like flexbox and Grid to it in response to the changing needs of the web is kind of a testament of how well CSS modelled the problem of layout. Learning box-model and cascading will let one solve 90% of common CSS problems people encounter just from first principles.')
