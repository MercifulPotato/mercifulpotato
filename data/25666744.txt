Also it is not clear if whatsapp implements the same:<p><pre><code>  - forward secrecy\n  - self-destruction\n  - forced destruction\n</code></pre>\nas telegram does. E.g. whatsapp seems to only have an option for 7 day self-destruction, which may be too long for some use cases, and no instant destruction. Neither of two are superior privacy-wise all things considered, but stating that always-on e2ee is a most important thing is probably naive. And then you have tg bots, ui&#x2F;keyboards, stickers, etc which for a regular user outweigh the security area entirely.<p>Also your virtual bet is lost because every time my circle discusses ‘hot’ topics in telegram (company issues, lawyer&#x2F;audit-related chats, recreational drug use, etc), we go secret and warn users who do otherwise. We can’t check whether that is common or not, because those who <i>have</i> to be ‘secret’ may resist to admit this activity.')
