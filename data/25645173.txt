I say this because I feel the way we approach certain disciplines like psychology (in an increasingly scientific and statistical way) is the wrong take, although it has worked well for most things in the past. Although we can make good experiments, we are missing the intuitive part of it. There are some truths about the way minds work that you can understand, but you can&#x27;t really write down or quantify, and science can do no help there.<p>For physics though, we have it down right. Do the experiment, did it work?.. it&#x27;s already the correct method. No need to improve there.')
