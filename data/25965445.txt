I refuse to believe that such a massive entity with so much resources at it&#x27;s disposal has a think-tank consisting of two interns and a comatose member of middle-management. I&#x27;ve seen this sequence of events multiple times:<p>1. Entity X does thing that directly harms&#x2F;angers people.<p>2. Entity X &#x27;apologizes&#x27; and says some variation of &quot;oopsies, didn&#x27;t mean to, just a miscommunication gone awry, we&#x27;ll definitely look into improving our internal processes in the future :)&quot;.<p>3. Entity X faces no real repercussions.<p>At what point does this become a violation of Occam&#x27;s Razor? That all of these decisions that somehow always leave the entity unharmed&#x2F;better off at the expense of others were not made with intentionality and&#x2F;or any remote understanding of their consequences? When do they wear away the benefit of the doubt?')
