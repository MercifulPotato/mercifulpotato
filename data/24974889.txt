What happened here was a marketing knife-war between companies in the container management space. Then someone (we&#x27;ll never remember who) tried to differentiate by coining this term, which basically means &quot;binaries with RPC&quot;.<p>Every binary in your &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F; is a microservice. Just type `watch date` and enjoy two microservices running, no need for containers&#x2F;kubernetes :)')
