Not true.<p>Life is complicated, we have a lot of things to focus on, most people like to do work at work, not get tangled in what might be suppressive or irrelevant social webs.<p>My bet is that 70% of people would prefer apolitical, 20% &#x27;moderate&#x27; and only 10% activism - of course - only if it&#x27;s specifically their view of activism.')
