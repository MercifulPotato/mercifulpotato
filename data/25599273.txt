Suppose then that two large governments, say the Unites States of America and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, get into a little tiff about some boats hanging around the Taiwan Strait.  Would these societies (in aggregate) prefer that their domestic and international trade be conducted in Bitcoin, or in a domestically-controlled currency?<p>A cartel could lock out a set of accounts from the Bitcoin network.  Perhaps only temporarily, but long enough to have serious effects.<p>&gt; power themselves off-grid through renewables<p>That&#x27;d be cool, but I doubt that off-grid will ever reach the efficiency and scale that on-grid will provide, due to fluctuations in the power sources and the economies of scale.  It&#x27;s hard to make a currency choice by betting on that technology, especially as the calculation could swap as the technology changes.')
