All the other BS like emailing, meetings, assisting with manual testing, responding to support related Slacks, fire fighting, setting up DB queries or visualizations, checking a result of some scheduled job (these last two being business asks &#x2F; annoyances and don&#x27;t happen daily but you get it), etc, results in 5-8 hours BS, 2-3 hours code.<p>Hobby projects I can work on for 10-12 hours straight and still feel like I could go longer, but after a three day sprint of this, I have to take at least a day off to regroup my thoughts and make sure I&#x27;m not too far away from the original intention &#x2F; goal, or over-engineering.')
