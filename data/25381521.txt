The tricky part is that at enough scale, humans are really the bottleneck. Teams step on each others toes, abuse schemas, add data to a schema &quot;because&quot;, etc, etc. Its possible that to best manage the humans, de-normalization and relying on replicated data stores with slightly different views of the data is simplest.<p>Add again if &quot;overly flexible&quot; is a long term product requirement, I&#x27;d argue you&#x27;re going to eventually need full text search with all the power of Lucene (I&#x27;m betting its on your roadmap).<p>If Fauna perfectly addresses this problem domain, its likely quite helpful, but this article did not convince me it&#x27;ll always be cheaper &#x2F; better than DynamoDB + ElasticSearch for the complex usecases. That said, I look forward to the day I&#x27;m proved wrong :)')
