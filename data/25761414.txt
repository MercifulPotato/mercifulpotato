I&#x27;m sympathetic to the underdog that&#x27;s being targeted so I have my bias, but I have a hard time watching any platform (I&#x27;ve never used parler) get targeted because of politics. I have a hard time believing that anyone truly believes parler was the primary reason DC riots happened just as I have a hard time understanding that people actually think this targeted de platforming will somehow create fewer extremists. In my mind it&#x27;s rather obvious political targeting creates extremism and there are a number of platforms those extremists can use to communicate.')
