If you wanted wide distribution of getting a message out to the world (or even wider than your literal public square), you needed it to be published &amp; distributed. That means you had convince a publisher (i.e. a private corporation) to print your pamphlet or have the means to buy your own press. You also had to physically get it into people&#x27;s hands. The Internet reduces these costs so that making your thoughts available to anyone is easier today than it ever was.<p>Even if it was, that still doesn&#x27;t show any implied intention (it certainly is not explicit) of some <i>right</i> for one&#x27;s speech to be heard. Enforcing such a right would be impossible and probably contradictory to some other freedoms granted in the bill of rights.')
