Item(by='keiferski', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604216081, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24957617, text='SRS is the classic <i>technical user</i> situation. Anki looks like it’s from 1995 and has a massive initial learning curve with specialized vocabulary to learn (Cloze, decks, etc.) When it’s advertised, the copy is overly technical and confusing to the average person. Just look at SuperMemo’s home page, for an example:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supermemo.com&#x2F;en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supermemo.com&#x2F;en</a><p>To get widespread SRS adoption, two things need to happen:<p>1. The primary software needs to be simplified and prettified. The aesthetics of Anki are unappealing to pretty much everyone. And just using it has a learning curve far greater than basically every other popular app.<p>2. The marketing message needs to be about benefits, not features. No one cares about the forgetting curve or the intricacies of available card types. Everyone cares about saving time and money, learning cool stuff, and having fun.')
