I want to know what someone really thinks not what they think they have to say so that others don&#x27;t jump on top of them and get them into line with what you are supposed to say.<p>Maybe someone should draw a line if a close relative of friend died but not a public figure celebrity etc. I read your comment more like &#x27;get a life if this is what upsets you in some way&#x27;.<p>What I think? Didn&#x27;t like his music (not a fan) but even if it was someone who I liked it wouldn&#x27;t matter to me. For one thing (not the only thing one thing) none of these artists are typically making any good music anymore and even if they did the entertainment they provided can be easily replaced by another of thousands of artists.<p>By the way I would feel the same way about the worship by people about some tech figure dying or getting sick. It&#x27;s not because it&#x27;s music.<p>Harsh? Point is I don&#x27;t think people should assume that everyone cares about this nor should people be afraid that they won&#x27;t say the right or sensitive thing.')
