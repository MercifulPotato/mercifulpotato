What I like about that model it is a reasonable balance of customers actually paying for the thing they use (so the business owner isn&#x27;t beholden to advertising or tempted to abuse data access), and supporting the open source community (without which most of the modern web couldn&#x27;t exist). I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s entirely without risk - you need enough paid use to cover the costs of the open source use. But I think it&#x27;s an ethical and sustainable approach if you can achieve that.<p>And, again, restyled is open source - if you don&#x27;t trust the owner, you can run it yourself.')
