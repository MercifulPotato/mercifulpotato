Item(by='fingerlocks', descendants=None, kids=[24773600], score=None, time=1602641367, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24768511, text='&gt; who mumbled something about &quot;advanced functionality&quot;.<p>This isn&#x27;t fair. Each lightning connector has a small chip with MFI certification info, performs the magical asymmetric  pin switching for reversibility, and in some situations it informs the device of the cable&#x27;s purpose and functionality. E.g., at one company we built a custom lightning cable for high-speed (at the time) RT video streamed from a consumer camera. The cable&#x27;s pins could be configured ad-hoc to support data transfer (when streaming) or power transfer (charging the camera) as needed.<p>Sure, today this can be done without a special cable and some custom USB drivers, but 8 years ago it was really cool.')
