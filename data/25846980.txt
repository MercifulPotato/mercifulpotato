My wife and I started looking at buying land in mid-2020 and saw a handful of plots we were interested in. What stopped us from committing to buying one was internet service because we&#x27;re both remote workers who require at least 50&#x2F;10 mbit for both of us to be working without issue.<p>In the present it is fairly straightforward to get around no power, no water and no sewages with solar, well and septic system. If you don&#x27;t have internet service though there&#x27;s not much you can do to get around that.<p>Starlink has changed that. I suspect we&#x27;ll also see an uprise in prefabricated homes as well. I want to live further out to escape the city, have a family garden, and a couple chickens but I don&#x27;t want to have to build our home by hand.')
