It vexes them in the same way that many with color television sets were long ago bothered by the anachronism of black-and-white films, even carefully conceived black-and-white films. For them, The Wire seems frustrating or inaccessible – even more so than we intended it. And, hey, we are always in it to tell people a story, first and foremost. If a new format brings a few more thirsty critters to the water’s edge, then so be it.<p>It&#x27;s too bad they don&#x27;t offer a 4:3 HD version for those of us who care about high definition but want to respect the original composition. Same goes for Buffy, which is a complete mess in 16:9.<p>I watch many old movies on my 1080p projector to a 16:9 100&quot; screen and don&#x27;t mind side bars at all.')
