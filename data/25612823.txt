Variables are dropped (and hence unborrowed) in reverse order. So &#x27;a will necessarily be dropped before its owner, hence it&#x27;s shorter than &#x27;static.<p>As you can see it complains that it&#x27;s dropped at the end of main() even though it should be borrowed for &#x27;static. If this was an owned value it would NOT be dropped at main() since it would be moved into the function on call.<p>Nothing surprising here.<p>&gt; &amp;a can live up to the end of the application<p>Nope. Imagine spawning a thread and passing &amp;a but keeping &#x27;a&#x27; in your main thread.<p>&gt; bow out of this conversation thread I&#x27;m afraid<p>Welp I did what I could.')
