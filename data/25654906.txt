AFAICT it&#x27;s just one guy right now, and even if it were a small team that still sounds like a bargain. I would expect it to take at least a small team within Apple to get Linux running on their new hardware.<p>I worked on SoC chip bring-up at Qualcomm for a few years and it&#x27;s literally hundreds of engineers working for weeks to get Linux running, and that&#x27;s with not only technical documentation but direct access to the hardware engineers who designed the stuff. That was 5 years ago but I assume not much has changed.<p>If this one guy (or a small group) ports Linux to the new MacBooks on a &quot;Patreon salary&quot; I&#x27;d say we got a smoking good deal. I&#x27;m rooting for them and happily donating.')
