Same goes for sharing snippets with colleagues to explain&#x2F;understand ehat is happening. Even Go has shown that there is value in not putting a lot of context in every single word of your language: it makes it longer to write, but easier to read whrn you have no prior experience of said piece of code.<p>There is definitely a balance to be found, but I believe most languages today (and, unfortunately, programmers) rely too much on an IDE even though there&#x27;s a large enough part of our work happening outside of it.')
