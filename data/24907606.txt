Part of Amiga&#x27;s influence was its ability to show us what computing could do in our day to day life (games, video, etc.) that we didn&#x27;t even know we wanted until it was there. So I have to think there&#x27;s <i>something</i> that could come along and capture that essence again. I&#x27;d say the iPhone represented a similar qualitative jump, though by that time Apple had lost the identity of David to the industry&#x27;s Goliath.<p>I lack the creativity to guess what the next thing might be, but if I was put on the spot, I&#x27;d say perhaps VR. Some device&#x2F;software combo will come along and make VR accessible and sensible for the masses.')
