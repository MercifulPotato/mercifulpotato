Item(by='craftinator', descendants=None, kids=[25715179], score=None, time=1610245297, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25699430, text='&gt; New York City was not overwhelmed in the first wave, and had both Javits and the Mercy as unused spare capacity.<p>This is not in line with the facts as I understand them. Multiple health care workers I know told me in March-April that their ability to treat Covid patients were capped by constrained resources (not enough ventilators, not enough staff, not enough beds) during the first wave. Here [1] is an article that supports these anecdotes.<p>Also, the Navy hospital ships refused to accept patient transfers, even as the hospitals were completely full [2]. &quot;On top of its strict rules preventing people infected with the virus from coming on board, the Navy is also refusing to treat a host of other conditions. &quot; and &quot;Mr. Dowling said he has had to tear his hospitals apart, retrofitting any unused space, including lobbies and conference rooms, into hospital wards.&quot;.<p>So no, you are incorrect. NY hospitals were absolutely overrun during the first wave. Please do not perpetuate a narrative that isn&#x27;t supported by facts.<p>1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;30&#x2F;us&#x2F;brooklyn-hospital-coronavirus-patients-deaths&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;30&#x2F;us&#x2F;brooklyn-hospital-coronavi...</a><p>2) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;02&#x2F;nyregion&#x2F;ny-coronavirus-usns-comfort.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;02&#x2F;nyregion&#x2F;ny-coronavirus-u...</a>')
