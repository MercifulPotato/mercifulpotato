The employee can&#x27;t just decide to do overtime for extra pay (usually 150-200% hourly rate), neither can the company order an employee to do overtime hours. Both agree how many hours are needed and what should be accomplished by working extra hours.<p>I can _voluntarily_ work longer hours and &quot;bank&quot; those, I&#x27;m also free to use my banked hours at a time of my choosing or be compensated for those hours with money. For example I can do 9 hours from monday to thursday and leave at noon on friday for a nice long afternoon&#x2F;evening with my family.')
