I cried a lot, I begged doctors to make it go away, I went to the ER.<p>The fact is you can&#x27;t stay like that forever - you either kill yourself, or you somehow learn to live with it.<p>You don&#x27;t get used to chronic pain, but you <i>adjust</i> to a new &quot;normal&quot; level of pain. You develop coping mechanisms and learn to &quot;bury it&quot;, get on with it as best you can. If you&#x27;re lucky, you find some medication that actually helps somewhat. You research your condition and possible remedies, a lot. All of this isn&#x27;t to say it gets easy, believe me it fecking well does <i>not</i>.<p>A lot of people (doctors included) don&#x27;t seem to <i>believe</i> that you can be in severe pain, while sitting and conversing with them - &quot;he seems fine to me!&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ll add as well that I&#x27;m one of the &quot;lucky&quot; ones for whom a diagnostic test (skin biopsy) has shown concrete evidence that doctors believe in - without that, you&#x27;ll get nothing but platitudes and shown the door. You&#x27;ll probably also get told you have fibromyalgia, even if you don&#x27;t remotely fit the criteria. I know this firsthand, because I have had to research and guide clueless doctors and insist on tests, and insist on re-tests when they&#x27;ve messed up.')
