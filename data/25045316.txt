If the Quran and the Hadiths were a much more tame and apolitical document then we wouldn&#x27;t get the extent and mode of fighting that we experience now.<p>Japan in WW2 fits into this third theory of conflict as well. Yes it was partly fear of the Soviets, partly resentment (and fear of missing out) over European colonialism, but the rabid belief in nationalism and race superiority was also a big causal factor as well. Their reasons for advancing so aggressively into China and South Asia have nothing to do with oppression and nothing to do with a rational theory of conflict. Many thought the war with US was impossible to win, their industrial production capacity was 1&#x2F;20th that of the US for instance. Pearl Harbor was a suicidal all-in motivated by them running out of oil combined with their inability to surrender (rabid nationalism).<p>Very often these human drivers related to cognitive bias, fanatic belief, tribalism, are at the root.')
