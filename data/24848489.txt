When one is fixing bugs locally before the thing goes into production one can use each and every debugging strategy under the sun to find the bug. If it runs 10 times slower because of generating massive logs that is acceptable when debugging locally. In production one is constrained to debugging techniques that do not disturb production. This constraint quite often makes debugging times longer by factors of 10 if not 100 while at the same time a customer is getting somewhat impatient.<p>Also, the bug that would be discoverable locally but not in production is a bit of a strange animal. It does happen for cases where the developer has a better idea than the user what should be happening so the user will not even notice the bug. That sounds more like features that have been specified in too much detail than true bugs, though. More commonly everything that can go wrong locally will go wrong in production sooner or later. And in production you will, on top of that, hit all of the bugs that occur once every month and that only occur if the order of inputs is a bit strange while the database is under some load. If you have not done all possible debug&#x2F;test work locally the application will hit production when there still is a lot of debug work to do and there will probably be so many problems that they even start interacting with one another and produce some really &#x27;interesting&#x27; failures.')
