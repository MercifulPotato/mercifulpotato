With the hard link, there are two directory entries pointing to the same data on the disk. At that point, removing the original with a &quot;rm&quot; unlinks the original but the new directory entry for the file remains.<p>As a bonus, ln will not overwrite the destination file if you mistakenly try to &quot;ln&quot; it to an existing file.')
