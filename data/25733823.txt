There isn&#x27;t a point in being resilient against being dropped by one service if they all drop you in unison. If you try to take payments you will be dropped by all of the payment processors. If you try to run bare metal and are dropped by cloudflare you will be DDOS&#x27;d to death. If you go p2p you&#x27;ll need to be able to ship native apps which will be dropped from the app stores or denied a certificate. Side-loading is already dead in iOS and things are moving that way for other major operating systems including desktop.<p>If you are an illegal business there are a multitude of ways of working around many of these issues (using fake identities with hosting companies and other services, making money via shady malware riddled ad services, money laundering, etc...)<p>Until recently I thought that p2p&#x2F;crypto&#x2F;etc was the solution but since you cannot do true p2p in the browser and must ship native code, at the end of the day you will still need the blessing of Apple&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Microsoft and agree to their TOS to exist. Of course this is perfect storm that happens rarely but it&#x27;s still chilling to watch it unfold despite how contemptible the target is.')
