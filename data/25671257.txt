The intentions are indeed purer (if the comparison is restricted solely to someone breaching the Capitol building exclusively due to sincere belief the election was rigged [without displaying bigoted&#x2F;fascist regalia&#x2F;symbols] and someone burning down an arbitrary, unrelated private business after George Floyd&#x27;s death), but two things:<p>- That&#x27;s partly why this really highlights the cold immorality and&#x2F;or the abject delusion of the fomenter of this activity more than it does for most of the mob. I don&#x27;t necessarily think most of the protestors and rioters are immoral or trying to be malicious: I think they genuinely believe what their leader is telling them and believe they&#x27;re doing a righteous thing to protect the Constitution and the country. So for a large subset of the people, I think Trump deserves more blame for this than they do, whatever the underlying reasoning behind his actions.<p>- It&#x27;s difficult to accurately debate this without empirical classification of offenses (what people did and how many people did them), otherwise it&#x27;s easy to start reducing a broad situation to one symbolized by its least or most admirable participants.')
