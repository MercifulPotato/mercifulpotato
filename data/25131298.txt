For example:<p><pre><code>    Browser -----Request-to-SE-----&gt; Search Engine\n      ^                                   |\n      |                      Unfiltered Results (In YAML&#x2F;JSON)\n      |                                   |\n      |                                   V\n      |--Desired Results------ Local Filtering&#x2F;Rendering\n</code></pre>\nOn a private scale, if you are only crawling sites on the allow list than you have the possibility of being able to better maintain a local database of sites to show up on the search.<p>Edit: Possibly this could be easier to use to set up distributed search as well, as each node could index a given list, and then distribute that list similarly to DNS. Don&#x27;t really know how well that would work though, just an idea.')
