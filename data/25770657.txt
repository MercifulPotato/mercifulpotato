Maybe it&#x27;s going to be like in the 1970s and early 1980s when mainframes ruled supreme and you would rent these machines or compute time thereon.<p>People are accustomed to &quot;the cloud&quot; already, so it&#x27;s not really a regression going back to centralised computing for a bit.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;320891331_Experimental_Demonstration_of_a_Josephson_Magnetic_Memory_Cell_with_a_Programmable_p-Junction" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;320891331_Experimen...</a>')
