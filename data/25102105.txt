I can only describe why I prefer Vim. I specifically do not recommend it to anybody else - it&#x27;s hard enough to learn that you have to decide on your own that you want to make the effort.<p>In my opinion, the real drag of conventional text editing is constantly having to move between the keyboard and mouse. That&#x27;s a much more physically and mentally expensive mode switch than any editor mode switch. It always tends to hurt my focus on whatever I&#x27;m working on. Vim feels like I have all of the movement types in muscle memory, and it just seems to happen automatically.<p>I know all editors have keyboard shortcuts. I think they&#x27;re all much more awkward and inefficient than Vim though. Too many steps and too much thought for &quot;how do I move the cursor over there without using the mouse&quot;. When it gets beyond the basics, the keyboard shortcuts either don&#x27;t exist at all, or vary widely between editors. How do I split a view into 2 sections and switch between them with only the keyboard in VS Code? Beats me. Oh it may be possible, but if so, it&#x27;s probably different in IDEA, Eclipse, full VS, Sublime Text, etc. Vim is always Vim.<p>I also find most of the IDE features for live error checking and auto-complete to be more distracting than helpful, at least for dynamic languages. It&#x27;s subtly annoying and harmful to my focus for my editor to be constantly trying to tell me about the &quot;syntax errors&quot; in code I&#x27;m not finished writing yet, or to constantly pop up completely wrong autocomplete suggestions. I prefer to run these checks or unit tests explicitly on command, when I&#x27;m ready for it.')
