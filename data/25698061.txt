Maryland Governor Larry Hogan (R):<p>&quot;I was actually on the phone with Leader Hoyer who was pleading with us to send the guard,&quot; Hogan said, The Post reported. &quot;He was yelling across the room to Schumer and they were back and forth saying we do have the authorization and I&#x27;m saying, &#x27;I&#x27;m telling you we do not have the authorization.&#x27;&quot;<p>As rioters smashed windows and forced lawmakers into hiding, the head of the Maryland National Guard was told he could not come to the aid of US Capitol police, per Hogan.<p>Ninety minutes later, according to Hogan, the secretary of the Army, Ryan McCarthy, called him to request the deployment.<p>Typically such calls come from the US Secretary of Defense.
