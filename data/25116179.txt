I&#x27;m aware of these systems (my office workstation is an EliteDesk) however, these systems are not suitable for me for various reasons.<p>I make staggered updates and these systems are not very receptive for that. I wouldn&#x27;t want to change my case just to upgrade the motherboard and the CPU. Also, I&#x27;m not sure that a small EliteDesk tower can accommodate all my disks (2HDDs plus 2SSDs) neither space, nor power-wise. I also use a PCIe sound card (for sound quality reasons) which needs a PSU connection via floppy connector.<p>At the end of the day, these systems are very nice as-is, but I need to get them as a package and they&#x27;re not very flexible. My desktop usage scenario and update path is not very suitable for that.<p>Last but, not the least; I like to build my own desktop computers.')
