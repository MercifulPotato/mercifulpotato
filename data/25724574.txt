Item(by='jhanschoo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610339749, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25721221, text='&gt; The way this forum was purged from the internet is making me uncomfortable. I never used Parler, and I really don&#x27;t care about the fact that it&#x27;s gone. But the way that a handful of private companies effectively decides who gets to reach an audience and who doesn&#x27;t is deeply troubling. We&#x27;re increasingly becoming a world where what is and isn&#x27;t allowed in the public sphere is controlled by a handful of corporate leaders.<p>Historically, for a forum with nationwide reach, you were nevertheless reliant on periodicals and newspapers and their editors, or running your own publishing.<p>If there was a will, there&#x27;s still a way: sites like The Pirate Bay, Library Genesis, and WikiLeaks still find a way to stay up; and they definitely run their own servers though of course there&#x27;s more that&#x27;s needed. That kind of effort is what one must be prepared for. It can likely find friendly vendors if willing to look beyond US companies.')
