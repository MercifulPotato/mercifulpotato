Since shareholders own the company, wouldn&#x27;t this mean that the shareholders who didn&#x27;t sue are effectively paying the shareholders who did?<p>That makes sense if the shareholders who sued were somehow specifically affected, but if the effect is a drop in stock price, all shareholders were affected equally, so it doesn&#x27;t make sense for some shareholders to compensate others.')
