It sounds really obvious but the main problem experienced by homeless people is the lack of long term accommodation caused by their not being able to afford long term accommodation.<p>In the medium and long term people develop severe substance abuse habits and lose their ability to get and hold down a job (sometimes called economic scarring).<p>You can use additional money to do basically do poverty relief programs on the medium and long term homeless and from a humanity point of view that&#x27;s really important - but I don&#x27;t know of any programs that have consistently shown reintegrated of these populations. That is, they are working other than in services aimed at the homeless population.<p>It needs to be partnered with stopping putting people on the front of the belt (the short term homeless) which is only really achievable through bringing down the cost of long term accommodation. I only know of one way to do that which is to build more homes.')
