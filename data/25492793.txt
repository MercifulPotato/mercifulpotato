It can barely play Minecraft on medium graphics but it&#x27;s basically done every software development task I&#x27;ve cared to throw at it. Granted I&#x27;m not doing deep learning or building the Linux kernel but for building web applications it&#x27;s fine. It is extremely slow at running the Android emulator, however.')
