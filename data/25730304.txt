Why should your apps <i>and</i> your data be on your own server? Sandstorm and Cloudron already do this, and make it user-friendly to install, remove, and share web apps with people from a private space. Furthermore, Sandstorm also <i>assumes</i> apps are malicious, so it is relatively safe to install proprietary apps on-device and still prevent data exfiltration.<p>There are very few types of apps which truly need a third party server to work.')
