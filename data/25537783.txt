But they then showed the world how to deal with it and shared all of the relevant information as early as February. The failed responses by all European states and the US, most&#x2F;all Latin American states, most Middle Eastern states etc. can in no way be blamed on China.<p>If you want to see what a non-story this virus could have been if there were political will to do the right thing, you need only look at Vietnam. They are a 100M-people state taht have 4 times fewer cases in total by today than 10M people Sweden gets each and every day.<p>Edit: China tried to downplay -&gt; China tried to cover up')
