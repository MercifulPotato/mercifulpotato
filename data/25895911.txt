According to Wikipedia, the word &#x27;man&#x27; has adopted the meaning of &#x27;adult male human&#x27; as its primary meaning starting with Middle English, when it displaced Old English &#x27;wer&#x27;. There are still uses where it retains the much older meaning, but its primary meaning today is &#x27;adult male human&#x27;, and has been for a good few hundred years.')
