Clojure is a small, stable language (few changes over the years) that encourages creation of DSLs through macros. It provides solid ground on which to build the abstraction you want, so it&#x27;s possible to build these EE-ish indirection nightmares if that&#x27;s what you need.<p>Clojure&#x27;s design allows it to serve the needs of both hobbyists and enterprise, but the latter requires strong, disciplined developers who understand to avoid loose, hobbyist code that the language allows, and who will agree on which patterns to use in the codebase (something the hobbyist gets for free mostly). It&#x27;s a punishing language for a project with high developer turnover.')
