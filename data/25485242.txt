Without having beliefs we would be no different than an ML model, which just keeps adjusting weights according to the data it receives. Each of us has some beliefs, which &quot;seems right&quot; to us and this is what shapes our understanding of what we see around us, no matter what the &quot;data&quot; says.<p>If the belief is weak (or false), it might lead to confusion and distrust, which will make it impossible to learn anything.<p>Also, experiencing heightened states of awareness is not necessarily beneficial, people on drugs experience it routinely.')
