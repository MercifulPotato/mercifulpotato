Warranty work is due to manufacturer defect and defects can happen with ICE vehicles or EVs. Just look at the build quality issues Tesla was having.<p>Maintenance and repair issues go far beyond the engine.  Power train, electrical, doors, windows, brakes, lighting - all of which EVs still have.  Yeah, it’s great when you don’t need an oil or filter change twice a year, but that’s about all the maintenance an ICE needs.')
