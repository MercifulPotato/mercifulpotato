I think the government farms this task out to insurers specifically so the insurer can take the heat for the denials, when it&#x27;s actually the government&#x27;s rules and standards for the requested therapies that is resulting in denial of coverage.<p>I&#x27;ve personally seen this with Medicaid or CMS penalizing for erroneously approving payment for treatments and also erroneously denying payment for treatments.  And it gets very fun when the rules are not clear and there is a lot of gray area.')
