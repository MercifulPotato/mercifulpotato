X.org has been in the so called &quot;maintenance mode&quot; for years and any development on the current main project is dead in its tracks, this is a well known fact. But no &quot;drop in&quot; replacement exists as of now, nor in the foreseeable future it seems there will be one - Wayland is an alternative, if you limit yourself to anything that is properly supported, with fundamental design differences (necessary for a more &quot;modern&quot;, efficient approach to the current technologies), but I personally can&#x27;t but think it&#x27;s dead on arrival. There was some quote from the original developers of X.org about only few people in the world being able to grasp it in its entirety and I believe it&#x27;s gotta be true.')
