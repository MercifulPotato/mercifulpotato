In particular why do articles about corruption in the US (and other first world countries), never feature the word &quot;corruption&quot; explicitly? It is implied that there is corruption but it is never explicitly stated.\nIf this article was about some less developed country, the word would appear endlessly throughout the text.\nSeems like western journalists have bias when it comes to using that word.')
