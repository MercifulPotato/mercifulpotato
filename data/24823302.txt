Sure if it’s still open (the article was from January) then that’s not good but Chrome has thousands of open bugs as well and likely some that would give me pause. The fact that Google is the one giving Apple a hard time might indicate a bit of an agenda since it’s their competitor..<p>Google literally sends your browsing habits from pages visited to mouse movements to their servers where they link it with your other Google info like Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Maps GPS tracking via your phone. Google products “leak” all the users data back to the mothership as a feature. And Chrome users tend to use a lot of random extensions which means the data usually leaks to a lot of unknown third parties as well (see DataSpii for one example which effected millions of Chrome and Firefox users)<p>So yes let’s expect higher standards from all browser developers. But realistically Apple likely fixed the bug or has a very good reason why it’s difficult to entirely patch yet. Google has had many extended data leaks as well but they actually build tools to gather your data up in the first place which makes it that much riskier should it get stolen or misused by Google or Google employees.')
