Very few dependencies. No config files, and only a single CLI parameter required to run the server.<p>* Clients can be remote controlled by the server, and each client can open an arbitrary number of tunnels. ie you don&#x27;t have to start a separate ngrok process for each tunnel. Just set up the client on each machine you want to tunnel out of and forget about it. Everything is controlled \nthrough a simple web UI (or REST api).<p>* Automate as much as possible. Tunnel creation and Let&#x27;s Encrypt are already working. Eventually you&#x27;ll be able to add an API token from your DNS provider and that&#x27;ll be automated as well.<p>It&#x27;s not quite ready (launch planned for 31 Oct 2020), but you can check it out here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boringproxy.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boringproxy.io&#x2F;</a><p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24475946" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24475946</a>')
