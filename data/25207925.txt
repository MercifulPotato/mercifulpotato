I have foreseen this &quot;Apple goal&quot; in the past and the only thing thats keeping me to use MacOS is Little Snitch and Mullvad VPN combination. Sadly in Linux world there is no commercially viable option for access rules per app basis and I don&#x27;t understand why. I don&#x27;t have answer for another question: As a business I learned from Apple that keeping tight security and protecting your intellectual property is big thing. How on earth big business is complicit in this telemetry approach from Microsoft, Google and Apple? If you are business captured metadata is enough to know important metrics about your company and this may work against you in the long term. Thats why I am against cloud based apps (like Figma), and I am furious with Sketch for not providing collaboration solution and bragging about &quot;Mac Only&quot; approach.')
