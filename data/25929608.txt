The trainee put the epidural in the wrong spot three times and ended up giving my wife Horner&#x27;s syndrome after the final insert.  The older anesthesiologist didn&#x27;t notice the failed attempts because he was staring at something on the TV in the room.  I eventually told him he needed to pay attention because his resident kept screwing up.<p>Also, I suspect (but cannot prove) that our daughter ended up in the NICU because of additional failings during delivery related to a very long period of trying to induce while our daughter did not have sufficient oxygen.')
