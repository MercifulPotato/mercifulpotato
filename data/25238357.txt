One doesn&#x27;t even need correctness, performance, privacy, etc as can be seen from a multitude of very successful projects.<p>But it&#x27;s there for those that really need it and personally I like it because it shows what we can achieve when a massive group of experts from all over the planet gets together and they nurture a project over many decades which has to work for such a broad set of use cases under the most strict and diverse of requirements, from avionics to mobile apps, physics simulations to cutting edge video games, medical devices to smartwatches and so on.<p>These two languages have contributed so much to what we have achieved and they&#x27;re part of our digital heritage. Maybe that&#x27;s another reason that they had to be standardized, so that they belong to everyone. :-)')
