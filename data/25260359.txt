The challenges of scaling wider CPUs within available power budgets is widely accepted: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cse.wustl.edu&#x2F;~roger&#x2F;560M.f18&#x2F;CSE560-Superscalar.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cse.wustl.edu&#x2F;~roger&#x2F;560M.f18&#x2F;CSE560-Superscalar...</a> (for &quot;high-performance per watt cores,&quot; optimal &quot;issue width is ~2&quot;). Intel designed an entire architecture, Itanium, around the theory that OOO scaling would hit a point of diminishing returns. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realworldtech.com&#x2F;poulson" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.realworldtech.com&#x2F;poulson</a> (&quot;Many of them were convinced that dynamic instruction scheduling and out-of-order execution would ultimately prove to be too complex and power hungry.&quot;). It is also well accepted that we are hitting limits on ability to extract instruction-level parallelism: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docencia.ac.upc.edu&#x2F;master&#x2F;MIRI&#x2F;PD&#x2F;docs&#x2F;03-HPCProcessorDesign.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docencia.ac.upc.edu&#x2F;master&#x2F;MIRI&#x2F;PD&#x2F;docs&#x2F;03-HPCProces...</a> (&quot;There just arenâ€™t enough instructions that can actually be executed in parallel!&quot;); <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;compas.cs.stonybrook.edu&#x2F;~nhonarmand&#x2F;courses&#x2F;sp16&#x2F;cse502&#x2F;slides&#x2F;14-beyond_ILP.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;compas.cs.stonybrook.edu&#x2F;~nhonarmand&#x2F;courses&#x2F;sp16&#x2F;cs...</a> (&quot;Hardly more than 1-2 IPC on real workloads&quot;).<p>Apple being able to wring robust performance out of an 8-wide 3.2 GHz design, on a variety of benchmarks, is impressive and unexpected. For example, the M1 outperforms a Ryzen 5950X by 15%. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-tested&#x2F;4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16252&#x2F;mac-mini-apple-m1-teste...</a>. Zen 3 is either 4- or 8-wide decode (depending on whether you hit the micro-op cache) and boosts to 5 GHz. It beats the 10900k, a 4+1-way design that boosts to 5.1 GHz, by 25%. The GCC subtest, meanwhile, is famous for being branch-heavy code with low parallelism. Apple extracting 80% more IPC from that test than AMD&#x27;s latest core (which is already a very impressive, very wide core to begin with!) is very unexpected.<p>A lot of the conventional wisdom is based on assumptions about branch prediction and memory disambiguation, which have major impacts on how much ILP you can extract: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cse.uaa.alaska.edu&#x2F;~afkjm&#x2F;cs448&#x2F;handouts&#x2F;ILP-limitations.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cse.uaa.alaska.edu&#x2F;~afkjm&#x2F;cs448&#x2F;handouts&#x2F;ILP-limi...</a>. To do so well, Apple must be doing something very impressive on both fronts.')
