If two places have the same practice with different religions it does not mean the practice is thus cultural and not religious. Both Utah and Saudi Arabia have traditions of polygyny. But this clearly springs from religion. The polygyny mentioned is not cultural.<p>Lack of knowledge about Islam will lead you to the conclusion you came to, but Muslims will know that contact with animals affects ones ritual purity. And ritual purity is important when you have daily rituals. Cats do not affect the purity while other animals do. This is the reason, for Muslims, why cats are common and held in high esteem. There may be many factors into why cats are around but Muslims will tell you it is religious and cite religious doctrine to show that, how will you then determine that, to the contrary, it&#x27;s actually cultural?')
