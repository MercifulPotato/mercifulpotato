It died after only a couple years of extremely seldom use.<p>My favorite part? The software. It was <i>very Japanese</i>. Very ugly and very functional. Little jingles for everything. A ton of useful functions out of the box. First rate mobile support. It was so easy to use I&#x27;m honestly sad the POS printing part stopped working.')
