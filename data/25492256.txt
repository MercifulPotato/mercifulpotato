This is the easiest part of exploit writing. All linux distros run ELF binaries just fine.<p>People who are trying to package things in a correct way, where the user can list the installed program, uninstall it, have configuration stored in standardized locations, etc... that&#x27;s actually a harder problem. But just because writing a &quot;correct&quot; package varies a bit by distro doesn&#x27;t mean an exploit, which doesn&#x27;t have to follow packaging guidelines, has the same difficulty.<p>In addition, you&#x27;re trying to compare it to the difficulty of writing an exploit for iOS. It&#x27;s not comparable. There&#x27;s documentation about every step of compiling and packaging software for linux distros. There&#x27;s no documentation for elevating privileges and breaking iOS&#x27;s sandbox because it&#x27;s not intended to be possible.')
