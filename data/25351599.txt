And while I&#x27;m sure plenty of people disagree about bluetooth reliability, enough people here do seem agree with them that their comment is the first one you see when you enter the discussion.<p>I don&#x27;t believe audio quality is perceptible enough that you need to spend $500 on a pair of wired headphones. But even if I <i>did</i> believe that audio quality was perceptible enough to require that kind of money, I also don&#x27;t believe that the AirPods Max are going to match the raw specs or numbers of those $500 wired devices. And regardless, that&#x27;s all kind of besides the point. The AirPods Max have plenty of exciting features tacked on, but those features aren&#x27;t the primary reason why OP is excited -- they&#x27;re excited because:<p>&gt; I want to put them on and they need to make noise.<p>Well, you don&#x27;t need to spend $500 to get that. Wired headphones were <i>good</i> at that. That was never a question or a concern that anybody had about them. Even with the awful low-quality $15-$20 solutions, you never doubted walking out of the store that when you plugged them into any audio device, sound was going to instantly come out of them as soon as you pressed the play button, even if it was a phone that your friend owned, even if it was a random ATM on a street corner, even if it was a 5 year old MP3 player or game console. They just worked.')
