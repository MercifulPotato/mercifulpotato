Item(by='joshuamorton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610096591, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25682676, text='&gt; In 37 California articles I saved from that period, exactly zero even mentioned not touching surfaces in equal or higher importance to wearing masks...<p>That&#x27;s because surfaces aren&#x27;t a major transmission vector. There was significant early concern about surface transmission, with recommendations to leave packages to quarantine for a period or wipe things with alcohol to sanitize them. There was a period where I&#x27;d wipe my phone and credit cards with alcohol everytime I reentered my house.<p>Pretty quickly though, the data showed that didn&#x27;t matter, and so people (reasonably) stopped caring as much, instead prioritizing airborne particle transmission, which remains the main transmission vector.')
