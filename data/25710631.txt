I dare you to defend Parlor. Or, if you don&#x27;t like Parlor, we have a myriad of other deplatformings (Gamergate&#x2F;4Chan, Church of Scientology&#x2F;Wikipedia, and Daily Stormer &#x2F; Cloudflare) you can discuss instead.<p>IMO, you want to run away to an imaginary world where the events of last Wednesday do not matter. Some pretend argument where people are taking away all cell phones (or something similarly unrealistic...). I&#x27;m not going to let you. At a bare minimum, you need to choose a realistic example from reality before I can take you seriously.<p>Lets be real, lets stay real. Lets use actual, reality-based arguments and discussions.')
