In all, there are 20 units where everyone knows each other. Two weeks ago my landlord decided to install a pair of bright LED spotlights on the top of my unit which shine down into the grassy courtyard and illuminate what once felt like a quiet peaceful reprieve from the noisy street on the other side of the tree-line that divides our complex from the rest of the neighborhood.<p>I hate it. Hate hate hate HATE it. I used to enjoy sitting on my stoop in the still evening and listen to the ambient noise. Now what was once a dark, peaceful courtyard is lit up like a parking lot. When I close the blinds on my windows I can still see the light creeping around the edges. I sigh every time I look out them night.<p>I immediately made my dissatisfaction known, but as far as I know I&#x27;m the only one who cares. All I got from my landlord was some vague response that someone didn&#x27;t like the darkness. I don&#x27;t know why. I&#x27;ve been living here for three years and nobody has complained. Now when I lay in bed at night the ambient light bounces off of the fence outside my rear windows and into my bedroom.<p>I have no idea how to go about convincing my landlord to remove these or dim them considerably without being a huge pain in the ass. That may be what it takes. I just signed a new lease for my place and now I have to live with this. Anyone have thoughts?')
