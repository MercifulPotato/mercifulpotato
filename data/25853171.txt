Item(by='brownbat', descendants=None, kids=[25854801], score=None, time=1611184310, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25851252, text='More and more I feel like we need another new manifesto.<p>We need to pull people together who have a passion for making the world&#x27;s computers just work and build a brand around simple extensions and apps that are TRULY FREE. As in, they don&#x27;t have features removed that you can only unlock through a paid version, they don&#x27;t have ads, they don&#x27;t sell tracking data, source is open, and anyone can support them through optional donations, but they don&#x27;t nag you for anything.<p>Stallman distinguished between free as in freedom and free as in beer. I don&#x27;t think he went far enough.<p>I&#x27;m more radical because we are users first, all of us, and only by using great software are we able to be makers.<p>And I think about my typical experiences as a user. Often, using a piece of software that was pretty great, then suddenly out of nowhere, a popup, it was a free trial and the full version costs some exhorbitant amount. Or the software that was suddenly bought out and shut down. Or the &quot;five star&quot; app that is already full of spam.<p>Then I contrast that with those programs that just don&#x27;t ask for anything. You keep expecting it, but it&#x27;s just genuinely something truly free that works. They weren&#x27;t optimizing revenue, they were optimizing function. That feeling of finding that perfect FOSS or community developed app, it&#x27;s just sublime.<p>Some user had a problem they wanted to solve, once they solved it, it was just a gift to the world, implicitly asking people at most to think about paying it forward.<p>We should make stuff that emulates our ideal experiences, not our worst experiences. We should spread that same kind of joy we&#x27;ve felt. If one in a thousand pays it forward, the options spread. The oak tree doesn&#x27;t waste time trying to extract revenue from every squirrel, it knows one in a thousand will bury an acorn somewhere and build the forest.<p>And it&#x27;s especially needed now. There was a time in the early internet where there was just abundant freeware on the internet. Postcardware, donationware, people genuinely trying to make an entire open source ecosystem.<p>Then we got app stores. &quot;Curated,&quot; but not for that ultimate sublime user experience. Curated for sustainable profit back to the marketplace. Curated to make the biggest revenue earners find the exact bottom line of scumminess without getting banned, and encourage them to duplicate that model, then inspire copycats flooding the entire app ecosystem.<p>I know the rebuttal, devs need to get paid. Sure, I&#x27;m not an absolutist; this path isn&#x27;t for everyone or every project. But I&#x27;ve worked with some people who make many of their contributions as free as possible, and they include some incredibly talented and hardworking folks who might be a little bit crazy. The thing that unites them all is that they&#x27;re passionate about making the world a better place. They are lucky to have the freedom to do it, but it&#x27;s still praiseworthy that they use that freedom for everyone, when it&#x27;d be easy not to bother.<p>I know there are free cycles in the system out there where people code out of a desire to help. Just need to have a unifying purpose, a call to action, that&#x27;s how so many of the great movements like open source originally started. Just have to have 1% of people believe in it, then so many incredible things happen.')
