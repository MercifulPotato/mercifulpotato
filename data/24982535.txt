They are small per item but still there.  Do not confuse opex with capex.  they are easy to muddle together especially at first.  things like that leaky roof that needs to be fixed,  someone to clean the floors, someone to run the register, AC costs, taxes (property and sales), modernization (you do not want your store to look like something from the 60s when everyone else is newer looking), etc  Some of those items are operating expense, some are capital expense.')
