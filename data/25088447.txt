The lever isn&#x27;t good&#x2F;bad docs, it&#x27;s the market dominance apple has in controlling access to high-spend customers.<p>Similarly, MS was notoriously hard to dev on during MS&#x27;s period of market dominance. It&#x27;s a lot more dev-friendly now because it doesn&#x27;t dominate as much anymore.')
