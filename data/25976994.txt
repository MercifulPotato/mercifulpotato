HN is far away from that as people here have all sorts of different beliefs, background, etc. It&#x27;s an heterogeneous community that will hardly agree on anything.<p>There&#x27;s also no sense of belonging here, to a group, or a brand. etc..<p>There&#x27;s no HNer, not a club, or have a card in the sorts of &quot;Mensa&quot; that you would proudly show to tell how smart you are.. as most of us are anonymous here.<p>So i don&#x27;t think the patterns apply here. I think some people spend too much time on toxic social networks and suddenly start to see 33 all over even when the number is 21, because his neurons are seeing the same pattern too many times with these algorithms that are optimized to turn us all into neurotics.')
