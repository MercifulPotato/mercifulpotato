They were always &quot;crackpots&quot;. You need to be a crackpot to generate ideas that people aren&#x27;t generating, otherwise everyone would generate them. This means you&#x27;ll generate wrong ideas, but it also means you&#x27;ll generate right ideas that people think are wrong.<p>&gt;I definitely agree that conspiracy theorists reject authority and are contrarian, but most don&#x27;t strike me as curious except for a superficial level.<p>They are definitely more curious than most people, as evidenced by the fact that they were attracted to the conspiracy theory in the first place. It&#x27;s also not uncommon for an intelligent conspiracy theorist to be able to outargue a conventional person on a subject they care about, i.e. the Earth being flat or not.<p>&gt;As for the list of things those people may or may not enjoy, the sheer amount of things polled and the small sample size give me doubts.<p>I think this field is pretty well established and this paper in particular is well cited, so among peers it doesn&#x27;t seem to be contentious.')
