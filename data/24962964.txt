Why is that? I&#x27;ve been using it -version 2.91- in Windows 7 without problems (in fact I&#x27;m currently listening to it right now). I thought that it was solidly programmed and that it could work with any Windows as long as the underlying OS API was compatible. Is that not the case?<p>EDIT: Ok, after reading the comments, it seems that Winamp does indeed work in W10. So I guess that this &quot;update&quot; is not really necessary and this is just PR. I understand the reasons, but personally I&#x27;ve never felt the need to update.')
