Most times, I can record my movements cleaning a single line, and then replay those actions N times.<p>I can do this in most editors I used (VSC being an exception). I use recordable macros all the time to clean up lines in emas or slickedit or any other editor that has recordable macros<p>&gt; A final, simpler one: I have &lt;Leader&gt;f mapped to fd piped into fzf piped into open. Other editors probably have fuzzy file finders. Some of them maybe even use fzf internally.<p>Can do this in every editor I&#x27;ve ever used too.<p>Any actual vim only examples?')
