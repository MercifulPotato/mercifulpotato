And below that a bunch of statistics broken down by geography -- which is usually what I&#x27;m after, I don&#x27;t care so much about the map itself.<p>What I don&#x27;t see are any ads (and I&#x27;m not using an adblocker), or links to other Google properties except for their Coronavirus information site.<p>I realize you may get different results depending on where you are, but in particular, I&#x27;d be surprised if you saw ads or &quot;random crap&quot; for this search.')
