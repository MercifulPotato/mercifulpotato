It is ~15K personnel and is commanded by Maj. Gen. Andrew P. Schafer, Jr.<p>Nicknames for the 28th include: Keystone (Special Designation), Fire and Movement, Iron Division, and Bloody Bucket.<p>It includes the 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team (Iron Brigade (PA NG)), the 55th Heavy Brigade Combat Team (PA NG), the 56th Stryker Brigade Combat Team (Independence Brigade (PA NG)) and the Combat Aviation Brigade (28th Infantry Division (Heavy) (PA NG)). The sub-breakdowns of each brigade can be found in the links below, as well as what the mechanized elements each brigade consist of. I&#x27;ll be honest, it&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of very good equipment in what seems to be capable hands.<p>In modern US military usage, Combat Teams are the atomic unit of independent operations in a theatre. The 28th, as an example has four such units.<p>Though I do not know what the exact make-up of the Troops are to be in DC, I would not want to be on the wrong side of the barrels of a few Strykers armed with rifles or IEDs. Such encounters have gone the way of the US in the last few attempts. A division&#x27;s worth of armed and well-trained personnel is a formidable obstacle for any modern military, let alone a group of insurrectionists and seditionists.<p>All that said, <i>Dear God</i>. That we are talking about such things at all shows the <i>depravity</i> of the moment. Such a moment has occurred before on the Mall with the Bonus Army, but it was a horrible thing then and it remains so now. The thought of US Troops again being used on our fellow citizens is horrific and yet may unfortunately be history soon enough.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Division_(military)#United_States" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Division_(military)#United_Sta...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;military.wikia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;28th_Infantry_Division_(United_States)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;military.wikia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;28th_Infantry_Division_(Unit...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bonus_Army" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bonus_Army</a>')
