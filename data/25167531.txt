You forget to carry the two.<p>An act of hypocrisy implies person A asking&#x2F;requiring others to act in manner X, and an intentional act by person A that is clearly not in manner X.  In colloquial English, “Do as I say, not as I do.”<p>An intentional offense is not a mistake by the above definition, because it was intended and not accidental.  It can be a tort, a criminal offense, a sin, an idiocy...but not that neutral word “mistake”.<p>Using the word “mistake” neuters the act of its moral import and implicitly absolves those who acted of moral failing.<p>Would you agree to the wording<p>“which would pre-suppose that people in power are incapable of an act devoid of judgement or awareness of their authority position as having just asked&#x2F;required folks to do the opposite”<p>Because, in the case of politicians or anyone making their living from their fame, that is a act of gross professional incompetence.')
