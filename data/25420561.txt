If the only thing that Intel was struggling with was process nodes and the rest of their designs were amazing, Apple would have probably stayed with them and encouraged them to outsource their chip fab work.<p>Apple is getting performance that matches the best of Intel has while beating the power draw of basically all they have.<p>And it&#x27;s not just the CPU. The built in GPU of the MBA is surprisingly powerful, and the neural engine is beyond what Intel has.<p>Yes, Intel needs to get their chip fab back on track, but I also think they have issues with their chip designs (and perhaps something larger with x86).')
