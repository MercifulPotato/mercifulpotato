This means a typical charge for an average electric vehicle – from 20% charged to to 80% – would cost under £10\n</code></pre>\nThis is one of very few articles I&#x27;ve seen on electric vehicles which has actually put a price on the cost of a recharge. Most such articles don&#x27;t even mention money being involved and would almost leave you with the impression that in our magical zero carbon future [0], the motoring fairies will let you top up for free, wherever you are.<p>It would be interesting to do some comparisons to find out the kind of distance this £10 for 60% worth of charge would allow you to travel, compared to, say, £10 worth of diesel or petrol in a similarly sized ICE vehicle. Back of a braincell calculations suggest I could get somewhere in the region of 80 miles on a tenner&#x27;s worth of diesel in my ancient VW van. A modern efficient ICE engine should easily be able to double that.<p><i>[0] Don&#x27;t take this to mean I&#x27;m anti-environmental. I just think a lot of the press gives the impression that electric vehicles are produced, charged, run and disposed of with no environmental cost at all.</i>')
