They called up saying &quot;their system is no longer working&quot;.<p>After about an hour of investigation, I find one of the primary database tables is empty - completely blank.<p>I then spend the next hour looking through code to see if there&#x27;s any chance of a bug that would wipe their data and couldn&#x27;t find anything that would do that.<p>I then had to make &quot;the phone call&quot; to the client saying that their primary data table had been wiped and I didn&#x27;t know what we did wrong.<p>Their response: &quot;Oh I wrote a query and accidentally did that, but thought I stopped it&quot;.')
