Now, not so much -- it&#x27;s basically a guarantee that you&#x27;re going to spend a full day driving to&#x2F;from there, and gods help you if you leave friday afternoon and try to drive back on sunday -- everyone, their dog and grandma included, are going to be doing the same exact thing.<p>Once or twice a year is not implying accessible -- it&#x27;s implying that it&#x27;s inaccessible. It&#x27;s somewhere that people do want to go, but the effort required to do so limits most. If it wasn&#x27;t worth going, people wouldn&#x27;t be trying to go every winter, and if it was reasonably easy to get to, perhaps people would go more than once or twice a winter.')
