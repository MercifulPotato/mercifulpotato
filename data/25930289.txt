The Fuji X-T3 I use already does a lot of correction by itself.<p>I am not sure if you know this, but I guess it does not hurt to say it: if you are on Linux, you may need to update the Lensfun&#x27;s database used by Darktable, as they are separate things for some reason.<p>Assuming you have the liblensfun-bin package installed, just run lensfun-update-data to update the database for your user, or sudo lensfun-update-data to update it system-wide.<p>No idea how this work for other platforms.')
