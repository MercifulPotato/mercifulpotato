That way<p>1. heat would be more evenly distributed reducing the need for large heatsinks<p>2. smaller fresnel lenses could be positioned much closer to the light reducing thickness<p>3. with a lot of LEDs there&#x27;d be a less noticeable grid at the edges of each fresnel lens from chromatic aberration.<p>I&#x27;d totally buy a &#x27;sunlight window&#x27; product like this.')
