People routinely try to induce memory errors by overclocking their memory (to verify ECC is working). The triggering of bit flips is the very foundation of the Rowhammer attack (yes, I know Rowhammer can circumvent ECC with advanced techniques). Error correcting codes are used in networking environments, CPU caches, hard drives, anywhere but main memory.<p>Not sure why memory bit flips have the reputation of being such an edge case. It could be that it was an edge case 20 years ago, but it clearly isn&#x27;t anymore. Computer memory has changed too.')
