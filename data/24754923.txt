I think part of the problem is there is a layer of indirection - the developers of the packages themselves don&#x27;t look there.<p>&gt;they interpret &quot;I had a problem with this and therefore don&#x27;t use it&quot; as some kind of personal attack. This is not only unhelpful, but an actively repellent behavior.<p>Your posts so far have implied that people reporting their positive experience or advising how to make the most of Linux (eg being careful about hardware choice) must be doing so because of a kind of identity crisis, or that they are reciting from mockable &#x27;Linux Desktop Evangelism playbook&#x27;. Meanwhile you seem to have taken personal offence at the &#x27;community&#x27;s (as if it&#x27;s one entity) response to your Ubuntu bug tracker entry.')
