A terrible feedback cycle.<p>Unfortunately I think <i>some</i> police reform&#x2F;abolition activists have decided to accelerate this feedback loop under the theory that making things much worse is the only way to make things better.  &#x27;ACAB&#x27; makes bad cops think they&#x27;re in good company while probably making good cops want to quit (and similarly filters new police recruits.)  The premise is presumably that when cops get worse, more of the public will support reform.  &#x27;Accelerationist&#x27; approaches like thus might be well intentioned, but I think the consequences are more likely to be disastrous.')
