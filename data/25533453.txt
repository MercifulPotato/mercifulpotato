No focus on whether the mitigation is effective. No focus on whether it&#x27;s relevant or appropriate. No focus on whether it&#x27;s adequate, or how it sits in relation to the capabilities of a motivated adversary.<p>A decent understanding of your threat model, your exposure, and how you plan to invest to improve would be far more valuable. Second to this is to then avoid buying snake-oil vendor security products that aren&#x27;t effective - many of the big organisations breached through solarwinds offer incredibly expensive &quot;AI&quot;-based cyber tools as those are in vogue. Yet all were compromised by a silly supply chain breach from some proprietary DLL a third party vendor was shipping into organisations, which was blindly trusted.<p>Getting a basic understanding of the old fashioned principles of security and having someone help you take technical measures will be a load more effective than producing paperwork to keep a junior auditor happy.')
