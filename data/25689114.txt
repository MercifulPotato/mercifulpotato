Where the Black Panthers who took the California State Capitol in the 1970s insurrectionists?<p>Stop with the bullshit name games. These were not rioters. They didn&#x27;t set anything on fire. They should not have stolen or broken anything. That&#x27;s wrong and bad and should be condemned. Those people should get federal time<p>But man...you have to admit...there is something beautiful about the peasants entering the royal court, and the town idiot putting his feet up on the table that belongs to the Hand of the King.<p>The villagers entered the royal court and the senators clutched their pearls.<p>America has had a long history of occupying federal buildings. This is certainly not unprecedented.<p>These people were not a coup or insurrection. They had no plan. There was no person with a new founding document they were going to read. They didn&#x27;t bring in an armed force and take and occupy the capital.<p>The overreaction to what happened is fucking insane, especially compared to what actual Rioters where allowed to get away with for the past year. In May, DC was literally on fire from the BLM riots, and we didn&#x27;t see this type of DoubleSpeak.')
