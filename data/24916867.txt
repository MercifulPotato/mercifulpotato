My impression is that he finds HoTT mildly interesting, and has not really used&#x2F;advocated it. And, you are implicitly calling him and Voedvodsky &quot;not a mainstream mathematician&quot;, which is rather offensive considering their contributions to statistics (Per) and homotopy theory (Vladimir).<p>Your comment comes out as very reactionary. There is room for a lot of both HoTT (weather classical logic is used or not) and set theory in modern mathematics. In fact, doing set theory in HoTT is a very pleasant experience!')
