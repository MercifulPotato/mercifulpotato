Polls by the Pew Foundation do not bear this out.  Non-college educated Democrats and Republicans have equally wrong knowledge about what people on the other side of the spectrum believe.  College educated Republicans match their numbers.  The outliers are college educated Democrats.  They, by far, have the most distorted view of what right wing people ACTUALLY believe.  It goes both ways of course, with conservatives dramatically underestimating the patriotism of liberals, etc.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;commentisfree&#x2F;2019&#x2F;jul&#x2F;21&#x2F;democrats-republicans-political-beliefs-national-survey-poll" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;commentisfree&#x2F;2019&#x2F;jul&#x2F;21&#x2F;democr...</a><p>When I lived in Arkansas, the voters simultaneously voted for a Republican governor and state house, AND a ballot initiative to significantly raise the state minimum wage, as well as a ballot initiative for medical marijuana.<p>The GOP politicians were all against these measures, but the voters approved them by large majorities.<p>The point I&#x27;m making is that the politicians on both sides aren&#x27;t in step with the electorate, even if they are chosen by the electorate.  People are voting for the lesser of two evils a lot more than we give them credit for.')
