I like using it, but the main problem I&#x27;ve had with Altair is the size of the plots. Unless you save the plot as an image, the plot is rendered as a Vega-Lite spec JSON object.  The JSON spec stores the entire dataset, so it limits you to using 5,000 data points. Otherwise you&#x27;ll have this insanely large JSON object representing the plot. There are work-arounds like using a data server however.')
