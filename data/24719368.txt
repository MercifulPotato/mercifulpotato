That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re using Rust in the first place.<p>I -could- use a more convenient &#x2F; lenient language like ruby or golang but I generally wouldn&#x27;t prefer it unless the use case made sense. You end up &quot;paying&quot; in different ways later down the line as your codebase grows in complexity.<p>In my experience, the rust compiler is extremely helpful and most issues I had went away after reading the rust book.
