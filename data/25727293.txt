The FAQ only states:<p>&gt; Media and messages you back up aren&#x27;t protected by WhatsApp end-to-end encryption while in Google Drive.<p>That makes sense, why would you re-encrypt the messages with the end-to-end-key which is individual for each chat, if you could simply use a symmetric encryption for backups?<p>So the statement<p>&gt; It is encrypted with a per user key known to WhatsApp.<p>could still hold true, there&#x27;s no information contrary to that in the FAQ (but no information indicating another kind of encryption either).')
