Item(by='zamadatix', descendants=None, kids=[25367639], score=None, time=1607546809, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25361535, text='There is a clear and obvious path to implementing Manifest V3 in a way that best serves users overall and this path involves working with the uBlock Origin team&#x2F;gorhill and the concerns they&#x27;ve brought up with the change. Until that happens I refuse to believe any train of thought that this is a user focused change and not a ad revenue focused change. To be clear that it has some benefit to users that can be pointed out does not make the change user focused in the same way putting a solar cellphone charger on a cargo ship doesn&#x27;t make it environmentally friendly.<p>It&#x27;d be a different discussion if this was presented as an ad revenue focused change but it&#x27;s presented as if it&#x27;s user focus and the community is driving the direction of how it&#x27;s implemented. Clearly this is not the case, in a conveniently true way, and it&#x27;d be such a simple thing to clear up. Even if the uBlock Origin team ends up saying &quot;hmm, we really all got together and thought about it and there was nothing else to change that couldn&#x27;t impact user privacy significantly&quot; at least it removes the divide and controversy.<p>Throwing references from companies with shady practices that exclude Google ads from their blocking does nothing to show a willingness to work with developers on what&#x27;s best for users, in fact it makes the situation look even more shady.<p>I don&#x27;t know if gorhill reads HN but on the off chance he does thank you for your work.')
