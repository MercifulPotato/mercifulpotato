I personally don&#x27;t use RSS, so I am not sure how you would like to have it be implemented, I have two questions:<p>1. Do you want all articles on HackerDaily added to your RSS feed? (HackerDaily only shows the articles with 100+ points, so that&#x27;s about 30-50 articles per day)<p>2. HackerDaily uses your local timezone to find the articles per day, would you like to have this for the RSS feed as well, or is based on UTC also okay?')
