After a few years of this I&#x27;ve pulled my lower teeth out of alignment and the ones I do this to pitch forward now.<p>Asking my dentist how to defeat the bruxism all he could suggest was having braces might do it. Mentally preparing for sleep by telling myself not to grind my teeth can help, but I think without reducing all the stress it&#x27;ll never stop.<p>I look forward to reading all the advice in this thread on ways to make myself stop.')
