Mostly I use it for editing config files and other scripts, and occasionally to perform more complex editing tasks in files I&#x27;d usually use other editors for. I have a good configuration for editing these sorts of files. I have tab completion, project search, and the like set up here, but not more complex language-specific editing functionality for the most part.<p>- Emacs: for Org mode and Magit primarily. I&#x27;ll edit other files here if it&#x27;s convenient (especially if I&#x27;m editing a file linked to by my Org agenda) - I use Doom Emacs, so there are some sane defaults installed for other languages - but I probably won&#x27;t adopt Emacs as my primary editor, since it&#x27;s prone to lag and lock up too often. Maybe that&#x27;s due to Org, and I could fix it, but since Emacs&#x27; support for multithreading and async isn&#x27;t the most robust, it seems like a better of use of my time to leave Emacs dedicated to Org mode.<p>- IDE: At Google, there is a web IDE that is integrated with syntax checking, build system, source control, that I use most of the time to edit code that goes into Google&#x27;s main repository. I&#x27;ve briefly tried to set up such integration with Vim and Emacs - they exist, but it hasn&#x27;t been worth my time when a frankly pretty good solution is actively maintained internally.<p>Perhaps I would use VSCode if I were working elsewhere, assuming its plugins are more robust than Vim&#x2F;Emacs language integration plugins. The Language Server Protocol has been a boon to all the editors I use.')
