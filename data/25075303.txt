Sorry - but I&#x27;m glad I caught your interest.<p>If we were on a desert island, and I were to ask you to give me 40% of your income&#x2F;produce and take out loans from me to buy your hut and donkey, you would rightly refuse.  If I and 5 others where to do the same, you might consent, but you wouldn&#x27;t think it was right.  The system we have though - that no one asked for or signed into - is a system people actually think this is right!!  And they will fight to maintain it.  It is a slavery system, where because the criminals are so far away, unperceived by most, and tv and schooling (owned by those criminals) tells them it is right, and everyone else is going along with the insanity, well, we say &#x27;I guess that it is right, it&#x27;s what humans are&#x27; etc.  Justifying the unjustifiable.<p>&#x27;Self-sovereignty&#x27; to me, is being able to say that you are responsible for yourself, and to mean it.  Try it in the mirror!  If you are unconvinced, you are not sovereign.  This is not to say you need to lord it over others - far from it.  It&#x27;s that you treat yourself as an individual, and are responsible for yourself and your actions.  You get rid of the cognitive dissonance as you reason things out.  But you need to go all the way.<p>Accepting the authority of any other over your own experience and judgement, is to have made a grave error of personal judgement.  (I don&#x27;t mean refusing to accept the worthy advise of your mechanic over what to do with your car btw.)  I mean being told something and ignoring your own reasoning and accepting theirs.  To a reasonable person, it should be possible for someone to share evidence and allow you to make up your mind and get your agreement if what is requested is reasonable.  If it is unreasonable you should be able to refuse.  But our system is entirely unreasonable.  If you are in the US, did you agree to the constitution, to be an American citizen?  Were you - a free man under God - invited to join this club?  The system is about manipulation and covert use of force and fear.  It has an appeal - it is comforting (and easier) to think that someone else has this - but in fact, only you do.<p>&#x27;Might makes right&#x27; in this system (a system I think it has been in place for 100s of years).  At some point those with the might want not to fight, or be hassled, or even known.  &#x27;They&#x27; set up a system to train those it has subjugated that this situation is right (education).  No, education is not about improving those that go through its system - as you may have noticed.  It is about making the men that suit the system and play the game.<p>Individually, people are lovely and cannot conceive of the breadth of the scam and lie that they are living.  We are happy joyful creatures, but we have been turned inside out.  And the loss of privacy is another example.  They cannot conceive that education is 15 years of mind moulding, that the health industry is about making them unwell, that the media is about keeping them uninformed, that science is religion masquerading as reason, etc.  But there it is.  If you look and do your own research - and you have to do your own research - you will see what I mean.<p>All the best.')
