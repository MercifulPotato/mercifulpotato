I never understood the whole reverence for RHEL, when an alternative has lived alongside it for the whole time and longer. I&#x27;ve been using Debian since &#x27;97 or &#x27;98, and with one (glaring) exception, stable upgrade paths were always trivial when compared to Centos &quot;nuke and rebuild&quot; approach, and you get 5 years of support, which is really quite decent.<p>Of course, Debian will not sell you support but you have places that will. I&#x27;ve never worked with a truly giant fleet, so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing something, but I also feel very fortunate at the moment to have always had the choice to work with Debian both personally and professionally.')
