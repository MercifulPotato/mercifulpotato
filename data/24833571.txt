Each of them highlights a different aspect of that all-important number.<p>What the GP was trying to explain was that the exponential function to the base of e, up to a multiplicative constant, is the only function whose derivative (roughly: slope) is equal to itself. That is: any such function is of the form a*e^x for some real number a. This is certainly one big reason for why e plays such a central role in mathematics.<p>But I think for someone not very familiar with all these topics, it&#x27;s much easier to think of e as some number somewhere between 2,5 and 3. There are also some explanations for where exactly this number comes from, e.g. as the basis for continuously compounded interest (which is useful in economics), but they do require the student to be comfortable with some sort of, at least informal, limiting process.')
