Maybe not an issue for the desktop. If they doubled the SOC for 16 cores (8 hot&#x2F;8 cool) and 32GB of RAM that would be a decent Mac Pro.<p>But plenty of people want &gt;32GB of memory, I routinely use machines with 256GB. No way you can get enough RAM into the SOC. Large core counts are even harder, because speed of light means you need a new on socket switched architecture, memory on the other side is slow to access etc. TANSTAAFL.')
