Mmmm Russia.<p>It&#x27;d be interesting to see it&#x27;s upvote and downvote history.  There are definite attacks on HN you can see play out.<p>I think this bot is actually academic since it is very prolific, it could hide itself a lot more if it wanted to.<p>[edit] OT: I&#x27;ll give an example of a ongoing Russian attack, Bellingcat is constantly flagged.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;from?site=bellingcat.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;from?site=bellingcat.com</a><p>Bellingcat is prime HN, open source intelligence. A lot to learn from.

Questions why it&#x27;s flagged on HN are quickly made fuzzy.')
