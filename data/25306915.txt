I might be biased but for the youger sibling all learnings are almost ready made, they can just absorb if they are interested in that sport and it is very easy because it is very easy for them to connect with the elder brother&#x2F;sister . Just my opinion, however biased it may be (speaking as an elder brother &amp; athlete)')
