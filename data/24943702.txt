We&#x27;ve known about filter bubbles for at least a decade now. Amplifying disinformation specifically to an audience that is vulnerable to it is different than airing it on TV and increasing awareness.<p>That&#x27;s exactly what algorithmically curated content feeds like Facebook and YouTube recommendations do. They amplify messages to certain people who are susceptible, and there&#x27;s little awareness until somebody shoots up a mosque and then suddenly we realize there&#x27;s a whole subculture of people that have semi-willingly brainwashed themselves with conspiracies floating around about white people being &quot;replaced&quot; and think Shariah law is being implemented in Western countries.<p>I don&#x27;t think censorship of the content is the right answer. Short of calling for violence, people should obviously be free to propagate conspiracies, alternative history, whatever. The component that I am wary of is the algorithmic curation. It seems to tend towards &quot;you like that? How about this slightly more extreme piece of related content?&quot;')
