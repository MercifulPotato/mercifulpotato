Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25794982], score=None, time=1610734598, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25788795, text='&gt; I am of the opinion that we should prevent violent insurrection rather than waiting for it to happen and then responding with jail time.<p>Responding with jail time <i>is</i> how you prevent it, through deterrence.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not saying we should prevent all book publishing, but you do understand what historical precedence I was referring to right?<p>Presumably the unconstitutional Son of Sam laws?<p>&gt; If the dumb thing they&#x27;re saying is that all politicians are satan worshipers and pedophiles, then it doesn&#x27;t matter what &quot;thing&quot; I have to say to them.<p>I disagree. There are still things you can say and do to black pill the crazies.<p>Now, sometimes the only thing you can do to convince them is to <i>do</i> something, because just saying &quot;no you&#x27;re wrong&quot; isn&#x27;t much of an argument. Whereas, say, arresting and prosecuting everyone involved with Jeffrey Epstein would satisfy a lot more people that there isn&#x27;t a vast international conspiracy of pedophile Satanist cannibals, as compared to the presumably truer situation in which a lot of powerful people were involved a major statutory rape and prostitution debacle and yet thus far have escaped prosecution.')
