The stated goal is to understand our biases and flaws, and to become &quot;less wrong.&quot; But it&#x27;s easy to fall into a trap where one claims to get better at such biases, therefore making them more rational than people who haven&#x27;t, therefore making their position superior - hence re-enforcing their biases.<p>A lot of the public declarations coming from &quot;rationalist&quot; communities remind me of public declarations of sin coming from certain religious groups. Though it presents itself as self-effacing, it ends up being affirming.
