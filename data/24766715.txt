Decent sized mountain towns have pretty good food and bars, including unique establishments. Of course they won’t please a true snob looking for a new home, but they plenty suit low key snobs like me. Last time I made a pit stop in Flagstaff it took 30 seconds on Yelp to find a great independent Cajun-creole joint with a pleasant patio, friendly staff, and delicious food and craft beer.<p>And frankly, let’s not let SF off the hook for its large proportion of mediocre restaurants and bars. IMO they are a another sad consequence of Prop 13: old businesses with low property taxes don’t need to be much good to survive, but the cost of starting a new business is spectacularly high.')
