The KDE example you have linked shows that you can in fact guarantee a stable C++ ABI (although it requires a lot of care). The fact that they go through all the trouble is a hint that a C ABI is in fact too restrictive and not expressive enough for a large framework like KDE.<p>Specifically KDE relies (among other things) on the ABI stability of the layout of virtual tables which is certainly not part of the C ABI.')
