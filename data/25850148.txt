Most of these people have empathy in my experience.<p>In the large enterprise migrations I&#x27;ve worked on the past 2 years, I haven&#x27;t heard a Google employee or partner say, &quot;you&#x27;re doing it wrong.&quot;  Sometimes there is a response along the lines of, &quot;we don&#x27;t recommend doing it that way for the following specific reasons.
