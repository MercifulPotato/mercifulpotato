Amazon removed it. I asked why and was sent a link by a bot-like sender.<p>Some months back I gave a so so review on AirBNB and had it removed.  I asked why, I was sent a link and cut and pasted guidelines.  Responding using Reason led to being completely ignored.<p>Then I discovered a reddit subgroup where hosts tell each other tips to easily get reviews removed.<p>The whole review system has become corrupted.  The complaint is that only motivated people put positive or negative reviews, which is only partially true.  It&#x27;s actually gaslighting by marketing people.<p>Not surprised by Amazon. Fakespot helps somewhat it seems... as does not ordering from Amazon where possible. I just ordered a jacket with a 20 pct coupon from a sporting goods store that sells the same item on Amazon.. without the 20 pct discount.<p>The trick is to remove negative reviews that violate guidelines, but for positive reviews that violate common sense and ethics, nyet.')
