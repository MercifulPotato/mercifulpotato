I have a cordless dewalt drill that I can use all day on my jobsite, but every single appliance in my kitchen needs a cord. Hand mixer? Immersion blender? Regular blender? Stand mixer? Everything has a cord. Why isn&#x27;t there a kitchen battery system yet?<p>Similarly: I&#x27;d love to have a little reading sconce on my wall next to my bed, but running a circuit through the existing walls without tearing them up is impossible. Why isn&#x27;t there any attractive battery-powered home lighting? Sure, maybe overhead lights for lighting a room need more draw, but there&#x27;s no reason to plug in a desk lamp, wall sconce, or coffee table light every day. Especially for renters who aren&#x27;t about to hire an electricianâ€”why no battery-powered lights designed for the home? Periodic recharging is annoying, but it&#x27;s better than literally not being able to have a light where I want it.<p>There&#x27;s a market here and it&#x27;s not new technology. It&#x27;s just repackaging existing technology with a splash of industrial design. Hell, the battery requirements for my drill are much greater than the battery requirements for my immersion blender. It shouldn&#x27;t even be expensive!')
