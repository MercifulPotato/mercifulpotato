It is a fair question to ask how much value do both stores contribute to their business. If Apple and Google provide more value to the business than they take away then a lot of the arguments about how <i>fair</i> these charges are, melt away.<p>When people pretend they are arbiters of what is and isn&#x27;t valid because <i>they</i> don&#x27;t consider it fair it stops any avenue of investigation because <i>they</i> consider it forbidden.<p>As much as I don&#x27;t like Apple or their store, if they are going to provide value I am going to work with them. Pretend that for a minute that apple gave me a 10 fold increase on revenue. <i>70% of a 1000 is still more than 100% of 100</i>.<p>Also number of people sideloading an app on Android I would wager is negligible compared to store purchases and could be considered to be irrelevant.<p>So again the question is how much of their revenue came from those stores and how much value does that add to the business?')
