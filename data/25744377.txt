You could say that I agree in general.<p>Much of what you point out is also what Quine identified in his paper &quot;The two Dogmas of Empiricism&quot; which is trivially the question &quot;Is logic&#x2F;mathematics empirical?&quot;. In my world-view inductive types (computations) are empirical.<p>But since you seem to be optimising for &quot;pinning things precisely&quot;, general consensus&#x2F;agreement may not be of any empirical value ;)')
