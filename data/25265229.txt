It&#x27;s like a web server that is always on, never goes down, and you only pay for exactly what services you use (and no more). It is also uncensorable and perfectly immutable - which as a consequence is very useful for money. So one of the high-value services Ethereum supports is moving money and applications around money. This &quot;money&quot; is sometimes referred to as &quot;tokens&quot;, which are like digital equity, bonds, currency, but are very hard to put in a single bucket and kind of operate like all of them at once. One interesting aspect is they are bearer instruments, meaning no one can seize them from you.<p>It&#x27;s an alternative financial system that anyone can hack on and no one can prevent you from using. Many, especially on HN, quickly lose their Hacker ethos and revert to being state worshippers when it comes to the monetary system, for reasons I don&#x27;t fully understand. But there is a sizable community of programmers around the world that value a completely open, transparent, hackable, and protocol-oriented financial system. Its network effects have allowed it to be greater than the sum of its parts, and novel financial applications continue to be constructed on it.')
