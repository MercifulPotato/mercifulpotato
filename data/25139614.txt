Their only cost to run the class is for support staff to grade projects and write and grade exams.<p>One downside to this model is that for some courses, like those with rapidly changing content, the lecture videos can go out of date after a year or two.  GT needs to address this somehow.  (Their ML and computer vision courses especially suffer from this.)<p>But their degrees are still a great value and worth every penny.')
