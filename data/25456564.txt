A lot of people <i>love</i> Pocket. It&#x27;s enormously popular, despite the impression you would get if you exclusively went by HN comments.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve just recently started to try using it. It hasn&#x27;t really captured my enthusiasm yet, despite addressing one of my larger pain points with a browser. I still think I&#x27;d prefer management capabilities that felt more built into the standard (well, Tree-Style Tabs) tabs&#x2F;history experience. But it&#x27;s early days, I&#x27;ll have to see how my Pocket experiment goes.<p>They&#x27;re certainly good at surfacing appealing-looking content that isn&#x27;t vapid when I try reading it. That&#x27;s worth something.')
