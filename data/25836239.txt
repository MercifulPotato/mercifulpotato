Using a trademark is not infringing Copyright. It may or may not be infringing the trademark, but that&#x27;s a whole different thing.<p>In general, anyone can use your trademark as long as they are using it about you or your product. I can say &quot;I like Coca Cola, it tastes great&quot; or even &quot;Coca Cola is disgusting&quot; but if I put Coca Cola on the menu but give you Pepsi, that&#x27;s infringing.<p>This is why some projects have generic names and brand names for the commercial version. PhoneGap and Cordova, RedHat and Centos, etc. Amazon can offer a machine and say &quot;This is Centos, it&#x27;s mostly the same as RedHat&quot;, but they can&#x27;t say &quot;This is RedHat&quot; unless they pay for actual RedHat.')
