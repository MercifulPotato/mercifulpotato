IMHO the rest of your argument seems to obfuscate something rather simple... your brain is a physical object. The atoms that make up the neurons, glial cells, etc. are real and are governed by physics. Are you saying that what you think of as &quot;you&quot; is made up of more than these physical ingredients? To me that would be invoking something &quot;magical&quot; and would thus bear the burden of proof.<p>&gt; You can have concrete green triangular objects in the world, but not triangularity or green as such...except in a mind that is able to abstract universals from particulars<p>Why can a sufficiently powerful computer not conceptualize these things? How is that fundamentally different than what goes on in your brain?')
