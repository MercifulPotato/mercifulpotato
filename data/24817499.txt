How do I start?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hi HN,<p>I just graduated last June and has been working on this idea since last year. I have made some research on the topic and could not find anything substantial on building a digital banking startup. Currently, there is a huge opportunity where I live and there are only one or two digital bank startups that are already in the market.<p>Assuming I have enough capital and already has the license from the local central bank, how do I go about building the MVP? The MVP that I have in mind is a simple mobile app where users can:<p>- Transfer and receive money \n- Pay bills<p>I know this is a difficult endeavour and many will be sceptical, but 2020 has been a difficult year for me. At the moment, I have nothing to lose and I would rather work on this idea and fail rather than not trying at all. Thank you so much!')
