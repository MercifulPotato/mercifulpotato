His wife was from there, missed home and he could work remotely, so why not buy twice the house for a quarter the price?<p>He&#x27;s back in the greater London now after 4 miserable years. The locals objected to an outsider in the village. He was refused service at the local pub. The pub shut ultimately because of lack of business. But he was sick of it and came back here where people don&#x27;t care where you were born and things open on Sundays.')
