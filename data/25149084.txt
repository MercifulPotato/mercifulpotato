Treasure trove covers finding <i>money</i> on your property. Refined precious metals (gold and silver particularly) are historically and legally treated as money for many purposes. But a gold mine isn&#x27;t.<p>This seems to me more like discovering a gold mine. You can&#x27;t buy things with your meteorite, or divide it indefinitely into smaller pieces that keep their value pro rata. Even if it was filled with platinum ore, you&#x27;d need to smelt and refine it.<p>The tax treatment of treasure trove in the US is different from the treatment of discovering gold or oil: in brief, you owe taxes when you find it, instead of when you sell it or its products.<p>Edit: another legal question, what if you don&#x27;t own the mineral rights under your own home?')
