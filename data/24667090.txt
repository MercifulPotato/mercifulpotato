It happened with the bible. It happened with karate. It happened with rock music. So people kind of have their guard up. Misinformation is so rampant here that adele very well could become the inventor of dred locks if people don&#x27;t make enough noise about it.<p>So people still react like this because it wasn&#x27;t too long ago that back to the future was implying that Chuck Berry stole the idea for Johnny B Good from a white person.
