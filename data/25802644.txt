How is that going to catch an actor like lazerus?<p>They&#x27;re not going to scan your service, or attempt to attack it without observing actual workflows of their target&#x27;s employees. If the employees are not using the honeypots, they won&#x27;t either.<p>What strategy do you employ to catch attackers at that level? I&#x27;m not critical of honeypots in general. But I would like to know some success stories, since I have not witnessed their success myself, and have a hard time believing they&#x27;d help against attackers that have the skills to penetrate otherwise well defended organizations.')
