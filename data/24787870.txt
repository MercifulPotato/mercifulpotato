Item(by='coldcode', descendants=None, kids=[24789180], score=None, time=1602764977, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24787668, text='Facebook requires that you pay them enormous money but you do not matter to them at all otherwise, as there are always more suckers out there to replace you if you leave. Both Google and Facebook understand that support costs them money, so they don&#x27;t provide any, which lets them keep the money. Quality costs money, so not having quality lets them keep more money since people are desperate enough to put up with a lack of it to point ads at 2B people. The market for ads is completely captured by Facebook and Google, so you either put up with no support and no quality, or you can&#x27;t play.<p>It&#x27;s like living in a run down tenement, no matter how many rats and roaches you have to deal with due to a lack of maintenance, you have no choice if the alternative is the street. Yet the owner makes money no matter how horrific the building.')
