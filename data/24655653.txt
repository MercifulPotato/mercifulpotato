But the PL theory syntax nearly did me in.  TAPL was like banging my head against a brick wall -- completely opaque to me.  My PI wasn&#x27;t familiar with the space either, so I was sort of on my own.  The school eventually brought in a PL theory faculty and things sort of got better.  But yes, the syntax for PL is certainly one of the more complex, nuanced, and difficult notations I&#x27;ve worked with.')
