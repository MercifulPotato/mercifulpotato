I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re talking about political stances that are meaningfully related to the company&#x27;s mission, and in either case how that would affect governments&#x27; willingness to regulate those companies. Are you simply arguing that governments would be more willing to regulate Google if Google didn&#x27;t spend so much lobbying against regulation? In that case, obviously (this is pretty much tautologically true), but how does that relate to what we&#x27;re discussing? If we&#x27;re talking about political stances like &quot;police shootings are <i>unjustly</i> biased against black people&quot;, then that&#x27;s about as unrelated to Google&#x27;s mission as one could imagine. It seems like mental gymnastics either way.')
