I am also upgrading some work hardware currently which is expensive. I&#x27;ve heard anecdotally that some small businesses only pay tax on profit. I am hoping there is a way to set up an &quot;entity&quot; for myself that pays for and owns the hardware, and then the contract payments go to the company (for which I would be an employee), and then I don&#x27;t have to pay taxes on all of the income since it is covering expenses (and maybe the business keeps the money too, I&#x27;m okay with not taking that money as a salary until a later date). (But ultimately, income will outpace expenses for the year).<p>Does HN have any advice for an individual contractor with notable expenses?')
