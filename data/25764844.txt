Fermions have half spin. What&#x27;s spin? The &quot;want for electrons&quot;. What&#x27;s that? Nature always does the easiest thing. If nature can slow down it&#x27;s internal clock, or smudge the margins of the present environment, nature will find those heat transfer mediums all on its own. Electromagnetism is that heat transfer, finding a medium for an easier path besides conductive surfaces or convective fluids. Half spin means you need something else, like current needs ground. Full spin, like a shiny bright or flat dark topology relating internal clock speed, doesn&#x27;t. They transfer heat regardless.<p>Nature will transfer heat by dumping mass without changing the chemical bonds of the material. That&#x27;s nuclear decay.  When it does, everything around it finds an easier path by adding mass to the released heat. That&#x27;s the Higg&#x27;s field. What if there was not just one of those, like Planck showed things must heat up a little before they become brighter?<p>This is what made me understand anyons:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quantamagazine.org&#x2F;milestone-evidence-for-anyons-a-third-kingdom-of-particles-20200512&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quantamagazine.org&#x2F;milestone-evidence-for-anyons...</a><p>As dimensions increase, the more constrained you get. As dimensions decrease, like in the singularity derived from background radiation and red shift, the more freedom you get.<p>Why this matters: I want to use the sun to microwave an asteroid, cure cancer, and far more important reasons, special effects in movies and video games.')
