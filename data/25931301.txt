Data archives need to be managed by an institution or purchased with a single up-front fee, otherwise they won&#x27;t stick around.<p>There&#x27;s also the aspect that, even if you as an individual take it upon yourself to publish your data without institutional support, anyone who reads your paper will most likely ignore your dataset.
