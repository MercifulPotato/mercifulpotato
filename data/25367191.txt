He cannot be worse than the present mayor.<p>On the other hand, I think he’s a bit naive.  He has good intentions, but we know where good intentions take us.<p>UBI in principle sounds nice, but it is also potentially a power grab.  You get people used to UBI, you get them dependent on it, then you use it to control them.<p>But who knows, if his mayorship doesn’t not revolve around his hobbyhorse, I don’t see why he couldn’t be better than mr Wilhelm.')
