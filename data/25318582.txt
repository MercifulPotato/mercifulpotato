Item(by='mattlondon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607203847, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25315780, text='&gt; I find it disturbing that people have stopped supporting free speech when they stopped liking its content.<p>I think the problem is that - in the west at least - we have fairly good free speech, and the governments do not routinely go around censoring discussion etc (obviously this is not true everywhere and varies from place to place).<p>So this means that people who want to say something <i>can</i> say something using the usual means&#x2F;technologies. They do not generally need to resort to anything special to avoid censorship or consequences.<p>As a result, a large proportion of the people who <i>do</i> end up using the uncensorable&#x2F;untraceable tech are the worst of society doing outright illegal stuff. Drug dealers, kiddie fidlers, murders, organised crime, terrorists etc.<p>I love the idea of decentralised web tech etc, but I do not want to spend my time facilitating the scum of society to break the laws in my country. I also don&#x27;t want to host their decentralised content on my machines or waste my bandwidth transmitting their uncensorable porn etc.<p>Of course I realise that there are places in the world where there are not as many freedoms as I enjoy and people might genuinely need to use such technology to avoid oppression. I guess I am just selfish.<p>Tl;Dr - you can support free speech without supporting illegal activity.')
