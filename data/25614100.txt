I imagine it had to be painful to write. Sharing such experiences help others in the same situation understand that it&#x27;s not their fault: unfortunately, toxic people and toxic work environments exist.<p>If you are in a situation like the one described, my advice is: _just leave_. It&#x27;s not worth it: it&#x27;s not worth the money, it&#x27;s not worth the feeling of &quot;failure&quot;, it&#x27;s not worth the fear that you won&#x27;t find anything better. Just leave. If you have some friends at that job, don&#x27;t worry: they&#x27;ll understand.<p>Don&#x27;t be afraid of not finding anything else: we&#x27;re very lucky in this regard, software engineering jobs are relatively easy to find. And &quot;there may be many unexpected feasts ahead of you&quot;.')
