I&#x27;ve had an HR women on the phone with me crying because she&#x27;s so disturbed ny what happened but she had to pretend like she wasn&#x27;t infront of my boss. She even told me 1:1 the man who refused to let me speak also refused to speak to her it was beneath him and he had another male deliver the message to her to fire me.<p>In the end she was useless to me and powerless and had as much power ad a caged parrot.<p>If they are not evil they are simply in control of determining nothing and just a euphemistic liaison for corporate abuse.<p>I have many war stories from companies like these. Never sign the paperwork right away. I was once given 23minutes to sign a severence agreement and found out later they violated state law: 21 days plus a 7 day walk back, and broke federal law by saying I couldn&#x27;t have cobra health insurance if I didn&#x27;t promise to shut up.<p>Typically a shut up you little bitch document also known as a separation agreement holds severence pay hostage, not healthcare. They also fired me days before I vested my equity and didn&#x27;t tell me why. In my state you can fire anyone for any reason. They don&#x27;t have to tell you why. Yeh it&#x27;s really messed up.<p>Corporations are like small abusive dictatorships. Just try to find a decent one with good work who is successful enough to be focused on good engineering or whatever it is you do they don&#x27;t need to bully and tear people down to protect themselves and get by in life.')
