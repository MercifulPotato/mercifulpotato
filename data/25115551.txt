Having a PhD will help you get a research position, teaching position, or select &#x27;high-end&#x27; jobs. You can still do research jobs or teaching jobs with a masters, but people with a PhD would likely rise to the top of the resume pile over a masters degree candidate. What I mean by &#x27;high-end&#x27; jobs would be things like Data Science or AI&#x2F;ML researchers&#x2F;leads for Google, finance, etc.<p>That being said, if your current company will pay for the PhD (or allow you to pursue one while paying your normal salary) and you have the time to do it, then it just becomes a question of how much do you want it.<p>I thought about doing an online DSc for data science since my company would pay for 90% of it. But in the end I felt that it wouldn&#x27;t give me enough benefit over my MSIS to be worth that 10% and, more importantly, my time. I have come to accept that I&#x27;m just a midlevel dev with no potential. I&#x27;ll work my job (that I hate) for as long as I can and save as much money as possible so that one day I can quit.')
