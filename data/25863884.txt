I have these options because being a computer programmer (lately) gives me options.  In any occupation where it is a &quot;buyer&#x27;s market&quot;, the employee has no such option.<p>Now, whether things like healthcare and retirement should be linked to employment in the first place, is a real and valid question.  But currently it is, and the distinction between &quot;employee&quot; and &quot;contractor&quot; seems bogus in a lot of cases.')
