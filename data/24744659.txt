Item(by='nendroid', descendants=None, kids=[24745522], score=None, time=1602408400, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24744286, text='&gt;I can just as well argue that long rambling variable names are unreadable, because they obscure the macro-level structure of the code and the continuous repetition creates extra cognitive load (&quot;is this really the same variable as the other one? It looks like the first three words are the same, but...&quot;) especially when one tries to keep track of several of these huge names and follow the dataflow.<p>This problem you describe occurs in the english language. In formal documentation of code written in English tends to be by far more verbose in their explanation of code than the code itself.<p>Yet we don&#x27;t complain about english? Why?<p>What if I take all the crazy shortcuts we use in programming names and use that in documentation and daily communication. Would it make my communication seem less like rambling and seem more clear? Would it help lessen the obscurity of the macro level structure of my point? Will removing the continuous use of grammatical repetition with words like &quot;the&quot; or &quot;and&quot; lessen the large cognitive load on your brain so you can understand my english?<p>No it likely won&#x27;t. In fact it will make me LESS understandable.<p>The dichotomy here illustrates a bias within human nature. For some reason people perceive a certain level of verbosity in code to be bad but not so in english. Given the fact that even among programmers English is much more readable than code I would say that there is definitely a huge unrealized mass delusion going on here.<p>Have you heard of literate programming by donald knuth? It&#x27;s literally about taking every line of code and upping the verbosity by 10x by replacing it with a macro of an english paragraph. Literally an extreme version of the verbose variable naming I&#x27;m describing.<p>If you can see validity in literate programming than basically my variable naming is a tiny tiny step in that direction.')
