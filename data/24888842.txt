Only one of those handful of cases was significant (I <i>needed</i> that information for work, not a simple curious search) but Google saved the day.<p>Some of it may be due to years of growing accustomed to building searches subconsciously around Google which is unfair to DDG, but it&#x27;s hard to say definitively.')
