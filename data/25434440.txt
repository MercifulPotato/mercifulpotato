I see they have a &quot;Notebook Server,&quot; is that what you mean by &quot;locally,&quot; rather than starting it from clicking an e.g. &quot;jupyter.html&quot; file?<p>To their credit, it doesn&#x27;t seem to use Node, and configuration via .py files tells me maybe they have some lightweight server thing that makes it a bit more manageable as a single-user app than via Node or Electron and friends.<p>Anyway, I have a project I have been wanting to be completely self-contained in an HTML file, but that gives me CORS problems, so now I&#x27;m thinking maybe the Jupyter posse has implemented a nice compromise I can use.')
