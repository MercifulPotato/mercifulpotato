Item(by='thinkcontext', descendants=None, kids=[25907594], score=None, time=1611601961, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25906704, text='You&#x27;ve moved the goalposts from where you originally said EV&#x27;s are &quot;very expensive&quot;.  &quot;Very expensive&quot; cannot mean less than the average price for a new car.  You can argue more expensive than comparable quality or something but &quot;very expensive&quot; is wrong.  As for used cars, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s enough data yet but I recall seeing an article where Teslas depreciated less than comparable ICE vehicles.<p>On the developing world front, in the last few months of the year the best selling EV in China cost $4,200.<p>&gt; Plus personally I&#x27;ve rarely convinced anyone to buy anything with TCO calculations. Maybe you&#x27;ve had more luck :-)<p>The fuel costs ways less per mile, what don&#x27;t you believe about that?<p>&gt; I think EVs are still a few years ago from real mass adoption. 2025 sounds a bit more realistic.<p>This is what the projections I&#x27;ve read say as well, and battery prices will continue to decline, though not as steeply.  That will be when the steepening of the adoption S curve happens.')
