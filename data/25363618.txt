Mainstream news networks like Fox have talking heads spouting venomous lies that are demonstrably and trivially proven as such. The <i>POTUS</i> is lying on an hourly basis (many of those lies just <i>brazenly</i>, ridiculously false), and has millions of people believing his every word - he&#x27;s personally profiting hugely, while brainwashing them and whipping them up into frenzy. It&#x27;s fucking <i>dangerous</i>, especially with the US&#x27; lax gun laws.<p>I don&#x27;t like private companies getting to decide what&#x27;s truthful and what&#x27;s not, but it&#x27;s not like the US government is doing a better job, and is it <i>safe</i> to allow mad conspiracies and obvious lies to become &quot;truth&quot; for so many millions?<p>I don&#x27;t think there are any good outcomes here regardless - it&#x27;s one of those &quot;least worst&quot; choices.')
