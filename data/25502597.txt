It doesn&#x27;t include a word processor or a spreadsheet app - Oberon was created to build a workstation system, not an office machine - but a graphics editor is included. Other applications are available, of course, such as a tool for digital circuit design or an email tool.<p>But one of the most important use cases for Oberon is probably software development - so one of the most important tools that is included with the system is the compiler.')
