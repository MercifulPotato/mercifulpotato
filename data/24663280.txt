The fundamental randomness is so high here that any ranking a VC made would likely be garbage - the sample size of investments is not nearly high enough to come to a precise viewpoint on expected value of one good deals vs another. As an analogy, if this was a regression the standard errors would be massive, so much so that each investment would not be statistically significantly different from one another in terms of expected return. I think it’s plausible that they’d be able to distinguish best from absolute worst, but best from slightly less good? No way.<p>I think a more realistic “model” of a VCs behavior is one of thresholding - set the bar somewhere and invest in any company that seems to be above that quality bar, with some stochasticity as to which deals you actually win in the end.')
