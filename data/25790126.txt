This is assuming that all &quot;economic activity&quot; directly or indirectly uses energy, and that most energy is fossil-fuel based. This is actually a good way to estimate the maximum energy usage, because energy is fungible but businesses aren&#x27;t a charity. They&#x27;ll sell you something for the energy cost plus profit, but not less than the base energy cost.<p>A Tesla replacement pack costs roughly $15K and a matching solar panel to charge it would cost about $10K. That&#x27;s the equivalent to burning $25K of a fuel such as petrol. Even before the pandemic, my fuel costs were quite low at about $1.5K&#x2F;year, so it would have taken nearly 17 years to break even! An Uber driver might be able to achieve a net benefit for the environment in under a year.')
