I was familiar with the notion of Copyleft, but not with the variant with a &quot;K&quot; ; so I googled it and found this article: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Anti-Wikipedianism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:Anti-Wikipedianism</a><p>&gt; One of the main sources of Anti-Wikipedianism is the radical far copyLeft (also referred to as Kopyleft, with the Communist K, i.e. Das Kapital). They expect Wikipedia to forbid content from being used for commercial purposes.<p>But on the article, it is written &quot;Do as you like.&quot;. So I am a bit confused. Can we really do &quot;as we like&quot;, or can we use this content for commercial purpuses..?')
