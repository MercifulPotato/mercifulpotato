It&#x27;s not unseen to have 32-year old parents living with their 16-year old daughter <i>and her two babies</i>, a 14-year old child and another ~12-year old child. Of course these are extremely poor compared to even most of low income households. Perhaps that&#x27;s what was meant by the comment.')
