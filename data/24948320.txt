Building curb ramps doesn’t just help people in wheelchairs, it also helps parents with strollers and tourists with luggage. Adding subtitles to videos helps both deaf people and language learners. Making websites usable with a screen reader also makes it easier to build automated tests. Disabilities are also not always permanent or complete; people with low vision can also benefit from screen readers even if not legally blind, for example.<p>Specifically for technology, you also need to understand the true life changing difference it can make on a disabled person’s life. My dad is blind, and thanks to screen readers on his computer and phone, he can read books, make Zoom calls for work, correspond with people via email and WhatsApp, and so much more. He’s in his 60s too, and technology has allowed him be an independent and productive member of society.')
