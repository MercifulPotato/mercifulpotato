Item(by='metafunctor', descendants=None, kids=[25902784, 25902868, 25903112, 25902862], score=None, time=1611580148, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25902519, text='The big issue for me is delivery times.  When I order something the website claims is &quot;in stock&quot;, it often takes weeks to be delivered.  Clearly they don&#x27;t have the item in stock, but are backordering it from somewhere else (usually Germany).  That sucks so much.  I am perfectly capable of ordering from Germany myself, and it is much faster than ordering from these faux &quot;in stock&quot; websites.<p>Not Amazon, though.  They get it.  Quick delivery is key.<p>The problem here for Wolt is to get an accurate (and I mean _accurate_) picture of what they can actually deliver very quickly.  Most brick &amp; mortar stores don&#x27;t have the ERP to support that.  They have no computer system that correctly tracks what items they actually have on their shelves.  It&#x27;s crazy, but it&#x27;s true.<p>P.S.  The above may be wildly different in different locales.  I&#x27;m in Finland, where Wolt was conceived.  I sometimes order lunch from Wolt but I have serious reservations they can pull this off with items that are back-ordered through a lengthy supply chain.')
