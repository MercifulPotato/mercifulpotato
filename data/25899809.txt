As the minority opinion Iâ€™m also more likely to get flagged or banned, and I do use that handicap as a crutch sometimes (thanks @dang).<p>Perhaps the best option would be for us to get drunk and rage about this for a few hours or days. I bet I could rant for a lot longer than you, and I bet I understand your position better than you understand mine. Perks of being in the counterculture, I guess.')
