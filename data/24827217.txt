Then you can get a deeper answer. Even, perhaps especially, when they disagree with the way in which the interviewer has framed the question.<p>If you don&#x27;t like Lex&#x27;s style, well, then don&#x27;t listen to him. A lot of\npeople seem to like and enjoy him. Asking someone to change to better fit\nyour own expectations, honestly, seems quite a bit to ask, and at the end\nmight not work that well, if it doesn&#x27;t fit himself.<p>Sure, you can critique whatever you want, but Lex doesn&#x27;t really has to\nlisten and also shouldn&#x27;t, if he has that many listeners by just doing his\nthing.')
