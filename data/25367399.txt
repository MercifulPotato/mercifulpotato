They were considered moderate in the 90s, but I would classify them as far right today.<p>Perfect example of why the question had to be asked.<p>Most people in America would not consider those positions to be far-right today. Most immigrants to the US today would also have those positions if asked. Everyone in my parents&#x27; generation still has those views, and my generation is split on the issue.<p>Don&#x27;t ask don&#x27;t tell and the Defense of Marriage act can coexist with a tolerant society. It&#x27;s not &quot;far-right&quot; to believe that marriage is only between men and women and to still believe that LGBT people have the same rights as everyone else.<p>EDIT: Further data. Pew says that in 2019(!) 49% of black Americans did not support extending marriage to LGBT people. Are 49% of black Americans far-right? Obviously not, but intellectual circles in the US have moved so far to the left that this is a serious statement they would make.
