Interestingly, every point you said was completely false for me:<p>&gt; 1. Socializing is the primary activity that happens at work for the vast majority of workers. The gal or guy coming by your desk to &quot;check in&quot; or &quot;see how your weekend was&quot; etc... is literally where they find their social outlets and personal connections.<p>Not for me, or most of my cowoerks at Google. We absolutely would be doing more work by WFH. When we indeed going to hang out in the office with coworker, that&#x27;s because we are bored by the work at hands, and need some outlet or simply resting. Not that we desire hanging out with coworkers.<p>&gt; 2. Managers like to be able to watch their direct reports because it makes them feel more in control than they are<p>I never was in a team that managers need to see their reports. Most of the time, I often want to see my manager(s) in the office, but they were enjoying their meetings all day every day through the week.<p>&gt; 3. The commuting routine, even if it&#x27;s a nightmare, offers a sense of normalcy that most people have gotten used to and in a weird way rely on for grounding.<p>This sounds weird. I absolutely hate the commute. I am pretty sure that without the commute, my work output would double. Just by having those commute time being actual working hours.<p>I dont feel commuting is normal. Commuting isn&#x27;t ideal for anyone. That&#x27;s an unreasonable idea to me.<p>&gt; 4. For a huge swath of Americans at least, work is an escape from the drudgery of the home.<p>That&#x27;s somewhat true.<p>I indeed felt relaxed in office without being bothered by my children.<p>But now after all of us get used to the mode where my closed door means I am not to be disturbed, I absolutely love working from home. For example, if I need a rest, I can grab my younger son, and play with my older daughter. Fantastic experience! I think WFH have reshaped my relationship with my daughter because of more time together.')
