You probably already have a list in your head of “non-bullshit” people that you already know. Ask them what they care about and what they like to think about&#x2F;work on. A few brainstorm starters:<p>- How can we address inequality and provide more opportunities to traditionally under-served communities?<p>- What does a “better” education system look like?<p>- How do we get people to eat less meat without being dogmatic or preachy? It’s really a win-win, people and the environment will be healthier.<p>- How does one combat counter-factualism (fake-news) without getting political?<p>- How do we bring new opportunities to those working in industries on the out? E.g. coal<p>- What are we going to do about a growing &amp; aging population? Thinking about things like elderly care, retirement savings, family relationships in a fast moving and increasingly remote world.<p>I think most people want to think of themselves as “non-bullshit” but often it’s easier and safer to take a 6-figure job at something like a FAANG where they focus on monopolizing attention instead of working on really impactful problems like climate, education, health, etc. How might we change those incentives to get more people working on those types of problems?')
