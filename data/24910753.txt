Popcorn did this and got their code reinstated on github: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24885079" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24885079</a><p>In the worst case, they need to adjust their tests. This is what the issuer of the complaint brought up. Their tests of the code downloaded a couple of seconds of what the RIAA thought is copyrighted material. If I&#x27;m not mistaken, this is what they are basing their case on.<p>If youtube-dl removes those explicit urls from their test cases, I don&#x27;t think they have a case. You could argue fair use, but remember it&#x27;s only a test case in that program. The authors could just as easily reprogram the test cases to accept any url a user wants to test.<p>Anyways, consult lawyers, perhaps change the test code and issue a counter notice and move on.')
