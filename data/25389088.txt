Item(by='lisper', descendants=None, kids=[25390142], score=None, time=1607712111, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25388936, text='Hm, interesting.  I think the discrepancy comes about because Scott takes into account equivalence under state permutation, but I&#x27;d have to crunch some more algebra to be sure.  In any case, I&#x27;d certainly accept Scott A. as an authoritative source on this.<p>[UPDATE] No, that can&#x27;t be it.  A two-state machine has no equivalent permutations because one state has to be a privileged start state.  And even if it did, there are only two permutations of two states, so this can&#x27;t possible explain the discrepancy.<p>[UPDATE2] Turns out there is a typo in Scott&#x27;s formula.  The correct answer is (4(n+1))^2n, not (4n+1)^2n.  This is because each state transition has 4(n+1) possible values, 4 possibilities for the movement direction and symbol to write (with two possibilities each) and, independently, n+1 possible next states (including the halt state).  The result for 2-state machines is, as &#x2F;u&#x2F;tromp correctly noted, 20736.<p>[UPDATE3] (I think I&#x27;m about to set some kind of record here.)  As a sanity check, it&#x27;s pretty easy to see that the result has to be an even number because every possible TM has a corresponding distinct TM where the direction of movement or written symbol in any state is changed to the opposite value.')
