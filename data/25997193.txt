It was life-changing for a while, but it started feeling less helpful over time. I remember feeling like my energy&#x2F;attention was a zero-sum game, and I had to pay it back at the end of the day.<p>I was frustrated with these side-effects in college, so I quit the meds as a freshman. I got through college and even a masters degree, but it was a slog. While working at my first &quot;real&quot; job, I felt like I&#x27;d hit a brick wall. It was near impossible for me to stay focused during the day. I went back to my doctor and started taking Vyvanse, which I&#x27;ve been on for ~5 years now. This drug has been really amazing, and I don&#x27;t feel totally sapped at the end of the day. (My layman&#x27;s understanding is that it&#x27;s a pro-drug, so your liver has to chop the molecules apart to produce the actual amphetamine. It has a slower ramp-up and ramp-down than the Concerta did.)<p>One thing to consider is sleep quality. It turns out I had an obstructive sinus blockage for many years. I got it removed surgically and feel amazing. I still take meds to deal with underlying ADHD symptoms, but I could actually be a functioning adult without the meds at this point.')
