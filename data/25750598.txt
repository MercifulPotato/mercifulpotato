First, that the trifactorial data was just wildly too accurate (using a chi-squared approach). This seems to be resolved in the scientific community as an off-by-one error: if instead of 10 seeds, Gregor had used 11 on occasion, that&#x27;s enough to resolve the issue.<p>The other issue is the chi-squared analysis of Mendel&#x27;s experiments in aggregate, which when pooled also too neatly fit the pattern he wanted to illustrate. And as best I know, nobody has adaquately disputed that analysis.')
