I doubt hospitals have ten thousand deaths which they procrastinated reporting.<p>More likely the author meant that November and December is not yet counted, and therefore must add the “yet” to the sentence.<p>As you say, [0] states that a slightly larger than average number of deaths occurred during Q2, and a smaller number during Q3. It may be a tragedy to die in spring and not in fall, and miss one last summer. Please keep in mind though that the claim you’re responding to was that 2020 the year didn’t see a significant increase in deaths - it was a very average year to die as a Swede.')
