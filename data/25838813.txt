You can use Pandoc to do this <i>if you are the sort of person who is comfortable using tools like Pandoc.</i> I can do that, along with all sorts of other things, because I am that sort of nerd.<p><i>However,</i> most fiction writers and editors are <i>not</i> that sort of nerd. Most people don&#x27;t want to use Markdown in the first place. Of the people who <i>do</i> want to use Markdown, not all of <i>them</i> are that sort of nerd, either. They want an &quot;Export to &gt; DOCX&quot; command in their editor, not &quot;save the Markdown file, open your terminal app, change to your documents directory, and type &quot;pandoc -o my-novel.docx my-novel.md&quot;. (And that&#x27;s assuming they&#x27;re not doing something like, well, what NovelWriter does, saving individual chapters and perhaps even individual <i>scenes</i> as independent files.)<p>Look, I love Pandoc. It&#x27;s great. But it&#x27;s not a tool for everyone. If someone is trying to embrace the plain text lifestyle with a tool like NovelWriter but pointing out not being able to export to a Word file is a problem for them, asking &quot;are you comfortable with Unix command line tools&quot; and then telling them about Pandoc if they say yes might be a great idea -- but starting out with &quot;obviously you hate the Unix way&quot;, maybe not so much.<p>&gt; you can even convert it to WordStar....magic eh? Pandoc can do that.<p>No, in fact it cannot. :)')
