When I was on my national Reddit sub, it would come up 40 times a year.<p>When I was a kid, everyone was catching it. That was just one of those diseases you catch once and then you are done with it.<p>It is so low-risk that doctors didn&#x27;t even declare the cases as they were supposed to be. They just observed them in case it would turn bad. Watching well and treating the few difficult case well made it so that there was just around 5 deaths a year, amongst cohorts of 800.000 who almost all caught it.
