I&#x27;ve recently had the displeasure to work with Azure and not only the console UI is even worse than AWS but every single service, despite looking similar to the competition, is actually different in subtle ways (which you often don&#x27;t realize until you get started implementing against it) and forces you to waste time working around some Microsoft dev&#x27;s attempt at being smart[0].<p>[0]: as an example, obtaining root on a container in an Azure DevOps CI pipeline. You have to bind-mount the Docker management socket into the container, then use that to gain initial root access and install sudo, then use sudo to run all your commands. I don&#x27;t recall ever having to do that on any other CI service.')
