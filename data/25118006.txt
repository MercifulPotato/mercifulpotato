AirBNB does not side with the host more often. It prefers to do nothing.<p>We had drug dealers moving product from one. We told airbnb not to contact the guests. They contact them anyways trying to &quot;resolve&quot; the situation.<p>Every time guests break rules like smoking that have clearly posted fees, airbnb says they can&#x27;t help. Even when the guests admit to it.<p>When we needed to call CPS on morons endangering their one year old, we were not able to get the guests information to give to the police.<p>Their support will straight up lie to you to resolve cases faster.')
