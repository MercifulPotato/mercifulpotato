Back then the consensus was the watch would be a watershed test of whether the team at Apple had it in them. Now that they&#x27;ve conclusively nailed it, we discover it didn&#x27;t count after all.<p>Of course the expectation was that the Apple Watch should be just as popular as the iPhone and transcend the watch industry completely. Wearables would be the next utterly indispensable technology, maybe even threatening the phone itself. In comparison, &#x27;merely&#x27; dominating the existing watch industry and gobbling large chunks of the fitness tracker market seems underwhelming.')
