One time the hard drive of my Mac Mini crashed. I lost all my mp3s. Fortunately, they were all stored on my iPod, so I could just get them from there.<p>On Mac: There was an application that could do that, but Apple sued them and so was not available anymore.\nOn Windows: Was not able to get those mp3&#x27;s out (don&#x27;t remember why exactly)\nOn Linux: Was able to mount it and get those files out with some Open Source iTunes clone.<p>At that point, I totally ditched Apple.')
