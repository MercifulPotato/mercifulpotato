Your QB can be absolutely amazing but if a guard or tackle is slacking that QB is going to be sacked over and over but in most cases it&#x27;s a lot harder to see the impact.<p>In wrestling everyone can individually perform amazingly but at most you&#x27;re only contributing 6 points to the score but if you&#x27;ve ever seen one wrestler perform well at the top of the lineup you can just see how it influences everyone else and triggers a run, like you said immediate and obvious to all.')
