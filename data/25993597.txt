How much will each of your sats cost? What is the projected development cost to launch your first satellite? Or What will you need to raise from investors to get one satellite in orbit? What is your strategy for de-risking what sounds like a lot of new tech before your first launch? When does the first, to spec satellite fly (not including hosted payloads)? Why LWIR over MWIR? How would you respond to competitors claiming claiming similar thermal imaging resolution (MWIR)?')
