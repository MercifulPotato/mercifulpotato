The one time a year I need my laptop, it&#x27;s out of commission for a day while updates install or whatever.  For that reason, I have a desktop and take an iPad Pro when I&#x27;m going to be away from home.  The iPad is no computer replacement, but it can SSH places and can do enough work to justify not owning a laptop.  More importantly, it can&#x27;t have any configuration done to it.  But if you already have a laptop, I would just skip the iPad entirely.  The laptop is your &quot;one device&quot;.<p>(Would I want a mobile processor as my primary means of doing work?  Absolutely not.  But, people seem to make it work... at the cost of being blown away by a new processor that&#x27;s slower than HEDTs they could have been using for a few years ;)')
