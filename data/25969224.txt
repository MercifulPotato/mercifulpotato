I&#x27;m not sure there was a big-name platformer for PC was released in my entire formative years, and if it was, I certainly didn&#x27;t play it.<p>Link to the Past was also quite hard, but I cheated at that (abusing the saving&#x2F;loading from the Switch emulator version) so I can&#x27;t compare. But I blamed it&#x27;s difficulty on its old-fashioned controls: you can&#x27;t attack in a direction unless you move in that direction. I find this extremely frustrating and limited after playing more modern top-down action games like Hotline Miami.')
