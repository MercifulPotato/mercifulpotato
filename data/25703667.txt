Even the new  EVs by the trsditional IC car makers will ramp slowly as the inevitable stumbles cause recalls and production delays. People are now witnessing the huge economies in EV, both in terms of far lower electric power costs coupled with the far lower mechanical repair costs due to the ability of an electric motor to last millions of miles compared to the thousands of threshing&#x2F;wearing parts in an IC machine. The high first cost has been a barrier.\nI can see no reason that a large car, with a well streamlined body, and only 150-200 miles range as well as a far smaller motor than Tesla can not fill the low end chevy niche. This will save on the first cost of the battery. Many people can operate within that range for days and new houses will all have chargers, same with new condos. Many deliverers can use a small cube van that only goes 150 miles on a charge. With flat floors, they can easily make 2-3 versions with extra battery space under the floor as ordered. There will be an epic expansion of EVs over the next 10 years, and all makers will expand into that space.\nShort selling is a form of informed gambling&#x2F;guessing...')
