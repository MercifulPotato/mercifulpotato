I remember saving these points from a Zero Hedge article:<p>1. Kim DotCom said he knew Seth Rich and knew he was the leaker.  He tried to Mueller to take his testimony about Seth Rich but he wouldn&#x27;t reply to his emails.<p>2.  &quot;two men working with the Rich family - private investigator and former D.C. Police detective Rod Wheeler and family acquaintance Ed Butowsky, have previously stated that Rich had contacts with WikiLeaks before his death.&quot;<p>3.  Friend of the family Ed Butowsky says there&#x27;s an FBI report &quot;establishing that Seth Rich sent emails to WikiLeaks.&quot;<p>4.  Private investigator and former D.C. Police detective Rod &quot;Wheeler also claimed in recently leaked audio that Seth Rich’s brother, Aaron – a Northrup Grumman employee, blocked him from looking at Seth’s computer and stonewalled his investigation.&quot;<p>6.  &quot;Metro police detectives claim that Mr. Rich was a robbery victim, which is strange since after being shot twice in the back, he was still wearing a $2,000 gold necklace and watch. He still had his wallet, key and phone.&quot;<p>Has any of this changed or been questioned since then?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zerohedge.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2018-03-02&#x2F;contradictions-seth-rich-murder-continue-challenge-hacking-narrative" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zerohedge.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2018-03-02&#x2F;contradictions-set...</a>')
