Wouldn&#x27;t the centralized server just be a different server?<p>The source code is all public and freely licensed, client and server. Anyone could pick it up, turn it federated, and run it. But it’s unlikely Signal would choose to federate with any other servers.<p>&gt; Side note: isn&#x27;t it good to be centralized while the app is quickly rolling out new features? Then a switch to federation<p>It’s pretty clear from Moxie’s words on the topic that he has no desire to federate Signal in the future. He’s solidly convinced that the agility necessary to build a userbase on top of a secure messenger will be lost if he has to spend resources bringing the rest of the ecosystem in line with new developments.')
