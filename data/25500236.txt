The fact that you cannot make a YouTube video expressing concerns about COVID-19 or election fraud, since it will be censored, is a shining example of the failure of freedom of speech.<p>Many people think that censorship is something that only a government is capable of doing, and that it doesn’t apply to corporations. But when multinational corporations like Google have more power, and more wealth than the GDPs of half the world’s countries, that thinking falls flat on its face.<p>This proposed Polish law is the strongest form of anti-censorship that I’ve ever seen.')
