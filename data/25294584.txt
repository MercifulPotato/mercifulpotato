It’s cheaper to take a pet aboard a plane than to board for a few weeks. But there should be better options than either (1) the cargo bay or (2) in the cabin with everyone else.<p>&gt; Actual service animals do still belong, because they provide an actual service, are extremely well-trained, and are worth the allergen&#x2F;phobia tradeoff because folks who need them literally need them.<p>Emotional support animals <i>absolutely are a thing</i>. The problem is everyone abuses the idea. But for someone with depression, just having your dog or cat next to you can keep you sane better than your medicine can. I know, because that someone is me. Do I take my pet everyone? No, but they absolutely do help when needed.')
