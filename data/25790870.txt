I’m not a typical user, so I really don’t know, but my sense is that people have a go-to source (Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, aggregators like Apple News or yeah, Google News, or loading sites directly like NYT, Fox News, etc.) If they do use Google search, what are they searching for? Do they type “news”, or do they think, hmm, what topics am I interested in today, and search for those directly?')
