Global warming is an Algore rebranding that got lots of public awareness. Once the science took over it was back to climate change again. But yeah you are right. A lot of people just attack the used language and then shout &quot;deception&quot; when people are just talking colloquially because explaining everything from scratch gets very tiring eventually.<p>The problem with climate change deniers is that they refuse everything so you have to actually explain everything from scratch time and time again. That&#x27;s part of the strategy. Look for tiny mistakes and then deny the whole thing.<p>Clarifying that one is talking about anthropogenic climate change instead of just &quot;regular&quot; climate change is a pretty good example. Ultimately the difference is meaningless because non anthropogenic climate change is insignificant on human time scales. Give me 500 years to prepare and I won&#x27;t care. Give me 50 years and I will always fail.<p>The worst part is that I don&#x27;t even see any long term benefits to denying climate change. Even if it was completely fictional I still don&#x27;t see any reason to not adopt technologies that would ultimately reduce the impact of climate change. Coal is a dying industry because of the economics. Oil is too precious to burn in cars (planes and ships are good use cases though). There is a general lack of investments to put central bank money into.<p>Oh, did I just say &quot;climate change denier&quot;? I obviously mean &quot;climate change skeptics&quot;. (I am awaiting a response that skeptic is also wrong)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;j.2153-3490.1956.tb01206.x" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;j.2153-3490....</a>')
