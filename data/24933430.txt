The students who get their degree but can&#x27;t use it have to pay the money back just the same as students who got the degree and get the high-paying entry level job.<p>So getting a degree is a gamble, because you either come out ahead or you get hobbled by it for the rest of your life. Whereas if you did indeed get free money to get a degree it would eliminate the hobble and produce a class of well-educated people who could afford to work for PD wages.')
