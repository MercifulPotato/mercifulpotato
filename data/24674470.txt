One thing I can note from personal experience, though, is that saying `structopt` “is relatively slow to compile and doesn’t produce the tiniest code” is quite an understatement—its binary overhead is 379.6KiB and compile time is over 15 seconds[0]! Parsing args is a <i>tiny</i> part of an application, so giving over so much time and memory is crazy to me. I’ve personally settled on using pico, which doesn’t use proc macros so you don’t get the sugar of a declarative arguments object, but it’s fast to build and almost as small as the lightweight recommendation `argh`.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RazrFalcon&#x2F;pico-args#alternatives" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RazrFalcon&#x2F;pico-args#alternatives</a>')
