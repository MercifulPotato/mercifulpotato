For my uses I’d rather just test something out and either let it burn down quickly or pay the price eventually to fix it (an old colleague called this a “champagne problem”). I’ve only had to pay the price a few times, which probably made each sequential one easier to avoid some parts.<p>Rails is still a phenomenal framework to use, again something I somewhat begrudgingly admit.')
