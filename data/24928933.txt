Of course it’s a story that has been picked up  by  the  media,  and some  people  have  been  crunching  heavily,but  a large  part  of  the  team  is  not crunching at all since they have finished their work; it’s mostly about Q&amp;A and engineers, programmers –but it’s not that heavy;  of  course,  it  will be  extended  a bit,  but  we  have  feedback  from  the  team; they’re happy about the extra three weeks, so we don’t see any threats regarding crunch.&quot;')
