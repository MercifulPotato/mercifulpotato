For example, accepting &quot;douchey anticompetitive moves&quot; in exchange for utilising inevitable progress of the internet. One common response could be that the tradeoff isn&#x27;t worth it; HN would be willing to sacrifice utilising the progress being made in exchange for avoiding the neverending &quot;douchey anticompetitive moves&quot;.  As I read these &quot;nostalgic&quot; comments, HN is not denying that progress is occurring.  HN is questioning whether the tradeoff for utilising the progress, under &quot;douchey anticompetitive&quot; terms, is actually worth it.  HN does not long for the level of progress of the 90&#x2F;00&#x27;s, it reminisces about the time before every iota of progress was extricably linked to &quot;douchey anticompetitive moves&quot;.')
