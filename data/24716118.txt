Tesla quality, for the prices they charge, is insulting. I had a Model S for 3 years, put about 20K miles on it (which means I wasn’t a “heavy” driver by any means) and it was rattling, had massive panel gaps in the body, and all kinds of little bits just starting to fall apart. The charger door wouldn’t stay closed and eventually broke due to coming open on the highway so many times. After just 20K miles, the car honestly felt like a car feels after you put 150K miles on it.<p>Then there’s the service. I got an indicator on the massive screen telling me that the radiator needed service. I called the Service center and was told by two different people, “that’s not possible because our cars don’t have radiators.” I said, “look, I’m not the technician here, you are; but, I am reading you the message that the car has on the screen.” Finally got someone who acknowledged that, yes, Tesla’s do have radiators and I brought it in. When I picked it up, the Air Conditioning didn’t work. In the middle of Summer. I called them and told them and they told me there were no openings for service for 6 weeks. After arguing with the service manager for 20 minutes on the phone, he agreed to have me come in the next day and, sure enough, they’d forgotten to reconnect it when they were working on it.<p>Was it the worst car I’ve ever owned? Honestly, it might have been. When I factor in that it cost over $90K, it’s definitely the worst car purchase I’ve ever made.')
