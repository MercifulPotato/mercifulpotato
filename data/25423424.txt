As a user, you can very easily turn it off and on at will, mute it, even set status messages like &quot;I will check my messages twice a day&quot;.<p>There are plenty of &#x27;product X is bad&#x27; write-ups, but all of them try to blame something while the blame is for something intangible which is much harder to write a clever title for.<p>Same goes for the open office; that can work just fine if you make sure everyone shuts their mouth while working; having your &#x27;own&#x27; office space with lots of distractions isn&#x27;t any better than having a &#x27;shared&#x27; space with the same distractions.
