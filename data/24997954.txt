In the years since the team working on the ported part has been given time to make their code better.  I have concluded that we could have in place refactored the old code to the new system and been fully functional the whole time for much less cost.<p>The new system is clearly better than the old one.  If we had refactored in place we wouldn&#x27;t have the same system as we have now. With the benefit of hindsight, I can now see some places in the new system that are not working as well as hoped and we are working on a plan to refactor those parts in place to something better.')
