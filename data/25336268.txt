I switched to TS from pure JS a couple years ago and could never imagine going back. I am <i>so</i> much more productive in TS than JS:<p>1. Typeahead is crucial, and even when just working on my own projects it makes me much faster.<p>2. Refactoring is a scary nightmare in pure JS, but so much easier with TS.<p>3. I have yet to see any sizable, multi-person pure JS project <i>not</i> become an incomprehensible nightmare after a couple years. TS makes large codebases much easier to maintain.<p>There are other reasons.<p>If anything, the consolidation onto TS from previous competing type systems for JS (e.g. I think Flow is dead for all intents and purposes, and I&#x27;ve seen a number of projects migrate onto TS from Flow) results in less fragmentation.')
