Or even said it provocatively? Maybe Farrakhan, but otherwise...? Almost every Black Lives Matter commentator has pointed out that the US police are deeply violent against everyone, even though black people get it the worst. In fact they have used this to build support for the movement, and argue that white Americans&#x27; tolerance for police violence against blacks leads to increased police violence overall.<p>The way you formulated your view is what (actual) critical race theorists would describe as being &quot;high in racial resentment&quot;: you&#x27;re inventing pro-black racists in response to legitimate calls from black people for civil rights reform.<p>&gt; supporting discrimination for&#x2F;against some races (for black &#x2F; against Asian when it comes to schooling), etc<p>Harvard artificially deflating the number of accepted Asians is a thorny issue, but calling affirmative action &quot;discrimination&quot; is another of these views that are filled with racial resentment. It&#x27;s not quite as bad as people who suggest that black beneficiaries of affirmative action are somehow unqualified (this is not how affirmative action works and it&#x27;s disgusting to suggest otherwise), but it&#x27;s still a pejorative and antagonistic framework of the issue. It also completely ignores why affirmative action exists in the first place: unlike white and Asian children, black children are badly screwed over by racist teachers and racist administrators starting from kindergarten.<p>&gt;  A lot of these policies would be good if they were instead targeting everybody<p>The reason why critical race theorists criticize this classical-liberal approach is that a wealthy black person still overall has a much more difficult life in America than a lower-middle-class white person. White people have a lot of difficulty understanding this, hence &quot;class not race&quot; movements on the left. But &quot;class not race&quot; in America is a right-wing idea, one that couldn&#x27;t exist without a racist erasure of black history and black experiences. Bernie Sanders is also a big &quot;class not race&quot; guy and it&#x27;s a huge reason why there was a such a split in 2016 between socialists and social democrats. And also why a bunch of centrists and center-right folks (like my father) liked Bernie.<p>&gt; (e.g. &quot;defund the police&quot; is particularly bad... instead what you should do is, prevent police buying military gear, stop swatting, ban civil forfeiture, fund (and train) them more, legalize drugs, reduce poverty to reduce crime, ...)<p>OK, I also agree that the &quot;abolish the police&quot; framework is poorly phrased. But Black Lives Matter activists have definitely pushed for every single one of these policies, except &quot;more funding&quot; - even if you don&#x27;t care about police violence, metropolitan police in particular simply have too much damn money. They spend it very badly! But they don&#x27;t need more money, they need more oversight on how its spent.<p>&gt; Therefore, I understand why proponents of CRT would want to pain liberals like me as bad (&quot;right-wing&quot;)<p>You are clearly center-right in a lot of ways. Maybe you are more of a social democrat on economics. But  suggesting that CRT is anti-white and that Black Lives Matter hasn&#x27;t actually thought about policy is... just plain racist.')
