In theory, it is much easier to get large companies and nation states to take actions to protect lands than to reduce consumption.<p>But that&#x27;s where the philosophy of environmentalism can diverge. Are humans capable of being part of nature? Or are we a cancer on the system? An enormous number of people are very misanthropic these days, on principle.<p>It&#x27;s frustrating, also, because consistently-- when people get richer, they care more about preserving nature.<p>This suggests a natural harmony between economic growth and environtal protection. That idea is very offensive to some; but the evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of optimism.')
