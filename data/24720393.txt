So paying for it or being member is in all case 2 very different things. And it seems workers are free to join or not, and most of them decided to join.<p>I don&#x27;t know the situation of all European countries, but in France, unions gets some money from their member, but they also get some money from the state (ie taxppayers), and some elected union&#x2F;worker representatives have some work time paid by the company to work on workers representation and union stuff')
