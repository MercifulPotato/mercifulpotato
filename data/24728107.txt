Then there are several #ifdefs like &quot;__GNU_LIBRARY__&quot; or &quot;__GNUC__&quot; or e-mail addresses of people in the gnu.org domain.<p>In practice, it doesn&#x27;t matter at all as the preprocessor replaces all license headers with a single space even before the compiler has the chance to look at it.')
