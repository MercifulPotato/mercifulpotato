Often the mainstream journalists have an agenda and if you see that comments are disabled under an article, it is a strong indicator that it is a propaganda piece. If comments were enabled, however, you could see many counter opinions to a given article that would give you pointers where to look for the true picture of what happened. AMP makes for lower quality news and just because of that I avoid it, but it also cuts Ad revenue from the outlets that use it.')
