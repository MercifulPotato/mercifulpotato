It&#x27;s a legitimate concern, I think.)<p>I think the story here is that they were overwhelmed with a high demand during the past &quot;WFH and improve your home year&quot; all while their production and shipment capacity was being more or less randomly reduced (separately in each country) with very little warning.<p>Stock sync issues? I used to think they had bugs there until I realized they&#x27;re constrained in two aspects that are both unusually tight at the moment:<p>a) forecasted availability of products in your particular shipment center<p>b) forecasted availability of home delivery capacity in your particular region<p>Note that the two will have to match up for the same week at least (maybe less), or there&#x27;ll be a pileup. In a normal year this isn&#x27;t really a problem, there&#x27;s some slack...<p>The strategy I eventually landed on was to give up trying to bundle everything into one neat order to save a little money. I&#x27;ve been ordering large&#x2F;heavy stuff (like sofas&#x2F;beds) for home delivery in separate deliveries, as soon as I&#x27;ve been able to decide on something. Smaller things I&#x27;ve been picking up outside their nearby store. If I didn&#x27;t live near an IKEA, I&#x27;d order the smaller items by postal&#x2F;package delivery.')
