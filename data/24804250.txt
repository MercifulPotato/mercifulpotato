Some open source software still had more restrictive licensing, but most corporations opted not to use it, often because they simply couldn&#x27;t and still operate legally, and thus, the software was less supported and less used software died out.<p>When companies couldn&#x27;t find free software to use, they just wrote it themselves, typically, unless it was something big and way outside their domain.<p>Rather than being beholden to a licensing agreement, it would be nice if OSS had a license for an &quot;enterprise-level donation&quot; that was mandatory for for-profit use. It would be a one-time cost, so it would be easier to push through the accountants at lots of big companies, and companies could feel free to use the software at their leisure. Authors&#x2F;contributors could choose to charge another fee for upgrading to a new major version, opt to end support of an old version or not and so on and so forth.')
