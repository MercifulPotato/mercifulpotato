We instead nowadays have tons of various fees on our bank accounts so the return ends up being negative. And we&#x27;re supposed to accept that this is fine and normal? Economy is booming? Give me a break.<p>This is why creative solutions like bitcoin, if not (necessarily) directly solving anything, do give pause for thought, and maybe shine some hope for a non-corrupt (immutable) system of money.<p>I need to read up on whether a deflationary currency&#x2F;economy would really be an issue, or if it just wouldn&#x27;t work with how things are <i>currently</i> set up.<p>Edit: And yes, it&#x27;s a complex issue with no outright easy answers. Doesn&#x27;t hurt to think about it though.')
