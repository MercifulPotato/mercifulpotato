The fastest single GPU Apple sells on the Mac Pro is 14 TFLOPS (with a step-up fee of $2,400!).<p>There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any reason why Apple couldn&#x27;t integrate a 16 TFLOPS GPU on an SOC using a 5nm or better process. The M1 GPU is 2.6 TFLOPS, they can x6 or more it, and obviously change the memory subsystem (HBM?).')
