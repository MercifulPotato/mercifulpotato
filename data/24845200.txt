If the A&#x2F;B test says you get more sales when you annoy the customer, who am I to argue (or it annoys me and not them). But it does mean you will have them as a customer and not me, and that&#x27;s fine.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m wrong to use this as one of many indicators of how annoying a SaaS is going to be to deal with over the long term.')
