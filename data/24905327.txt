Granted I live in London, but it&#x27;s more than just the lack of land, it also extends to a different culture around things like parks.<p>E.g. opening hours and fences around parks - what the hell is that about? I was just totally confused the first time I got to a park in the evening and it was <i>closed</i>.<p>Part of it of course has to do with density, but to me that just makes it all the more important to protect and ensure as much access as possible. Instead people are herded into as little land as possible, and opening hours imposed on a good chunk of it.<p>Scotland does have similar rights to Scandinavia.')
