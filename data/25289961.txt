Receiving benefits because of your assigned groups rather than your individual merits must become a positive thing. We are all incentivized to add importance to further categorizations of people, so we might gain some favour. The more of your remedy we get, the worse off we will be.<p>How do you imagine this unequal treatment for good will come to an end &quot;after a while&quot;? When all organizations are geared up to divvy up resources among these groups? When even more people in power got there as champions for specific categories? It will be very hard to get out of that situation.<p>I&#x27;d much rather make up for past violations of &quot;equal treatment for all&quot; by implementing more &quot;equal treatment&quot;. The more of this we can manage to get, the better of we will be. And there will be nothing to wind down &quot;after a while&quot;.')
