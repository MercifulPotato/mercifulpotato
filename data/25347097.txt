Item(by='_jal', descendants=None, kids=[25347237], score=None, time=1607443771, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25346834, text='&gt; I believe Apple can do better because they have so much vertical integration<p>That is a big part of it. But how did Apple do well enough to vertically integrate? They were not the crazy powerhouse they are now for most of their history.<p>Another big aspect is culture. Apple chooses not to ship things they don&#x27;t think are good enough. Put aside that they&#x27;re not always correct. How many other shops do that? How many places stick to the schedule relentlessly, because shipping is all that matters to them? Convince themselves they&#x27;ll fix the software problems after release?<p>A big part, I think, is a combination of knowing when it is &#x27;good enough&#x27;, combined with the courage, patience and money to keep building until you get there (or spike the project because you missed the market window).')
