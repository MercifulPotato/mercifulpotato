There are many communicable diseases that kill, if you&#x27;re being consistent with this save every life possible approach, you also need to stay in your home any time the flu is going around. Do those deaths not count? Tens of thousands of dead are ok, but a hundred thousand is not? How do you decide which lives are worth saving when you throw out these caviler implied moral condemnations of anyone who wouldn&#x27;t live in a state of permanent lockdown to save lives? that&#x27;s the question. I&#x27;m asking this due to your super self certain wording.<p>Basically, I would never make such absolute statements because saving lives is always an opportunity cost. Human life is only so long, if I stay in lockdown a year to save a stranger, I might miss the last Thanksgiving with a parent or grandparent in their last year on the planet and never know until it is too late. That&#x27;s not a trivial cost when you lock down a million to save one, while all one million lose a piece of their finite lives forever.')
