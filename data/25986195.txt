There is a lot of stuff that implicitly assumes this model and fails to work when this is not our reality and the truth is this is not our reality for most Americans today.<p>For people already scoffing at the idea of wanting a servant to serve you your meal, this is a standard expectation in American culture, we just usually call her &quot;mom&quot; and gloss over the fact that she is a de facto servant.<p>One of my many neglected project ideas is to somehow write about how to keep yourself adequately fed under challenging conditions and one of the things that drives that interest is the frequency with which I see complaints online that people are either going broke and getting fat ordering takeout or going broke and getting fat eating microwave meals or similar. Cooking for just one person takes almost as much time and effort as cooking for a whole family and doesn&#x27;t come with built-in conversation, so eating alone doesn&#x27;t simultaneously help everyone in the family bond emotionally, keep up with family news, etc. At best it just keeps you fed and that&#x27;s it.<p>There are benefits to having one person do the cooking, like it means they can get good at it while other people put time and effort into other things. It provides efficiency of time use at the societal level to have some people cook and some people not bother to learn.<p>I think we need to do more takeout and we need to revive a practice that was alive and well when I was child but seems to have died out: The walk-up window for takeout. Now we have drive-throughs and no walk-up windows and this de facto assumes everyone has a car and it penalizes people who don&#x27;t. (No, they often will not serve a pedestrian at a drive-through.)<p>For the pandemic, I really like Little Caesar&#x27;s Pizza Portal and I don&#x27;t see why we can&#x27;t do something similar for more eateries. You order online, get a code, walk in and punch in the code, get your food and leave.<p>One of the hidden benefits is that one person can pay with their debit card and another can pick up because you don&#x27;t sign for it. At most places, if you order online, you need to be prepared to sign the receipt which is a problem if one person is paying and another is picking up.<p>I also would love to see an updated version of the &quot;food court&quot; -- an outdoor socially distanced seating area that serves multiple local eateries with walk-up windows and&#x2F;or food &quot;portals.&quot; Being waited on by waitstaff is of relatively little interest to me personally, but being able to get food conveniently without having to cook it or do the cleanup is quite valuable to me and was when I was homeless.')
