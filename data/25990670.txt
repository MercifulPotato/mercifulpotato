It would link immediately, the voice commands were straight forward and always worked quickly and accurately.<p>I barely use the voice commands in my Corolla right now. It almost never works, takes forever to sync with my phone (Samsung Android) and the voice commands are total shit. It either doesn&#x27;t understand me or the commands are so cumbersome just do something basic, its a waste of time compared to just grabbing my phone and pushing a few buttons. Compared the SYNC where I could say, &quot;Call parents, home.&quot; and it just worked.')
