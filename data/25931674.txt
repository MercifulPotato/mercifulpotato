They are usually dirty and smell like petrol.<p>Aside from the overall grossness of gas stations, they are generally poorly laid out for long term parking. Gas stations need lots of room for cars to get in and out of stalls quickly and usually only have a few spaces for short term parking in front of the convenience store portion of the station.<p>Adding charging centers to roadside restaurants and shopping centers makes a ton more sense because the longer charging time is highly compatible with having a place where there are interesting things to do or rest and eat.')
