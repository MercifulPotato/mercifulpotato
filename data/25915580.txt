Twitter will definitely compete and take marketshare from Substack with lower fees from 20% to 5%. \nI hope this acquisition is actually a stepping stone for Twitter to become a much better service.<p>Twitter could absolutely become a paid service and move away from ads as its business model. No political ads to worry about. No interference with the product experience. And believe it or not, if I understand correctly these services (FB, Twitter) have an ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) of just $5-8 per year.<p>Imagine paying $1-3 per month for FB or Twitter. We&#x27;d no longer be the product — our data not for sale — and the companies would make more money! Knowing that my message would get received, I&#x27;d happily pay to slide into the DMs like people do to me on LinkedIn (mostly service providers, but I&#x27;ve gotten some great biz dev connections from InMail).<p>It&#x27;s almost a running joke, up there with Daft Punk playing at the trash fence, that Twitter just won&#x27;t release an edit button. With a move towards paying subscribers, maybe Twitter will listen to its <i>real</i> customers -- content writers -- rather than advertisers.')
