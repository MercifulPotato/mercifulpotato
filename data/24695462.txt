To defend the woman in that case from the ECHR&#x27;s deranged ruling: Scholars estimate that Mohammed married Aisha, his youngest wife, when she was only 6. If that is not paedophilia, I don&#x27;t know what is.<p>You bring up libel laws in the US. Historically, they have had a very, very high burden of proof. Only oligarchal authoritarians like Trump try to expand their reach. Libel cases are also exceedingly rare, and if they are brought to court, they are brought to court as a civil matter. And, to top it off, criticism or slander of a figure who is:<p>- Dead<p>- Partly mythologized<p>- A religious figure<p>is completely fair game under the US doctrine of free speech and religious freedom. In the US I would be just as free to say &quot;Jesus was a gay man&quot; or &quot;Mohammed was schizophrenic&quot; as anything else, and in my opinion this is the proper approach. Anyone should also be allowed to print the text of the Quran on toilet paper or burn the Bible or deface the Talmud â€” why the hell should that be illegal???<p>Noam Chomsky (who is an extremely prominent Jewish-American scholar and linguist), is one of the staunchest supporters of free speech, from a leftist position. He even made efforts to defend a French Holocaust denier (holocaust denial is also not something I believe should be illegal). I would recommend this video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4-oV42OMQoE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4-oV42OMQoE</a> if you would like to see more on that specific case.<p>If you take a look of the depicted world map, you&#x27;ll see what I was referring to: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Blasphemy_law#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Blasphemy_laws_worldwide.svg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Blasphemy_law#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Blas...</a>. What Germany shares in common with the other countries I named is that blasphemy is a potentially imprisonable offence.<p>I strongly believe that there are many things which are done far better in the German&#x2F;European system:<p>- Healthcare<p>- Data privacy<p>- Taxation<p>- Criminal prosecution&#x2F;the prison system<p>- etc.<p>but there are a few things about the American system which I ascribe extreme value to, chiefly the right to freedom of speech.<p>I say all of this as a dual German-American citizen myself.')
