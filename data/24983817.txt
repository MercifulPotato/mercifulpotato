Then they can slowly incrementally fix it with &quot;live&quot; feedback.<p>Ironically while this might seem bad long term it can potentially lead to a better end-product from both the view of github and the users.<p>The only problem is that you run at risk of ossification, i.e. you no longer being able to fix a problem because to many rely on it being that way.')
