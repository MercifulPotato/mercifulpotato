Because even if it&#x27;s more murky, if they&#x27;re waiting until it&#x27;s -very clearly violent-, egregiously so, with real physical criminal acts occurring because of it, I&#x27;m pretty sure no matter how murky the line is, they&#x27;re well on the side of &quot;violent words&quot;, not &quot;offensive speech&quot;.<p>Your concern only applies if they&#x27;re trying to draw the line in an area that is murky. I&#x27;d contend this is not.')
