That is a possibility of nearly half of Server Sales gone. 97% number is no longer accurate as AMD has gain some ( rather small ) market shares in terms of revenue. But Intel is still &gt;90%. ( In Revenue, not Volume )<p>In the short term most hyperscaler are only going to be switching may be around 50% of their infrastructure, since x86 will still be in demand. But the trend is set and there are no reversal. And Server Segment is the most profitable segment. That is 25% of profit gone in the short term.<p>And if you now include AMD for the remaining x86 market, you are looking at another reduction. Depending on how AMD is executing ( Which in my book is not nearly good enough on their Server Segment, mainly due to conservative planning for Capacity )<p>AMD is also for the first time in history really competing in Notebook market with their APU. They have a lot of lessons to learn with regards to working with Notebook manufacture. But again the numbers suggest AMD is making lots of inroad, holding back by capacity again.<p>You then have majority of the volume driven by OEM and Business usage. These CPU are low margin business. But AMD are not interested in those, and Intel needs those to fill capacity, so they are fine.<p>So in the next 5 years you are looking at roughly 25% reduction of profits or revenue. Now of course Intel are making their own GPU and are expanding into Network and SSD. And more importantly the market for both PC and Server is still expanding. Which means despite having a lower market share in terms of percentage the revenue number may not be as bad. But again, there nothing even on paper that suggest Intel could change its course. They couldn&#x27;t even give a valid argument in Investor notes or Technical Forum meetings to clam the market.')
