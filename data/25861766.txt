They have a strong(!) tendency to be homophobic&#x2F;transphobic&#x2F;misogynist. They are a liability which can get you sued.<p>Does that sound like a correct, or even fair, assessment to you?<p>I&#x27;m a Republican software engineer from Kansas and it doesn&#x27;t to me.<p>Beyond that, from my time living in Beirut and traveling the Middle-east I can assure you there are many, many liberal (in both the Western and US sense) and metropolitan software engineers who would have no &quot;problems working with more liberal&#x2F;woke&quot; companies&quot;.')
