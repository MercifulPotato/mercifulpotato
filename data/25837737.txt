All those require a huge number of transistors.<p>Yes &amp; no. Most of the M1 die isn&#x27;t spent on CPU, it&#x27;s spent things like GPU, neural net, and SLC cache. A &quot;basic&quot; dual-core CPU-only M1 would be very manufacturable back in 2011 or so. After all, Intel at some point decided to spend a whole lot of transistors adding a GPU to every single CPU regardless of worth, there were transistors to spare.')
