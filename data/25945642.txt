It is &quot;witnessed&quot; personally during near-death experiences, just like karma is &quot;witnessed&quot; in other altered states of consciousness. These states are relatively rare, but frequent enough to fill a void of not knowing what happens after death in almost all tribes and societies. Then the emotional part kicks in: it&#x27;s easier to survive a loss of somebody if one believes in that kind of after-death experience.<p>Of course, religions and this kind of grass-root spiritual beliefs are mutually reinforcing too, but the latter seems to predate (and direct) the former.')
