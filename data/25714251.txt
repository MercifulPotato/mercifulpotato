P provides simple &quot;Ad absurdum&quot; examples for why that is. In you stating that kids are &quot;brainwashed&quot; elsewhere too is just engaging in whataboutism.<p>Can you explain why you think there is sufficient additional value in completely---absurdly so---free speech (as per P&#x27;s scenarios, for example) over limiting obviously dangerous and detrimental speech? Obviously the crux lies in drawing the required boundary, which is the job of an educated society as a whole and might be in flux with the times.')
