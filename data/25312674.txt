I never did any hard drugs. I have no intentions of doing so.<p>I do have maybe small personal gains with total legislation of marijuhana - \nbut no personal gains from advocating total legislation.<p>Au contraire.<p>This actually hurts marijuhana legislation efforts as people like you just assume I am a coke&#x2F;heroin&#x2F;meth addict. And feel pushed to keep things forbidden alltogether.<p>People are more open to legal ganja, but not at all to legal hard drugs.<p>So if I would just want to incremental my personal life a bit, I would jump on the train of most pro weed legalisation advocats saying &quot;yes yes, hard drugs are bad and should stay banned. But ganja is so soft, much less harmful than alcohol, so please please legalize it so I can be stoned all they and worry less.&quot;<p>Well no.\nFirst of all I know weed is a dangerous drug, too.\nBut I simply want to decide for myself, when are the times it is beneficial to me and when not. Likewise with other substances.<p>And when I claim that right for myself. I think it is fair to claim it for others too, even though I disagree with them about the benefits of coke for example.<p>So my point of view on legalization is altruistic. Not egoistic.<p>Did that change your point of view a bit?<p>I actually think so. Not that you advocate legalization, but that you probably wont make that point again.')
