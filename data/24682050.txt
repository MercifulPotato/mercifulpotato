If the requestor is a user of your services, you presumably have some kind of id for them (like email).<p>Given that this is not a new law (2018 it became active), you would hopefully have some list of tables with information on users. From there it&#x27;s select * from tables where user=blah.<p>Deletion requests are where you&#x27;ll normally have more issues, but it&#x27;s best effort. Again, look at how Facebook handle this. They explicitly state that it will take 90 days for all backups to be rolled out, and this is totally fine.<p>And if you are a small service, the likelihood of you having large amounts of PII on people across multiple services is pretty low.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that IP addresses which can&#x27;t be matched back to a user are not covered by GDPR, so unless you&#x27;ve been storing every IP from which a user&#x27;s logged in, then you&#x27;ll be fine.<p>But, the real solution here is to only store data for which you have a need, and get consent for the processing which your service requires. Sure, this is harder than the normal YOLO store all the things, but it&#x27;s probably better both from a storage and liability point of view.<p>Also, your argument segues from running a business of noteworthy capacity (who may have a problem complying) to small businesses (who won&#x27;t have the capacity, but also don&#x27;t store enough data to have a problem complying).<p>And to be fair, GDPR was npt imposed by elites, it was demanded by an awful lot of consumers in Europe. Maybe you don&#x27;t like that, but I personally think that breast-feeding mothers shouldn&#x27;t be censored. So cultural differences are going to cause both of us problems.')
