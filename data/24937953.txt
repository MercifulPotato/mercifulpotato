Did 230 say anything about why those are treated differently?<p>The law itself doesn&#x27;t, because laws generally don&#x27;t. The discussions around the law offered a number of reasons; one basic deontological idea, as I recall, was that a website moderating user content was functionally more like a choosing which third-party publications to offer than actually publishing. But probably the more significant argument was consequentialist, that if companies were liable for everything if they tried to moderate at all, the into viable large scale sites would be completely unmoderated, with no attempt to preemptively identify illegal and offensive content. And that&#x27;s why it was included as part of the Communications Decency Act.')
