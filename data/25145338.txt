If you fill out the questions, the site might be able to recommend you someone good straight off. Otherwise one of our staff will help you through the process. We try really hard to bypass that &quot;I tried 4 therapists before I found the right one&quot; thing, and get you in with someone right the first time.<p>Here&#x27;s the 80&#x2F;20 of getting the most out of a therapist, drawn from watching thousands of people get great results over the last 5 years:<p>* talk to several therapists on the phone for 5 or 10 minutes first. You&#x27;re going to be hesitant and uncomfortable, it&#x27;s their job to put you at ease, they&#x27;re the professional. You&#x27;ll learn a lot quickly about them, and about the mental health process. If you have an uncomfortable 5 minute chat, you&#x27;re going to have an uncomfortable hour, so skip that therapist. Go with your intuition, either say &quot;heck yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.<p>* make a plan, work the plan. Write out your goals. The way to do this is &quot;present situation&quot; -&gt; &quot;desired situation&quot;. Everyone forgets the &quot;desired situation&quot; because they&#x27;ve got so much negative mental energy tied up in &quot;present situation&quot;. Anyway, take your goals to your therapist. Put a circle around the one you need to address first. Insist that it gets addressed, or 6 sessions will go by and you&#x27;ll realise the only change is to your wallet<p>* ask for homework, do your homework. You&#x27;re in therapy an hour a week and out of therapy 167 hours a week. Your therapist can&#x27;t compete with that. What you do outside therapy matters greatly<p>* if after 3 sessions you haven&#x27;t established a good working relationship with your therapist and seen a bit of forward motion on your goals, get a new therapist. It could improve but statistically it&#x27;s unlikely. This is an evidence-based cut-off.<p>Mental health is health, stay healthy!')
