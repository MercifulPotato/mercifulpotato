Sure they&#x27;re symptoms. That&#x27;d be relevant if they were following the non-placebo group to test for long-term organ damages or other &quot;symptoms&quot; too. The easier way would be to consistently test all candidates for asymptomatic covid which isn&#x27;t the case here.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m misunderstanding the data here. It seems like we&#x27;ve only directly proven that the vaccine has been effective at reducing the normal symptoms (coughs, fevers) to the point where candidates don&#x27;t seem to be prompted enough to go get tested anymore. It doesn&#x27;t directly prove those candidates didn&#x27;t get covid.')
