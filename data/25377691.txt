So it would be permanent in the sense that you couldn’t fix all that equipment by turning it off and then on again.<p>I heard an expert say that the whole thing could be avoided by simply adding grounding wires to power lines. They kind of already do this for lightning — a grounding rod is shorted by a special material that becomes conductive at high voltage. The high voltage is “dumped” to earth. Put enough of those on power lines and the excess voltage might never reach sensitive equipment down stream.')
