I wrote this book after I raised my rate 467% in three years. I had to change a lot about the way I worked to do this, but ultimately was able to remain an individual contributor (coding most of the day, with minimal meetings – as opposed to going down the management track), and continue working remotely as well.<p>My data is anecdotal, of course, but I believe the lessons I learned and share are fundamentally true. Succeeding past a certain point can&#x27;t really happen by accident – and my bet is that the things that helped me succeed can also help others succeed, and that I&#x27;m able to share those experiences in a way that others can also learn from them.<p>There are some free chapters available that capture the general thrust of the book:<p>1. Quit Your Job And Start Contracting [1]<p>2. Find Work By Talking To Recruiters [2]<p>It&#x27;s ~120 pages long and still in beta. I kept it super tight, while including everything I&#x27;ve learned over nearly seven years in the industry. It&#x27;s definitely not for everybody, but if those two chapters don&#x27;t turn you off immediately you&#x27;ll probably enjoy the rest!<p>Also included are insights from:<p>- Patrick McKenzie<p>- Dan Luu<p>- Jeff Atwood<p>- Jamie Zawinski (jwz)<p>- Colin McIntosh (ex-recruiter for some of the top companies in the world, 10s of thousands of resumes screened)<p>Looking forward to your questions and comments.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1AOsPRgHwbdfF2Kai95EHW23VzufMOpDZfsLBJ908qpI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1AOsPRgHwbdfF2Kai95EHW23V...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1d3osO0H606dAMuEHGsv7Zp74ZNDZs5jw_sQO79_C2hs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;1d3osO0H606dAMuEHGsv7Zp74...</a>')
