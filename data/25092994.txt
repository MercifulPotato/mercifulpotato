Could have taken another century if group video calls hadn&#x27;t recently been made simple.<p>What&#x27;s simpler: group video call or group audio bridge?<p>The UX for most audio bridges:\n1. difficult to setup account, dial-in #s, etc. in the first place (for the organizer of the call)\n2. participants need to type in a long PIN\n3. participants don&#x27;t always know who is on the bridge, who isn&#x27;t and who is but unknowingly muted.<p>It helped of course that people had non business reasons to have Zooms, Facetimes, Hangouts etc. prior to the pandemic (whereas most people didn&#x27;t have non-business audio conferencing accounts).<p>And timing is always important - near ubiquitous broadband and personal compute being prerequisites for the mass video conferencing boom.')
