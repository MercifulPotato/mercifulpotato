Take something like a water bear. It can survive in extreme environments and is very specialized to do so. If it changes certain characteristics, it&#x27;s range of habitable environments may decrease significantly. To maximize it&#x27;s survivability it minimizes it&#x27;s evolutionary flexibility.<p>Species in more stable&#x2F;predictable environments on the other hand can change more characteristics without impairing their ability to survive in their environment, so their stable&#x2F;predictable environment allows them to maximize their evolutionary flexibility at the expense of being confined to that environment.')
