But you have no chance of providing the equivalent effect of a video landing on the YouTube frontpage.<p>Most people <i>on Youtube</i> never even have their videos land on the frontpage, and yet many of them are successful. That network effect and scale isn&#x27;t necessary for the ability to broadcast and disseminate speech online, so it doesn&#x27;t really contradict the premise that free speech on the web (as far as video is concerned) <i>requires</i> Youtube as a host, or that competition couldn&#x27;t be as effective as, say, repealing Section 230 or having the government take over Youtube and force it to act as a public utility.<p>At the end of the day, all Youtube is, is popular. They&#x27;re not like J.P. Morgan, holding monopoly power by physically controlling infrastructure and making competition impossible. The reason there isn&#x27;t &quot;effective&quot; competition isn&#x27;t because Google controls the web, it&#x27;s because no one considers anything less than Google-scale to be &quot;competition,&quot; so they write off the tons of other media streaming sites and social media platforms as irrelevant because they can&#x27;t gain dominant market share. But this conflates the free speech argument with arguments about effective business strategy.')
