The Salem Witch Trials come to mind. Conspiracy theories need to burn their way through the population, reaching a crescendo until saner minds take sway.<p>These are the natural ebbs and flows of popular opinion. It&#x27;s seldom rational even without conspiracy theories being involved. Trying to control this back-and-forth by shutting down one side of the conversation is just going to increase the pressure until the natural cycle continues.<p>I think _maybe_ YT has some sort of long-game in mind where they come out with a business model, but this doesn&#x27;t appear to end well for them or any of us. Treating complex and sometimes chaotic systems as if they were simple ones doesn&#x27;t make for good results. If you think the question is whether or not the claims are true, you&#x27;re not even close to the critical conversation society needs to have right now.')
