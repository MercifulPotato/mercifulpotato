In fact your argument is falling victim to the is-ought fallacy -- Things are a certain way, therefore they shouldn&#x27;t be another way.<p>The fact of the matter is that its true that bad arguments _should_ be fought with better arguments; that&#x27;s a necessary assumption at the base of any philosophic discourse, and doesn&#x27;t magically disappear when some section of people are disagreeing with you.<p>It&#x27;s ironic that you call the OP naive, as your line of thinking leads directly to censorship, and history can attest to where that leads.')
