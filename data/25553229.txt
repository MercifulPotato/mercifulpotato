I think it&#x27;s more useful (and reasonable) to look at all the brutality.\nThe 1850s civil war in China btw was arguably the worst of the lot. An insane level of brutality there but it seemingly goes unmentioned.<p>The west did horrific things in Asia. I&#x27;m really curious why the Chinese don&#x27;t have the same level of resentment over the British given how barbaric they treated them in the 1800s.<p>Don&#x27;t forget it was USA that forced open Japan. They didn&#x27;t ask to be open to the world.')
