BLAS implements three sets of operations:\nLevel 1: unary and binary vector vector operations, one transform.\nLevel 2: Matrix vector operations.\nLevel 3: Matrix matrix operations (most famously the dgemm routine).<p>Perhaps some blas implementations offer more features, but that would defeat the purpose of a standard interface.')
