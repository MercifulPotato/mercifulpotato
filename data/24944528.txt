There is a bunch of code generators out there to produce code for your definitions to have a native swift , objective , Java, Go api stubs for either clients or servers.\nIt is a joy to work with in cross functional teams and define your APIs whilst taking into account what Api versioning would mean, how to define enums, how to rename field names whilst being compatible with the transport protocol and other things.\nAlso if you were to route a payload from service A via B to C and each service is deployed independently and gets new Api changes, gRPC supports you in how to handle ther Szenarios.<p>Sure enough openapi can do all of this I guess but grpc definitions in Protobuf or Google artman are just way quicker to understand and work with.  (At least for me)')
