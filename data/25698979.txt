They were not identical twins but many people said they look similar even though I never had an issue in recognizing them. After I returned from a one year trip abroad I met up with one of the twins. I knew which one I was meeting, but when I get into their car I was confused why the other twin was picking me up. It took me a solid minute of talking with him before I realized it actually was the twin I was supposed to meet up with. I now recognize them better again but still occasionally have a splitsecond of confusion. Their facial features, silhuetes and fashion has grown to be very similar.')
