The idea is to make a visual distinction between a function call and a macro invocation, as the latter is used as a mechanism to provide control structures that are usually built-in in Algol-like languages.<p>I&#x27;m just not sure I actually understand how that distinction is supposed to be implemented by the &quot;semantic indentation&quot; style. The example in the article only shows how there is a difference between the styles for _function calls_ (calls to `filter`). But I suspect the example is just a bad one for illustrating the authors point.<p>In general though, I think hanging indentation is a bad idea for the reasons I stated above :).')
