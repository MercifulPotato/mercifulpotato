Which I&#x27;m in favor of only because of the failures of the drug war, especially in destabilizing Mexico and Central America into narco mafia states.<p>America has radicalized around guns and gun violence, to the point they are religions. Sure, go ahead and say there are no effects from violent gun games, then go talk to your kids about the school shooting drills. Sure we can argue that gun manufacturers and partisan wedge politics have elevated gun worship and not 25 years of shooter games.<p>I get there aren&#x27;t smoking gun game studies. But we are way far from the days of cartoon Doom.')
