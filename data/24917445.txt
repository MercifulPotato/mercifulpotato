It&#x27;s all just data in the end. The signals from your eye are not any more real because they are in response to photons.<p>2. Deafblind people exist, and can even learn to speak vocally. They might have misconceptions about the visual world, but it&#x27;s certainly not true that they lack general intelligence.<p>3. As an objection to GPT-3 as a pathway to AGI, the only thing stopping us training these models on high-bandwidth highly-multimodal data is scale, anyway, so the objection doesn&#x27;t work.<p>4. GPT-3 is <i>clearly</i> capable of reasoning in ways that can only be explained with more sophisticated world models than at smaller scales. People asserted reasoning was at a limit with GPT-2, and it just clearly isn&#x27;t.')
