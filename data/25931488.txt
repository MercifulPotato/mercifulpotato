Personally I think hordes of chat bots are instigating this. I fully suspect reddit to come in with a heavy hand and shutdown this game.  Next you will see something spin up at either wallstreetbets.win or wsb.win.  The party will continue but not nearly as hard as it has been over the past week.')
