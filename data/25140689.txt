I&#x27;ve been going through a fairly significant book revision the past few months. <i>Of course</i> it&#x27;s been more work than I thought--even though I should have known better.<p>However, even though I&#x27;m making quite a few changes&#x2F;additions including a new chapter, it&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> easier to patch something that exists than starting with a blank page. The fact that I don&#x27;t need to churn out a huge number of words lets me focus on the new material and refactoring as needed.<p>When I was an industry analyst, I used to joke that the effort to write something went up by something like the square of the page count. There are counter-examples but mostly I think it&#x27;s at least somewhat true given that you need to sort of keep your head around the whole project.')
