This is one of the main reasons I&#x27;m using Vim - not\nonly because of the program itself but how I can just combine it\nwith the multiplexer I want, in my preferred terminal emulator,\ninterfacing with other text-based tools. Many things I do\nregularly would require me to write custom plugins in VS Code.\nIn Vim I can just bind keys to an arbitrary sequence of inputs -\nsomething modern applications sorely lack.<p>It&#x27;s limited, but that limitation severely reduced the\ncomplexity of the interface - it&#x27;s all just a string and bash\nis, despite all its weirdness, an extremely productive string\nprocessing language.')
