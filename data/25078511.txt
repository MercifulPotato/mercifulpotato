It is an accidental denial of service attack on the client.<p>It will get fixed pretty easily: Apple will add some combination of a timeout and a request back-off to their client, to properly handle the situation of a server that is reachable but not sufficiently responsive.<p>Apple clearly does not mean to make their devices unresponsive if the server is offline, because pointing requests at localhost resolves the issue.')
