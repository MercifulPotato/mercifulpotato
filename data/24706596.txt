I understand the whole worship of individualism, but this is just taking it absurdly far.<p>You are missing his age. He is not a grown up who could graps the whole complexity of the task. He can see what he have done, but he is unable to grasp what others did to make his achievement possible. Such an inability would be worrying for me, if he was older -- 20 years old, or even 16-18 years old. But for 13 yo kid it is absolutely normal. Cognitive limitations he shows are only to be expected. There is no reason to grumble about society degrading to a hell.')
