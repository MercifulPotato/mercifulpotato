MapBox doesn&#x27;t have quite the feature set and quality that GM does, but it&#x27;s a great library, and won&#x27;t give you sticker shock.<p>Google has a lot of money for a reason.<p>I have found that Apple Maps is fine for my purposes. I don&#x27;t really need some of the fancier stuff that GM and MapBox gives you. If I needed the fancier stuff, I&#x27;d probably go with MapBox.')
