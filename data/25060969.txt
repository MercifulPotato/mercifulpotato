They often won&#x27;t even hear the case (for instance there has been no ruling on the legality of most NSA activities). This is how the internment of Japanese Americans in ww2 worked: an executive order is law until a court will overturn it and they generally won&#x27;t interfere in anything to do with foreign policy, national security, espionage etc...')
