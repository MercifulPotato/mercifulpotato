Item(by='jamesmehaffey', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607199562, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25310779, text='I couldnâ€™t help thinking about a lot of the kids I knew at University while reading that. Some of them were enrolled in classes, and some of them were only tangentially associated with the school. Many of them were poor or occasionally homeless or just had very low paying jobs, and substance abuse was not at all uncommon. But the thing is they were all very smart and creative and tough. I would much rather have spent my time with them then the mindless frat boys and the so-called honors students... I think those are the types of privileged people discussed in the post that simply cannot function outside of that bubble. I am not suggesting that anyone should want to be poor or unprivileged but rather that it is a possibility, and this sort of humble approach helps to give a better perspective when things are not going so well.')
