Underground electrical service is extremely rare in rural areas of the USA.  We have these things called utility poles.  And we use them.<p>On what planet do GPON prisms cost more than switches?  The whole reason it got popular was that it was even cheaper than active optical.  Here&#x27;s a 32-way prism for $14: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fs.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;11528.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fs.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;11528.html</a> .  That&#x27;s under $0.50&#x2F;customer.  You pay a bit more for the weatherproof enclosure for it that mounts on a pole.<p>Frankly, GPON is for losers.  144-count ADSS is so cheap now it&#x27;s stupid to build GPON&#x2F;EPON&#x2F;BPON these days.  Most of central Washington State (Grant County) has a dedicated strand of fiber to each household -- it&#x27;s future-proof.  Just do it.  GPON is a scam by large telcos who are afraid that unless they have the whole neighborhood sharing something (i.e. a fiber) they&#x27;ll be forced to let each customer choose a different provider for that customer&#x27;s strand.  I predict that we will see stupid telcos keep rolling out GPON even after it becomes way more expensive than dedicated dark fiber.  It&#x27;s greed and bamboozlement.<p>Bamboozlers gonna bamboozle.')
