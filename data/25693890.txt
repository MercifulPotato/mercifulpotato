They are a leading-edge fab right now like Intel is a leading-edge fab right now. You&#x27;re right that they are a contender, but the fab market is always going to be this way: one player will be the best, the others won&#x27;t be. If you design CPUs but don&#x27;t manufacture them, your supplier will always have a natural monopoly, meanwhile your customers have more options every day. Ditching the monopoly market to focus on the competitive market is not a good long-term strategy.')
