Especially not modern corporations and all the legal structures that encapsulate them.<p>Libertarian Private enterprise is more like LLC&#x27;s, and partnerships than Corporations.<p>As to where removing the liability shields would encourage more beneficial behaviors from corporations?<p>You see hints of it all the time,  anytime you see a situation where someone comments &quot;if a person would have done X they would be in jail&quot;  well the Corporation is shielding the people that actually did the harm to society from consequences from their actions.  Most of the time the actual bad actors simply move from one corporation to another continuing to inflict manage on society with no accountability because of those liability shield<p>you view it as &quot;sociopathic&quot;, but viewing it that way is part of the problem, we have anthropomorphized corporations to were we treat them like people, punish them (the corporations) with fines and other actions but never punish the actual human actors responsible for the activity<p>I understand the need for some kind of limited liability in business,  Strict Liability would likely cause very poor investment into private enterprise the problem is with corporations, especially publicly traded corporations we have created such a impenetrable liability shield around them that the incentive curve has shift so far towards &quot;profit by any means&quot; that the people in corporations are only punished when they DO NOT do bad things (i.e Pollute the environment, screw workers, etc) in chasing of more profit, and NEVER when they do those thing at most the corporation may pay a fine for doing it but the actual people responsible are never liable')
