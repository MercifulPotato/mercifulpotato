Item(by='asiachick', descendants=None, kids=[25593120, 25593199], score=None, time=1609425742, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25592606, text='I don&#x27;t know what criteria is being used to claim Texas is American&#x27;s most diverse city but simple checking the census data shows that is provably false.<p>ALSO, WTF is up with the whole mixing in Hispanic in such a strange way in the census? Seems super fishy like someone wanted to paint a certain kind of picture but if they just plainly list ethnicities they don&#x27;t get to make the story they want to tell.')
