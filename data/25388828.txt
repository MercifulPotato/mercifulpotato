Windows CE smartphones provided access about the same as Windows 98&#x2F;NT in terms of the freedom to run apps and providing apps unfettered access to OS level APIs.  The same can&#x27;t be said for Android and Apple&#x27;s sandbox + walled garden model.<p>The only Linux smartphone I can think of from that era that offered similar access and control was the (I think?) Nokia N900 and interest in those was IIRC negligible.')
