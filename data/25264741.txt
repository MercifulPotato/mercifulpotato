Some subset of 81, though... almost meaningless.<p>There&#x27;s a tremendous inertia when it comes to work weeks. The five-day is locked in pretty firmly in the developed world, and a company that tries to change that risks getting out of synch with suppliers, subcontractors, and partners.  &quot;Today&#x27;s Thursday. Our office is closed on Fridays, so we&#x27;ll have to schedule that call for Tuesday, because one of our suppliers is closed on Mondays.&quot;<p>I mean, they can try it, and employees might like the extra time off, but it might well slow things down and ultimately result in commensurately lower salaries and bonuses.')
