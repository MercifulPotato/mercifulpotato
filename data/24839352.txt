Item(by='gumby', descendants=None, kids=[24840071, 24840950, 24840160], score=None, time=1603211452, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24839101, text='&gt; but is it really that hard to document these behaviors?<p>I imagine it is, given the bureaucracy of a big company.  Apple&#x27;s documentation has long been really dreadful, mostly nonexistent and where it does exist, usually incomplete and even wrong.  I&#x27;ve assumed it was because the code itself is developed by isolated groups while the documentation presumably has to touch all sorts of people (publishing, translation, language checks, ...) in a kind of Conway&#x27;s law.<p>However, hard or not, writing comprehensive documentation is quite doable.  I have never been a fan of the Windows programming model but I have long admired not just MS&#x27;s documentation but the amount of effort and commitment they obviously put in.<p>Apple cares about some things but in this regard it appears they simply don&#x27;t give a shit.')
