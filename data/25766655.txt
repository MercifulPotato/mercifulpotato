Item(by='vladTheInhaler', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610565208, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25764897, text='A big part of the confusion is that you seem to treat this like an abstract matter of philosophical debate, because frankly, you don&#x27;t really have a personal stake in it.  That&#x27;s not meant as an insult, just a statement of fact.  As a straight, white male, neither do I.  But it&#x27;s not reasonable to expect someone to engage in dispassionate discourse about their own safety and their right to be treated like a human being.  It&#x27;s easy to forget because of how rapid and sweeping the change in public opinion was in the US, but in many other countries (and quite a few places in this one) LGBTQ rights are still a matter of life and death.<p>And this is the problem with so many debates - the people who are largely comfortable with the status quo are confused because people in marginalized groups are screaming at them, when they didn&#x27;t really do anything to those people.  In fact they may, in some abstract way, be supportive of their struggle.  But the people are screaming because a third party has a gun (literally or figuratively) to their heads.  So in order for there to be a real conversation, first we need to get that guy to put the gun down.  Nothing else can happen until then.')
