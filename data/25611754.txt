The comment I am responding to is one that I&#x27;ve seen&#x2F;heard in the context of courier services in that there is a profit extraction.  I ask people to clarify but they never seem to do so.  Instead, there&#x27;s an echo chamber repeating what others have said without taking a moment to think about whether the argument is valid.<p>What you are referring to isn&#x27;t about profit extraction.  It&#x27;s about brands, reputation, distribution rights, etc.  These are valid, separate concerns not related to the question I&#x27;m asking.<p>The profit extraction argument is invalid until proven otherwise.')
