Because rust is statically compiled, there&#x27;s no runtime startup or anything involved with it.  From dead to alive is pretty much instant.<p>Dynamic linkage is not the slow part of application startup.  The slow part (for applications which are slow) is almost always the gathering of non-compiled assets from disk.<p>IMO, the lack of dynamic linkage is Rust&#x27;s #2 weak point, second only to slow build times.')
