It&#x27;s pennies-on-the-dollar nature is carefully designed to dupe your statistics-naive hind brain into believing there is something being done when it&#x27;s really the opposite ; it&#x27;s the microoptimization of the economic world, equivalent to transforming a multiplication-by-two into shifting while the code above you is allocating one million boxed objects. Just a small, pointless thing you do to make yourself feel better for no actual reason.<p>A few millions here and there, no matter what they do or how much happiness they cause, is nothing compared to billions upon billions^(TM) continuesly pumped out of the world into one person&#x27;s coffers.<p>I don&#x27;t care what kind of persons billionaires are, allowing someone to have wealth equivalent to several countries&#x27; economies is ugly and injust. No amount of gift-giving and hospital-visiting is gonna make that any less of a moral disaster. Maybe when we discover arbitary-destination wormholes can we be that inefficient and injust with resources distribution, but with just one freaking planet? good luck convincing me (and the several billions who are not billionaires) that philanthropist billionaire overthere isn&#x27;t stealing somebody&#x27;s (probably several million somebodies) food in their pointless unending quest to pile wealth they&#x27;re not going to use 10% of in their wildest dreams.')
