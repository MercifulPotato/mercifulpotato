I just hate to do it and every other bits of attention source will got me seeked on, like a notification from my phone, or someone dropped a pen to the ground.<p>That&#x27;s how fast I lost focus. But on the other hand sometimes I can be extra-focused, with a prerequisite it&#x27;s something I enjoyed -- where I truly focus on one single task nonstop, like I finally got the ebb and flow in a tranced out state. This resulted me in one case coding straight for 7 hours. It&#x27;s not until my body started to crave for food or I don&#x27;t know how long will this loose cannon shoot.<p>ADD is both a blessing and a curse to me. This is how I accquired coding and various IT skills since 13, all self-taught. But this also fucked me over exams, and my so life experience is greatly impacted. I also tried to play rhythm games to control focus, only to see it ultimately failed. The only thing I had to deal with it slightly is my Ritalin...only so slightly I can &quot;normally&quot; focus for an hour. I just hope things go right in the rest of my life.')
