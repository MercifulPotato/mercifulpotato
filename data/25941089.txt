Because what goes up &quot;slow&quot; and steady is what we add of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.<p>We don&#x27;t feel temperature as global averages over a year, we feel heatwaves of maybe days over 45ÂºC, hailstorms, hurricanes, droughts and massive loss of crops. Our cities won&#x27;t go because a slow and steady, centimeter by centimeter rise of the sea level, will get ocassionally flooded by each time more frequent storms, till we decide that we should abandon them. An that won&#x27;t happen evenly on all the world.<p>Regarding the &quot;slow&quot; rise of greenhouse gases, it happens orders above of what a person, or an organized and large enough group of persons can revert, the industries add really big amount of CO2 and methane to the atmosphere each year. But that slow rise gets jumps, not because what we do, but because triggering possitive feedback loop processes, like each time more frequent forest fires, loss of ice reflecting sunlight, and warming polar regions (that have a lot of frozen greenhouse gases, that are getting released in massive scale by now). And some of those positive feedback mechanisms will work by us, when most of us must take measures against the effects of extreme weather, like everyone having air conditioners and turned on most of the time.<p>Personal action won&#x27;t make a difference, at least directly on global climate, the only thing at a large enough scale that could do something to slow down the trend are the big industries, and they won&#x27;t do anything to affect their profits till is too late already. And regarding governments, the last 5 years already showed us that matter for most of them are profits and short term results too.<p>Maybe the Great Filter is already with us since we invented money, all that came after till this point just took the path of least resistance.')
