Item(by='graycat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608312012, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25468234, text='&gt; I just think it would be misleading to imply that this is a path that most people can take.<p>Yes, but if focus just on <i>computing</i>, in that field,  there is, long amazing to me, evidence that &quot;most people can&quot; and, in a significant sense, do:  I&#x27;ve long been impressed the degree to which the learning crucial for computing in the US has been obtained via self study much as in the OP.<p>Okay, say what you will about an ugrad computer science degree and then move on to graduate degrees, Masters and Ph.D.  Uh, <i>reality check</i>: At the grad level, the material to be taught is often not all polished up and instead has rough edges, loose strings, things left unclear, etc.  The fundamental reason is that the material, the work, the education, whatever, are supposed to be at <i>the leading edge</i>, or, if you will, the <i>bleeding</i> edge.  More, the profs are paid mostly for their research (which for teaching is a path, with some efficacy, of quality) and not having all polished up, with good <i>pedagogy</i>, course teaching.<p>And in Ph.D. programs, and sometimes in Master&#x27;s programs, the student is expected to write something, original, hopefully publishable -- usual criteria, &quot;new, correct, and significant&quot;.<p>So for the work, it&#x27;s, in a word, <i>new</i>.  Right away can assume false starts, dead ends, encounters with brick walls, unpredictable rates of progress, unpredictable results, etc.  So, we&#x27;re back to <i>independent work</i> or, if you will, <i>self study</i>.<p>Main point:  In education, self-study is not only helpful but at times crucial.  In particular, independent study has been especially important in the US computer industry.  So, in a sense, the independent study in the OP is not very surprising.<p>Oh, by the way, the OP mentioned a Georgia Tech Master&#x27;s degree for ~$10,000.  Secret:  Commonly high end US research university graduate programs are very short on good students and long on tuition scholarships -- tuition should be about $0.00 for the whole graduate school effort.<p>Evidence:  I was a student and a prof in applied math and computing.  From a world class research university, I got a Master&#x27;s and a Ph.D.  For the grad degrees, I paid nothing in tuition.  Independent study was crucial.<p>E.g., of the five Ph.D. qualifying exams, I did the best in the class on four of them, all four made heavy use of independent study, and three of them making heavy use of independent study before the grad program.<p>E.g., the work that did me the most good in grad school was the independent study with results that were clearly publishable.')
