Yes, phase 2 is primarily about safety, but these are much smaller trials than phase 3, which in turn is much smaller than the post-marketing patient population (cohort).  Safety issues routinely arise in phase 3, or even after, due to the much larger cohort sizes.  Good phase 2 results are not <i>proof</i> of safety, rather an indication of safety.  It is bordering on genocidal levels of reckless endangerment to release a vaccine for general use after Phase 2 in the hopes that it <i>might</i> be effective and is <i>probably</i> safe.')
