I test in Pale Moon, Firefox, Internet Explorer and sometimes Opera and Chrome. I look at some of these &quot;Modern&quot; web sites filled with ads up and down the sides and across the top... Yuck!

Not to mention leaving no finger prints and no drones or cameras taking your picture, tracking who you are, and where you go.
