Item(by='Vinnl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602185833, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24721239, text='&gt; A simple example is, if you and I want to share, say, user data, and you have a &quot;people&quot; table and I have &quot;Users&quot;, and my fields are &quot;first_name&quot; &quot;last_name&quot; and yours &quot;given&quot; and &quot;proper&quot;, and so on, how do we match the same user across tables? RDF provides a solution for that.<p>What solution does RDF provide for that? I know of `owl:sameAs`, but even if it were feasible to look up those statements and reason about them (assuming someone reliable went to the effort to actually define them, and did so correctly), that already breaks down if I have to match a single field &quot;name&quot; (or, say, vcard:fn) with two fields &quot;first name&quot; and &quot;last name&quot; (or, say, foaf:givenName and foaf:surName). So as far as I know, there&#x27;s still no practical solution - or is there?')
