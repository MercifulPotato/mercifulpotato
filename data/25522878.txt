Basically you&#x27;re telling the candidate that you want to underpay them now, so you can eventually pay them what they are worth. The math is in their favor even if they don&#x27;t get a raise next year. And of course, next year they will be worth more anyway because they will have another year&#x27;s experience plus additional domain knowledge.<p>I&#x27;m curious if anyone has ever fallen for that line.')
