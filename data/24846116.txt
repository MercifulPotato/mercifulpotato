It seems half the team want to use an ORM and have a long list of reasons not to use SQL&#x2F;Stored Procs (slower to develop, out dated, not testable, business logic in the wrong place). The other half of the team wants to avoid ORMs and would rather use SQL&#x2F;Stored Procs (performance, ORMs start off okay but soon aren&#x27;t up to the job, more control and power with direct SQL). In fact, you can see these two standpoints in this very discussion.<p>I find both have valid points and there isn&#x27;t really a compromise. Whichever approach is taken you end up with half the team feeling not listened to and disenfranchised.<p>I have found few things to be more divisive than the ORM vs No ORM debate and I am not sure what the answer is.')
