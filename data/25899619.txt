To me, they don&#x27;t seem much better than the demos people were giving ten years ago, in academic competitions, etc.<p>The Tesla videos scare the hell out of me.  My own auto pilot purchase scares me whenever I use it. I can&#x27;t even use cruise control in my Tesla without it randomly slamming on the brakes.<p>It&#x27;s pretty straightforward to make batteries and an electric car. To make a computer vision product work? Based on everything I&#x27;ve seen of the field over the past 20 years, I am <i>not</i> impressed by Tesla&#x27;s efforts in the least. They seem crazy, not competent.')
