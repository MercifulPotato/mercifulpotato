Tyler Cowen is one of the most influential economists today. His Bloomberg column might have more reach than the MR blog though. So the topics are really different - MR will discuss many issues that are central to the current “national conversation”, with more of a broad-based style of reasoning, whereas Gwern and SSC will go much more into detail on a small set of topics, with more of a “rationalist” style of reasoning. I wouldn’t say they are “seen to be similar”.<p>Personally, I rate MR quite highly. I just think the reasoning is better-argued and the topics are more often something I’m interested in, compared to basically any other blog. Gwern and SSC are great too though.')
