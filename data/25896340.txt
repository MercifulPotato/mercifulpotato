I&#x27;ve <i>very</i> wary of investing or getting involved with any company that has an open source strategy.  I worked for one (Sendmail) and it did not go well.  We talked about how it&#x27;s hard to compete when your number one competitor is your own software for $0.  If you look at successful public companies with open source, they are all fairly small successes compared to their public closed source peers.<p>When I worked at reddit, we open sourced our code.  It didn&#x27;t gain us much.  We got a few contributions, and we also got a few competitors.  The biggest benefit was being able to show people the code when they suspected shenanigans.<p>At Netflix our ethos was &quot;if it&#x27;s involved in infrastructure, open source it, if it&#x27;s related to movies, keep it closed.&quot;  That actually worked pretty well.  But the open source code was difficult to use unless you invested in the entire ecosystem.  The main benefit was recruiting.<p>For my own company, I try to support open source by donating to the people who make it.')
