Item(by='jjav', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607076439, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25298748, text='&gt; Professional Interviewers<p>It is such a tragedy for our industry. Personally, I don&#x27;t participate. And encourage everyone to opt out.<p>I want, and do, spend all my efforts in delivering best performing, most secure real products, making customers happy and the infrastructure and code maintainable. I have as much impostor syndrome as anyone (or probably more than most) but very slowly over many years and long string of managers who gush about my performance and always give me highest possible reviews, I&#x27;ve come to accept (if not actually believe) that I&#x27;m very good at what I do.<p>And yet, no way I could ever &quot;pass&quot; one of these whiteboard algorithm monkeydance interviews. A company wants to judge based on nonsense that has nothing to do with the job? Then you don&#x27;t get to hire me, a proven expert with a track record of success. Enjoy hiring a team of people who&#x27;ve spent their life doing artificial exercises and (as a consequence) haven&#x27;t put much effort into building actual products.<p>I do what I can to improve the industry hiring. I do interview lots of candidates and will never do so via whiteboard monkeydance. I interview based on their experience doing real work, based on the resume. I encourage everyone to do the same and put and end (at least slightly reduce) the leetcode nonsense that&#x27;s killing the hiring culture.')
