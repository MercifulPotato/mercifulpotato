It&#x27;s those who don&#x27;t that anger me.  Specifically, I&#x27;m talking about things like riding through a crosswalk, riding the wrong way, and not signaling lane changes.  There&#x27;s a <i>reason</i> you&#x27;re supposed to walk your bike through a crosswalk, and not signaling when you&#x27;re a ~200 lb driver + rider combo facing down vehicles weighing more than 10x and capable of going much, much faster than you is just dumb.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean drivers aren&#x27;t dumb, too.  On top of the usual traffic BS we all deal with while driving, I also see a lot of instances of drivers not taking over a bike lane when turning.  Usually, in this case, this just seems to lead to a lot of &quot;go!  no, you go!  no you go!&quot; business, but it&#x27;s 100% a recipe for a crash.')
