If you can encode int8 and string more efficiently, then you can save some bytes with a custom binary encoding. However, you always need to be able to represent JSON as well. If a part of the JSON file isn&#x27;t present in the old version, then you encode that part by the plain JSON.<p>&gt; and moving the &quot;symbol table&quot; (string data) to the end? â€¦ you could also compress redundant symbols into single strings.<p>Sounds interesting, but in my experience these types of tricks are usually not paying off compared to just sending it through Gzip afterwards.')
