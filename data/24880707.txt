So (def x b) is an expression, because it returns a value. {} in C is a statement, even though it has no side effects.<p>Now, there are some statements in CL as far as I remember - I believe (declaim x integer) is a kind of statement, at least in the sense above.<p>But you can write a CL program that doesn&#x27;t use a single statement.')
