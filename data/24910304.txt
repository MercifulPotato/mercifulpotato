How do you import flash cards into Anki? After adding the AnkiConnect add-on the documentation just says to use the &quot;Sync Flashcards to Anki&quot; within Tools but there is no Tools (on the Web App &#x2F; MacOS versions). I can see it being done in the old version of this video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=F2aMWBdZUeQ&amp;t=636" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=F2aMWBdZUeQ&amp;t=636</a><p>Where did you see that? The directions might be stale somewhere. I checked our site and it&#x27;s not there.  It&#x27;s in the overflow menu in the toolbar (the three dots on the top right).<p>It only works from the Polar desktop app though.<p>&gt; 2. When importing using the Polar chrome extension I ran into a bug. When importing this page (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Magnus_Carlsen" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Magnus_Carlsen</a>) the page mark feature is completely broken. Once you drag it below the top picture it shoots all the way to the bottom, rendering the feature useless. This didn&#x27;t happen on the few other pages I tested it on though.<p>Thanks. I&#x27;ll use this as a test candidate.  The EPUB pagemarks have a rare but I can&#x27;t really duplicate that seems to happen like 5% of the time. I might work on a different implementation.<p>&gt; Regardless this seems fantastic, great job!<p>Thanks!  Keep the feedback coming as we rapidly iterate. Usually pushing 2-3 releases per week!')
