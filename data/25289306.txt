The idea was to create a lower cost alternative to Lego Mindstorms for programming simple robots. So &quot;â¬†5&quot; would tell a robot to move forward 5 rotations. The <i>other</i> idea I was playing with was to remove the need to type at a keyboard... instead, a child would have a deck of cards with all the syntax they&#x27;d need, then they&#x27;d lay out their program out on a table or floor, and then use a camera + computer vision to read in the program.<p>The idea was if we issued one robot to each child, it would be cheaper to program the robot with a camera and deck of &quot;code cards&quot; than to also have to give budget for giving them a tablet or chromebook, too.<p>Here&#x27;s my original proof of concept:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dSOfMSS9aFY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dSOfMSS9aFY</a><p>And the code is up on GitHub:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hugs&#x2F;wildcard" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hugs&#x2F;wildcard</a>')
