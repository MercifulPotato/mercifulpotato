The technical stack layer-cake is usually same for all the micro-services â€“ that allows it to be &#x27;micro&#x27; and yet be economical. You want less than 20% of your engineering force to be responsible for operating this technical layer-cake while the 80% of the engineering workforce to be productive on actually solving the functional domain problems of your business.<p>What you are referring to is the old-school SOA where each SOA service could be built by completely different companies using different stack and deployed in different environments and yet interact. This is applicable in financial&#x2F;banking ecosystems (say real-time payment systems across banks&#x2F;payment-networks).')
