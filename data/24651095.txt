And the fact that you&#x27;re supposed to do the whole reading thing is probably the source of the problem.<p>You see the same plug, same colors on the connector, you EXPECT to work the same.<p>--<p>[1] Most of my devices are micro-usb, my Dell work laptop charges via thunderbolt&#x2F;usb-c but I&#x27;ve got the Dell dock for that.')
