If you had rooted your phone previously, it was possible to work around it by modifying the device-tree and limiting it to only using some cores of the CPU.<p>LG would fix it for free if you were lucky, they did for me. I think you had a 50&#x2F;50 chance of them refusing to fix it for free by claiming the failure was due to water damage, even if that was definitely not true. The prevalence of the failure makes me think that every single 5x failed eventually. The timing of the boot-loop failure was such that your alternate Google options were probably Pixel 1 or 2 at the time.<p>After the 5x failure, I purchased a Pixel 2. It is very fast to this day, but the lack of a microphone jack has been a real thorn to me. My car does not support the bluetooth a2dp profile, I use the USB-C adapter to stream music, and it has put a lot of extra wear on the USB-C connector. It has lasted a long time, and everything else works fine, but it&#x27;s only a matter of time before I can no longer charge it.')
