But I love it when I see, say, a beautiful cauliflower that looks fresh and tasty not only because I&#x27;m looking forward to the pleasure of tasting it but also because somewhere in the back of my head something tells me &quot;that&#x27;s good stuff&quot;.<p>However, of course I&#x27;m just <i>assuming</i> that something is actually nutritious. You&#x27;re right that I don&#x27;t actually know that, and that kinda is the point of the article, right? We have all been taught that veggies are good for you, bla bla bla, but in the light of the article you can now at least wonder to what degree that is still as true as it was some years ago.')
