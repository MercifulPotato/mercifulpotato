Those are polls that give a particular result with a +- confidence interval. If the polls were to any extent competently done, you expect the result to be well within that margin of error.<p>The reality though has been that the results have been well outside the margin of error, sometimes multiple sigmas from the actual result - that is simply unacceptable for a poll. The only conclusion should be that polling data can be completely ignored, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any clear relationship with the final results.')
