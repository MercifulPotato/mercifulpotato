Esp. since I&#x27;ve taken another look at the refactoring chapters of Clean Code, but instead of being enlightened I felt disgusted. Like, for-loops are ok, if-statements are ok, those are the basic constructs of code, you can see the shapes visually and it&#x27;s easy to follow the code path. This is what you find in low level C&#x2F;C++ code, lots of switches, loops and conditionals. Those programmers just get used to the verbosity and look at shapes instead of reading line by line. Maybe it&#x27;s easier for subtle mistakes to pass unnoticed, but refactoring out everything into layers of abstraction brings jumping around and context switching between these different pieces and trying to make a mental picture of how it all fits together.')
