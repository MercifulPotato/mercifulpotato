Between insurance politics and the difficulties of keeping up with research, there are a lot of perverse incentives out there. I&#x27;m certainly not alone in this. Even if I knew for certain the Doctor&#x27;s interests aligned perfectly with my own, the fact is I am a non-expert and putting my faith in something I am unfamiliar with and don&#x27;t fully understand is scary.<p>Now imagine if a doctor could instantly put my fears to rest. When I start asking questions, he can instantly put a nice looking piece of paper in my hand telling me why his decision is the best option for me, personally. Maybe I don&#x27;t totally get what all the numbers mean, but I see my readings, my symptoms, there&#x27;s a graph on it and the drug prescribed to me has the biggest bar. If that were an option, I&#x27;d never use a doctor who didn&#x27;t do that. Even if it didn&#x27;t lead to more patient referrals, certainly it would save doctors time answering all the &quot;but WebMD says...&quot; questions, and a doctor&#x27;s time is worth a lot.')
