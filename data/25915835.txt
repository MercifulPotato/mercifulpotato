You need a workflow engine on top like Kubeflow or Airflow, so run you jobs. Thus. consider K8s more as a cluster operating software, but not as a fully-enabled workload management like slurm.<p>Furthermore, K8s has so many features you do not need in HPC environments, where high throughput and load occupation is paramount.')
