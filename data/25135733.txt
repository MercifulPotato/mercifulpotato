I just want to check a route or some place and travel bloggers and their bloated ad-riddled popup-covered sites take forever to load.<p>I mentioned in another thread an alternative browser I&#x27;ve been prototyping to solve this problem. I&#x27;d love if you could tell me more about what you need from something like this. All my prototyping so far has been on desktop but the idea in my head has always been for a mobile app since that&#x27;s often all I have when travelling, but there&#x27;s no reason for it not to work on desktop too.')
