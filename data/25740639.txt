Item(by='cbozeman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610412112, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25735100, text='&gt; i am really sad that hate speech is allowed in the US. i think it is shameful and dangerous.<p>Fortunately our founders realized how necessary speech is, especially speech we don&#x27;t like. I&#x27;m waiting to see Noam Chomsky get canceled for saying, “Goebbels was in favor of free speech for views he liked. So was Stalin. If you’re really in favor of free speech, then you’re in favor of freedom of speech for precisely the views you despise. Otherwise, you’re not in favor of free speech.”<p>&gt; I have no comment on you telling that other guy to be very fucking careful<p>He should be thankful, because I&#x27;m trying to save him from getting seriously injured - perhaps even killed one day. People who have a lot of experience fighting, especially having either seen or participated in fights outside of a controlled environment, will tell you just how incredibly dangerous it is to fight someone for whom you have no idea of their capabilities. You might have just picked a fight with someone with advanced combat training who will hand you your ass... even worse, you might have come upon someone with enough training you to seriously harm you, but not enough training to know how to exercise restraint.<p>You are far better served to try to de-escalate a situation than to actively jump in like your John Wick... because you&#x27;re not. John Wicks of the world are only fighting when they have no other option.')
