The i7-11700 or whatever the newest one coming out soon is called, is going to be pretty much exactly on parity with AMD&#x27;s Ryzen 5000 series.<p>So if node shrinkage is such a dramatic increase in performance and power usage, then when Intel unfucks themselves and refines their 10nm node and 7nm node and whatever-node after that, they&#x27;ll clearly be more performant than AMD... and Apple&#x27;s M1.<p>Process technology is holding Intel back. They fix that, they get scary again.')
