I&#x27;ve found global search very useful for searching for example-uses of rarely-used libraries.   Having all that at my fingertips was useful.<p>I understand legacy examples aren&#x27;t useful for everyone, but for me they often were, and now a lot of code will be completely unfindable.  :&#x2F;<p>Think of niche programming languages and the like that&#x27;ve passed their heyday - I guess tagging might help, but a lot of people don&#x27;t bother tagging projects.<p>Also, I guess this includes one&#x27;s own projects?  I have about a hundred repos of various ages, and it&#x27;s easy to lose track of them.  Not being able to search through my own code sounds like a bit of a bummer (Though I don&#x27;t have an intuition for how often I search for stuff in my own repos, TBH).<p>Pity there wasn&#x27;t a better solution available to solve their problems.')
