It just takes a lot of time&#x2F;effort for me to write the code. It&#x27;s easy to say that support for AVX, AVX2, etc., would be nice, but that&#x27;s months of hard work (unfunded)<p>I guess we agree that a niche tool like NN-512, that has a reduced feature set (trimmed to allow one person to complete it and release it for free), has trouble competing with the huge, free, flexible, multi-target tools funded by large companies<p>In retrospect this is obvious!')
