Separation of concerns (ie, make it trivial to separate the Data and the View components from the surrounding html clutter).  Currently it can be a pain to extract data from the DOM.<p>2. Allow the Data component to express arbitrary data shapes, including at least:\n - 2-D tables\n - n-dimensional data tables\n - groups of related tables and schema (for a relational database)\n - sparse data sets\n - lists\n - trees\n - graphs<p>A lisp-like representation of data would provide adaptability to arbitrarily shaped data.<p>3. Make it easy to use:-\n The webpage coder would write \n  &lt;html&gt;\n   &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;data name=&quot;data1&quot;&gt;...lisp-like-data-structure...&lt;&#x2F;data&gt;\n   &lt;&#x2F;head&gt;\n   &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;view name=&quot;view1&quot; data=&quot;data1&quot;&gt;...view-code...&lt;&#x2F;view&gt;\n   &lt;&#x2F;body&gt;\n  &lt;&#x2F;html&gt;<p>If no View-code was provided in the html then a default OS&#x2F;browser View would be used.<p>3. Ideally HTML would provide native support for the Data and View primitives.\n Failing that then it could be provided by a script (hosted on a single website, to ensure consistency of interpretation).<p>4. Ideally the OS would provide support for the Data and View primitives, in the GUI and in the command line.\n Failing that then these could be provided as user programs.<p>5. Encourage webpage developers to use the new &lt;data&gt; and &lt;view&gt; primitives by deprecating &lt;table&gt; ;)')
