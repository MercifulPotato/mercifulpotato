Item(by='necovek', descendants=None, kids=[25901298], score=None, time=1611566940, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25900665, text='While spatial awareness is important during driving,I believe being focused on driving is even more so.<p>When driving the tight streets of old European cities with pedestrians jumping out everywhere, I usually watch for hints like too tall cars parked on the sidewalk and potentially hiding pedestrians planning to cross the street, and move my foot from the gas to hovering above the brake pedal. And a million other things like that, mostly by paying close attention to driving.<p>Sure, I believe my spatial awareness is also great, but that helps me to parallel park in fewer back-and-forths or to remember a way to a place I&#x27;ve been to once six months ago through a maze of one way streets. But it does not help me reduce the chances of an impactful collision (sure, I might ding a car on the parking lot or not because of it, but nobody is going to get hurt because of that).<p>You are right that cars are not safe, but for some part, you&#x27;ve got control of the risk yourself. I also watch for hints a car will swerve in front of me, and I am sure I&#x27;ve helped avoid 100s of traffic accidents by being focused on the whole driving task. And other drivers have helped avoid traffic accidents that I would have caused in probably a dozen cases too. I think I am an above average driver simply because of that ratio.<p>You run similar risks when you board a public bus without knowing how the driver feels that day, and how focused they generally are.')
