I have recently used them to authenticate API&#x2F;RPC access for some IoT-ish devices.<p>They work great.<p>Setting up nginx to proxy things through to the backend Go API server was a bit uncomfortable, however.<p>Getting the exact right incantation of `ssl_verify_client`, `map $ssl_client_verify ...` and `$ssl_client_escaped_cert` to achieve the desired effect is nowhere near as straightforward as it should be. Then on the backend, you have to be very mindful of what nginx has and hasn&#x27;t done with respect to verification of the proxied client certificate.<p>If you are not well-versed in mutual TLS, then I can easily see how this could go horribly wrong.<p>Drew argues that OAuth is often implemented poorly. I agree, but I don&#x27;t think that client certificates are less prone to implementation problems.')
