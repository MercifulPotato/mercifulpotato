Spam job offers, freelancing sites with bloated profiles, sending unsolicited messages and resume to people in LinkedIn and AngelList. Much of this comes from us having 1&#x2F;6 of world&#x27;s population, but that doesn&#x27;t excuse a big group from their misdeeds. I personally believe that there&#x27;s a need to teach people about etiquette in written communication and how to behave in semi-formal to casual internet settings')
