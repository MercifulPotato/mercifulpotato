If you get a paper into CVPR, or SIGGRAPH, or NeurIPS, it has the potential to make your career. It&#x27;s <i>that</i> important to some employers (academic and not) and that&#x27;s why everyone struggles to publish in those &quot;top&quot; venues. It&#x27;s not like you won&#x27;t have a career without a paper in these places (I really want to stress this), but it&#x27;s enough of a boost to your reputation that everyone wants to.<p>Think of it like getting a Nature or Science paper, or something in Phys Rev, or Cell. It&#x27;s about prestige.<p>The real issue is conferences taking the place of academic journals. In most fields conferences are laid back places to share your WIP. In CS, conferences require full papers which means many ML researchers (for example) structure their whole year around meeting the NeurIPS and ICML&#x2F;ICLR deadlines. It&#x27;s a bit broken because those conferences have limited capacity and it can be a lottery if you get in. Journals don&#x27;t have the same restriction and don&#x27;t have deadlines unless you&#x27;re going for a special issue, so you can actually take the time to polish before submitting.')
