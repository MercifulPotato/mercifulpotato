When you arrive you are required to have a SIM card.  During quaratine, they track your device and call randomly one or twice a day to be sure your phone is on you.  Breaking quarantine is a big fine (up to $33k USD) and there is a carrot if you complete quarantine without any incidents ($500 or something?).  Individuals are provided quarantine housing if they can&#x27;t pay but employers are expected to pay (e.g, workers from Indonesia).')
