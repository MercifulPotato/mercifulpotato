But a few things to note:<p>1. This was Archbishop Gregory&#x27;s decision. I&#x27;m unsure how high up the &quot;chain&quot; goes for the Catholic Church. As such, Archbishop Gregory&#x27;s history is important, but also the Archdiocese he&#x27;s leading. So #2 goes into that background...<p>2. Archbishop Gregory was brought into my Archdiocese as a &quot;turning over a new page&quot; kind of bishop... as Theodore McCarrick (a previous leader) was caught up in the whole sex-abuse scandal that I&#x27;m sure you know about. Cardinal Wuerl, Gregory&#x27;s immediate predecessor, was also seen as too connected to the sex-abuse scandals.<p>So after having the whole sex-abuse thing come into light over the past few years, and coming on as the new Bishop who will turn a new page after that whole awful affair... it is obvious what Archbishop Gregory should do for his first Easter of this area of Church.<p>So this is quite possibly a local-church politics (Archdiocese wide) thing that plays into the decision making process here.<p>&gt; After all, we all know the Catholic church has The Pope as their leader, and probably about the only religion people know who the World voice of that religion is.<p>And yes, the Pope is the leader for sure. The new Pope is also quite reformist in attitude, and Archbishop Gregory would have been elevated to his position thanks to the blessings of the Pope.<p>But I didn&#x27;t know the Archbishop had the power to negate the need of mass + eucharist (temporarily) during this pandemic. Such authority is rarely, if ever, used. But its those sorts of moves that really help get the Church unified during a long-term pandemic like this.<p>Not bad for Archbishop Gregory&#x27;s first year.<p>----------<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adw.org&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adw.org&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;</a><p>&gt;&gt; The dispensation issued by Archbishop Gregory from the obligation to attend Mass during this time remains in effect. All persons who are subjects of the Archbishop of Washington no matter where they may be, and all other persons who are actually present in the Archdiocese of Washington who are under the obligation, are dispensed from the obligation until further notice (cann. 87 ยง1, 91).')
