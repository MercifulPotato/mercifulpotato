So you have two ways to increase profits in the long run:<p>&gt;1) Increase number of subscribers. Possible to do, but the market is pretty saturated.<p>&gt;2) Raise prices of healthcare overall. 20% of larger costs is more than 20% of smaller costs.<p>The 20% profit margin also has to cover the insurer&#x27;s operating expenses.
