A possible set of steps:<p>1) Being able to connect and discuss openly.<p>Probably the largest community mailing list at MIT -- the ancient csail-related mailing list, whose roots date back to the AI Lab days is gone after a thread titled &quot;What is CSAIL&#x27;s stance on Marvin Minsky?&quot; (Minsky was on Epstein&#x27;s island once, and one of the Epstein girls was pressured to offer herself; by Minsky&#x27;s wife&#x27;s account, he didn&#x27;t take her up on it). MIT killed the whole list -- probably a half-century old community mailing list with thousands of people. I&#x27;m not sure how to recover from that.<p>Keep in mind that MIT emails were also mined for evidence to cover up (also not a secret; just a buried open fact -- part of the &quot;Factfinding&quot; process was finding evidence and getting ahead of it, and MIT was straightforward that MIT private emails were now under surveillance -- and I presume they&#x27;re still monitoring). I&#x27;m not sure how nasty MIT will get if people start organizing. Higher-ups are well-connected.<p>2) Letting folks know what&#x27;s up.<p>Keep in mind that a lot of the MIT community trusts the administration implicitly. A lot of school pride. And public evidence is mixed.<p>3) Reform.<p>Ideally, across elite schools. These issues aren&#x27;t unique to MIT. MIT is a leader in corruption, as it is in so many areas, but other schools are neck-and-neck, and others will follow. Working to block funding, pending transparency reforms. No more NDAs and non-disparage agreements. Make universities subject to FOIA-style requests. Implement open governance measures. Etc. Ideally, that would go for alumni donations, government grants, and foundation funding.<p>4) Providing a face-saving out.<p>Sad to say, lots of people at MIT illicitly made millions of dollars. They&#x27;re powerful and connected. A direct fight is unlikely to be successful. They&#x27;re less likely to block reforms they feel less threatened by.<p>Whether the future is dim or bright is hard to say. MIT has a massive endowment, and professors are very comfortable. My major concern is that we need an MIT-classic: a pre-brand-obsessed, low-key institute where nerds can nerd, build need things, do credible science, etc. Ideally, that&#x27;d be MIT again, post-reform. Less ideally, we&#x27;d take another institute and run with it. If all alumni donations went somewhere new, that&#x27;d be an option too: pick a school, and pending transparency and anti-corruption checks-and-balances, build it up.<p>But I don&#x27;t really know if that would do it, or if that&#x27;s reasonable.
