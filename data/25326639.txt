It will ramp into use for longer, but the noise difference is worth it   and case of you will certainly not notice it&#x27;s activity as much.<p>Been nice if they just had the fan and connector attached to a new top for the case and could of added some side vents with height, making things just that much easier overall.<p>I myself have a 3rd party acrylic layer stack affair with a top fan and heat sink with 3V and run it constant as well below whisper level.  I&#x27;d measure the dB but other systems currently mean my noise floor is 50dB and with sound meter right next to it, I get nothing above that.  Though when just that a running, it a faint breeze sound at best.')
