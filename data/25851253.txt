It runs Outlook, Chrome, Slack, and Exceed to connect to a remote Linux server where I do all of my work.  At random times throughout the day the fan will get really loud.  When I run the process viewer tool during this time I see things using 100% CPU.  It&#x27;s a Core i5-8350U with 8GB RAM and during these times it gets almost unusable.  I&#x27;ve googled a few of them and they always seem to be antivirus things.<p>At home I have over 8 Linux machines and the only times their fans get louder are when I am actually running a video encoding program or something CPU intensive like that.
