They don&#x27;t control what is happening to their properly, and without Sony&#x27;s agreement they cannot repair damage done by sony to it.<p>That does not sound like ownership to me - again, think back to car ownership. Firstly tampering with your car would have been criminal damage.<p>Secondly, BMW does not get a say in how you use your car. They can&#x27;t stop you going over the speed limit. You could get your car fixed without having to involve BMW or going to court to force their hand.<p>In my view this Sony case looks like compensation for breach of a lease-like contract.')
