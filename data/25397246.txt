It works well - if you defeat someone, you gain points and they lose an equal number of points. The bigger the difference in rating, the bigger the change in points. A 1200 player defeating a 1250 player gains +7 points, but defeating a 2000 player would be more like +30.<p>This system has also been adapted to team games like League of Legends and Dota 2. Teams are constructed such that most players in the game  have the same rating. The winners gain +25 each and the losers lose -25. A significant minority feel that this is unfair. <i>Clearly</i> they only lost because of incompetent team mates so they lose points even when they play well. If only they could gain 200-1000 rating points, they would be playing with people at their own skill level, and they would win way more.<p>Turns out this theory is a bunch of horse shit, as proven countless times. These whiners play high ranked players to temporarily take over their account, win 1000 more points and then start playing at their new higher rating. And then they proceed to lose 40 games in a row because they have no idea what theyâ€™re doing.<p>Source - played Dota 2 for years. Rating was 3000 (top 5% at the time). I saw countless posts from whiners and losses from account buyers.')
