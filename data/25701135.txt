I&#x27;m looking for the best way to do this in 2021.<p><pre><code>  Fastmail ($50&#x2F;year) unlimited domains aliased to 1 account looks like best in class based on comments in this thread-- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22789401 .\n  Migadu (now $90&#x2F;year) was formerly the go-to based on its old prices. Then they auto-renewed my annual subscription without notification at about 2x the price. Looking to move away in case they do that again.  \n  Mailbox.org (1â‚¬&#x2F;month&#x2F;e-mail) looks promising.  \n  Zoho mail ($1&#x2F;month&#x2F;e-mail) also looks promising.\n</code></pre>\nAnother option is FOSS self-hosted, which actually looks more safe in 2021. The major problem is finding an IP that&#x27;s not blacklisted.<p><pre><code>  Mailcow: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailcow.github.io&#x2F;mailcow-dockerized-docs&#x2F; . Completely dockerized. 6gb ram required (VPS in the ~$40&#x2F;month range)  \n  Mailinabox: 1gb ram required (VPS ~$10&#x2F;month). Same problem with having to deal with blacklisting, much less ram required though. Can also use dockerized version.</code></pre>')
