Many of them receive free electricity and all of them don&#x27;t pay any taxes (no matter how much they earn). In states like Punjab, the farmers have entered a vicious cycle where they keep planting water-hungry crops like wheat and rice due to the Minimum Support Price that they get on those (the water table in this region is in danger). Plus these protestors are also against the laws that fine farmers for burning the stubble after harvest (which results in the infamous Delhi smog every winter).\nBasically, it&#x27;s a fight between two groups with vested interests.')
