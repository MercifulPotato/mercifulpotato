Item(by='drieddust', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601671062, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24665752, text='&gt; What&#x27;s the use of this &quot;class system&quot; if one class covers such a broad area? Isn&#x27;t it so broad as to be useless?<p>Hinduism is evolutionary in nature. It anticipated emergence of new profession as society progressed ahead with time . Having said that first three classes were fixed in terms of duties of education, defence , and business. They were responsible for providing stable environment for rest of the professions to bloom and evolve. That why last class wasn&#x27;t fixed. It is impossible to predict emerging professions anyways.<p>Moreover The Varna system was merely a loose way of classifying the society. These weren&#x27;t categories you have to live your entire life.  Many people moved up and down. Vishwamitra was a king who turned into a sage as an example. There is a long list of such cases.[1]<p>&gt; Was this ever true in practice?<p>Yes to a large extent. Please read comment of dilippkumar quoting from the books describing practices of pre-conial India.<p>If you have time please read Bhagwad Gita for an introduction to Hindu philosophical system. Many Westerns like Bethovan, Robert Oppenheimer, Thoreau have drawn inspiration from it. Remember this book was written 5000 or perhaps before that. Only a stable and developed society would&#x27;ve thought about these ideas in such details I would argue.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hindupedia.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;%C5%9Audra_Hindu_saints" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hindupedia.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;%C5%9Audra_Hindu_saints</a>')
