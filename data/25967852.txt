Item(by='GlitchMr', descendants=None, kids=[25968201], score=None, time=1612001720, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25964226, text='I believe that removal of Element from Google Play Store is a violation of EU regulation 2019&#x2F;1150. Element has legal entities in Britain (which is affected by Brexit but has similar law) and France. Google is LEGALLY required to provide a justification for removal 30 days before application removal.<p>Anyway, you may try contacting Google using EU regulation 2019&#x2F;1150 violation procedure, see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;merchants&#x2F;answer&#x2F;9969397" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;merchants&#x2F;answer&#x2F;9969397</a> for more information. This may be more effective than using a regular contact procedure, as it would show Google that you are aware of this regulation and they are unlikely to win.<p>Note that I&#x27;m not a lawyer.')
