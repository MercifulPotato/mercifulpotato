For example, could someone build a slick mobile app and website and use Treasury to launch a B2B &quot;bank&quot;, complete with FDIC insurance? Would it be acceptable to launch an offering like mercury.com entirely powered by Treasury?<p>Or is the intent to only allow Treasury as an adjunct to a &quot;real&quot; business?<p>Thanks!')
