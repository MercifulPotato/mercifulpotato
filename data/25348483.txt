I guess they got sick of people taking their code and ripping out their API subscriptions.<p>For anyone interested in an open source mapping library (that also has 3D support) that can handle raster data (including the Mapbox tiles), I launched a project 2 weeks ago that is the culmination of 7 years effort: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;felixpalmer&#x2F;procedural-gl-js&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;felixpalmer&#x2F;procedural-gl-js&#x2F;</a>.<p>I must say (while acknowledging my <i>huge</i> bias) that I&#x27;m disappointed with how the 3D terrain works in the new Mapbox version.
