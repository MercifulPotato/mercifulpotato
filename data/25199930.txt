Been setting things up and migrating the last few days. In fact, I&#x27;ll probably convert my Linux dev box to FreeBSD and run Linux in a VM.<p>Why the swtich? I&#x27;m really hoping that FreeBSD brings me some stability. I&#x27;m frustrated of learning how Ubuntu does things with every new named release. In a commercial environment, I&#x27;m aware and comfortable with the vast amount of infrastructure that&#x27;s deployed to make our applications operable. One of my goals for FreeBSD is to come back to fundamentals and build my applications in an environment that I can understand and maintain without fully staffed teams.<p>Couple things I noticed. As a Linux user for many years, I am working my way through the FreeBSD Handbook docs. Most of the material I&#x27;m familiar with so it&#x27;s a fast read but have on numerous occasions learned new information. Especially useful since I&#x27;m learning how FreeBSD does things. It&#x27;s no diferent than learning a new programming language in a paradigm that one would considers themselves an expert in.<p>As a primarily app developer, rc(8) is just the right amount of abstraction and it makes sense. I get it intuitively. I really find it joyful when I encounter such designs.<p>I love how FreeBSD is organized. This must be attributed to it being designed by a cohesive team. Great job, I noticed and very quickly.<p>One downside so far, Google seems to answer _every_ linux &#x2F; ubuntu question I throw at it or at least guides me close enough that I can sort my way through a problem. This hasn&#x27;t been my experience with the FreeBSD system. Though I&#x27;ve tackled all my issues, it took more time. I should provide an update to this in the future since it could very well be because it&#x27;s a new system.<p>I&#x27;ll also miss cgroups. FreeBSD has rctl(8) and it looks like jails have resources parameters as well. cgroups are  very well deigned for the problem that they&#x27;re solving for me. It gives the right control over the right resources in a cohesive manner.<p>I&#x27;ll end this with things that I&#x27;m excited for. I find learning new things does this to me so I&#x27;ll share just for fun. I&#x27;m excited to learn jails and hope that I find it an improvement over Docker. I&#x27;m excited to deploy my erlang application and host my postgres database. I&#x27;m excited for root zfs. I&#x27;m excited to UPGRADE when the next version of FreeBSD comes out. This should work right? I _never_ upgrade my Ubuntu dev box. I&#x27;m excited that Wireguard is getting native kernel support in BSDs [<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=WireGuard-For-OpenBSD-Kernel" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phoronix.com&#x2F;scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=WireGuar...</a>]')
