I don&#x27;t think any silver bullet solution has been invented yet.<p>I&#x27;d like to see error handling supported in a transactional way, which at least would roll things back to a clean state before the error happened. Of course if you performed an operation which cannot be rolled back, then so much for my great idea.')
