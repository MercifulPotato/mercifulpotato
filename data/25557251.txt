I appreciate the rigor you&#x27;re trying to bring to this discussion. Most of the points regarding logic you raise here and in your other replies on the thread have been comprehensively debunked in Kant&#x27;s <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>.<p>One omission is the nature of human senses and perceptions. The understanding of which eliminates whatsoever any possibility of conclusively distinguishing the statement &quot;logic is true&quot; from &quot;logic appears true to us but it&#x27;s actual truth status is unknowable&quot;. This is just a toy explanation and the Critique is far more comprehensive and rigorous.<p>&gt; empiricism involves the addition of observational evidence on top of other forms of analysis.<p>That may be the case in circumstances where it&#x27;s convenient and other forms of analysis serve the function of useful tools or mental aids. However empirical observation always trumps other forms of analysis when they&#x27;re in conflict. Otherwise we&#x27;re no longer discussing science anymore.')
