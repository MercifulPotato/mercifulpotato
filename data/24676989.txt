We were all, apparently, simply lucky that the variant of ransomware used didn&#x27;t happen to exfiltrate all our health data.<p>Garmin is notorious for their software issues, and Apple is probably much better than Garmin at securing their production environments. But more importantly, because Apple end-to-end encrypts users&#x27; health data, nobody would be able to access any of it even if they were successfully attacked.<p>I agree it&#x27;s nice that Garmin wearables can mostly keep working independently even if Garmin Connect is down.')
