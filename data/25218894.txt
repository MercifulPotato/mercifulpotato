We&#x27;re a .NET&#x2F;C#&#x2F;SQL Server&#x2F;TypeScript&#x2F;React shop, with a bit of R and Python thrown in outside of the core technology team.<p>I couldn&#x27;t work out whether he couldn&#x27;t get his head round our pair programming task (which isn&#x27;t any kind of ridiculous invert a red&#x2F;black tree type whiteboard problem) because he wasn&#x27;t a good programmer or because the mental model was so different to what he was used to, and he really seemed to struggle with C#. I didn&#x27;t give him a job because I thought the risk of having to let him go during probation was too high, which would have sucked given that he&#x27;d have been leaving a steady job to join us.<p>Contrast this with another interviewee who was a nurse, and a self-taught programmer, who really did seem to get it. He nailed our assessments, and we made him an offer. He joined us and has worked out really well.<p>It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m against hiring people with mismatched skills, or from an unusual professional background - far from it - but I need to see some glimmer of a good match during the selection process, particularly if somebody would be leaving stable employment to join us (not that we&#x27;re unstable, but there&#x27;s the probation period to successfully navigate) and&#x2F;or - not really an issue now we&#x27;re all WFH - they&#x27;re planning to relocate to work with us.')
