In life and in sports you cannot always avoid having your knees go past your toes, so gradually building the capacity for your knees and ankles to allow your knees to support you when they are past the toes makes sense to me. Everyone is so focused on building hip power to be able to explosively accelerate but this program is all about building the muscles that decelerate the body. Most non contact knee injuries in basketball come when a player plants and tries to come to an abrupt stop. This program builds your VMOs and tibialis and many other muscles that help bulletproof your knees against the extreme forces involved in coming to a sudden stop. The extreme moves that Ben demonstrates are very advanced and the program would never ever have someone do them without following the proper progression. If your knees are fucked up you just begin with backwards walking until your knee pain is reduced enough to progress further. Backwards walking is the safest way to begin building stability with the knees past the toes and this alone can help reduce knee pain.')
