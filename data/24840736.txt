I&#x27;ve been experimenting with B2 (via QNAP&#x27;s HBS 3) as well — works great, but $20&#x2F;month vs. CrashPlan&#x27;s $10 — and I&#x27;d just ask that Backblaze consider whether there may be room for a &quot;Personal+&quot; or &quot;Family&quot; fixed-rate plan that supports home NAS devices.
