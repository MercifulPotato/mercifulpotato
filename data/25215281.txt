League, Dota, FPSs, and discord too apparently all have this weird group of people who get banned for doing shady shit then go on forums and complain. People being banned from services unfairly (and without explanation) is a real problem, that doesn&#x27;t mean that everytime someone complains they deserve the benefit of the doubt.')
