With just the shell features, one could do `make ... &amp;&amp; make ... &amp;&amp; make ... &amp;`, but that would cause bothersome output that would prevent you from effectively working in the same terminal. One could redirect the output of those commands, but then you lose it, or you have to think of where to collect it. This provides an alternative where you can background and still have convenient access to the output when you need it.<p>The other use is something like:<p>$ nq mpv $youtube_url<p>$ #work... work... work....<p>$ nq mpv $next_youtube_url<p>so that the next starts when the first finishes.')
