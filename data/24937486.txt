In case of a crime in the street the police could exceptionally access surveillance cameras to investigate. That&#x27;s it.<p>This is what &quot;no privacy in public&quot; meant in 2000&#x2F;2010, and I was totally fine with that. I was totally pro video surveillance at that time .<p>Now we&#x27;re in 2020 and facial recognition is happening. Everything changes.<p>Today, taking the picture of someone = taking biometric data like fingerprint or DNA. This allows you to have a total control over that person. Law were made at a time when a cameras were not such devastating weapons.<p>Everywhere you go, everything you eat, each item in the store you look at, each person you look at, heartbeat &amp; stress level, which house you&#x27;re at, who are you talking to, what did you bought, when, with who, what ads did you watch in the street, which part if the ads, with which emotion, we can find your identity, social posts, private data, health data, intimate message, browsing history, emotions, stress level, etc just by pointing a camera at you because of facial recognition. All this is anaylzed, sold and stored <i></i>forever<i></i>.<p>We&#x27;re getting in a dystopia the worst case-scenario dystopic sci-fi movie couldn&#x27;t even imagine and people are like &quot;nah we shouldn&#x27;t expect privacy anyway ya know&quot;...')
