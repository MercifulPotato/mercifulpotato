The hardest thing to do is to say no.<p>What’s even more impressive is that they did not start out doing any user research.  They made what they wanted and (pardon the pun) it struck a chord. If they had not had the courage to trust their instinct, but had done what so many designers do and focus on satisfying only the needs users can imagine and articulate, I think they would have made yet another Cubase or Protools lookalike. That’s a crowded market and they wouldn’t have made it.<p>Sure, I understand and agree with your criticism, but there are probably great tools that do what you ask for cleaner and better because those tools are designed around different ideas.<p>If they can squeeze this in and make it work: great.  If they can’t, that’s okay too.')
