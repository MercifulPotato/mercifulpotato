Totalitarism might be more efficient short term but long term it will be set back much more. It just places too much responsibility&#x2F;power on too few. You might get lucky or might not.<p>Problem with democracy is that it&#x27;s susceptible to neocolonialism(bribery, power and economic diff, dissinformation, non-competive local market), that&#x27;s why I guess all Asian economic miracles happened with good faith authoritarian government and with good geopolitical location that allowed them to close market without wars.<p>This would suggest that having big country nearby powerful neighbours is not a good place to be, which brings India to my mind.
