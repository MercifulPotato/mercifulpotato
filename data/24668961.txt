The only thing I paid for was the serial cable so I could configure the correct input port, but even if I&#x27;d purchased the projector new it would run me about $150.  In comparison, one of the article&#x27;s top recommended dumb TVs is $450, while the other is &quot;no longer available&quot;.  Plus we can use a real computer with a keyboard sitting on our coffee table to control it instead of using the TV remote to painstakingly enter every character.  Sure, we could have a less janky setup in many ways -- one day I aspire to build an actual wall shelf for the projector -- but the experience is miles better than any TV, smart or otherwise.')
