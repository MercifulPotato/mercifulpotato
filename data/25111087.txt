I&#x27;m calling _you_ racist.<p>Secondly, I&#x27;ve tried my best not to bash you nor your countrymen. And I do not even disagree with many things you have said: indeed, some gypsies consider it fair game to steal from tourists, some have no respect for property, etc. Sure. The same could be said of many other discriminated minorities, and I&#x27;m pretty sure we&#x27;ve all heard and read the exact same complains that $Xs are just thieves, cannot be educated, will never give away their long heritage of misbehaviour, etc, etc, where $X is the minority of the day and place.<p>The discriminated minority varies, but what does not vary is the false generalisation (&quot;all $X are thieves&quot;), the scapegoating (&quot;$Xs are why the economy is bad&quot;), and the reassuring feeling of superiority (&quot;we have been nice to $Xs to no avail yet they were never nice to us&quot;). This is exactly what racism is all about in my views.<p>Listen, I&#x27;m not calling you a bad person for that. I totally understand that when pockets of poverty and antisocial behaviour do exist in one&#x27;s country then one is upset about it. Just be aware that no minority is inherently bad; minorities have their own dynamic that depends upon many things (on top of which: having to live in a ghetto), but not upon the inner biology&#x2F;heritage&#x2F;wtv of any individuals. Do not delude yourself into thinking you would behave any different were you born in the same circumstances, into the same ghetto, etc.<p>I do not know what have the previous regimes tried to end the discrimination and integrate gypsies, and I&#x27;m sad if that has failed. I&#x27;m certain though that ghettos are not improving anyone&#x27;s situation, be it in Bulgaria or in France.<p>Let&#x27;s always try to think about the problem practically, to look for solutions&#x2F;improvements not to look for revenge.')
