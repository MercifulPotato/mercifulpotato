This means a.o. that wherever you want to go, there&#x27;ll be pretty good parking really close by.\nCombine that with a lack of proper bike infrastructure. No bike racks anywhere in sight, so you have to dump your bike on the pavement, hoping nobody will give it a shove because it&#x27;s in their way. No bike lanes, or if there are, they have angles and corners that are not realistic to take on a bike. Corners that have you swerving into the opposite lane if you take them at anything above 15 km&#x2F;h.<p>In those situations taking the car for short distances becomes the convenient, fast and safe thing to do.<p>P.S. from your name I suspect you&#x27;re Dutch. In that case you don&#x27;t even have to go far to find that sort of situation. I live in Belgium, which is generally considered to be a rather bike friendly country. I beg to differ. Everything I describe above applies, at least in a region of a few kilometers around my house. I can only assume it also applies elsewhere in Belgium.')
