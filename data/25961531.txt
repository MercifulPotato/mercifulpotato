Boldly proclaiming you don&#x27;t consent to a search or you refuse to answer questions can lead to a tough time for you.  I think in general one should strive for de-escalation, and being overly compliant in the above type interaction.  Once you are arrested then definitely assert your rights.  It&#x27;s unfortunate that police powers are such that we can&#x27;t assert out rights without fear of retribution.<p>I strongly disagree with your last sentence.  I believe cops will take advantage of those who can&#x27;t afford lawyers as long as there are no real consequences to them.')
