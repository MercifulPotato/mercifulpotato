I&#x27;m not aware of bandwidth issues requiring much more than an update maybe once in 50-100 years. For example, where I live in rural NM, the houses around here presumably got paired telephone wires on the order of 50-100 years ago, and then within the last 10-15 years they got rewired with multi-twisted-pair cables that easily get to 50Mbps. While in 80 years that might not be considered sufficient, I doubt anyone will seriously suggest another round of recabling within that time frame.<p>But anyway, you really seem to be missing the fundamental point here: there is no limited &quot;spectrum&quot; for wiring in the sense of multiple possible parties who want to use &quot;parts of it&quot; for various purposes. If you assign the XMHz to YMHz band of the electromagnetic spectrum to some purpose, it&#x27;s gone, it cannot be used for anything else, by anyone else, across a potentially vast geographic area. There&#x27;s no equivalent for this in the context of digital (or analog) data moving down wires.')
