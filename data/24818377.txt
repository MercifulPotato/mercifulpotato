(faster performance = less hardware required, bigger scale and potentially improve end user experience - save from their data being on the cloud of course).<p>On device (eg mobile phone) processing with battery usage that respects the user. Older hardware&#x2F;models inclusion as well.<p>Of course the above aren&#x27;t cases were the stream itself is 100+fps, but more of broader general benefits. For a 100+ fps stream.. well there are many things that go fast, imagine you wanted a robot that tracks or catches a fly before it takes off. Flies have a reaction time of 5ms (200fps), that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s hard for us to catch! Expand and apply the same concept to other things (that are fast, or happen very quickly) now...')
