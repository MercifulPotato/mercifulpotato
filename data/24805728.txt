Item(by='hsitz', descendants=None, kids=[24805878], score=None, time=1602888292, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24801142, text='I don&#x27;t really follow the idea that &quot;midi is lossy&quot; in the sense described.  Because it uses note-on&#x2F;note-off pairs?  I don&#x27;t see the problem there. Certainly the idea that a score somehow has more information in it than a midi recording is ridiculous. A score always requires interpretation.  The midi is, in contrast, fully specified, very little room for interpretation.<p>A midi recording contains pretty precise velocity info for each note (0-127) that is either not present at all in a score, or is present only in the form of a limited number of dynamic markings[1], which govern the flow of dynamics imprecisely, and almost not at all on a per-note basis.<p>With tempo it is similar to dynamics:  midi will precisely determine when notes turn on and off, down to the millisecond, in the process resulting in the midi performance having a precise tempo.  In contrast, musical scores have limited means to indicate proper tempo[2], necessitating (as with dynamic markings in a musical score) much interpretation by the musician.<p>All of this is not to say that a midi performance is somehow &quot;better&quot; than a score.  There are good midi recordings and bad ones.  A good recording will generally be made by an accomplished musician who in making the recording records fairly precisely a particular (and good) interpretation of the score.  Likewise, a bad recording would generally be the result of a poor interpretation of a score.  But whatever the case, the midi recording is far more precise than the score itself.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aboutmusictheory.com&#x2F;music-dynamics.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aboutmusictheory.com&#x2F;music-dynamics.html</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tempo#Basic_tempo_markings" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tempo#Basic_tempo_markings</a>')
