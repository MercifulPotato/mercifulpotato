Item(by='temac', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608135980, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25441359, text='&gt; Any time not spent consuming or creating is bad for the economy.<p>This is a complete countersense toward the etymology of &quot;economy&quot; and I would even say toward its only possible natural goal.<p>The concept of economy is about reaching goals with the least effort. And the selection of those goals can certainly not be &quot;the economy&quot;, that would be circular, an attempt to optimize arbitrary conventions that is completely meaningless.<p>So having a good economy is certainly not possible by the furious consumption of unneeded things.<p>I couldn&#x27;t care less about &quot;the economy&quot; if its goal has shifted toward the selection of our new masters. And that state of mind about &quot;the economy&quot; will certainly not favor neighbourhood stores but more probably megacorps and their (often very few) owners.')
