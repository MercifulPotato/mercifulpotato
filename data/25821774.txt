We are talking about such a layer in the stack, where Apple or Microsoft won&#x27;t even let you play. Anyone, who uses the multiple DEs as an excuse is firmly put into <i>doesn&#x27;t know what he is talking about</i> box.<p>Multiple package managers are not an issue either. In this day and age, you should be using Flatpak. That would also allow you to target very specific ABIs in a cross-distribution way, thus removing the fragmentation excuse.')
