I&#x27;ve been on the road all day and caught this thread too late.<p>The reason that the &quot;Serverless Revolution&quot; appears to have stalled is that the customers who have the most to gain from serverless technologies have the least ability to recognize that the technologies they&#x27;re using are actually serverless. Nor do they care.<p>In its most reductive form, &quot;serverless&quot; just means &quot;SaaS.&quot; And Shopify store owners, for example, don&#x27;t care about how many servers they run -- they care about how many snowboards they can sell. They could maintain one, twenty, or twenty thousand, or zero -- if the cost to run these things and provide value on top is abstracted away by a few tools it doesn&#x27;t really matter. So you can use i.e. AWS Lambda to solve their problems, or you could sell ShopifyStoreManagerPlus but they don&#x27;t care what it&#x27;s called. They just care that they sold more snowboards.<p>So &quot;serverless&quot; stalled because the target audience doesn&#x27;t actually care about the implementation, so the smart companies selling &quot;serverless&quot; solutions all dropped the lingo. AWS Lambda is just another tool in the toolchain; an engine and crankshaft instead of a horseless carriage.')
