Item(by='ShamelessC', descendants=None, kids=[25764383, 25743461], score=None, time=1610414589, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25736380, text='&gt; and as an open world city itâ€™s a shallow clone of a GTA game<p>I have played about 200 hours of the game on Ultra with Ray Tracing and this is the only point I disagree on. The graphics and beautiful design of the city is _the_ major accomplishment of this game. It&#x27;s significantly more dense in terms of graphical fidelity and polygon count. I found myself often just ignoring the actual gameplay and parkouring around the beautiful city.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to the ps4 version really, but I&#x27;ve seen screenshots and as far as I can tell they somehow made it look like a PS3 game. I don&#x27;t think I could make it look that bad on PC even if I turned everything to low.')
