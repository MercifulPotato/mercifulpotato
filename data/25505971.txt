It&#x27;s actually a _watch_ and it doesn&#x27;t feel like a wrist computer. Plus, the notifications work amazing, and all training-related things are awesome. Software updates over the year brought very needed improvements.<p>2. Garmin Edge 830 bike computer. Also wonderful piece of engineering, again feels like a thing and doesn&#x27;t add any overhead to rides as a phone with Komoot or some other app does. Now I&#x27;m thinking that a non-sensor-screen 820 would be a better choice.<p>3. Mountain bike, Ghost Kato 7.9 2019. I&#x27;d go for full suspension next time for sure, but it still opened a whole new world of unpaved roads around the city for me.')
