Less war, less natural cause deaths other than old age, less world wide poverty, the world is getting better on a whole. Still plenty of serious problems. No one should discount that. But I had to stop watching the general news the past few months because it seemed like we were living during the black death, world war 1 and 2, and the American civil war (I&#x27;m in the US) all at the same time. We&#x27;re not. Things aren&#x27;t perfect, but holy shit things were far worse roughly 100 years ago. Theres a point where every radical on any political spectrum needs to get hit with a belt in the ass and told to stand in the corner, same goes for the general media. We all need to take a deep breath, be grateful that things aren&#x27;t as bad as during our grandparents time, quit thinking the world will end tomorrow, and calmly fix things together. But hey, that&#x27;s all crazy talk and doesn&#x27;t produce ad clicks for google, facebook and twitter.')
