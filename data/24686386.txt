Looks interesting, I started thinking about using it for some &quot;backoffice&quot; related things. Probably will wait a year or more though, to find out how Fauna evolves — 3 months ago: <i>&quot;$27M [funding] and New Leadership&quot;</i>.<p>About using it for a commenting system: What comes to my mind, is that outgoing bandwidth is a little bit expensive: 0.1$ per GB. So, maybe Fauna is a good idea for one&#x27;s own personal commenting system — and, not such a good idea for someone who builds a SaaS commenting system and wants to keep the costs down.<p>&gt; <i>something built in Node that I can import, add configs, and hook into my front-end</i><p>Maybe something like the below? But not for Gatsby, instead, for the framework you use?
