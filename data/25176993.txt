I had to delete my linkedin post when my ex-manager called me to delete it otherwise the startup&#x27;s employees will go crazy and try every which way to make my life hell.<p>Unfortunately, thats what you get in living in this country and trying to voice your opinion (without any strong political and financial credentials).<p>I have mentioned this earlier, people keep complaining of &quot;brain drain&quot; here in India as tech graduates keep leaving India for opportunities abroad; I thought I won&#x27;t be that one and will do something for the country; it&#x27;s just too difficult, I have add enough, I can&#x27;t wait to leave.<p>I always tell people to just be anonymous, having your personal identity linked when saying anything remotely offensive is just an open invitation for personal attacks and things like this.')
