You must use Firefox accounts or something like that.<p>Sure, you can run your own actual data hosting, but it still forces you to use some authorization service. Sure, you can try to also run your own version of that, but now you have to setup two distinct services for one sync function.<p>It&#x27;s a gigantic enormous hassle to do it, you must also override several Firefox settings to make it use your &quot;3rd&quot; party auth service. Oh and the documentation is not existent because their official stance is &quot;don&#x27;t do this, don&#x27;t run your own Firefox Accounts service&quot;<p>Once upon a time this wasn&#x27;t the case, but at some point it was decided to &#x27;upgrade&#x27; the sync stack. which resulted in a centralized auth function.
