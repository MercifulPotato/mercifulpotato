The web also has a full spectrum responsive solution.<p>Even Apple is transitioning from 90s KVO tech to SwiftUI, a buggy experiment that looks like any of the reactive&#x2F;observable weekend frameworks that the web has been experimenting with for 10 years.<p>One thing I notice is how little cross-experience there is. The iOS developers I work with have barely built a web client, and web developers have barely built a mobile client. I bet 95% of our opinions including my own are driven by familiarity, and we just like to roleplay that it&#x27;s some deeper technical calculation.<p>That said, even if the iOS dev experience was 10x as good as it is today, I still wouldn&#x27;t pick it for personal projects because polishing an application that only iOS users can use is a nonstarter. That downside got old so fast.')
