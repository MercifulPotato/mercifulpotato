This is a thing which benefits those in power, not the general population; those in power always either think they are acting in the best interest of the people, or don’t care what the interests of the general population are. Either way, surveillance states support whatever goals the people at the top have.<p>&gt; The best-case positive for a surveillance state is people lose any expectation of privacy but a few hundred criminals a year get caught who wouldn&#x27;t otherwise.<p>If you think drugs are a serious problem (I don’t, but governments act like it is, and my brother’s in-laws (who are are Pilipino) support Duterte‘s drugs policy), consider: in the UK 2017-18 crime survey, 9% of 16 to 59-year-olds reported using a drug in the previous year[1].<p>If the No Drugs Party wants to end drugs forever, how tempting would perfect surveillance be for them? That’s not a mere few criminals, it’s a radical change to society that the No Drugs Party would want to actively pursue.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.publishing.service.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;system&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;attachment_data&#x2F;file&#x2F;728776&#x2F;drug-misuse-2018-hosb1418snr.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assets.publishing.service.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;...</a>')
