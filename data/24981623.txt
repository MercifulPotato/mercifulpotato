The only way to reproduce his results is to perform the experiment and then selectively remove datapoints that disagree with his result until you only have results remaining that are close to his. That doesn&#x27;t qualify as reproducible in my book, except in the trivial sense you can perform the same experiment he did, irrespective of the actual result.')
