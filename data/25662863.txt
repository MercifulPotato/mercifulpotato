However, there are a number of mitigating factors. (1) Individual parents vary widely in their persuasive skill. (2) If there are 2 parents, those 2 don&#x27;t necessarily agree in their beliefs, which means mixed messages for the children. (3) The child&#x27;s friends, neighbors, schools, and community are also important influences on the child. (4) Genetics guarantees individual differences regardless. (5) Kids have a natural tendency to rebel against their parents, regardless of the parent&#x27;s beliefs.<p>A lot of kids turn out a lot like their parents. And a lot of kids don&#x27;t. Some even become the opposite of their parents. So the parental influence is definitely a factor, but it&#x27;s not inescapable.<p>In any case, most kids pay very little attention to politics or &quot;hard news&quot; before they reach voting age (or even after). The news consumption itself tends to occur mainly in adulthood.')
