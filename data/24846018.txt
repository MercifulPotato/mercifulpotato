Details of your current database that have leaked into your data layer abstractions will soon become obvious<p>Well, details of Postgres <i>have</i> leaked into my database queries and schemas, but it was a conscious decision to use Postgres and its features. Sure, it seems nice to be able to swap one database for another, but you lose out on a lot of what a database can do if you stick strictly for the lowest common denominator of features. I use Postgres partly <i>because</i> of its feature set, so I am going to use these features. This does mean that its unlikely I will ever run my software against a different SQL database, but I&#x27;m ok with this.<p>I guess an important note is that you should be aware of it and it should be a conscious decision, rather than something that crept in over time.<p>But I suppose that&#x27;s a tangent and not the articles point. Forcing Functions is about unearthing the brittleness that has crept into a codebase over time and I absolutely agree that is a helpful and worthwhile exercise. I&#x27;ve seen plenty of codebases that were meant to be database agnostic, but porting them was still not painless.')
