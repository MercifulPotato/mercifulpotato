(which I&#x27;m doing for a mortgage). Then, in Firefox, nothing happens, no dialog, no pop-up&#x2F;under, just... nothing, when I click join meeting.<p>If I do it in Edge&#x2F;Chrome- it works. Frustrating.<p>Superfluous example: Microsoft Teams _always_ has issues and sometimes even throws up warnings about using an unsupported browser. Though this is on Firefox ESR.')
