This is basically the same setup I&#x27;ve used for more than a decade. (I tried 3 monitors once and it was too much.) However, if I were starting over without a built-in monitor, I would seriously look at one of the big&#x2F;wide curved screen monitors. A number of people I know prefer those to dual monitors.<p>On the flip side, it is nice to have one screen with video conferencing set up to be as near the camera as possible. But I actually tend to do notes and so forth on a laptop while I&#x27;m conferencing because my mechanical keyboard on my desktop is very loud.')
