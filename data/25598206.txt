Though looks like the bitcoin devs are working towards something to improve privacy called taproot and schnorr.<p>The thing that it solves for me compared to traditional fiat currencies is that it retains its value very well over a period of time. some of the bitcoin stuff I bought long back and spent it on hardware now means I got the hardware for nearly more than 500% cheaper if I had chosen to hold it in dollar or other fiat currencies.<p>Fiat currencies are a liability (depreciating value) if you are not constantly trying to invest them just to keep their value from crashing due to accelerating money printing&#x2F;inflation.')
