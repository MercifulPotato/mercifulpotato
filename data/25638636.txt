Item(by='cmehdy', descendants=None, kids=[25638912], score=None, time=1609796853, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25637825, text='The DSM is a guide on average, not a book of truth. For one, it offers SOMETHING to discuss in the first place.<p>The names change, there are sometimes huge mistakes in those books, etc.. That&#x27;s absolutely true. It doesn&#x27;t mean that there is no progress to the process, even if admittedly it&#x27;s all pretty slow (for reasons that everyone will have their own opinion about).<p>I&#x27;ve lived my life since early childhood with various major issues, of which only recently Major depressive disorder and Generalized anxiety disorder were the primary diagnoses (but there are other major things that I&#x27;d prefer keeping to myself).<p>Putting some name, ANY name, on those issues, allowed me to look for what is usually brought up to improve things. Doing that allowed me to apply certain tools to my situation which have been incredibly helpful, and those tools include both therapy and medical treatment. Doing THAT allowed me to stop digging a deeper grave. I&#x27;m not cured from depression, suicidal ideation, cognitive distortions, etc.. much in the same way a burn victim isn&#x27;t cured from it when they&#x27;re still in the medical ward working at their rehabilitation. It&#x27;s not a reason to say that the medical ward is useless.<p>So even if you are not satisfied with the state of things (and I&#x27;m not either btw), at least you can concede that having people trying to apply scientific processes to the issues AND having a world-spanning effort in significant numbers will do more to help figure things out than any localized shamanism effort.')
