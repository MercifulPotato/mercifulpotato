However if we count around 4 million requests at 0.5 USD &#x2F; million requests, you can see that costs from the serverless infrastructure itself are negligible at a few dollars only.<p>The major &quot;infrastructure&quot; cost stems from Sentry, which we used for application monitoring &amp; crash reporting. We&#x27;re on the team plan at 29USD &#x2F; month with added on-demand spend of 100 USD, which we&#x27;ve nearly exhausted considering a large number of events were sent to Sentry. We had also enabled spike protection, which means we&#x27;re paying less as certain events are rate limited in any given minute to avoid massive overspend (which we would have certainly run into).')
