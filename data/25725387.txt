It probably is. But we just don&#x27;t know yet. There&#x27;s also little reason to get the vaccine in that case as we&#x27;re now very confident that immunity after infection is effective and long lasting. Obviously, being exposed to it, many nurses would have been infected already and recovered; if I knew I had been infected already, I would not get vaccinated.')
