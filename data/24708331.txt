There is definitely a need.<p>I&#x27;ve found a huge problem with products is that their quality changes over time. So, a product may be named the same but the SKU changes or the products from a couple of years back were much better made for whatever reason while the company has gutted them and continues to sell on reputation. I&#x27;ve wondered if there&#x27;s a way to track product changes (user reported maybe?) between revisions of products on a wide scale. Can you convert the &quot;years owned&quot; to a purchase date somewhere? Are you tracking SKUs?<p>How will you handle fake reviews?')
