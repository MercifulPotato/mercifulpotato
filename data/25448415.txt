First of all, hardware acceleration in Xpra has been a relatively rocky story for a long time. Second of all, Firejail didn’t support using it until 2016.<p>The first <i>Firejail</i> beta releases itself was in 2014, long after <i>Wayland</i> was first conceived.<p>The first <i>Xpra</i> release was in 2008, however.<p>&gt; If you want to keep buying borderline Linux-incompatible video cards and running an unmaintained display server, by all means try to jam a security model onto an inherently insecure client-server system to help justify it. As cold as it may be, the world will happily leave you behind. And if you don’t believe me, just keep waiting. Lots of people thought Macromedia Flash would stick around forever, too.<p>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll tell the next man that proved you wrong that you “never saw proof” as well, and he will provide proof too, which you will just as dismiss with vague arguments of “It&#x27;s buggy and a huge compromise, but I won&#x27;t provide any specifics on which bugs, and which compromises.”<p>People that actually think that <i>Wayland</i> is the “future” that will replace <i>X11</i> with this constant “features that many users need are insecure and they really don&#x27;t need them.” are a laughter. As of this moment most user interfaces haven&#x27;t even tried an attempt to make a <i>Wayland</i> port and aren&#x27;t interested; the only noteable ports are <i>KDE</i>, <i>GNOME</i>, <i>Sway</i>, and <i>Enlightenment</i>, two of which had to add back many of the cut features to make their system work, but had to do so in incompatible, nonstandardized ways.<p>It must have been around 2013 when I first heard talk about how <i>Wayland</i> was ready and would leave <i>X11</i> behind, and adoption hasn&#x27;t increased much since then.')
