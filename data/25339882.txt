It’s where I want to be. But I can’t justify paying the absurd rents to live there when my job doesn’t require me to be there AND socialization&#x2F;networking&#x2F;most leisure activities are on pause. After March there was nothing for me to do except enjoy nature activities&#x2F;exercise outside, and my social life was in shambles.<p>I can’t wait for everything to go back to normal and move back to the Bay Area, but for now I am very happy I moved back in with my parents.')
