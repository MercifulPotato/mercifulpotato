Can I do so before that person&#x27;s within 2 yards?<p>Better to just leave it on and leave it be rather than spend all day fumbling with it.  That is:<p>&gt; We need a steady state of vigilance.<p>Wearing a mask when out in public <i>is</i> that steady state.  Taking it off because you think you&#x27;re alone is a deviation from that steady state.')
