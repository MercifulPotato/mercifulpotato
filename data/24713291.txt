Things like S3, for example, can make use of no head of line blocking by allowing multiple file transfers, multiple pagination requests, etc. Even APIs can benefit from this by using bidirectional streaming.<p>Games can now also be built over a REST-like API using separate channels for different priority messages: movement, world state, chat, etc. Since you don&#x27;t need to worry about blocking you get way better performance. Almost every game engine networking component essentially implements TCP-over-UDP just to get application level control over these functions.')
