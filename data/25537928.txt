Item(by='DoreenMichele', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608919124, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25536138, text='I think two things contribute:<p>1. People think the point of education is credentials and free online courses don&#x27;t typically come with credentials.<p>2. People routinely use price as a proxy for value. This makes it hard to feel confident that a free course is actually worthwhile.<p>The nice thing about YC&#x27;s free education is that neither of these applies.<p>If you want to start a business, you mostly don&#x27;t need credentials. (There are exceptions.) You mostly just need to know how to make it happen.<p>They have a really good reputation. They know what they are talking about.<p>Bonus points: They do this stuff for free because HN and Startup School are both part of their funnel. If you actually do start a business and hope to grow it big, they would like a piece of the action.<p>So you know they are giving you good information because they want you to succeed so they can get a cut of some of the businesses that succeed that started out just consuming their free stuff. That&#x27;s exactly how they make their money and there is a lot of money at stake, so it&#x27;s worth it to them to give some stuff away for free.')
