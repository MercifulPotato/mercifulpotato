But because simplicity has a substantially greater impact than the language choice, I think it&#x27;s better to focus on that. Right now, the ecosystem is focusing more on the language choice, and hardly talking about simplicity at all. And particularly in the case of Rust, I think it fails simplicity a lot in its own ways - in the stdlib, the compiler and toolchain, the language design - and the trade-offs don&#x27;t really make sense for a lot of use cases that people are pining for it over anyway.')
