Those norms are mostly there as &#x27;social rules&#x27; so that we all get along and prosper - and it&#x27;s often difficult to tell &#x27;which ones are important and not&#x27;. Sometimes norms are important merely as norms, i.e. &#x27;standard modes of behaviour&#x27;. Language is like this - there&#x27;s nothing inherently moral or &#x27;good&#x27; about language but it helps immensely that we are all on the same page.<p>It doesn&#x27;t take intelligence to break norms either, but it definitely takes intelligence to develop reasonable opinions about them. Doing so is risky and can appear &#x27;foolish&#x27; - which is not stupid.<p>Sometimes we view arbitrary breaking of norms and &#x27;not being serious&#x27; as stupid, when often it&#x27;s not.<p>- People have always been stupid, but we now have the internet to highlight stupidity<p>- A lot of our own behaviours are influenced by emotional&#x2F;ideological memes, which is why there are so many out and about, and even &#x27;intelligent people&#x27; fall for them all day long. All major news outlets are written for a &#x27;dumbed down&#x27; audience - which includes a lot of intelligent people.<p>- Ideology. Even smart people are utterly confounded and made stupid by their ideologies. Carl Marx said some smart things, but a lot of utterly stupid things that continue to be &#x27;orthodox&#x27; in some groups. Every &#x27;touchy subject&#x27; is piled upon with stupidity because there isn&#x27;t any nuance allowed in the discussion.')
