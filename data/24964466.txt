So not much to compare.<p>I did have a really good experience doing long fasted running in the morning. At first I couldn&#x27;t go three miles without breakfast. But eventually I could do twelve straight out of bed and feel great.<p>As I understand, fasting trains your body to supply blood glucose from fat stores, which breaks your brain&#x27;s craving for sugary foods- which are a crutch for getting your blood sugar up. (Remember, your brain runs mainly on blood glucose)<p>Keto does the same thing a different way. But to me IF is way easier and healthier. (I strive to eat a Mediterranean style diet which ain&#x27;t Keto!)<p>I would say the experience for me is really good- as long as I avoid the cliff, which is what I was warning about. Basically, just don&#x27;t try to get all extreme thinking longer fasts are always better.')
