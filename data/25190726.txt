It could take days or weeks to debug that properly, if at all.<p>Nice you were able to get constant memory. I was getting 40byte max memory usage difference between identical RPC calls on the esp32, but that seems due to Nim’s ARC garbage collector. Sometimes +20 bytes, sometimes -20 bytes but not leaking. Though maybe it’s an esp-idf thing. Took me a bit to just call it good and focus on more important things. ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯')
