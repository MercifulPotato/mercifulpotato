You specify a high-level description of your project, and then you run cmake for it to generate your Makefile that performs the whole build.<p>With cmake you don&#x27;t even care which compiler you use. You can simply state you require, say, c++ 14 with constexpr support and you&#x27;re done for all platforms and all compiler picks.<p>If you believe cmake is more complex than a makefile then either you only work on single-foot projects or you have been cursed with hideously managed cmake projects.')
