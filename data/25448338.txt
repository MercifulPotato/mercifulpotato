Exercise programs like Supernatural or Beat Saber fall in the same category, fun, cool to try, but not something without okay substitutes or alternatives.<p>I think HL:Alyx is a game changer. Elite: Dangerous sold me on it initially. I regularly use Beat Saber to stay fit during the pandemic -- the recent addition of multiplayer is amazing. VR Chat is really awesome. I find it&#x27;s not nearly as exhausting to hang out with friends in VR Chat than a Zoom meeting.<p>HL:Alyx -- the fidelity, performance, and detail given to the content is amazing. But what was unique about it for me was that it made exchanges with <i>guns</i> actually harrowing and... more cinematic and believable. A lot of FPS&#x27; have to band-aid around the fact that the player character can soak bullets&#x2F;zaps&#x2F;whatever because the lack of spatial awareness of a projection onto a 2D surface means most casual players are going to be running into the middle of a fire fight and expect to have a reasonable chance to win.<p>In one of the opening scenes a soldier catches you off guard and points a gun right at you. In VR, without even thinking, my hands went up. In any other FPS, unless that interaction was scripted, I would have just shot back or ran.<p>Yet even because Alyx isn&#x27;t a super hero or wearing some high-tech recharging shield, it still feels cinematic. I&#x27;m physically ducking behind walls, tossing items and using bits of junk as a temporary shield.<p>And it does advance the story of the HL universe so there&#x27;s that... I wouldn&#x27;t say it didn&#x27;t change anything. It raised the bar for VR content that was lacking original content from AAA studios.<p>Elite: Dangerous. VR changed how I play completely. I was instantly better at flying. The added benefit of depth perception improved my reaction speed and spacial awareness. I play on a flat monitor now and again but it&#x27;s too boring and awkward.<p>Although you can&#x27;t argue with the numbers -- it&#x27;s not mainstream in the way that a Nintendo Switch or other game system is.<p>But I wonder if that&#x27;s not so much a content issue but if there were other factors involved like, say, how FB has managed Oculus or how it wasn&#x27;t deeply discounted at first to gain adoption like most new hardware platforms are.')
