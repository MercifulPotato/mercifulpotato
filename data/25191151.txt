For other examples, see the laws targeting Saturday-night specials, or even the army&#x2F;navy laws in the Jim Crow south.  Today we&#x27;re seeing much of this repeated with increased paperwork requirements, taxes, and price increases.  Regulatory requirements and ATF overreach decreases supply and helps move affordable firearms out of reach for many working-class or poor Americans.  Many people are concerned by increased voting requirements preventing people from voting, but fail to understand that these regulations do the same for gun rights.  Or maybe they do, and it&#x27;s intentional.<p>Reagan did a whole lot worse than this.  He signed the Hughes Amendment, which cut off the supply of new, civilian-transferrable machine guns.  I just can&#x27;t understand how anyone likes the guy in spite of the awful things he did to gun rights.  The Republican party is only somewhat less awful for gun rights than the Democrats.')
