I don&#x27;t think that pay-by-usage is inherently bad, for adults or kids.<p>I also feel like... it&#x27;s probably best if one doesn&#x27;t encounter these kinds of things as an adult for the first time.  What&#x27;s better to learn moderation with?<p>My kids (11, 9, 6) have, so far, largely shrugged off microtransaction things and think they&#x27;re kinda dumb... But they&#x27;ve spent maybe 10% of their discretionary money since birth on Pokemon cards, which scratches many of the same itches.  I don&#x27;t feel like A) it&#x27;s bad for them, or B) that they&#x27;re going to look back at the time and money spent and regret it.  But they have regretted spending a little bit on Pokemon cards that they&#x27;d later rather have spent on something else, and that&#x27;s a great lesson.')
