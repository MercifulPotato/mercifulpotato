We&#x27;re both beat by Wu by years, and arguably Zuboff by decades, <i>on that one element</i>. Though Doctorow <i>does</i> spend a lot of time talking abbout AdTech (mostly dismissing its significance, incorrectly IMO), and while he&#x27;s certainly discussed both censsorsship and propaganda in his work generally, he doesn&#x27;t quite bring the monopoly aspect and combined interreationship into focus.<p>Some cursory searching through the literature also seems to find this connection missing, though I&#x27;d be happy to be shown wrong.<p>(The Wu piece was found after my initial  postings, and <i>is</i> absolutely a piece of this.)')
