If you invest money back into the business, that might reduce your profits, and therefore any corporate or income taxes. But that investment it will increase the long-term value of the company. Under a wealth tax, that would cause taxes for everyone who holds the stock to go up! In fact, if investing in say a new line of business causes the value of the stock to go up by more than just parking the money in the corporate treasury, a wealth tax creates a perverse incentive <i>to not invest back in the company.</i>')
