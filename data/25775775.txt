Because you have friends in their group? Or peers? In the game I played, the top players knew each other.<p>So it&#x27;s avoidable. Just use another server which maybe you, or a neutral party controls. Doesn&#x27;t matter if they know eachother. Having a match against them is not a factor, if you play vs. them you don&#x27;t need to be in voice chat with your enemy to begin with, but maybe you have an example of a game where this is common.<p>&gt;Actually, you got a good idea who does the DDoS; &quot;supporters&quot; (hooligans) of group X, who got your IP from admin of voice chat server of group X.<p>Then don&#x27;t join group X. It&#x27;s simple really. Or you gather evidence, seems simple enough if you just write timestamps.')
