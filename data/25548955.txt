It makes you a useful idiot:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Useful_idiot" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Useful_idiot</a><p>2) Second, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is different than capitalism - it&#x27;s communist colonialism. The CCP is using money from US capital markets to massively bribe foreign officials to sell out their countries, with projects that are not affordable and often not useful - called debt traps.<p>In the case of Africa, China is also positioning armies in some of those countries.<p>In countries with ports, it&#x27;s having the host nation pay for future docking facilities for China&#x27;s navy, which is the largest in the world by number of ships.<p>In the case of Greece and some other European countries, it&#x27;s buying the largest ports and then telling the government to vote China&#x27;s way in the UN, or else.<p>In the case of the Himalayan neighbors, it&#x27;s providing financing while &quot;leasing&quot; vast areas of their countries, and encroaching on their head waters.<p>All of the above has already happened. It&#x27;s a form of global colonialism without firing a shot.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hcBQ148KPsg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hcBQ148KPsg</a><p>The US&#x27; fear is that the BRI ports will be used to store container nuclear bombs, then one day the CCP will announce they have &quot;mined&quot; the world&#x27;s largest ports.<p>Mao: &quot;Hide our strength, bide our time.&quot;')
