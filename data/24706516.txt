Especially men&#x27;s barbering. Has a particularly high dollar&#x2F;hour rate too.<p>Tooling is $1k for clippers and scissors and razors. Not sure about chairs, but probably another $1k.<p>Suppose you charge $20 a cut, typical cut takes ~15-20 minutes and you&#x27;re open 360 days a year.<p>10 cuts&#x2F;day =&gt; $72k&#x2F;yr. 2-3 hours of work a day.<p>20 cuts&#x2F;day =&gt; $144k&#x2F;yr. 4-5 hours of work a day.<p>Find reasonable rent and you&#x27;re netting a pretty good profit. And yes it&#x27;s an easy space to enter, but generally, once men find &quot;their barber&quot;, they&#x27;re locked in for pretty much the rest of their life and become a regular customer every 2-3 weeks.')
