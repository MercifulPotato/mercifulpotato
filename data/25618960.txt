Whoever is currently in power only violates the human rights of the people they don&#x27;t care about, and the party out of power at a given time may care about them but isn&#x27;t contemporaneously in power to stop it.<p>The next time they play musical chairs the people being violated may change but the incentives don&#x27;t.<p>You might imagine someone having the forethought to consider that someone else might be in power at some future point and put mechanisms in place to constrain their abuses.
