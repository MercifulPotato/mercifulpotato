If you are required to have insurance or a specific license but you could avoid it through a costly self education process, you end up in the same place.<p>Going back, let’s say the top is $100M, let’s say the bottom is....(not sure how to guess this)....<p>Ok, so, the 7th executive made $20M based on this dated public doc (1). So let’s say the top slate is $250M. Going from $20M to $1M for everyone else is ... $900M? Anyways so $1.15B.<p>The real thing though it’s probably not the cash expenditure part. It’s probably the GROWTH you can get by designing it correct. You’d be okay to spend for results.<p>Anyways at a high level, let’s say you have 5 FTEs at $200k, plus overhead at 100%, that’s $2M on $1B or 0.5%?
