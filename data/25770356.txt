After their 3 devices limitation, I lost trust of investing into their plans, I would hate to pay a company that makes a bait and switch of their main product.<p>Anyway after the bait and switch, I migrated to a self hosted solution with an old laptop and syncthing, and works great. But I miss some of the dropbox features, but not that much to pay for 90% of storage I will never use.<p>Yeah, selfhost it&#x27;s more expensive than their plans, and I&#x27;m responsible for the reliability; but I have more control and better features, so not so bad so far.')
