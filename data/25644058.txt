Make a system emulator where everything is fully deterministic, including perfectly timed IO and network characteristics.<p>Then your load test won&#x27;t have any random noise from things like an SSD with inconsistent performance, or a CPU that throttles down depending on room temperature.<p>A zero-noise load test can be much shorter to get good results, and means you won&#x27;t be investigating spurious performance regressions.  You can compare traces between tested software versions down to clock-cycle accuracy to <i>really</i> locate issues, rather than just guestimating.')
