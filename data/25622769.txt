One of these days, I felt sheepish, and went to Thunderbird. Didn&#x27;t cut it for me. The killer feature in Seamonkey for me is the search. The default works, but so does MacOS mail - but the advanced search in Seamonkey really works. I wonder why so many mail clients make a mess of this.<p>Especially during this Covid era, when the mail volume seems to have multiplied by a factor of 3 for me, search is really important. I don&#x27;t want fuzzy search, but rather exact search. Strangely enough, the mail client that seems to get it right is also the one that is clunkiest to look at.')
