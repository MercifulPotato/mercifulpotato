I really wanted to make some comments on this project and I hope they are constructive.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if you&#x27;re starting off with a specific vertical in mind for this, targeting any facebook user might be a bit hard, so maybe consider curating to specific groups of people or communities. The current UI&#x2F;UX would not be appealing to engineers for example (pop colours, animations, sliding panels) but to a more creative community it might be a welcome change.<p>Social networks are a dime a dozen, you most likely have some features that differentiate slyde from others and some features your target audience will appreciate. Let your users know about them. The landing page doesn&#x27;t offer much information. Why and how is slyde better for my community, friends, or work?<p>Help the user understand what your features do, channels don&#x27;t load, and I don&#x27;t know what they are. The button to &quot;create a post&quot; is giving me three options for feed&#x2F;channel&#x2F;story. I don&#x27;t know what these are and I don&#x27;t know how to find out. I am not sure what an invite will do.<p>---<p>Various minor personal annoyances with the site itself: The whole site is visually overloaded and is bringing my browser to its knees (on a pretty beefy desktop). The vertically scroll on the home page result in me going to the previous page when using the trackpad. Clicking on &quot;create a post&quot; takes 5 seconds to do something. Various buttons don&#x27;t show the correct cursor making me think they are not clickable.<p>Again a personal peeve: I would not invite my friends&#x2F;family to anything that suggests that they might know random strangers. I understand these are the first days of the network but logging in and simply seeing a list of options and reasons I should invite my friends would be more encouraging than seeing random people&#x27;s faces.')
