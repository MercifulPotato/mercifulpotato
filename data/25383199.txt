To contact the court WRT the validity of such a search warrant;<p>2.  To contact an attorney to obtain legal advice WRT how to respond to an attempt to enter and search her home;<p>3.  To remove her small children (who obviously have no involvement) and protect them from the police;<p>4.  To put on appropriate clothing so as to be fully dressed when police enter her home.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are a myriad of other reasonable reasons she might have delayed answering her door.<p>I don&#x27;t know if any or all of the above (or any other) reasons are relevant, but it seems to me that such a delay doesn&#x27;t imply wrongdoing on her part.')
