What I&#x27;m saying is that for low level memory mangling and primitive operations over the set of register based machines.. you don&#x27;t get any benefits from using another language it seems. I.. just a dude but some people doing HPC said that you can even reach FORTRAN speed on numerics if you fiddle with the right keywords to avoid aliasing.<p>Again I&#x27;m not a C fan.. but what would pascal or basic give you that is a critical factor in making a better system with it ? modula I can&#x27;t say.
