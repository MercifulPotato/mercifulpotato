I think reading books is like exercise, it doesn&#x27;t matter which part of muscle it trains, as long as you keep doing it, it&#x27;ll improve your health overall. I find that the best part of reading books for me comes mostly from the unconscious influence--often after I read a book, I can&#x27;t tell you what I remember specifically and how it would improve my life. But if I&#x27;m lucky, one day the idea will come to my mind at the right time. I find myself dislike the mindset of having a purpose on reading. For me, the meaty part of reading is the process of searching, not the results. And you can guess that I dislike reading self-help books. I don&#x27;t think we can change our behaviors by reading a book. knowing something is easy, practice is hard.<p>Interestingly, the author mentions he&#x27;s reading Daniel Kahneman&#x27;s Thinking, Fast and Slow. In a talk[1], Daniel says &quot;This is not really a self-help book. And of course it&#x27;s very easy for me to say because I&#x27;ve been studying it. Not only I&#x27;ve read the book, I wrote it. Didn&#x27;t improve my thinking at all.&quot;<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MgQutgSwY88&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4392" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=MgQutgSwY88&amp;feature=youtu.be...</a>')
