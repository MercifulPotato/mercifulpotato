The clients get a consistent contract (the view schema) which can be backed by whatever tables make sense (or don&#x27;t make sense but are used anyways).<p>I definitely appreciate the flexibility of a document store but I despise not having schemas for clients. Interface contracts reduce errors and ultimately make life easier for everyone. The database also has tons of information <i>in RAM</i> it can use to search and sort data, pushing those operations to the client balloons bandwidth requirements unnecessarily.')
