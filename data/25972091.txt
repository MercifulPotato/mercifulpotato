You&#x27;re arguing semantics in a disingenuous fashion which reinforces my point and make me like Nyxt even less. Nyxt, the end-user product, &quot;is not entirely written in Common Lisp&quot;. Your rendering and browsing engine, the core of your application, Webkit, is not a Lisp library.<p>2. This doesn&#x27;t solve the problem. Being able to use both webkit and web engine  in no way makes you resilient to the issue I brought up. Google has plenty of reasons to disallow and prevent their engine to be used by Nyxt and they have said that they will do so. Your answer strengthens my point.<p>3. Again, the issue is systemic and there&#x27;s nothing upstream providers of web engines can do. Using these libraries in isolation will always expose you to significantly more security issues than using them as part of the browsers they were meant to be used in.<p>4. Flexibility and power (as I explained) is me using uBlock origin and coutless other extensions without reimplementing them from zero. Do you have uBlock origin for Nyxt? I rest my point.<p>5. Really? Then explain this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nyxt.atlas.engineer&#x2F;applications" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nyxt.atlas.engineer&#x2F;applications</a><p>I&#x27;m very disappointed in your answers but I rest easy in knowing that my opinions and choice not to waste my time with your project are justified.')
