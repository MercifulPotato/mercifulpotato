In forums like this, we (Julians) often want to <i>make a case</i>  for Julia. Since most soon-to-be Julians come from Python, R or Matlab, it&#x27;s natural to argue <i>for</i> Julia by arguing why Python and R is deficient.<p>It&#x27;s similar to how it&#x27;s hard to argue for Rust without mentioning that C is unsafe. If C users kept insisting that the unsafe behaviour of C was not a real issue, Rustaceans would seem a lot more negative towards C.')
