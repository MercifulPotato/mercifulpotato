It controls boot, processes, authentication, time, dns, proxies, etc. The GNOME Foundation unilaterally required all distros adopt Systemd ten years ago without any community support. Yocto makes it exceedingly hard to create embedded devices that don&#x27;t have Systemd, so it&#x27;s probably lurking on all your IoT devices.')
