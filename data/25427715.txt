When I bought it, having a screen without an ugly notch or hole was the benefit and having a pop-up selfie camera was the trade-off.<p>Or so I thought. And then one week I caught my camera quickly popping up and down when using Firefox. I searched around thinking there must be a bug. It turned out, Firefox had camera permission somehow. I don&#x27;t recall granting it permission. In any case, it sure seemed like a rogue ad or JavaScript malware was taking pictures at random times. Who knows.<p>But I would never have known this if it were not for a physical camera that has to pop up. Today, I can&#x27;t imagine having a phone that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> have this same mechanism.')
