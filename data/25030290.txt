What you call stonewalling one side calls preventing damage. It&#x27;s from your point of view that it&#x27;s progress. The stonewalling actually serves a purpose. If both sides can&#x27;t agree, nothing happens. The gov is essentially frozen. You want control to force through policies that the other side doesn&#x27;t want. You claim the right doesn&#x27;t want to work together, but this is opinion. There&#x27;s clearly evidence of them working together. Your complaint is you don&#x27;t have full control, therefore bad. &quot;But we should work together.&quot;<p>Just admit it, the dems don&#x27;t want to work together or compromise at all. Nanci Pelosi made this very clear recently.')
