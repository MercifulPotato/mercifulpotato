In general, it needs to be clear to customers when they make the buying decision that it&#x27;s not dairy-based cheese. So, on the product page and on the product packaging we need to call it &quot;cheese alternative&quot;.<p>But those laws are stupid and pushed by the dairy and meat lobbies. To every sane person, it&#x27;s clear within 1 sec that this is a plant-based cheese without animal milk.')
