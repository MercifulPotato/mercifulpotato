Item(by='stvswn', descendants=None, kids=[25002526], score=None, time=1604612980, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25001772, text='I don&#x27;t really agree with you characterization of where our taxes go -- federally, 64% of the government budget is related to mandatory spending, almost all of which is social security, medicare, and medicaid.<p>15% of the budget goes to the military.  That makes the U.S. the largest military spender in the world.<p>15% of the budget may seem expensive, but it&#x27;s not fair to compare it to Western Europe.  NATO is a big reason why western europe does not need to spend more on their own defense.<p>I believe that&#x27;s a good thing - it&#x27;s in the United States&#x27; best interest to avoid rearmament in Europe, and Europe has never been at (relative) peace for so long as it has been since the emergence of the post-WWII consensus -- but they do in fact have more money for more non-defense discretionary spending than we do as a result.  The Euro area spends 1.4% of GDP on military spending while being protected by an umbrella of security provided by the U.S., which spends 3.7% of GDP on the military.<p>Again, I think this is good for the U.S., we benefit from the liberal world order that we enforce, but I think it has to be taken into context when the EU is described as a great example of how to spend tax money on wise social programs.')
