We both worked in what was called &quot;MIPO&quot; (Microprocessor Operation) but I was in Systems Validation and he was on the customer facing side with field engineering. My career went off through a variety of engineering roles, his went into management and up. When he joined EMC, I told him I had always thought he would have been Intel&#x27;s CEO. He told me, &quot;Hey, maybe I still will be :-)&quot; That was like 10 years ago, and here he is.<p>There are a lot of things you can say about Silicon Valley, but one of the more interesting aspects of it for me has been how &quot;small&quot; it is in terms of people have an oversized impact. I have never been one of those people of course, just a part of the entourage. But it has been interesting to watch and learn from folks who are good (and bad) role models.')
