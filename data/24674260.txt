If it did we would have already heard about a well-off target identified by the software, a target with the means to mount a loud defense against such tracking.<p>And it cannot be that the software accurately returns such results but LE simply ignores them if the target seems to be too powerful. In that case we would have already heard from a leaker about a murder from a perpetrator that such a system correctly identified but LE neglected to follow up on. (Think of the value to the company of such evidence!)<p>No, I&#x27;m guessing this system gives LE cover for the same flawed systems they&#x27;ve historically used to target and harass people who don&#x27;t have the means to loudly mount a defense. Just take the same process that a court has ruled against as unconstitutional, use its data as input to your ML algo, and voila! You&#x27;ve probably got at at least one more decade before society figures out you&#x27;re just appending the words &quot;through a sophisticated AI system&quot; to your outlawed policing.')
