It had beta 2 on it.  We started the porting effort and had questions.  Forums were the only place they said answers could be had.  Never got any answers.<p>When beta 10 was released, it just wouldn&#x27;t install.  We tried for a week then saw a post on the forums that gave a hint about Mac-to-Mac reset of the firmware and general machine state.  We had to upgrade another machine to Catalina to use it (inconvenient, but not a killer).<p>When 11.0.1 came out it wouldn&#x27;t install and now the machine is a brick.  We ordered a production mini with the M1 and it will be here in late December.  While we sit with the brick and can&#x27;t do any porting.<p>At every step we hit brick walls and had zero help from Apple.  It was beyond frustrating.')
