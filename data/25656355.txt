I think the key is that Americans love to dream of themselves as wealthy philanthropists (no matter how poor they actually are).<p>If there was a way to make paying taxes feel more like philanthropy, maybe we could solve this. Maybe it’s as simple as giving everybody a certificate with a list of anonymized names and what treatments they helped pay for, so they can brag about it on Facebook.<p>“I helped pay for a child’s chemotherapy” instead of “the government took my money”')
