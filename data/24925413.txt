At that point you’re <i>subverting</i> the process.<p>Sure, some approval processes are BS, but... generally, any time you’re in a role where you need a supervisor to sign off on stuff, you <i>do not know enough</i> about what matters to your business to tell the difference between BS and critical safety or security guarantees.')
