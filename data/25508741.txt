I&#x27;m afraid to say I have little trust in current academic standards.  The number of first-class honours degrees continues to rise while the academic rigour and teaching standards of courses continue to slide, and a big part of that is in tolerance of dishonesty.  It&#x27;s long past time that colleges and universities had a zero tolerance policy for this stuff; their reputations will suffer irreparably if they don&#x27;t.  If they haven&#x27;t already.<p>As someone who worked their ass off, graduated with first class honours and never cheated, rewarding cheating devalues the grades of honest students.  It&#x27;s absolutely unfair, and it needs properly policing.  Good academics don&#x27;t need to cheat.<p>There is huge pressure not to fail people, and it is incredibly difficult to actually fail--I know only of a small handful of instances.  In one case, they basically didn&#x27;t show up for six months on a 1 year masters and did zero work, and even then it took months of handwringing to actually kick them out.  But it shouldn&#x27;t require months of agonising if the rules are clear and consistently and fairly enforced.  The problem is that they are in a thrall to rich overseas students&#x27; cash, and they don&#x27;t want to rock the boat.  They even have special dumbed down Masters courses which are strictly for overseas students only.  An academic friend of mine who was a fellow PhD student teaches on one, and he wasn&#x27;t happy at the standard of the course or the academic conduct of the students.  If they were on a regular course they should mostly have failed.  And there&#x27;s also the issue of league tables--being lax in grading and punishing cheating gets you a higher ranking in the league tables, so there&#x27;s a strong disincentive to have high standards.<p>At this point, I do think that universities need some sort of external intervention.  If standards are to be upheld, academic misconduct must result in real consequences, i.e. being kicked out.  Most universities have a session on academic misconduct for all new students, and they have to sign a statement saying they understand what academic misconduct is and that they understand that it is not permitted.  That needs enforcing properly, no second chances.  As for cheating on coursework, there&#x27;s a simple answer to that: go back to closed examinations for all courses, and make the coursework component a minor part or remove it entirely.  And structure the coursework to minimise cheating.  For example, make every student&#x27;s work unique so there is no possibility of using anyone else&#x27;s work.  As a scientist, lab work and written work were usually your own experiments and essays, so little chance for cheating.<p>The real test for the cheaters is when they later have to perform in the real world.  There is usually a clear difference between motivated and competent people who are independent thinkers and doers and lazy chancers who struggle, and it&#x27;s quickly apparent which category people fall into despite their paper qualifications and CVs.  Whether you&#x27;re in a university or a company, there are people you can rely on who know their stuff and can deliver, and the people who can&#x27;t.')
