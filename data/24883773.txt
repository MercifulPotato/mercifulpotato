The goal of Buddha was to end &quot;suffering&quot;. What he found was that the&#x2F;one way to do that is to become aware of feelings&#x2F;emotions&#x2F;sensations, to the point where we don&#x27;t spontaneously react to them, but instead can consciously choose how to act when we encounter them. How you do that is by first fostering awareness and then by detaching yourself from your own reaction patterns. The idea is not to desensitize yourself, you still very much feel everything, but you can then choose what you do afterwards. Which means you still feel pain, love, bitterness and joy, but you don&#x27;t need to suffer.<p>Why would you want to suffer?')
