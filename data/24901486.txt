I had problems my whole life with attention and memory. It turned out to be a neurological problem and now it&#x27;s mostly under control thanks to medication and therapy. If you&#x27;re randomly commenting about it on HN it&#x27;s probably affecting more of your life than you think it is; that&#x27;s certainly the way it was for me, and I am <i>far</i> happier having talked to a doctor about what I thought was just a thing everyone had to deal with.')
