Not that I&#x27;m not a good engineer, mind you, but some of these places just wanted a &quot;token black guy&quot; or they actually had quotas as part of some social responsibility&#x2F;inclusiveness BS.<p>You know what? I absolutely hated those places and didn&#x27;t last long there. I definitely don&#x27;t want to be excluded because of how I look, but I don&#x27;t want to be hired or treated differently because of it either. I&#x27;m much happier at my current employer where there is no such BS and black people are a very small minority, which is absolutely fine since we are also a very small minority of CS students where I live.<p>Also on the topic of education - don&#x27;t create quotas or special programs for people with a certain appearance or ethnic background. Instead, create programs for the disadvantaged.')
