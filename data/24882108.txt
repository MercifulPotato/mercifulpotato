I challenge everyone to name a single person (or country, or continent) who’s done more than him.<p>- He refers to the Wuhan Virus as the China&#x2F;Chinese Virus (CCP is trying very hard from distancing themselves from responsibility; they won’t even let us into Wuhan to investigate).<p>- He started a trade war with China, which has forced companies to move their manufacturing to Vietnam, India, Mexico, Taiwan, etc. (Biden admittedly said he would end Trump’s China tariffs, but the many companies that already left are unlikely to return), and even high end tech such as the iPhone is starting to get assembled outside China as well.<p>- He was the first US President to speak directly with Taiwan&#x27;s President since 1979.<p>- He made the largest arms sale to Taiwan in the past few decades.<p>- The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act and the Hong Kong Autonomy Act were signed under his administration.<p>- The TAIPEI Act was signed under his administration.<p>- The Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act was singed under his administration.<p>- Meng Wanzhou was arrested under his administration (which dragged Canada into it because China decided to arbitrarily arrest Canadian citizens).<p>- China Mobile was blocked from offering services in the US, citing national security risks.<p>- Huawei was blocked from using Android and chips with US tech (which will effectively kill their mobiles once their stock runs out).<p>- Huawei was blocked from building 5G networks (USA paid other nations to block them as well).<p>- Hong Kong’s special status was revoked.<p>- Universal Postal Union agreed to let countries raise postal rates after Trump threatened to leave - this means you’ll no longer be able to buy cheap junk from Aliexpress (and resellers like Wish) at no shipping cost (the receiving country was previously forced to deliver the products for free, even if you brought some toy for 10 cents).<p>- Trump is pushing for WTO to drop China’s developing country status.<p>- TikTok and WeChat (likely with more to come) would’ve been blocked by now if it wasn’t for judges temporarily blocking the bans.<p>There&#x27;s a reason China&#x27;s GDP growth in 2019 was the lowest it&#x27;s been since 1990, and there&#x27;s a reason China&#x27;s worldwide reputation is at an all-time low. That reason is Trump. It&#x27;s also no surprise that all the nations that suffer the most from CCP&#x27;s actions, such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam, etc. tend to be pro-Trump.')
