Same API though.<p>For symtabs a swiss table variant for short strings should be the best. See the 2017 swiss table talk.\nEsp. for unicode symbols I&#x27;ll add u8ident, but better is to avoid unicode identifiers at all. ASCII is good enough. \nJust think of mixing greek with cyrillic and math symbols. They are undistinguishable.')
