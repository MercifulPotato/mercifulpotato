(See: the state of most debate and discussion.) I don&#x27;t know what would be a cure, or even if that&#x27;s even possible.  Censorship definitely seems to be the wrong approach.  Since it&#x27;s hard to improve what you can&#x27;t measure, perhaps this attempt to measure censorship will be helpful.')
