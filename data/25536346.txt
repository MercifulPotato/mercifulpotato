Most of the time I would have immediately fixed my problem by being told &quot;you are returning a reference to the insides of a temporary structure, either clone it or make the structure&#x27;s lifetime `static`&quot; but no, I have to get an error about not implementing a certain trait with anonymous type parameter... :(<p>I&#x27;m getting there though.
