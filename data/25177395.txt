The community. I&#x27;ve shared a fairly large amount of content (some of it of pretty low quality), and I&#x27;ve always received positive feedback or tactfully worded constructive feedback. I&#x27;ve yet to see a negative comment on my work. It&#x27;s a community of folks hanging out sharing their hobby together.<p>2. The set inventories. The community works hard to keep these up-to-date. I&#x27;ve found them to be very reliable. These are all freely available for download as well. This is a godsend to folks like me who prefer their LEGO inventory to be in a local database they can query.<p>3. The business model. Most features are available for free in an ad-supported manner, but users can pay for premium features and the removal of ads.')
