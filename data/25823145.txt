Yes, sure, Wikipedia. Every news article posted about Parler from the beginning. The CEO. The court filing after Amazon warned them to implement some moderation policies and they didn’t[0].<p>Parler was also notorious for banning non-hardcore right-wing opinions, much like how r&#x2F;conservative is somehow both a “free speech zone” but you aren’t allowed to post dissenting opinions.<p>Personally, I believe ISIS have a right to believe we all need to live under Sharia law. These wackjobs have a right to believe we all need to live in a fascist state where we can hang gays, Jews, liberals, and dissenters. But I have a right to believe views like that are abhorrent and dangerous and that Amazon and every other host is well within their rights to say, “we prefer social stability, thanks” and I would feel exactly the same about some violent left wing movement (if one existed that wasn’t some boogeyman created by OANN or NewsMax). Twitter removes violent left wing content just as much as it removes violent right wing content. The left just doesn’t bitch about nearly as much, or as loudly. And yes, I’m sure you can cherry-pick a few examples where lefties posted vile shit and it didn’t get removed, then I would cherry-pick some vile shit a right winger posted that didn’t get removed, and we would continue in this fashion indefinitely. It’s hard to moderate content when you have millions of users and millions of bots. No system is going to make everyone happy, but I think calling for the violent death of our democratically elected representatives is over the line, no matter who is making the call, and content like that should be removed. I feel like that’s a pretty sensible line to draw.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;amazoncom-parler&#x2F;amazon-warned-parler-about-violent-content-before-cutoff-court-filing-idUSL1N2JO274" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;amazoncom-parler&#x2F;amazon-warn...</a>')
