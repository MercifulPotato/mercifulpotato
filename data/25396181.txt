Then you can press ESC to go back. Given you feedback, we didn&#x27;t make that obvious enough.<p>&gt; Context\nYes. We want to release a VSCode (and other IDEs+editors will follow) extension that will understand your current working context. The goal is to eliminate browser as much as possible. This way, for example, we would be able to extract errors from your terminal and offer you answers even before you start searching.<p>&gt; Unauthenticated search\nUnfortunately, GitHub let you do only 10 searches per minute as an unauthenticated user. We seemed to go over that limit fairly often from our internal testing. Once you authenticate yourself you get limit of 30 searches&#x2F;minute. Eventually, we want to build our own index and use our API.<p>Thank you for trying out the app!')
