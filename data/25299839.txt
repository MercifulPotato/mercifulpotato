Imagine working at a company that has basically found its niche, is doing well, just not growing much so only hiring really slowly. Everybody around you has been there for 20+ years. Everybody working like 20-30 years ago. This kind of bubble is dangerous, not just for the employees&#x27; future chances on the job market, but for the company itself. To find the best solutions to the problems in their market, the company needs to stay cutting edge with its tech too. Otherwisr they will get outcompeted in no time.<p>And by doing so, it profits the employees too. If everybody has been around for 20+ years but stays really current, even just for the sake of the company, their employability stays high too! It&#x27;s a win-win.<p>These rants about &quot;I&#x27;m back on the job market and now have to re-learn coding&quot; tend to be a strong sign of complacency. &quot;I already went through this and now want peace and quiet, why am I being forced to learn something new?&quot; Well, because the world is evolving. Keep evolving with it, or gradually disappear in obsolescence. If you don&#x27;t then that&#x27;s not just bad for your job chances but even for your company. You&#x27;d not want to work at a place that still uses VB6 just because it was hip 20 years ago when everybody was hired.<p>FWIW I work at a company where we are strongly encouraged to stay on top of the game so that we stay competitive in the market. That automatically keeps everybody employable.')
