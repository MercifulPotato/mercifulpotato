Elites have their parents pay for school, they don&#x27;t need loans.<p>2) budgets for public colleges have been annihilated over the last ~20 years. State governments used to pay a much larger share of tuition. Bailing out students loan debt would pay some of this gap indirectly<p>3) student loans cannot be discharged in bankruptcy, unlike any other type of debt. &quot;Debt slavery&quot; is real. I know people that have permanently fled the country because there is no other escape from crushing debt.<p>4) Democrats are very limited in what they can do for relief. With Republicans stonewalling the Senate, they&#x27;re basically limited to direct one-time payments. It&#x27;s basically this or nothing')
