Item(by='nickelcitymario', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609785830, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25635735, text='&gt; Previously I worked from home a couple of days per week.<p>That&#x27;s very different from working from home every day. If it was an option, I&#x27;d love to work from home twice a week and from the office the other 3. That would be a nice balance.<p>&gt; This year many of us combined working from home with a restriction on all of those &quot;safety valves&quot; and in-person socialization in general.<p>Definitely an interesting question. Would I have enjoyed working from home if I could still go out and socialize every day? Impossible to say but I&#x27;d love to find out some day.')
