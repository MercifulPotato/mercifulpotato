I have always appreciate simple things like this that allow me to learn new features of a language, or in this case the stdlib that comes with a language, without introducing too much cruft. I am still learning new tech and these kinds of demos are a great way to learn.<p>I am just being overly pedantic about the 100 LOC thing because it&#x27;s been used over decades as a kind of badge of honor&#x2F;bragging rights. If you implement something that really relies on nothing in N LOC then it&#x27;s warranted. If it&#x27;s just a teaching tool, like this is, I feel that it&#x27;s better to present it as &quot;Show HN: how I learned about HTTP support in the Ruby stdlib and wrote a toy proxy server&quot;. The README for this project actually makes it sound like this is something you could use in production, which you absolutely should not.')
