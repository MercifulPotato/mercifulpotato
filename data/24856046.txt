I&#x27;m far less effective when the problem isn&#x27;t taking over my whole brain. And when I have two problems going on at once it causes large amounts of stress.\nSo if I&#x27;m working on something that isn&#x27;t aligned with my actual goals - then I have a mind that is constantly flip flopping between the task I&#x27;m supposed to be doing, my work, and the task I really want to do. \nSo I&#x27;ve spent my working life intermittently working on the programming problem at hand and wandering off into &#x27;thinking space&#x27; to work on the intellectual problem I&#x27;m actually interested in.<p>In those rare periods where I actually want to work on what I&#x27;m supposed to be working on - maybe a couple of times a year - my productivity literally triples.')
