Use if for whatever, study what it does, change it, share the original or modified version -- those are the <i>four freedoms</i> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;philosophy&#x2F;free-sw.en.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;philosophy&#x2F;free-sw.en.html</a> . Humans can&#x27;t be free, if they&#x27;re not in control of the computers&#x2F;software that they use.<p>The Free software community considers it unethical, if a cellphone owner or an automobile owner can&#x27;t do with her device (including the software it runs) what she wants, even though she bought it with her hard earned money.')
