They do when they visit their dying relatives in the hospital, when they go through gut wrenching legal proceedings with a person they once loved, when their boss tells them they&#x27;re worthless. We all crush through harsh realities on the daily, having someone by your side doesn&#x27;t make you weak. There is nothing to &quot;normalize&quot;, if anything the abnormal thing is that we strayed from it to a culture that pretends the individual is all powerful, a masturbatory illusion of absolute self-reliance.<p>Grit will help you right up until you jump off a bridge. Very few people succeed through sheer tyranny of will, most do because they have a support network that helps them survive.')
