Watched it with my daughter who is an 8-yo wannabe a marine biologist someday. What always troubles me is that in the end, the film maker just lets the octopus died. I wonder what stops him from providing a sanctuary for it. Another moment in this I found strange is how he didn&#x27;t want to intervene when the shark came after and ate the octopus arm. Maybe his thought is more about survival of the fittest and didn&#x27;t want to be the decision maker in the natural food chain.')
