You can give teachers the freedom to modify their curricula while still mandating that some books make it into the curriculum.<p>2. Banning the book forces the teachers to use a different option, but not necessarily a better option. The ones voluntarily using the &quot;better&quot; book(s) aren&#x27;t in any way aided by the book being banned, the only teachers the ban affects are those who deliberately decided against the better books. Now imagine, if a teacher gets told that a book is problematic and some alternative is less racist, and that teacher says &#x27;nah, I&#x27;m going to stick with the more racist one&#x27; do you really trust that teacher to move in the correct direction when given the freedom to select any other unbanned book?<p>3. Mein Kampf and comparable works are books that fall into the &quot;objectively unnacceptable in the classroom&quot; category that logically should be banned outright from the curriculum. These are books that are not only inferior to other options, they should not be taught in schools even if they were the last books on Earth. GP comment was arguing TKAM belongs in this category, which prompted my initial comment.')
