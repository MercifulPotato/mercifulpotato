If everyone collectively stopped paying their bills and crashed the economy, is that violent? I would suggest that when (sorry, all things end) America collapses...not a shot will be fired.<p>Likewise, if I were to advise a foreign adversay on the best way to &quot;fight&quot; the US, I would suggest currency manipulation or information manipulation.
