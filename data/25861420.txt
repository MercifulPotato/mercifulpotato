Twitter backing an illegitimate US backed tin pot dictator and denying the legitmately elected government a voice.<p>As far as I can tell, the group you&#x27;re calling the &quot;legitimately elected government&quot; is that of the tin pot dictator that&#x27;s run Venezuela into the ground and ran a sham election to cement its power:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;venezuela-congress-socialists-control-5226bbbcdeb19b07fd8b4e2e425b2759" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;venezuela-congress-socialists-con...</a>:<p>&gt; Maduro’s allies swept legislative elections last month boycotted by the opposition and denounced as a sham by the U.S., the European Union and several other foreign governments. While the vote was marred by anemically low turnout, it nonetheless seemed to relegate into irrelevancy the U.S.-backed opposition led by lawmaker Juan Guaidó.<p>The government there bribes voters with <i>food handouts</i>.  Think of how bad things must be if you can be bribed with food:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-latin-america-55211149" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-latin-america-55211149</a>:<p>&gt; The government may now be in control of the National Assembly but the low turnout was hardly a &quot;win&quot;.<p>&gt; Sure, there were people who cast their vote, some still clinging to the man in power, others citing their democratic right as well as many more fearful of repercussions like losing food handouts if they didn&#x27;t.<p>&gt; But for the most part, there&#x27;s an atmosphere of resignation. Most Venezuelans I&#x27;ve spoken to this past week saw little point in these elections and decided there were better things to be doing on Sunday.<p>&gt; The vast queues at petrol stations rather than the polling stations explain what you need to know about politics here - that Venezuelans just want to survive another day and for politics to just go away.')
