The US Attorney just a couple hours ago complained publicly that the Capitol Police didn&#x27;t apprehend the attackers; peaceful racial justice protesters were arrested and beaten over the summer; T. Greg Doucette tracked and lost count of all the video evidence of it. There is an obvious double standard.<p>The problem I keep having with these arguments is that it&#x27;s easy for me to accept that Kendi and DiAngelo are grifters, but the people pointing that out also want me to swallow a bunch of other less tenable stuff.')
