[...] Whole grain wheat may contain as high as 14% resistant starch, while milled wheat flour may contain only 2%.<p>&gt; The fermentation of resistant starch produces more butyrate than other types of dietary fibers.<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Resistant_starch#Processing_effects" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Resistant_starch#Processing_ef...</a><p>&gt; Butyrates are important as food for cells lining the mammalian colon (colonocytes).

From what I hear, colon cancer is not terribly fun.  Since processing greatly reduces the resistant starch content of certain goods it seems reasonable to claim that &quot;processing&quot; makes some foods less healthy.<p>Though like all things there is a lot of subtly here; I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if plant based burgers end up healthier on the whole despite the processing when compared to regular meat.  But they are unlikely to be healthier than the equivalent in unprocessed veggies.')
