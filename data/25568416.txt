I am not a socialist but i do not find public health and sanitation a political &#x2F;ideological issue. It in my libertarian bag as it violates the freedoms and human rights of others to not have diseases. Not having a vaccine harms others through lack of herd immunity.<p>Also I would argue it is more a business issue. These countries rely a lot on the hospitality and tourism industry and lack of herd immunity means the economy is severely hamstrung. So yeah, it is actually a matter of economic survival. For me it should be mandatory, but as far as i know Portuguese constitution does not allow it. Even for the lock down they needed to declare national emergency, because otherwise there would not be a legal basis for it. The only other time there was an emergency was when the country was on the verge of a civil war after the carnations revolution in the 70s.<p>In Portugal you used to have a vaccine card, which some institutions required you to provide. For example, health professionals are required the vaccine bulletin to apply for work.<p>Except for the case above, I am not aware any other case where the vaccine record is required for adults. I actually lost my card several years ago. I think they started digitalizing it though, but i do not think it contains old information, only newly taken vaccine shots.<p>I said adults, because for children there is a caveat, where there is a de facto enforcement unless exempted by a medical doctor, or home school (very rare). To apply to a school your child needs to have the OPs mentioned vaccines. If you do not you will be denied application. Every year it is checked. As there is mandatory education in Portugal the way around it is very hard.')
