Maybe they’re taking more or less than I expected, but if I’m syncing my entire contact list I just have to assume now they have my contact list- and I accepted that when I enabled the functionality.<p>Some feature flags&#x2F;settings across all the OSes get hidden, are non-obvious, on by default, or are flat out using dark patterns (looking at you Win10) but in general I assume the default state (for all OSes) is a combination of reducing support incidents, easiest on-boarding, and trying to push some corporate strategic objective summed up as keep the average user happy enough to stick around and possibly give us more money.<p>Any app I install on said OS, may want to access this information but without all the permissions explainers I have no idea what it’s going to want or why.<p>Again, I assume the OS has access to all of this because it’s the OS it either needs it  or is the manager of the info and access broker.<p>To sum up my thought, I guess I agree that there’s a double standard but disagree that it’s necessarily bad or shady- but that’s because I already had a double standard in mind when I think about OS vs App.<p>Specific to ad-tracking and Apple: I have no proof for my belief but I believe Apple who primarily wants to sell me hardware and has made public acknowledgements of the importance of privacy, including making noticeable improvements to their OS, is significantly less likely to abuse my privacy than any other OS vendor out there.<p>I’m not saying this as a whataboutism, I just base it on my perceptions given all the things you just flat out can’t turn off in Win10 and that Google literally makes their money off of getting ads to your eyeballs and Android’s permissions are a dumpster fire nightmare for privacy.<p>I feel (again, no real proof) that the Apple eco-system is providing me the best _mainstream and low-effort_ steps to privacy protection vs the others, but I concede that it’s probably not good enough in many ways.')
