But I have seen a couple of instances where this is not followed and the developer chooses to use the entire state object passed to the component. This was fixed quickly and all developers got a short doc on the do&#x27;s and dont&#x27;s of Redux. This is what I mean by the extra work around redux library and not the concept itself.<p>Also its a fairly common to see developers pushing multiple micro updates like keystrokes to redux making it slow down. This gets filtered in the reviews but it misses out sometimes. I&#x27;m guessing this to happen in many other projects too unless I&#x27;m missing out on some major update on the tooling around redux.<p>These problems are not because of the approach but in the implementations. I hope you get what I mean by cost in my opinion above.')
