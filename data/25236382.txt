If you ever work in big companies you will know that.<p>&gt; Adults shouldn&#x27;t have their employer telling them that sexual harassment is a no no.<p>Yes they do,<p>Assuming you are a male, you might be unknowingly harrasing female employees just by having a boys will be boys attitude.  So an employer has to give you training and explain you why its wrong.<p>Some people use throwaway accounts to harass other employees on social media, if your employer gave you the training you would have learnt that is wrong.<p>&gt; The policy is the law.<p>Exactly, now you get it, the company may get into legal trouble if they dont have an official policy or they make it super difficult to report complaints.<p>&gt; The responsible thing is to involve the authorities when one of your employees is committing a crime. Simple as that.<p>No its not simple as that, just telling the victim to go to authorities is just washing your hands, a responsible company also makes sure that victims can file a complaint with the management. Not all victims want to file a police complaint, that does not mean they the abuser should get away with harassment. The company should still investigate and fire the abuser and then file a complaint with the victim&#x27;s permission.<p>These are some of the aspects which you will understand if you  been through some training.')
