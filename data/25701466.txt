You could opt into having &quot;packed&quot; structs with  #pragma pack and avoid the runtime error by compiling all the code with --misalign.<p>As I recall, this had a performance penalty since memory reads&#x2F;writes are now byte-by-byte. Also it could make code which assumed atomic reads&#x2F;writes of 32 bit quantities go awry.')
