Insurers are only liable for an amount more than that, which the average home is unlikely to exceed given our building standards.<p>If your home is not insured (with a private insurer) the government says they will not help you financially after an earthquake.<p>California could do the same, but I suspect there would be protests from people living in low fire zones, while here in NZ pretty much everywhere is at risk of earthquakes.')
