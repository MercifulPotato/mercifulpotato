While still used extensively in lab&#x2F;specialist environments, this large coaxial connector isn’t something the average ‘tech dude’ is likely to encounter these days.<p>Any ‘tech dude’ that’s also a HAM or anyone who’s done work with other radios definitively will disagree that N connectors are only used in labs. I have quite a bit of “consumer grade” gear that uses that connector even (cell signal boosters and Wi-Fi antennas as two examples).')
