As long as you fix it in the release build, not the debug build.<p>If you have a computer fast enough to do a release build quickly, it’s probably also fast enough to hide performance problems with the release build.<p>There are other approaches that can work, like building in the cloud so you don’t need a huge fast PC for each developer, or doing partially-optimized builds that balance build time with runtime (and debuggability).')
