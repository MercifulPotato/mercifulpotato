Sure, Teslas and Porsches and Jaguars are, but you can also get a late-model used Nissan Leaf for under 10k, or a brand new Kia Niro for ~30k after tax credit. That&#x27;s well within the bell curve of what people spend on ICE cars, used or not. A Leaf might not meet your needs, but it&#x27;s not like there aren&#x27;t other options out there. If you factor in longer-term costs like fuel cost, maintenance, and wear-and-tear, the equation tilts even further towards EV.<p>Not to say they shouldn&#x27;t be cheaper, but they&#x27;ll definitely get there. We&#x27;re pretty close to price-parity as is (just not tons of options).')
