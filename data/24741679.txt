Not really because of any bad experiences, though reports about the high number of counterfeit goods that Amazon sells certainly contributes to my reluctance. Also: Amazon is just too big. I like a bit of competition in the market.<p>Also, in Netherland, Amazon isn&#x27;t all that big. In the distant past, I sometimes ordered at amazon.com, later at amazon.de. Recently I got an invitation to amazon.nl which apparently just opened, but I really don&#x27;t see the point. Netherland already had a couple of big online retailers: bol.com and coolbue. They&#x27;re good, fast, reliable. I don&#x27;t need Amazon anymore.')
