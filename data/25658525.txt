If you are air gapped and really need accurate time, you at least have to deal with leap seconds.  Even if a one-second error doesn’t bother you, there’s an entire two-hour interval when DST ends in which the local time is ambiguous.  Or do these systems try to do the right thing by distinguishing 2:30 AM PST from 2:30 AM PDT?')
