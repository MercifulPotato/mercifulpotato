It takes tangible time for signals to travel between neurons. When you&#x27;re young, you&#x27;re small, and the distances are shorter. As you age, you grow in size, and the signal length grows also. Thus as you grow you literally think slower; though hopefully, more effectively (wisdom). Your perception of time changes accordingly.')
