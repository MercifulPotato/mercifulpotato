But countries&#x27; fortunes have shifted back and forth over time, those who seemed to be doing worse than everyone reversed course, and vice versa. There are exceptions, Vietnam appears to be one.<p>My thought on Sweden was not so much &quot;wait until the fall&quot;, but to note that even though they didn&#x27;t shut down, the economic impact was broadly similar to that of neighboring counties who did.<p>So from my view this all seems very &quot;pick your poison&quot;. I suspect the correlations we keep implying between shutdowns and the economy may actually have more to do with the fact of the pandemic itself. I don&#x27;t care if the movie theaters are shut down or not, I&#x27;m not going to one.')
