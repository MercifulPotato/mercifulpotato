I can&#x27;t believe that we&#x27;re going to get nothing done for another 4 years because Biden believes in a weaker executive branch.<p>Personally, I think the president has far too much power (especially in war-powers), but Biden will need to deploy a ton of executive orders to get anything done with the legislative branch he&#x27;s about to get - and he won&#x27;t do it because he (along with his party and Obama) believe in fair-play, norms and institutions. The issue is that their opponents don&#x27;t.<p>Republicans will win back the house in 2024 in no small part due to Biden being precieved as having done nothing due to his reluctance to use executive orders to legislate from the oval office like his predecessor did.')
