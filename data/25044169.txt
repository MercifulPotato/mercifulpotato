Most of my working copies have at least half a dozen old stashes that I don&#x27;t remember any details about anymore.<p>One approach to avoid this mess that git stash can lead to is to never use it, and just commit all your work before switching to a different branch. Clean up the current state of the repo, try to document your changes in the commit message, and commit them. Then switch branches.<p>You can always squash or rewrite the commits later, and it&#x27;s a lot easier rebasing or merging a few old commits than working with stashes.<p>If you like stashes, please use them!<p>But I agree with the author, using them a lot can lead to a mess, and temporary branches are usually a cleaner way of saving your work.')
