GTP-3 and Tesla FSD are examples of this.<p>I agree with this. As an anecdote, I&#x27;ve spent the past decade explaining to clients that things like natural language question answering and abstractive summarization are impossible, and now we have OpenAI and others dropping pretrained models like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;openai&#x2F;summarize-from-feedback" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;openai&#x2F;summarize-from-feedback</a> that turn all those assumptions on their head. There are caveats, of course, but I&#x27;ve gone from a deep learning skeptic (I started my career with &quot;traditional&quot; ML and NLP) to believing that these sorts of techniques are truly revolutionary and we are only yet scratching the surface of what&#x27;s possible with them.')
