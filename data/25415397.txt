I definitely understand - I&#x27;m on the &quot;unorganized and chaotic&quot; end of the scale. That is, I desperately <i>try</i> to get myself organized. I have been, for almost two decades now. I&#x27;ve started with GTD, done it numerous times, and went through pretty much anything I could find on-line. What always happened is as you describe: it &quot;doesn&#x27;t matter how beautiful the system is, (...) - a couple of months later it will lie abandoned and forgotten&quot;.<p>But! Every now and then, something from one of these systems will stick for longer. Perhaps a technique, or vocabulary, or a piece of tooling. Over time, it coalesces into this chaotic, very idiosyncratic organizational system that kind of works for you. I&#x27;m definitely much more productive today than I was those two decades ago.')
