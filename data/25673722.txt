If your views are against the general views held by the members of that space, you have to choose your words more carefully and present your opinions more diplomatically than if you were in your own space or a space that is at least more in agreement with you.<p>This really shouldn&#x27;t come as a surprise to anyone. Not everyone is equally welcome everywhere. Different owners&#x2F;moderators set different limits, often based on precious situations, which you may not be aware of.<p>Specifically the argument of doing things that a lot of people consider irresponsible, even if they are not disallowed, is a very sore subject with a lot of people during this pandemic. Authorities in a lot of countries have been way too lax in imposing lockdowns and restrictions, leading to much higher numbers of infected and dead than would otherwise have occurred in the same amount of time.<p>Odds are that the travel subreddit you mention has seen a lot of people arguing that if there is no travel ban, they should be free to travel wherever they want and however they want, which really rubs a lot of people the wrong way, especially those who have lost loved ones and consider such behavior highly irresponsible. Odds are also that the moderators previously made an announcement or even rule changes prohibiting those sorts of discussions, because of how they rile people up.<p>In the eyes of the moderator, you transgressed the rules of the subreddit, so they firmly showed you the door. I make no judgment on whether whatever you posted was morally reprehensible, what matters is that the proprietor of that particular space found it so.<p>Reddit is a collection of many little kingdoms. Some of them have kings that just don&#x27;t like you, for whatever reason. That&#x27;s their prerogative and there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it, except maybe creating a rival subreddit that potentially becomes more popular.')
