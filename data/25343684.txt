It looks like Adm Prakash whacked them both.<p>Story is amusing, though. Really sells the chaos of that war. The writer&#x27;s wingman nearly clips him in the fog when they&#x27;re landing at their home base to prep for the attack. Then on the attack he blasts a water tower, puts a few rounds in a camo&#x27;d C-130, and then knocks out this random Beechcraft.')
