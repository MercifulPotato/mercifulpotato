Quite the opposite, really. It&#x27;s well-structured, and <i>incredibly</i> well-documented.<p>It&#x27;s because I tend to do some fairly ambitious things, and write in a modular, layered fashion that can distribute functionality throughout the stack.<p>I also tend to write in a fairly asynchronous fashion (would you call it &quot;reactive&quot;? I dunno. I&#x27;ve been writing code like that since long before &quot;reactive&quot; was an official buzzword).<p>Can be hard to grok.')
