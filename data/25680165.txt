Started with pure ES6, Preact, and htm templates - no transpilation step!  As the project got bigger I migrated to Typescript and start using it&#x27;s built-in JSX compiler.  Was a pretty easy step.  My only package dependencies for a long time were preact and preact-router.  Recently moved to webpack to support proper packaging of node modules when I moved from REST to GraphQL.  But no babel, and it&#x27;s been really nice to slowly increment the build complexity only when it&#x27;s been needed.')
