Let&#x27;s not forget that they did put out press releases (that are still up btw [0] [1]) falsely claiming that &quot;Officials were on site to verify all world record criteria was met -- including review of Dewetron GPS measurements&quot; which then prompted Dewetron themselves to distance themselves and post several comments and their own statements denying that claim [2].<p>Only when evidence and press&#x2F;public attention started increasing did SSC then miraculously also started finding inconsistencies in the videos, etc etc. But at this point, their only options were to either admit to their wrongdoing or go along and side with the people that, by this time, already had pretty damning reports and proofs that the evidence for the &quot;record&quot; was very sketchy. If you haven&#x27;t seen, you should check out Shmee150&#x27;s video [3]<p>So, to me this was either purposely done for attention&#x2F;press or the SSC people were really incompetent at trying to break this kind of record without proper measurement tools and official&#x2F;independent reviewers. Something like this should, imho, be done as professionally and with as much redundancy as possible before any wild claim is made and press releases issued. It should never have come to a point where a few car enthusiasts on youtube can, from just a video and basic math&#x2F;physics and knowing your own car parts, figure out that your record claims are false or at least very inaccurate. It has never happened when Bugatti or Koenigsegg broke the records. But now, if you search for &quot;fastest production car&quot; on Google, you get a whole lot of SSC results so, in a way, I guess they have succeeded.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sscnorthamerica.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;ssc-tuatara-hypercar-earns-worlds-fastest-production-vehicle-title" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sscnorthamerica.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;ssc-tuatara-hypercar-ea...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sscnorthamerica.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;dewetron-validates-ssc-tuatara-record-top-speed" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sscnorthamerica.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;dewetron-validates-ssc-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.autodevot.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;Dewetron-SSC-Tuatara-Press-Release-October-28.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.autodevot.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;Dewetro...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;nPXXGTuQKbk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;nPXXGTuQKbk</a>')
