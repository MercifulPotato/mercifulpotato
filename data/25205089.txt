Every day, they would report that it rose (in the east), grew higher in the sky, and eventually set (in the west). Periodically there would be analysis pieces that took a longer view, and noted how when the weather was warmer, the sun rose to a higher position in the sky, and that when it was colder, the rise point was a little more to the south.<p>After a year or two of this, by the metrics of TFA, this coverage would contain essentially zero information (at least for anyone who had followed said coverage for a while).<p>And yet ... every single part of it would be true, and there would be no other &quot;sides&quot; to consider. For most humans, the knowledge that the sun behaves in this way is of some importance, though less so in a modern industrialized society.<p>So ... the question is not about how much information there is &quot;today&#x27;s media&quot;. It&#x27;s about whether or not what the media contains is true and whether or not it is important (which might often be synonym for &quot;useful&quot;).')
