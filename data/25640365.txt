They straight up tell you that your whole concept isn&#x27;t allowed to exist on the app store. I think I&#x27;ve seen a couple of stories about this a while ago. Or if there&#x27;s any semblance of UGC, you&#x27;re supposed to have a moderation team that would enforce Apple&#x27;s ridiculous policies. Oh you&#x27;re an individual and don&#x27;t intend to turn that into a company? Tough luck, sorry.')
