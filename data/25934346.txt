The programming ones are a mixed bag. But others are worse. I was browsing recently a medical subreddit which was a support forum for a certain class of diseases, and people were using codewords to refer to banned names of various medical problems, to avoid having their posts deleted. It was ridiculous.<p>For programming&#x2F;tech related topics, I no longer use reddit these days, instead just read HN and some blogs. The community is nicer here.')
