Writes can be lost if the primary dies and a secondary is promoted before data from primary has been replicated to it.<p>Is this any different than how things work in eg Postgres?<p>&gt; 2. The whole point of adding secondaries — again, the &quot;webscale!&quot; argument — is to scale read capacities<p>The main driver behind secondaries is redundancy&#x2F;durability. If the primary goes down, there&#x27;s no&#x2F;very little overall service interruption.<p>If you need the latest data, read from the primary. If you care more about faster reads than perfect data accuracy, read from a secondary.')
