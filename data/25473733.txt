Initial implementation was easy and quick to iterate. After a few years when it was evident that it was not sustainable. Two years of painfull effort was required to squeeze out MongoDB.<p><pre><code>  are you doing frontend development (or something similar where fast paced change means new technology, new best practices etc. all the time) = unkind\n</code></pre>\nReact already won, front-end tech is stable in last 4 years. It is an easier part of my job. Front-end development require high upfront learning, but it is boring at some point.<p><pre><code>  are you doing text processing analysis of structured data following well understood schemas = kind\n</code></pre>\nI know some pipelines on structured data that are hell. I worked with XML (FpML) and systems that produced&#x2F;consume these, It would make most people cry. It is very easy to create massive technical debt where data is flowing. Any change needs to be done from both ends. It is not like front-end where I can refactor components as much I want.<p>Because programming is such diverse field, I would be careful with labeling anything kind&#x2F;unkind.')
