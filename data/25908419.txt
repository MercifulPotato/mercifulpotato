Item(by='gamblor956', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611606900, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25907711, text='Yes, all made up.<p>First paragraph: simply made up by Ramsland, by basically treating all the times a ballot was entered incorrectly (such as upside down) as a vote requiring adjudication.<p>Second paragraph: False. The person in charge of updating the system...was a Republican. Also, the voting machines <i>were</i> in compliance with federal voting system standards. The machine that was not updated prior to the election was the computer that the voting machines connected to, which was updated after the election during vote tabulation. (A hand recount of the paper receipts printed on Election Day confirmed the post-update count.)<p>Third paragraph: Also fiction, and quite literally contradicts your first paragraph. (They can&#x27;t both possibly be true; either the adjudication logs were there and there were a lot of adjudicated votes, or they weren&#x27;t, and the first paragraph is made up.) Also, the machines were audited after the election...by Republicans.<p>On a further note, neither NASA or MIT has any record of Ramsland or any of his companies, doing any work for them as he claims (and which forms the basis of his supposed technical expertise).')
