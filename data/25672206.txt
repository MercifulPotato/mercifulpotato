Expecting a course to facilitate that is flawed. I&#x27;d be all for increasing the roles of internships in CS education in order to accomplish that -- and I have noticed that&#x27;s begun to happen as well. CS majors these days have internships lined for summer and winter if not more (especially due to COVID). I am sure they&#x27;ll learn a lot more than I did during that era of my life just by sheer osmosis.')
