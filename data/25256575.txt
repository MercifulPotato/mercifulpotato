One of the biggest applications of ML to science that I know of for sure. People used to manually crystallize proteins at great effort to solve for structures.<p>Of course, there is a caveat. The static, crystallized structure is only one aspect of a protein. The dynamic behavior dissolved in H2O, at different pH, different ionic strength, with different ligands&#x2F;cofactors are all also important, and not (afaik) directly addressed by this research.')
