You&#x27;re reading words that we didn&#x27;t use. And I didn&#x27;t say there&#x27;s anything wrong with socialism - I didn&#x27;t even mention it! I live in a country with many socialist policies such as socialised healthcare. It&#x27;s almost universally supported here. But I don&#x27;t think most people here would want to try to force everyone to be more-or-less equal.')
