They can achieve this responsibility through, for instance, basic income, unemployment benefits or a social safety net.<p>The moral responsibility of a state is not to make people work at all costs. It&#x27;s to look after its citizens and to your point make sure they don&#x27;t die. Americans tend to conflate the two but they are distinct.<p>Combining the two creates a weird world where the state needs to stay out of the way of individuals getting any job at all no matter how bad or underpaid, and that&#x27;s not really the mission statement.<p>If you&#x27;re talking about &quot;killing people&quot; because of drunk driving, I would suggest that there are plenty of other ways for folks to get home, between public transit, a designated driver, or yes, a taxi. I enjoy drinking as much as the next guy, but not having Uber isn&#x27;t going to cause me to die. At some point personal responsibility comes in to play when the goal is to optimize for the greater good. I do think having Uber or Lyft is strictly better.')
