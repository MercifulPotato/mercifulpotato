Even if the game had no bugs, it&#x27;s nothing like what it was presented to be. And no, not by the &#x27;fanboys&#x27; but by CDPR themselves.<p>I&#x27;d probably have bought the game on discount if I knew it was, much like Witcher 3, a mediocre game in most ways other than visuals, and in some ways actually a step down from their previous title.<p>But I bought this one on preorder because it was presented as not just &#x27;The Witcher 3, but Cyberpunk and wonkier in most ways&#x27;, but a game that would do an open world well, and so much more.<p>Normally I don&#x27;t preorder games, but I gave CDPR the benefit of the doubt. The fact that Sony, of all companies, is actually offering refunds, should make it clear that this game is terrible. It&#x27;s fine that you enjoy it, but why try to argue it&#x27;s all &#x27;blown out of proportion&#x27; or that &#x27;fanboys expected too much&#x27;. Can&#x27;t you just enjoy the game without needing validation?')
