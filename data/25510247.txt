Item(by='kaitai', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608666102, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25508981, text='As other commenters have pointed out, it&#x27;s generally defined in the first days of the course.<p>Speaking from my former job as &quot;professor&quot;, the problem with cheating is that students are not benefitting from the work of others. They think they are, because they think the product of the class is a grade. But I taught math. This point of view is only successful if one can maintain the cheating throughout all classes and then one&#x27;s job, which is an awful lot of work and in fact even harder than just learning the d(*&amp; math.<p>From my point of view, I tried to use psychology to &quot;trick&quot; students into learning when they were inclined to cheat -- making the process of iteration into something worth points (you don&#x27;t show me an imperfect MVP and then improve it? you don&#x27;t get points), making acknowledgement of collaboration and outside sources into something worth points, etc. I also provided old copies of all my exams going back several years, some with answers, because I wanted all students to have an equal playing field. Last, I always included a question or two very similar to&#x2F;identical to a question on a previous exam or homework. You might think this is just bad teaching, but it was actually a quite useful tool: since I telegraphed it beforehand, students actually studied the old tests&#x2F;homework, thereby accidentally learning something, and then when a surprising number of students did terribly on something word-by-word from a previous test, we got to talk about effective learning techniques.<p>Cheating is relatively predictable in character. Use the impulses and mechanisms gently against reluctant students to trick them into learning despite themselves. It&#x27;s way more fun than the alternative.')
