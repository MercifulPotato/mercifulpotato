I&#x27;m basing that off the paragraph after the table, which says:<p>&gt; AMDâ€™s EPYC 7742 which still comes in at $6950<p>A couple quick searches (Amazon, Newegg) show people selling the CPU-only for this price. Since that&#x27;s the price they&#x27;re comparing to the table, I think the table prices are for the ARM CPU only.')
