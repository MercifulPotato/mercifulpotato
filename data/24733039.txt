What kind of &quot;wood weapon&quot; are you speaking of? Are you speaking in the context of some &quot;dojo&quot; or some style of martial art?<p>One problem with dojo drills is that the opponent must &quot;hold back&quot; due to possibility of injury. Also, in a dojo, only one style (e.g., use of the rapier) is usually being taught: not unsurprisingly all other styles somehow fail to measure up. There are many reasons for this: unskilled users, absence of in-house expert (&quot;sensei&quot;, &quot;master&quot;, etc.) in the  opposing style, the power of suggestion.<p>Don&#x27;t confuse choreographed drills in a dojo with a real fight&#x2F;battle. Some dojos sell the belief that their weapon of choice (longsword, rapier, long staff, Klingon Bat&#x27;Leth, short staff, firearm, knife, bare hands, etc.) is the &quot;one and true&quot; weapon that will protect you against all comers. But  they&#x27;can&#x27;t all be dominant in all situations and that is part of what Silvers&#x27; &quot;Paradoxes of Defense&quot; says.<p>In a real fight the pole cracks skulls, breaks legs and arms and is thrust into mouths, noses, eyes and necks before an opponent&#x27;s blade can reach the poler. A &quot;stick&quot;, as you call it, can be as long but is likely quicker than the sword, cannot be easily damaged by the sword and as Silvers summarizes, is superior in battle.<p>Pictures of men wearing gambesons show  exposed faces and limbs. The gambeson likely lowers mobility (and might be uncomfortably warm). It resembles a bulletproof vest, most which spend their time in the closet. And, as you may know, a man with a knife can make short work of a man in or out of a bulletproof vest (there are gaps).')
