Don’t forget that business is ultimately just selling a solution to a problem. This is very simplified but my thoughts: Find an interesting niche domain or area of interest, dive deeply and learn about the problems and challenges, find vendors and individuals in that domain and talk to them about their problems, research some solutions, create landing pages and validate some of the ideas and solutions you come up with, get a nice customer pipeline who will pay you real money for a solution, build the solution and ship the solution, profit off that solution.')
