I prefer to flesh out ideas by kicking them around with others, and this is has suffered significantly. I&#x27;ve noticed a real lack of engagement in online communication at work, by others and by me. Personally, I&#x27;m bored of online communication having used email since the 90s and seeing it degrade into an ad-hoc workflow mismanagement tool. I suspect others are weary of opening their emails in the morning, too. The surge in online communication due to covid actually makes me more weary, and the dwindling engagement I see in Zoom, Teams etc suggests to me a similar creeping dissatisfaction. When it&#x27;s feasible, I plan to ditch email other than transactional necessities, and conduct all work interaction by phone or in person. Webcam feels unnatural to me, it&#x27;s more like being on show than being in a conversation.')
