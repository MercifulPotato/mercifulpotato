First, you&#x27;re wrong about the current biometric systems&#x27; sensor design — Touch ID and Face ID are not simple single frame cameras[1] so while spoofing is not impossible it&#x27;s nowhere near as easy as you&#x27;re claiming — and, more importantly, you&#x27;re missing that the biometric is used to authenticate to the local device, not the remote service. If someone steals your phone, as soon as it&#x27;s removed from your account the attacker has no access or way to gain access to your resources <i>and</i> they also do not have a copy of your biometric data. If I do get a full biometric from you, I cannot use that to add a new key-pair to your account without already having fully compromised it.<p>That means that you&#x27;re left with really unusual situations like someone stalking you with drones with 3-D infrared scanners who can&#x27;t figure out how to have the same drone record your password when you type it in many times per day.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;HT204587" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;HT204587</a> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;HT208108" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.apple.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;HT208108</a>')
