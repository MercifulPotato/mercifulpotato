You can get a 20 year 737 for a lot less than 200mil, and is probably closer to the average.<p>If your point is that MRIs less than 3T exist, I agree. If your point is that cheaper MRI exist, I agree. If your point is that nobody has spent 3 mil on a CT, then I disagree. A link showing the price of used machines 10-15 years old isnâ€™t going to change that.')
