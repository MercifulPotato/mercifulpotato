That overhead doesn&#x27;t scale linearly with the employee&#x27;s working hours. I don&#x27;t think that this is the primary reason for not getting responses though. Why would a company do it? And why would they listen to a random person who contacted them? Did you just sent out an email to random contact@company.com address? Do you understand how this looks to anyone who receives that kind of communication? I suspect that you&#x27;re missing a lot of knowledge about the internal power structure in each company which is necessary to make a real change. And there need to be a lot of strong incentives for any big change to happen.<p>If a year ago, you sent every software company in the world an email asking them to move to remote work, I suspect that you would change 0 minds too. The incentive from the pandemic had to be &quot;work remotely or not at all&quot; for many companies&#x27; power structures to open up to the idea.')
