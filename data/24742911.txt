Nevertheless, it was the first time in about 2 years that I&#x27;d run into this kind of pain with Arch. Mostly the OS has been rock solid and out of the way, and I enjoy being able to dive deep when needed. I&#x27;d given linux a try every few years since 2001. Arch was the first distro that stuck for me. It&#x27;s like the OS equivalent of writing a library from scratch vs plugging into someone else&#x27;s framework. It&#x27;s hard to imagine going back at this point.')
