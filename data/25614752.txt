These are not really parking spots anymore.  They are &quot;charging bays&quot;.  That&#x27;s cool.  Just remember not to park your electric car there with a full battery.  I guess if your battery is full, by the time you drive around a while looking for another spot it will be low enough that you will be allowed to use the bay.<p>The few times I&#x27;ve tried to charge an EV at a public non-tesla charging point, it has been a real hassle.  The multitude of protocols mean that sometimes it just doesn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;d be very not happy if that meant I would then have to find another spot.<p>Perhaps there is a market for a defeat device, a plug that simulates an electric car, like those HDMI&#x2F;VGA simulators used to trick motherboards into thinking they are attached to a screen.  It probably wouldn&#x27;t need much of a resistor to simulate minimal charging rates.')
