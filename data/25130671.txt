Are there actual past articles and literature that conflates the two when speaking of fossil fuels? Setting the bar too high for renewables would be a big fallacy, but where has that happened exactly? It&#x27;ll be cool to look back at old articles and twitter posts and spot this conflation or at least to ask for clarification.')
