As you&#x27;d expect, they had large screens in the atrium so you could watch CNN while you ate or shopped. It was a nice convenience. Over time the tone of what they presented changed drastically and I couldn&#x27;t stand to listen to it even long enough to eat. Though the content also had declined in quality, it was the tone, the non-stop outrage and anger being presented that made me start eating at Peachtree Center instead. It really was vile and I can&#x27;t see why anyone would want to pump that into their home and into their brains. It wasn&#x27;t always that way.')
