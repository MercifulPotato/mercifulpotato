Of course, that is a lot of problems, including many useful things that biological intelligence appears to solve.<p>But it is true that ML - in particular neural networks - often gets thrown at problems that traditional analysis and modeling could serve more efficiently, and also more predictably.  The other benefit of first trying traditional analysis is that it helps the implementer of the system better understand the domain first.<p>Pertinently, I&#x27;ve heard some scientists working on medical imaging describe to me how there has been a trend away from the basic science of understanding the medical phenomena behind the image being analyzed and instead relying excessively on ML based pattern recognition to make predictions&#x2F;inferences.')
