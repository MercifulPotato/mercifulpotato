I think you <i>could</i> have a JS-based editor that approaches or achieves what emacs offers, but I haven&#x27;t encountered it. One useful thing about emacs and elisp is that lisp is one of the primary modes of interaction for users, whereas (IME) many JS-based editors seem to hide JavaScript from you to some extent.<p>Not in the sense that it&#x27;s not there, or that there&#x27;s a second language that the JS interprets. But when you open emacs without specifying a file to open you are dropped into a buffer called *scratch* which lets you directly execute elisp code. It really is a central part of the experience of using emacs. Similarly, your configuration file(s) are written in elisp, versus often a subset of JavaScript (perhaps JSON) used in JavaScript-based editors. And you&#x27;re not just supplying configuration <i>data</i>, but <i>extending</i> the program.<p>And then there&#x27;s completeness. While emacs has parts written in C, that portion really exists to enable elisp. Essentially every capability of the editor is directly reachable through lisp. The same doesn&#x27;t seem (or at least feel) true of JavaScript-based editors I&#x27;ve tried. In those, it often feels more like the creators have selected a portion of the internals to expose to users, but it&#x27;s more the minimal amount needed rather than the maximal amount possible that emacs strives for.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;ve finally figured out how to insert an asterisk around a word on HN without needing spaces. Is this documented anywhere? Just use double asterisks on either end like<p><pre><code>  **foo**\n</code></pre>\n*foo*<p>Turns out this is in the FAQ, it&#x27;s been a while since I looked at the formatting part of that so I guess it changed since 10 years or so ago or I&#x27;d forgotten.')
