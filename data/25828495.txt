I am looking for a service, or even a GitHub repo which we can host ourselves where our documentation team can put up technical documentation.<p>In addition to product docs, we also want to create a learning center about real-estate (which is the industry we are in)<p>Ideal requirements are\n- Ability to write content in markdown\n- Display articles by category\n- show TOC inside an article\n- Follow good SEO practices<p>I have looked at Zendesk, which is expensive. Also looked at Crisp (which is a messenger and but also has Helpdesk). The problem with Crisp is that the articles are kind of locked in their platform.<p>(I am not associated with either of those companies)<p>What do you guys use?')
