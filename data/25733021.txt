Fear that &quot;evil democrats&quot; and &quot;the left&quot; are out to &quot;destroy democracy&quot; by subverting the election that he &quot;won&quot;.<p>Then on the day Congress was supposed to confirm the result they organised a rally of the people they&#x27;d stirred up and spent hours telling that they needed to &quot;fight&quot;. The closest thing to a direct order was Giuliani during that rally:<p>&gt; “Over the next ten days, we get to see the machines that are crooked, the ballots that are fraudulent, and if we&#x27;re wrong, we will be made fools of. But if we&#x27;re right, a lot of them will go to jail.” Mr Giuliani then suddenly yelled: &quot;Let&#x27;s have trial by combat!&quot; to lacklustre cheers from the crowd.[1]<p>Despite the apparently lacklustre response, Trump then went on to direct the mob towards the Capitol where we all know what happened.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;americas&#x2F;us-election-2020&#x2F;rudy-giuliani-dc-trump-rally-b1783428.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;americas&#x2F;us-electio...</a>')
