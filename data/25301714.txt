The resultant film wasn’t what he envisioned, as Whedon took over. He’s back and wants to finish making his film the way he wanted it.<p>GoT is exactly what D&amp;D envisioned. The fans didn’t like it, but it’s their vision, and they DGAF what anyone else thinks. We might not like that outcome as viewers, but should respect the artistry all the same.<p>PS: the cast of justice league didn’t dedicate 8 years of their life to making that film like the cast of GoT did. They’re understandably done and moving forward, not looking back.')
