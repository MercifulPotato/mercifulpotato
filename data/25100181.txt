In my corridor, there are 2 motion detectors and they switch those lights. At night less bright; That works flawless!<p>And that shows how nice it actually can be if it works.<p>I also use alexa quite often to switch between light settings; From Eating to watching TV to &#x27;energize&#x27; where all lights on at 100%.<p>and it gets more interesting after i hooked up alexa to our blindes. I wanted to control them with a schedule anyway and now i can also use it thourgh alexa.<p>Honestly, i think alexa is a very interesting playground on how modern&#x2F;future user interface might&#x2F;will look like as it feels much more direct, nicer etc.<p>Heating is also quite interesting: Make sure to only heat in winter when the outdoor temperature is cold enough. Alert when co2 is to high in a room. Sync up the work schedule of my wife to heat the bath room at 4 in the morning for an hour.<p>What is the problem? The Problem is still complexity, cost and reliability. But this will become better every single day.')
