In this case, author merging is a capability that only folks who have been added to our Librarians usergroup can access because the process of reverting an accidental merge is quite time consuming (and so we have some training in place).<p>If you tweet @ our lead community librarian (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;seabelis" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;seabelis</a>) she can likely help you make this fix! Also, if you&#x27;re interested in helping us make changes like this, we can invite you to our slack channel :)')
