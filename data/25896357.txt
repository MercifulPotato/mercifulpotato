It looks like this man has no idea what the free software spirit is. I mean, he definitely hasn&#x27;t, as he&#x27;s talking about &quot;exit valueâ€œ. Still, he&#x27;s writing that with HTML, using SSL and TCP, on a PHP website probably running on Nginx or Apache on a Linux server with a postgresql database... Opensource is what allows him to talk to people or even create his business he is so proud of that he gives advices to everybody, yet he encourages everyone to not join the game. If open source has some problem, it&#x27;s certainly because of people like him.')
