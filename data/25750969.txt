There are plenty of work arounds if you get used to not having generics in the language. The fast compile times of Go are amazing. I was doing some Kotlin a few weeks ago and the difference is crazy. Go: Install deps, compile everything done in 5s. Doing the same in Kotlin, laptop freezes, android studio freeze, time to get a coffee :)<p>That being said it would be really nice to have some reusable map type structures that handle GC better than the default maps. Fingers crossed.')
