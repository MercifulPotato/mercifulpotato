CUDA and OpenCL developers write  scalar code that is implicitly parallelized by compiler and  hardware. On  Intel  GPUs, however, this  abstraction has profound performance  implications as the underlying ISA is SIMD and important hardware capabilities cannot be  fully utilized<p>What? That makes no sense.<p>GPU processor cores are basically just SIMD with a different color hat. The SASS assebly simply has _only_ SIMD instructions - and with the full instrunction set being SIMD&#x27;ized, it can drop the mention of &quot;this is SIMD&quot; and just pretend individual lanes are instruction-locked threads .<p>So, an OpenCL compiler would do very similar parallelization on a GPU and on an Intel CPU. (It&#x27;s obviously not exactly the same since the instruction sets do differ, and the widths are not the same, and Intel CPUs has different widths which could all act at the same time etc.)<p>So, the hardware capabilities can be utilized just fine.')
