Item(by='cyphar', descendants=None, kids=[25323602], score=None, time=1607245765, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25322125, text='&gt; Some rumors from the Moderna vaccine indicated that people got swelling the size of a softball on their arm, and it was rock hard. This does not sound like a vaccine that I want to take.<p>Muscle soreness, minor fever, and minor swelling (as someone who had immunotherapy -- the swelling you describe really is minor) are pretty common side effects of most vaccines[1]. And of course, your example is just anecdotal evidence.<p>These kinds of side-effects really aren&#x27;t new at all, and I&#x27;d be surprised if anyone whose had regular vaccines hasn&#x27;t encountered them at least once. It&#x27;s just your body&#x27;s immune response, and it&#x27;s effectively an indication that the vaccine is triggering the desired immune response.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccines&#x2F;vac-gen&#x2F;side-effects.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccines&#x2F;vac-gen&#x2F;side-effects.htm</a>')
