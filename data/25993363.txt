We moved to BigQuery instead. But the interface kind of sucks.<p>Would love to get this up and running. A couple of questions:<p>1. Is it possible to setup outside of AWS&#x2F;GCP? I would like to set this up on a dedicated server.<p>2. If not - then do you have a pricing comparison page where you give some example figures? e.g. to ingest 1 billion log lines from Apache per month it will cost you roughly $X in AWS hosting fees and $Y per seat to use Opstrace')
