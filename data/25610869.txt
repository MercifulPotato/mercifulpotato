There are domains where visual programming prevails, like shader design in computer graphics. Visual programming is a spectrum: on one end you’re trading the raw power of textual languages for a visual abstraction, and on the other end you just have GUI apps. UI design and prototyping programs like Sketch are arguably visual programming environments, and you’d have a hard time convincing me that working in text would be more efficient.')
