The average would be quite a bit lower because many books are only rarely checked out.<p>One thing I dislike about library ebooks is how thin the selection is.  It should be trivial for the publisher to offer every ebook ever published.  It&#x27;s insane that they felt the need to port the concept of scarcity to the digital world.  ebooks should have something like the compulsory licensing system used for songs.')
