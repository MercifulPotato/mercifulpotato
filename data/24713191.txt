(The delta is not quite as strong in the European or Chinese markets, but it&#x27;s still there.)<p>Things that people like about EVs and Teslas specifically:\n1) The driving experience is very special.  Startling acceleration, single-pedal driving, near-silent low speed operation.  \n2) Operating costs are very low.  Next to no routine maintenance, inexpensive &quot;fuel&quot;.  \n3) Class-leading safety due to low CoG and lack of engine in the crumple zone.  \n4) Great software that is updated frequently over the air.\n5) Arguably the best proto-self-driving&#x2F;advanced driver assistance that gets better over time.  6) Hands down the best charging infrastructure and experience.<p>The build quality issues are real, but tend to be overblown by the media.  The looks, inside and out, are definitely polarizing.  I personally love the minimalism but would like better materials.  But it&#x27;s inarguably <i>different</i>, and for lots of people that&#x27;s exciting in and of itself.')
