The former (git-bug) allows decentralized issue management by storing the issues and conversations on separate git objects, while git-appraise allows the same but for code reviews and thus (I assume) pull&#x2F;merge requests.<p>IMO, both very nice projects that open-source devs might want to investigate in order to be independent of their code hosting platforms. Or even better, contribute or donate for their continued development. The current dependence on hosted issue + PR management is revealing its weaknesses.')
