Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604613753, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25002362, text='&gt; What this does is, it collects money from today&#x27;s FAANGs while disincentivizing future startups from starting here.<p>Does it? Startups probably start out with a fairly small Executive Pay Ratio because they start out without a lot of low-paid grunts, and its already not common for them to open satellite facilities or move HQs for grunt work when they scale out to more jobs where they aren&#x27;t trying to attract locally-concentrated elite talent. Because its triggered on the ratio between the highest paid managerial employee <i>anywere</i> in the firm and the median pay of employees <i>in the City</i>, it really just adds further incentives to do low-level gruntwork outside of the city, but doesn&#x27;t seem otherwise to really change the structural incentives much for startups.<p>OTOH, it <i>does</i> make it more expensive for any widespread organization whose headquarters and elite labor are elsewhere to operate a facility with mostly low-level labor in the City; a tech startup headquartered in the City might never be hit by it even as they scaled up if they are focussed on automation, as they might never have a low-paid workforce. OTOH, retail, etc., outlets, hotels, etc., of firms with highly-paid executives with their main executive and high-paid labor force outside of the city <i>would</i> be hit hard (as far as compared to other firms, I don&#x27;t think the tax rate is ever high enough to really be &quot;hit hard&quot;) by it on their operations in the City.')
