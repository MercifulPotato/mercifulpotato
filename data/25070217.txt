Famous guitarists that have bubbled under your nose? What about new guitarists?<p>What about them?<p>If I purchase music, it&#x27;s because I want to listen to that music.<p>Whether that&#x27;s Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Lari Basilio, Nick Johnston or anyone else, what business is it of yours (or anyone else, for that matter) how or where <i>I</i> listen to the music that I&#x27;ve purchased?<p>This is the first I&#x27;m hearing about Funk Whale and I fully intend to install it, as I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent self-hosted, streaming music server to listen to music owned by <i>me</i>.<p>It&#x27;s likely that it won&#x27;t meet my needs and I&#x27;ll move on to something else.<p>I suppose that just about any music streaming server <i>could</i> be used to take food out of the mouths of the starving children of musicians.<p>Rather than assuming (as it <i>appears</i> you are doing) that <i>everyone</i> who uses a self-hosted streaming server is engaged in stealing from musicians, please let us (me, especially) know what platform <i>you</i> would recommend as a personal streaming server.<p>I&#x27;d really appreciate any suggestions.  Thanks!')
