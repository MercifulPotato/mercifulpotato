Bugs that get fixed are sometimes done by domain knowledge holders on he base team, and those fixes are large fixes that get done on a different release schedule to mine. Its an utter waste of time for me to bug some guy in Seattle about something that he fixed months ago in a release that I haven&#x27;t received yet when I can see the fix version and change in jira, and either wait or take the fix from the upcoming release myself.')
