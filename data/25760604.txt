I hope you guys be peaceful if an argument is inevitable. This is only my view and it definitely is biased. I have never lived in a free country. If my visa gets approved this year, I will go to a graduate school to get my master degree in the USA this fall.<p>1.These kinds of systems have been used by the Chinese government for many years. Being tracked is not even a big deal in our lives. The big deal is that the communication applications(QQ, Wechat) are dominated by one company(Tencent) and I can calculate it out with my toe that they share every word I said, every picture I posted with the government. They work with the government and the government promises Tencent is the only one allowed to provide communication applications in China. I have been kicked out of chat groups many times since I said something inappropriate. My friends and family also warned me not to talk about those topics. Many people have been put in jail because of this. Tencent also invested companies outside China, like Reddit, Epic Games.<p>2. I saw Falun Gong mentioned in this thread. From what I know and experienced, Falun Gong is a dangerous cult. When I was in high school, one time I broke my leg and I had to go to see a doctor. On the road a woman approached me and tried to convince me that doctor is not helpful, Falun Gong would be better. They printed many pamphlets, throw them into your home at night, sometimes there would even be a disk. They print their slogan on cash. That was about ten years ago when I was in a small town. And they mostly activate in those small towns and try to recruit middle-aged women. I also noticed them running many websites and newsagents now in foreign countries, from what I see, most contents on their websites are much worse than FOX news. IMO, the gov have done some things wrong or even terrible when to expel it, but to expel it is not wrong. They are dangerous, you are warned.<p>3. People in Xinjiang are under suppression, but that is far from Fascism. There are movements pushed by the government to incorporate minorities. These movements are stronger than previous years recently, and sometimes they might even be forced. These movements, from different perspectives, would seem different. But to summarize, it&#x27;s like that the government says: just give up your religion and don&#x27;t fight against us, and we will make sure you have a comfortable life. What is included in this comfortable life is a small amount of subsidy every month, a job if you want, a small house, free college for the next generation. The minorities are at advantage points in society from my view, if they are willing to give up religious belief and obey(actually most minorities born after 90s do not hold religious beliefs anymore since these movements have been undertaken for many years). One of my roommates back in university is a minority, when the university calculates his score in GaoKao(SAT in the USA?), they have to add 20 to it. The total score is 750. Minorities in this society also have another advantage, from what I know, local governments do not have jurisdiction over minorities, which means, say, if I fight with one guy from Xinjiang, I would get in jail and he would be sent back to Xinjiang. Some guys from Xinjiang used to take advantage of this, they would put up a small stall to sell dessert, if you get close and ask them how much, they would cut a piece off and ask you to buy it, if you don&#x27;t buy, several other guys would approach and threaten you. Well, you can&#x27;t fight as I said, you have to pay some money. In recent years I heard fewer stories like this. Most guys from Xinjiang are OK, one restaurant nearby run by several people from Xinjiang have the best Kebab I have ever known.<p>links:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zh.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;%E6%B3%95%E8%BD%AE%E5%8A%9F#%E9%95%87%E5%8E%8B%E5%8E%9F%E5%9B%A0%E6%8E%A2%E8%AE%A8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zh.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;%E6%B3%95%E8%BD%AE%E5%8A%9F#%E...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zh.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;%E5%88%87%E7%B3%95%E5%85%9A" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zh.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;%E5%88%87%E7%B3%95%E5%85%9A</a><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.moe.gov.cn&#x2F;jyb_xwfb&#x2F;xw_zt&#x2F;moe_357&#x2F;jyzt_2020n&#x2F;2020_zt12&#x2F;baodao&#x2F;202006&#x2F;t20200616_466276.html#:~:text=%E4%B8%80%E6%98%AF%E7%83%88%E5%A3%AB%E5%AD%90%E5%A5%B3%EF%BC%8C%E5%A2%9E%E5%8A%A0,%E8%80%83%E7%94%9F%EF%BC%8C%E5%A2%9E%E5%8A%A010%E5%88%86%E6%8A%95%E6%A1%A3%E3%80%82" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.moe.gov.cn&#x2F;jyb_xwfb&#x2F;xw_zt&#x2F;moe_357&#x2F;jyzt_2020n&#x2F;2020...</a>')
