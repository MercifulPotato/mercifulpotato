With places like oshpark and JLPCB a few iterations on small boards luckily don&#x27;t break the bank anymore.<p>Go look at other people&#x27;s designs. If you&#x27;re doing something mildly interesting to others they might also be willing to help review your designs (user forums etc for the PCB design tool you are using can also be helpful for that)')
