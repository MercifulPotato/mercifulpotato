They did an accelerated aging test at 90°C and 85% RH, where most discs didn&#x27;t last a single test cycle (of 10 days), two discs lasted a single cycle, and only syylex lasted all 4 cycles.<p>Quote on a brand-name DVD<p>&gt; This  DVD  model  had  the  longest  lifetime  (i.e.  1500h)  at  80°C  and  85%  RH.  At  90°C,  it  is destroyed after the first cycle of 250 hours.<p>For an idea of what it does to the substrate:<p>&gt; [for measurement] DVDs have to be taken [out] .. To prevent the formation of water droplets in the polycarbonate, it is necessary to &quot;purify&quot; the polycarbonate from the water that was absorbed at high  temperature.<p>OTOH, I had CDs (Verbatim, upper middle class), of which about 1-2 of 50 had issues after 20 years storage (in dark, mostly room-temperature conditions).')
