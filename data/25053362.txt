What about the continued doubts by the NYT that there would soon be news about a working coronavirus vaccine at the end of October, early November? What about the Steele Dossier that is now known to have been paid for by Russia (which Trump said at the beginning, but was claimed to be a lie)? What about the forced firing via threat of withholding aide of the Ukrainian prosecutor by Joe Biden, who denied being involved with his son&#x27;s business dealings in the Ukraine?  We were told that was lies, but there is indisputable DKIM evidence that an e-mail from Burisima to Hunter Biden thanked him for meeting his father while he was in office (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;robertdavidgraham&#x2F;hunter-dkim" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;robertdavidgraham&#x2F;hunter-dkim</a>). Are those lies too?<p>Sure Trump lies, like any other politician. But sometimes he tells the truth, and the truth is so ludicrous, that it seems like lies, but when it finally comes out that it was true, we all sit and say to ourselves... maybe we should believe the guy. But I mean... continue on with the denial, you&#x27;ll just turn more formerly anti-Trump people into pro-Trumpers.')
