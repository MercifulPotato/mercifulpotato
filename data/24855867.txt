Then, on Firefox, I bind each amazon(1-6).localhost to its own container and configure it to always open this site in its container.\nNow every time I type &quot;amazon2&quot; it will open up amazon.com in its right container.<p>Would have wished to have bookmarks granularity as part of Firefox, but for my use case, this is the best I could come up with in few minutes of work.')
