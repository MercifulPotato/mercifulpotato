So other than mentioning it in some books and talk shows, what was his contribution that merits a PhD?<p>I didn&#x27;t say he was the only one to do so, but he put in the work to get observational data and brought to the mainstream archeaologists and historians who wrote countless works and based their dissertations on their &#x27;irrefutable fact&#x27; of how the Ice Age ended which never included an asteroid impact and he staunchly challenged academia as a JOURNALIST and did the legwork with his colleagues who were actually trained archeologists and documented his observations.<p>And just so it&#x27;s clear: I&#x27;m not parroting academia&#x27;s indoctrination it forced me to bend to, but Wikipedia is not a valid source for citation for a reason, and if I had submitted a paper referencing it was dismissed entirely.<p>But here is an essay from the Man himself if you are so inclined to read it [0].<p>I think his work is notable and his contributions worthy and have merit, which is honestly much more than what many people based their PhDs on when they make arguments about things like the extinction of wooly mammoths and other mega fauna as result of Human over hunting. When NOTHING could explain these massive dead zones, but were none the less awarded degrees for their findings.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grahamhancock.com&#x2F;hancockg17&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grahamhancock.com&#x2F;hancockg17&#x2F;</a>')
