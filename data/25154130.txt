Youtube takes a 45% cut, but part of that is to subsidize the videos that currently don&#x27;t have ads, so let&#x27;s say 20% of current ad revenue is a reasonble price of Youtube removing ads from a single video.<p>For a video viewed a million times, it would cost a creator $6545 (.018 x 20&#x2F;55 x 1,000,000) to keep the video ad free. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone willing to pay that much to keep their videos ad-free.')
