It is usually a good candidate in many recipes where you need a mostly-solid fat. Both palm oil and butter have a high percentage of saturated fatty acids so butter can just be replaced most of the time. Extra virgin olive oil is not a good replacement in those cases for example, even if it is perceived as &quot;more healthy&quot; generally, but it can be the wrong choice if you are frying (and you would lose most of its taste, so it is an expensive waste). That is why I really do not understand &quot;organic &#x2F; full corn &#x2F; honey-instead-of-sugar &#x2F; olive-oil-instead of butter&quot; pastries. It is still a lot of sugar and fat, so you should not probably eat a lot of that. Just eat it a bit less, use the right ingredients and enjoy ;-)')
