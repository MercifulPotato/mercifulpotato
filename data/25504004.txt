So far the treatment has been mostly rest, what I&#x27;ve been told boils down to &#x27;if there is neural damage then it will likely repair itself in time and if not there is nothing we can do about it&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s a pretty weird feeling, as if your sharp knife has suddenly gone dull, it is hard to describe the &#x27;before&#x27; and &#x27;after&#x27; because I&#x27;m both subject and observer but it definitely feels off.<p>The other day there was an article about Alzheimer&#x27;s stages,  and the first stage read like an exact description of what I&#x27;m experiencing.

If it stays as it is that would be acceptable, if it heals that would be preferable and the third alternative is one I&#x27;d rather not think of.')
