Iran has probably less than 10 that are actually flyable, and they&#x27;ve been so heavily modified as to be mostly not recognizable as F14s anymore.  The only other actual airframes that are anywhere near a 50 year lifespan are the B-52s, and they&#x27;ve been totally redesigned and rebuilt multiple times over those years.<p>There are no F15 airframes over 45 years, there are no F4 airframes over 45 years.  The F15 production line is still open, there are 7 F4s still in service and they are a heavily upgraded version that wasn&#x27;t produced in 1984 -- and those 7 leave service next month.  You&#x27;re confusing first date of production with the actual production dates of the aircraft still flying in order to make up a point that isn&#x27;t even accurate as you&#x27;ve stated it.<p>Anyway, you just keep making up stuff so I&#x27;m going to leave this discussion here for now.')
