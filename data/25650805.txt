I should be able to zoom in and out from that pivot point: to debian repositories, to container layers, to dependency graphs in NPM, to Helm charts. I should be able to see where it lives in my own systems, and exactly how it came to be there, from the network operations in my own systems all the way back to tickets and commits. For any given asset I should be able to discover everything that was assembled, transformed, transported and inspected in its scope.')
