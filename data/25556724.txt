(Note that a lot of lithium comes from &quot;resources&quot; and not from &quot;reserves,&quot; as the latter term usually refers to mining rather than brining.)<p>For current chemistries, cobalt is more of a concern, but that&#x27;s mostly a concern for car batteries, and the concern is more about the terrible conditions of extraction (some child labor from small scale mining) than the total amount.<p>For stationary storage, sodium behaves a lot like lithium, but is far heavier. And there are all sorts of flow chemistries that have barely been examined.<p>However I think the lithium train has left the station, unless there&#x27;s some sort of serious market interference to  cause huge unexpected shortages, there&#x27;s little chance for lithium competitors to catch up within the next 15 years.')
