For example, medical malpractice has killed unimaginably more people than any suicidal cult ever has. Still, that does not mean it&#x27;s better to join a suicidal cult than it is to visit the doctor&#x27;s office.<p>&gt;<i>we know so little about the Aztecs compared to Europe that it would be impossible to make an informed if absurd decision as to which way I would want to be executed.</i><p>The reason you&#x27;d want to pick the justice system is that justice systems, even when imperfect, can still declare innocent people innocent. A justice system sometimes makes mistakes, the Aztec temple only made mistakes.')
