There is also limited ability to make doses.  If you don&#x27;t already have the infrastructure in place, then you will get notified when you shipment is arriving, and you get a few days to administer it. You schedule everyone who will get a dose for their shot and they are in and out quickly.  If it takes more  than half a day to use up their entire shipment it is because some dosages are reserved for 3rd shift and will be administered 12 hours later.  Then repeat 3 weeks latter.<p>Of course larger institutions already have everything in place and will get shipments with less warning (but they will also get smaller shipments since they don&#x27;t have to get everyone done at once)')
