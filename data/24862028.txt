But it fails to answer 2 urgent questions:<p>1. There&#x27;s an extinct group of crustaceans the Cyclida (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cyclida" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cyclida</a>) that were apparently quite crab-like. This article doesn&#x27;t address whether Cyclida were delicious when steamed, and muscle segments dunked in drawn butter. Really dropped the ball here.<p>2. If carcinization happened at least 5 times on Earth, has it occurred on other, extrasolar, planets? Science needs to get cracking on this.')
