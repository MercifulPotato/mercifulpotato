It would also help me debug my codes by comparing pixels values with a reference for example, and many other usages.<p>Of course, those are not the only requirements, but it would already spare me a lot of time to be able to open this kind of format by simply clicking on the file :)<p>The others operations I perform daily are frames&#x27; differences (|img1 - img2|) and display them using some colormap. We also frequently need to run several quality metrics like MS-PSNR, SSIM, etc.. to &quot;objectively&quot; evaluate what we see.<p>For the OpenEXR their lib is ok for opening images, I need this because several images I use have only one channel in 16bits, and it&#x27;s one of the only formats capable of storing this kind of data.<p>While for YUV, the format is actually extremely simple! It&#x27;s just a big array containing an intensity component (luma) and colors components (chroma) with some upscaling[1] and GPU&#x27;s decoders can work with them if it&#x27;s a performance issue [2] ;).<p>Both are standard in the professional video community! Think of them as &quot;raw&quot; video formats.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;60729170&#x2F;python-opencv-converting-planar-yuv-420-image-to-rgb-yuv-array-format" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;60729170&#x2F;python-opencv-c...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.nvidia.com&#x2F;drive&#x2F;drive_os_5.1.6.1L&#x2F;nvvib_docs&#x2F;index.html#page&#x2F;DRIVE_OS_Linux_SDK_Development_Guide&#x2F;NvMedia&#x2F;nvmedia_concept_surface.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.nvidia.com&#x2F;drive&#x2F;drive_os_5.1.6.1L&#x2F;nvvib_docs&#x2F;i...</a>')
