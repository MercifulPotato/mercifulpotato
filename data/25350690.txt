I don&#x27;t know how far that goes (like in the article &quot;magic numbers&quot; section discussing polyglot files, for example), but they have had success making other things more secure (ssh, cvs, smtp, ntp, ...).  Maybe they just made &quot;file&quot; less likely to have bugs discovered in the future.')
