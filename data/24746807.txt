I physically couldn&#x27;t fit a couple of extra monitors on my desk, and a vertical monitor for code, etc, on my desk if they were as thick as the CRT I used to use ages ago. And having recently upgraded from a plasma TV to an LED - good lord even the plasma TV was stupid heavy. Sometimes you want to be able to move around physical objects you know? Cleaning, rearranging, etc? There&#x27;s a difference going from a 10 mm phone to a 9 mm phone vs going from a 30 inch CRT to a 65 inch LED')
