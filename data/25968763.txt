In HN my &quot;workflow&quot; is to open the comments page of the interesting items in a new tab, click to read the article, and then click &quot;back&quot; to read the comments and upvote.<p>You need more post, like 5 per day. Reddit faked it with sockpuppets, but I perhaps you prefer to make the posts with the real names of the developer team. Anyway, more post and more comments, interesting comments.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s easier to get traction here with a technical post. Tech stack? How big is your server? Spam problems? (Don&#x27;t worry, you will get spam sooner or later.)<p>Someday you will also have moderation problems. Each one has a different definition of happiness. The initial community is important.')
