Armed agents of the state also clearly have to have a role in a country with as many guns as ours.<p>They should conduct themselves professionally enough that they aren&#x27;t pepper spraying people sitting in the street and aiming rubber bullets at their heads. Start there. If you are captured on film pepper spraying some 20 year old kid sitting on the street in the face for a solid twenty seconds? No, you are absolutely not qualified to carry a firearm, much less &quot;protect the peace&quot;.')
