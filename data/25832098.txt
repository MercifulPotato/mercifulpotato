I get that Signal is not Facebook, so it has that going for it, however beside that it leaks the same data (which Signal says it is not storing however). You could probably compare it to Whatsapp before it was sold to Facebook.<p>So I have to ask myself: What happens if Signal has financial issues?<p>edit: Signal is open-source and non-profit as commenters pointed out. That&#x27;s indeed advantageous.')
