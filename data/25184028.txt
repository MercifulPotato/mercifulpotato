And agreed it&#x27;s a weak argument to pick on zealots. I like your argument that all cultures have things in common. I don&#x27;t argue that are all the same as in not a simpleton. I say that to me there are more similarities than differences between secular and religious culture. I say that the similarities are critically instructive.<p>Some say there are no novel insights. But we still try. Here&#x27;s one effort: suppose we hypothesize that fiction is more effective at building political consensus. When I say &quot;fiction&quot; I don&#x27;t say falsehood. I say fiction to mean representation of reality that aim to be convincing rather than truthful. We all have seen this in action.<p>Suppose I say this is what religion looks like to me: the ancient study of social and political fiction.<p>I think modern science has lost its way. It has lost moral context. I think it looks a lot like the advanced institutions of the Roman Catholic Church near the time of the Reformation. Not exactly mind you, but in that it&#x27;s existing to maintain itself rather than as a responsive, living language of healthy communal culture.<p>I think it&#x27;s language that fascilitates rapid change in cultural realities. It&#x27;s this form of religious realism that interests me in critique of modern science institution. That&#x27;s not because I like to argue with people on the internet, but because I think there&#x27;s a novel, applied approach that emerges in looking at the problem that way.<p>But I don&#x27;t expect that to be clear, and while it&#x27;s been interesting I&#x27;m not much for basic arguing!')
