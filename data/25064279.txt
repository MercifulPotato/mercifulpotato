Ableton is optimised to cram as many plugins onto a single thread as possible, which means you are quickly going to run out of processing power when using more CPU demanding plugins, because as soon as you exhaust one cpu core, the project will no longer play in real time. When plugins run from their own process, the OS take care of distributing the load across multiple cores and that lets you run more plugins before it will overload. \nSo I agree that sandboxing is not done to gain perfomance, but better perfomance is an unintended side effect. That shows how bad Ableton scheduling is.')
