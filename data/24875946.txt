Humans can sometimes be unfair and biased and error-prone.<p>Code on the other hand does not discriminate. Ethereum smart contracts are open source and auditable.<p>Technology can be used for good or bad. But I would much rather an industry be run by fair, auditable code than (unfortunately faulty) humans.<p>If I apply for a mortgage, I would like to know the process if driven by code which is applied transparently and equally to everyone, so things like skin colour isn’t a factor.<p>Competition will always remain. If a company uses unfair smart contracts, there will always be alternatives.')
