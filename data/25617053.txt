Item(by='choeger', descendants=None, kids=[25617461], score=None, time=1609625554, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25615875, text='Unsafe driving is not characterized by speeding a slight margin over the limit on good roads (see German Autobahn for statistics, these are among the safest roads on the planet). Similarly, I am pretty certain that driving 40 in a 30 zone (when 30 is safely possible) is <i>not</i> the cause of most, if any, deaths. Causes are varied, but generally the situations where one or two meters of road would make a difference are obviously rare.<p>So to emphasize my point: Permanent and ubiquitous speed control is the wet dream of many people, but it&#x27;s a proxy. These people have a problem with <i>cars</i>. And there are many places where that is absolutely justified (dense inner cities for example, or streets in front of schools).')
