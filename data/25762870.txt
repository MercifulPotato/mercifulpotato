Meng tried to sell Huawei to Motorola for $7.5billion. The deal didn&#x27;t go through because CEO change in Motorola. Of course, Chinese government would be a client for Huawei as well as Microsoft and many other companies. Also government owned funds would invest in commercial entities to make money. I have not done full research on Huawei, so I cannot say there is no money invested in Huawei.<p>If you are worrying about Chinese government controlling the company, actually in China, the government does not need to fund a company to do that. For example, the poverty elimination program was set out by the government, all major companies would be encouraged to participate. If you are &#x27;encouraged&#x27; by the government in anywhere around the world, you would participate for a better relationship with the government.')
