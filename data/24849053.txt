I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s any company more vilely detested in America than Comcast.<p>Alas, for some reason the Democratic party hasn&#x27;t shown any real interest in regulating them or promoting competition, which is a failure of democracy. I don&#x27;t personally know why -- I could guess something about campaign contributions and lobbying but if anyone actually knowledgeable could speak up I&#x27;d love to know.')
