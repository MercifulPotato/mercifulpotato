The main issue with RSA is that depending on implementation and context-sensitive parameter selection (i.e. you actually have to think about them and can&#x27;t just always use the same) you get wildly different results.  \nOther algorithms, like ECC, also have parameters, but they aren&#x27;t context-sensitive, so always choosing the same one is fine for developers and only security researchers have to think of new and better parameters.  \nThe Question really is how brittle do you expect&#x2F;accept your encryption algorithm to be: RSA is very brittle in very unexpected ways, while e.g. ECC is only brittle if you choose a bad curve (but you can simply always select the same safe one) and people also know that.')
