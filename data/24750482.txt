It&#x27;s true. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re usually as destructive as Steinbeck was to his family, but it&#x27;s a rough road. They experience everything at high intensity-- you have to, to be able to write compelling fiction. Getting the accolades and money is about your only shot at making that hypersensitive existence &quot;worth it&quot;, so to speak.<p>Negative reviews hit these people harder than you&#x27;d expect, it&#x27;s true. If the reviewer&#x27;s right, then there&#x27;s cause for regret. If the reviewer&#x27;s wrong, it means he didn&#x27;t see the work as worth taking seriously. If you&#x27;re not sure, then you start to question whether you know anything about your own writing. You can end up giving far too much rent-free mental real estate to someone who got bored on page 27 and wrote a shitty DNF review. And you can&#x27;t respond, either; authors who respond to reviews (positive or negative) in the public end up regretting it. There&#x27;s just no good that comes out of it.<p>Most of the authors I know end up envying the more visual artists, who can display their talents more easily. A painting is either ugly or beautiful and it&#x27;s visible within a few seconds, even though it may take longer to pick up the subtleties. With a novel, you have to convince people to put hours of time into reading something they might end up hating. In traditional publishing, even getting read by someone of any importance at all takes monumental effort (that has very little to do with actual writing).')
