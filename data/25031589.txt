Send a voltage through a fiber optic cable, and make thousands of miles into compute.\n2. Predict gravitational waves, measure them with a laser, and build a resonator to heat up or generate a voltage. \n3. Work at the extremes. That semiconductor grounds itself to the Earth, and that semiconductor is at the scale of the Planck length. Everything here on earth is the same. Everything out there sees a black hole that&#x27;s not really black. Perhaps before humans have the tech, nature has had it all along through quantum chemistry and biology, solar radiation and orbits.<p>----------<p>Newton thought radiation was what happens when two things are close to the same temperature. The temperatures fluctuate back and forth, making a medium of their own. A few hundred years later, by accident, electrical potential and magnetism became the same thing, matching closely to the delay Galileo found when viewing Jupiter&#x27;s moons. Newton&#x27;s model began to fall apart, predicting a closed cupboard of cast iron pots and pans would cause one to radiate white hot and the rest to grow darker and colder.<p>Industrialists paid Max Planck to determine how bright a light bulb filament can be. Planck looked at the kinetic theory of gases, and created a model where matter needs to charge up a little bit before radiating light at a higher frequency. Connect two conductive surfaces, or focus light somewhere, and it&#x27;s like putting a tiny soup can around an area. What&#x27;s inside is either hitting each other, hitting the walls or hitting nothing, and probability of internal state relates to the external temperature and pressure to contain it.<p>Einstein looked at Planck&#x27;s model, and said you have a start, you have an end, you have a particle. Think about it in reverse. You have heat transfer collapsing to a point, the topology, providing the particle. The medium of radiation is the relative clocks of separate internal states. Nature will speed up and slow down clocks to transfer heat just the same as colliding matter. That&#x27;s what a photon is really. The model is particle emission but the nature is very different.<p>Electrical potential transfers through the medium. The actual electron is really slow. The photoelectric effect requires frequency regardless of intensity. It really is the opposite. Not building out of components. What on the surface balances out to create the internals for what the outside is containing.<p>I know this isn&#x27;t written anywhere. I would say it&#x27;s more the easier thermal path of what&#x27;s grounded to than it&#x27;s internal atomic state. You&#x27;re pushing back on what your grounded to with the relative clock.<p>Electrons and photons are really counter intuitive. Not little particles traveling in between. A filament holds a voltage, a spot on the wall gets bright because it&#x27;s the easiest path of thermal transfer.')
