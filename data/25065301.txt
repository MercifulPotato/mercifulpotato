People didn&#x27;t even bother trying to inject some kind of personality into their profile, so even if I matched them I had nothing to say to them. There is no online dating anymore really, there is only online hookup. That&#x27;s fine if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re into, but goddamn is this shit shallow.<p>I think it is time we admit that there are some problems that just can&#x27;t be solved with a website.')
