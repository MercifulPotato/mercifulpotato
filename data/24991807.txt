These papers can be used as a sort of make shift tutorial, which can be incredibly helpful when studying an unfamiliar topic.  (I actually like them better than tutorials, because I get some perspective into their thinking and how they came to explore the topic which makes it easier to generalize the lesson.)<p>Not just reading papers, but Wikipedia as well:  When exploring a new domain of knowledge, you may not know much or any of the vocabulary being used.  This turns the average person off.  I see this as the most common hurdle faced by those self studying a new topic.<p>The trick is to slow down, look at the different vocabulary you don&#x27;t recognize, and then look them up.  What sometimes happens is to learn this new vocabulary you&#x27;ll be met with a wall of even more unfamiliar vocabulary.  This turns into a dependency chain of unfamiliar topics.  Looking up those words &#x2F; dependencies recursively, eventually you&#x27;ll get to familiar knowledge.  You can start building up from that place of familiarity and before you know it you&#x27;ve picked up not only the basics of a new domain of knowledge but the more advanced topics build up to what you were interested in.<p>Learning the prerequisites usually takes hours, but sometimes this process can take days.  Taking days to learn a dependency chain to learn an advanced topic seems like a long time, but in comparison to taking a class on the topic or reading a text book, this style of learning is highly accelerated.  Sometimes there is no alternative learning style if you need to parse a paper on a cutting edge unfamiliar topic not yet covered in text books, and imo if you pace yourself and value learning over any other goal, it can be quite a relaxing and enjoyable process.  Reading papers is a lot of fun.<p>When I&#x27;m learning new topics, I take notes.  My goal is to maintain what I learn, not have it go in one ear and out the other, so why not slow down, relax, and take notes?  Better yet if I come back to the same topic months later I can look over my notes.  If I forgot something about the topic, I know my study style could be improved.  This meta-learning feedback loop can be super helpful if you value and enjoy learning new topics (which you do or you wouldn&#x27;t be on YC).')
