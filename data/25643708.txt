There&#x27;s people that truly don&#x27;t care about privacy and control, and see comments like this as a nuisance, because they can&#x27;t see how this massive amount of information could be used against them. WEF itself has been selling the <i>you won&#x27;t own a thing, and you&#x27;ll be happy</i> mantra for a while, and there&#x27;s more and more people buying it.<p>It would be palatable if the ones promoting it didn&#x27;t have so much privacy and control themselves.')
