As I wrote, it aligns interests between consumers (patients) and producers (doctors), and removes one step between them - patients will be much more directly impacted by their choice of insurer (now this is handled by their companies, consumers have no real choice), so they&#x27;ll be shopping around for the optimal price&#x2F;performance provider.<p>The alternative solution often proposed, Medicaid&#x2F;Medicare <i>for all</i> (socialized medicine), <i>actually</i> has no solution to this problem (except sweeping it under the rug even more, then it will be <i>the government</i> overpaying for medicine so people will care even less).')
