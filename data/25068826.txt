(You can also apply styling both on selected text and for text about to be typed, unlike plain text environments like this textfield I&#x27;m using now where you can&#x27;t do shift-8 on selected text.)<p>When you get into the more esoteric syntax, it&#x27;s still a tie: look how often even Gruber gets the Markdown link syntax wrong, and he <i>designed</i> it.')
