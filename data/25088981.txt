(When I left Google in 2012, Spanner table schemas were literally defined using protobuf IDL. I haven&#x27;t followed it since so I have no idea if that&#x27;s still the case.)<p>Admittedly, protobuf wasn&#x27;t explicitly designed for these purposes, it just of grew into them because they were convenient, and as a result there are certainly warts. But it&#x27;s close enough that it works pretty well.')
