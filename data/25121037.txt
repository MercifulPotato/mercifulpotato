(Through the practice of delegating tips and ratings to the end user.)<p>There&#x27;s a clear imbalance of power there -- it costs the customer nothing to not tip or to leave a one star review. But those things could absolutely impact someone&#x27;s earning potential as a worker.<p>Consider how many people seemingly enjoy being petty tyrants when given the opportunity, and the story gets worse and worse for the worker.<p>I always recommend that people always give five stars and a generous tip (until we outlaw typing). It&#x27;s not my job to narc on your workers, Uber.')
