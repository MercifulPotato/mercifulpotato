Opening windows for a few minutes after cooking can dramatically improve air quality.<p>After bad bush fires where I live I invested in both a CO2 monitor and a particle air quality monitor (Dylos DC1100 Pro Air Quality Monitor). It shocked me just how much cooking (and other factors I can&#x27;t quite determine yet) affected the air quality. Think 10 times more particles due to cooking, even with the fan on and windows open.<p>Another possible source of indoor air pollution are carpets and other manufactured things, interestingly.<p>CO2 was bad too, but opening my window has a greater impact on that. But it is shocking to see levels of ~800-900ppm inside with windows closed.')
