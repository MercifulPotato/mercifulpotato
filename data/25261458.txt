I&#x27;m married and in my 30s. We aren&#x27;t planning to have kids, we have no assets, my wife still has student debt (epidemiology is a bad field if you plan to work in the public sector), and with my &quot;good&quot; insurance, I can&#x27;t afford dental work that I need related to growing up in poverty.<p>Despite this, we have super comfortable lives, as you say. We&#x27;ve jumped from trailer park, meth country poverty to truly living like we&#x27;re in the middle class, something I think is way harder to do in other countries. But kids? No. That looks like a ticket right back to where we started.')
