I also don&#x27;t want to review 10 separate commits.<p>The majority of my comments are on separate chunks of code, so it&#x27;s not that hard for me to see the resolutions to all of them in one big diff.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m assuming the commits will be squashed at the end of the review. If you&#x27;re preserving the full commit history, then I can understand why you&#x27;d want the atomic commits for each note addressed.')
