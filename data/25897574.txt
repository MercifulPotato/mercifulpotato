Progressives are hurtling toward an Ibram Kendi definition of &quot;racism&quot; and under that definition, pretty much all of conservatism is &quot;racist&quot; in the sense that it&#x27;s not anti-racist. You&#x27;re probably not going to correct the structural economic differences between Black and white people without some sort of big-government intervention, large-scale redistribution, etc. (The Black-white income gap has not changed in decades, while e.g. Latino incomes have converged to white incomes within a few generations.) You can redefine pretty much every conservative policy a racist in that framing: gun rights--Black people disproportionately suffer from gun violence, etc. Kendi specifically uses the capital gains preference as an example of a &quot;racist&quot; policy. And based on his axioms, he&#x27;s not wrong. As I&#x27;ve said before, while I don&#x27;t share Kendi&#x27;s premises, I don&#x27;t really disagree with his reasoning within the framework he&#x27;s constructed.<p>Now, I think only a minority of rank-and-file Democrats actually view &quot;racism&quot; that expansively. But (1) these people are disproportionately represented in policy-making circles, media, and academia; and (2) Democrats have no institutional reason to push back on that since they control the media and academia.<p>So I expect these definitions to continue to gain purchase. When Don Lemon called all Trump voters racists, at least Chris Cuomo pushed back: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;tomselliott&#x2F;status&#x2F;1349672644455575554?s=20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;tomselliott&#x2F;status&#x2F;1349672644455575554?s...</a>. I don&#x27;t think that will be the case in 10 years. I&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised if it is.')
