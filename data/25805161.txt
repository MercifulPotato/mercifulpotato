Moxies vehement rejection of a distributed design seems less and less tenable each outage.  Last time it was what...verification numbers that werent getting sent?<p>and FWIW the divinations from the community are exceedingly helpful in a time when not even the signal website seems to confirm or deny any sort of outage.  Signups are still being taken and the outage page at signal.org is still as static as ever.  Even the twitter hasnt seen an update in nearly a day.  Is anyone at Signal foundation at the controls?<p>As a signal user myself I know this is going to sound rude but at this point other than the endorsements from musk and dorsey, why would <i>any</i> new user consider this service at all if its been down for nearly two days?  theres never any postmortem, and communication is generally evangelical or solicitous in nature for either installs or donations.')
