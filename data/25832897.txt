Item(by='sradman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611059983, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25829959, text='&gt; Poor reading, writing and numeracy skills in adults make up a literacy gap... the gap is due in part to an abundance of jobs in the past that do not require the daily use of reading comprehension and information synthesis skills.<p>The problem is identifying children with learning disabilities and&#x2F;or low IQ early enough and steering them into effective programs tailored to core literacy&#x2F;numeracy. This is a non-trivial problem in rural and remote communities.<p>Our disdain of IQ style tests, assumed to be associated with marginalization, has probably backfired. The key question is what level of literacy&#x2F;numeracy is expected for a given IQ and then identifying individuals that fall below this range of expectations. If you don’t recognize the natural distribution to begin with it is hard to improve outcomes.<p>A second problem not addressed in the article is individuals with above average IQs that are functionally innumerate and lack &quot;information synthesis skills”. Journalists generally fall into this category. We need quality information filters especially during a pandemic.')
