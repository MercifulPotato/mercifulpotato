The question is not, &quot;when I leave the bathroom, is everyone looking at me and judging me for having used it?&quot; Rather, the question is, &quot;when I see someone else leave the bathroom, do I think about it for more than a fraction of a second, and if I knew they had defecated, would I want to shame or embarrass them for it at all?&quot;<p>The answer to the latter, if you are not a horrible person, is of course not. You don&#x27;t really care, it&#x27;s not your problem, you&#x27;re not keeping track of it, it&#x27;s just an event you forget moments later. Probably, then, that&#x27;s what your coworkers think of you, when you go; so stop caring, because they definitely don&#x27;t.<p>(If anyone ever were to metaphorically give me shit for using the bathroom, I&#x27;d turn it around on them in a heartbeat, too. It&#x27;s so easy - just ask, what kind of creep cares about their coworker&#x27;s bodily functions to this extent? Gross, weird!)')
