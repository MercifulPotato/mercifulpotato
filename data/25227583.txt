Leaving aside where exactly &quot;midpoint&quot; of floats lies (either in Ruby&#x27;s implementation or other languages&#x27;): what would be implications of this for writing code dealing with floats? Can I shoot myself in the foot somehow with low precision if numbers I&#x27;m using are &quot;too close&quot; to infinity?')
