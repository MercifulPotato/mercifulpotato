When you look at places with a lot of unsolved cases, you see cops who don&#x27;t care or who protect their friends or are corrupt or who prefer to prosecute random people. And you see good apples cops getting demotivated and loosing political confkicts against bad apples cops.<p>What you don&#x27;t see is well discipline well intentioned police force that is just unable to get doctor report of injuries or use testimony as evidence.')
