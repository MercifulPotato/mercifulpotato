Item(by='sunpar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609335347, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25573236, text='&gt;you&#x27;ll find a dozen people to complain that you&#x27;re nothing but an eeeevil capitalist who would poison our oceans and black out our skies just to make an extra $3.50 in pocket change, if not simply out of spite generally.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be one of those people, trust me. I won&#x27;t go into what my line of work is, but suffice to say I may actually be one of those evil capitalists.<p>I DO think this is one of those cost-of-doing-business type of things when it comes to international trade. I think most consumers appreciate that when they go and buy something that labels itself &quot;pasta&quot;, it conforms to some standard that we can agree is reasonable. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll likely have someone who stuffs ramen noodles into a pasta package and sells it to some suckers. And now we all have to always know which are the &quot;real&quot; pasta brands and which are the fakes(yes, that might be easy enough to do, but it&#x27;s the overall cognitive load of having to do that with every product that should concern us). That&#x27;s just an example, but that&#x27;s why the regulations exist.<p>And you can&#x27;t just say &quot;well they sell this in Italy, and that&#x27;s the home of pasta, so c&#x27;mon man this can&#x27;t be right&quot;, because Italy I&#x27;m sure has like 3x more regulations around pasta selling (a cursory google search shows this is likely true), and any change they make to their regulation will keep in mind the interests of their consumers and their producers. They will not be thinking of American interests when making those regulations.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s worth keeping in mind that this one company that was recently restricted for not being in compliance is NOT the only manufacturer of Bucatini, and in fact may not be the largest or best manufacturer either. It&#x27;s just one company that returned the reporter&#x27;s calls and had an answer for them.')
