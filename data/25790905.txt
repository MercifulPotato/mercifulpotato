Find a place that consistently sells tether cheap. If anything, the lack of this place is a sign of poor research base for the original article.<p>They mention that some exchanges give tether &quot;prises&quot; sometimes, on some occasions, to a select number of users. I don&#x27;t see how that is so bad, and neither do I see how you could consistently profit from that. Those incentives are likely to be once per user, or once per referred customer, etc. There are likely protections in the form of &quot;you have to trade for this much in order to realize the total prise amount&quot;. I don&#x27;t see how this is any different from bonuses that many online casinos give out, and no one takes that as a sign that a given casino that does this is insolvent.')
