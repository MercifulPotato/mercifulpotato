I know people scratching at 200k, but they are senior consultants.<p>So a more realistic view would be 100k 40,5% tax+insurance+pension\n15% &quot;forced savings&quot; (Pension + Vorsorgekasse)\n6% health insurance\n19,6% income tax<p>This calculation assumes that you do not really have significant expenses of business. Having those actually makes the picture look worse.<p>You can calculate here for yourself, no &quot;cheating&quot; required:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abrechnen.wko.at" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abrechnen.wko.at</a> (official chamber of commerce calculator)<p>A GmbH is always better at 220k+&#x2F;year. But there may be reasons you would want one earlier (liability, employees, IP, investments, ...)<p>Employing people in Austria is expensive (&quot;cost of labor&quot;). Beeing self employed is not bad, if you factor in benefits and costs of life and quality of life.')
