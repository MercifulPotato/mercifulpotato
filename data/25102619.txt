Not every PR is made in good faith nor made with the same motivation as the maintainer. Someone making dozens of individual PRs for things like adding CONST to variables whose future use they do not understand is a drain on the maintainer&#x27;s time. For the person making the pull requests, they get a low effort way to pad their number of accepted pull requests, many of which are not in alignment with the goals of the maintainer or the project.')
