In their Python API, it had trouble correctly handling binary blob inserts. I really should have started poking at the code and tried to submit a patch, but I also realized I&#x27;d probably need to write my own schema migration layer (I&#x27;m use to yoyo-migrations for sqlite3).<p>I ended up back on sqlite3.
