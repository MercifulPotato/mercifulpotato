My side of the story is that a past global brand employer used their legal power to make me unemployable. My true mistake was using sarcasm around my boss, who presented it to HR as violent rage. I can go into details, ideally I could use our legal resources to clear up the situation if my story checks out. I know this is “negative” and will make people uncomfortable but it will come up so I’ll save us some time. I’ve been homeless for a long time, kept high spirits, been employed most of the time with happy bosses such as at Whole Foods and an upscale fast casual vegan restaurant. I didn’t go looking for a fight, it came to me, and I know that I can clear my name if I stay true. Coding for a monastary would be most excellent. I’ve 15 years of open source and user group presentations out there. Thanks.')
