Yes, you can write programs, but can you write a different &#x2F;bin&#x2F;init for your system? I&#x27;m not sure you can (either because Apple will not let you, or your lack of ability to do things like setting up a system to be used). Maybe you can, we&#x27;re wrong about this, and more power to you. But it&#x27;s quite likely that you can&#x27;t.')
