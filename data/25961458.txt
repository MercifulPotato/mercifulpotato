With named references, I can simply alphabetize them at the bottom and forget about them while I move sections around.<p>With single-char identifiers though, I&#x27;d feel an obligation to keep things in reference order, so one more thing to think about while I&#x27;m working.<p>On another note, I&#x27;m interested in this idea of reusing image links to preview CSVs and other formats. (graphviz comes to mind)  Do you have any examples of this being used in a document and the tooling to stitch it together?')
