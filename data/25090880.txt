But the Hell is paved with best intentions. Failing to understand that will keep you feeling pity for those who predicted what comes next, and then feeling pity for yourself for you did not listen when it was not too late.<p>Look, we are all a death threat to each other, but there&#x27;s one thing called immunity that keeps us from dying out. Elderly always were less immune; are you 100% sure that none of your droplets ever killed someone less immune back in the reckless unmasked days? Someone with a rare condition? Did you track fates of all people you ever contacted?<p>You people seem to have some panic button in your minds that has been activated by some great NLP masters, which now prevents you from accepting simple facts of life and death. Especially of death. You are willing to wrap life in masks and barbwire, to make it immobile and constrained, to eat and inject all kinds of poisons, to accept any kind of atrocious attitude and orders just in order to keep this undead state for indefinitely long. But that&#x27;s not going to happen, and you all know that. The clock is ticking for everyone. The only way out of this mess is to live a good fearless life and enjoy every second of it.<p>And I highly recommend watching these 2 videos in succession to all the good intended people who believe there&#x27;s nothing ominous going on right now.<p>Berlin in 1936: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Es6f7K4c-y8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Es6f7K4c-y8</a><p>Berlin in 1945: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=R5i9k7s9X_A" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=R5i9k7s9X_A</a><p>Be well and do try to join the dots...')
