As I wrote the comment above, I pulled up my old photo of outside Nintendo&#x27;s Kyoto office that day and noticed&#x2F;realized that sure enough they actually display that Kanji you shared on a blue&#x2F;white flat atop a tall flagpole directly next to the detached ground-level classic &quot;Nintendo&quot; logo sign.<p>Cross referecing with the building referred to later in Osaka then of course, it is the same blue and white colors with that Kanji.  Didn&#x27;t connect the dots at the time!  Just  happened to casually bring it up as a curious sight to my  friend while walking about on a summer day.')
