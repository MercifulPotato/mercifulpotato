I just had a friend drop a reference to Chesterton&#x27;s Fence on twitter the other day. I think that this is definitely a great point. Time boxing and code review and cultural guidance are probably the best defense.<p>But I think a valid thing to do if a newer dev doesn&#x27;t understand a section of code is to ask why and see if there are steps short of refactoring to improve that (comments, docs).  What I hate and strive to avoid is code that is &quot;abandon hope, all ye who enter&quot; territory--totally a mess but &quot;works&quot; and no one wants to touch it.<p>All in all I think we agree, drive by refactoring is the flip side of that and can lead to subtle bugs a year from now. It&#x27;s a balance.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;ll update the post to reflect this discussion. Thanks!')
