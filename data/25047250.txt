I.e. it sounds like your are more likely to get covid-19 if you have a mental illness but that&#x27;s not what it actually implies. More precise without additional information like the total percent of people tested which have mental illnesses, the consideration when it counts as a mental illness and how they don&#x27;t someone had one and most importantly if they consider pre-test or pre-pandemy this can&#x27;t be interpreted reasonable. Other missing parts include e.g. how likely someone with mental illness is to test themself compared to one which isn&#x27;t.')
