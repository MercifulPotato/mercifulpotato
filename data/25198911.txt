Bosses should not be allowed to spy on people. If I actually fail to do the job in time repeatedly - ok, go ahead and fire me, that would be fair (I won&#x27;t even resist if I see that&#x27;s even partially my fault), but don&#x27;t freaking spy!<p>Anyway, I would prefer to be unaware I&#x27;m being watched - I get kind of paralyzed with anxiety and can&#x27;t think when somebody&#x27;s watching over my shoulder and I know they do.')
