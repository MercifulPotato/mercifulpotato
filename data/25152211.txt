For context, I&#x27;ve been posting online for ~25 years; and the Usenet flamewars that preceded me were available to read in archives even then. Truth is, people have been arguing vociferously and personally for their opinions for years.<p>What has &quot;risen immensely&quot; is people who can&#x27;t seem to tolerate argument, or heated debate, or trolling, and allow it to impact their personal life. Some of this is because it&#x27;s no longer under a pseudonym, so it does actually have some potential to roll over into real life; some of this is because we&#x27;re involved in some efforts to actively change discourse in general, efforts that have amplified over the past few years.<p>Some of these efforts are good.
