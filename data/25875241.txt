Good experts state their assumptions and acknowledge their biases. The assumption seems to be that they don&#x27;t or that they aren&#x27;t, but I see it often. Furthermore, part of the job of the media is to mediate these experts, find consensus among those experts, and explain issues and tradeoffs to the public. This is also under attack by the same people for the same reasons. These reasons are not to make people believe lies, they are to make people believe there is no such thing as &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;. In other words, these reasons are to make people believe that &quot;my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge&quot;. This tactic works for muddying the cause of climate change, but doesn&#x27;t work for &quot;Biden won the election&quot;.<p>For democracy to survive, we need to teach information and media literacy broadly and early.')
