The argument is &quot;JavaScript frontends are becoming unnecessarily bloated, slow, and complicated, and we can do better&quot;. Solutions like the one Basecamp is proposing with Hotwire include pushing as much rendering logic as possible to the server, where you&#x27;re using a language like Ruby for logic. Nobody thinks you can just remove all logic from a web application unless it&#x27;s literally just static content.<p>And even with Hotwire, you&#x27;re not getting rid of JavaScript entirely. You can write it with Stimulus. The idea is just that frontend web development has become a mess, and it&#x27;s possible to simplify things.<p>&gt; there&#x27;s nothing inherently bad about it<p>Disagree.')
