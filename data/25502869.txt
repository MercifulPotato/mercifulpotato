When a function does not depend on state or anything it can be moved, reused and reorganized anywhere thus eliminating technical debt that comes from organizational issues. In other words, all functions in the point free style must be combinators because the point free style eliminates state as much as possible.<p>It&#x27;s a forcing function to make your logic all combinators and not dependent on free variables.<p>Though I do agree with one replier. It does harm readability so now I&#x27;m thinking it may not be the best recommendation. Using combinators without the point free style is enough to actually fix the technical debt I&#x27;m talking about.')
