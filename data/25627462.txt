Why?<p>1. Because TUI apps are perfectly good for this. These kind of apps don&#x27;t really need a fancy UI.<p>2. 90% of the time I want to use a system monitor is when my system is running slow and I need to find out why and which process I need to kill. A fancy GUI app will often take an age to load in these circumstances. Whereas somehow htop will usually still load in &lt;1 secon d and be responsive.')
