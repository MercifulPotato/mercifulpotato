You can&#x27;t start a reply by &quot;This is a lie&quot; and follow with preposterous claims.<p>&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nationalgeographic.com&#x2F;animals&#x2F;mammals&#x2F;g&#x2F;gray-wo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nationalgeographic.com&#x2F;animals&#x2F;mammals&#x2F;g&#x2F;gray-wo</a>...<p>Most of what you read in the popular press on wolf pack is bull. That&#x27;s litteraly the subject of my original comment.

That&#x27;s so silly. If you are the one making an outrageous claim, cite the claims yourself. It&#x27;s like you claiming that the earth is flat and then demanding I read some book to &quot;inform&quot; myself.<p>It&#x27;s not a book. It&#x27;s an article by one of the most prominent researcher on the subject we are discussing: &quot;Alpha Status, Dominance, and Division of Laborin Wolf Packs&quot; [1]. I was written in 1999 and has hundred of citations so I don&#x27;t despair in the information reaching the general public one day.<p>What&#x27;s happening here is you telling me the earth is flat as we have known for centuries and me telling you to go read Gallileo.<p>&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nationalgeographic.com&#x2F;animals&#x2F;mammals&#x2F;g&#x2F;gray-wo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nationalgeographic.com&#x2F;animals&#x2F;mammals&#x2F;g&#x2F;gray-wo</a>...<p>Like most of what you read in the general press on wolf pack, that&#x27;s bull. That was the point of my original post by the way. Journalists apparently stopped following research in the 70s on this.<p>&gt; Actually, the fighting is establishing a rank.<p>No, it&#x27;s not. Once again, please, read the paper I linked.<p>&gt; Yes we do. Parents at top and then kids ( pretty much by age ). Ever heard of patriarchy&#x2F;matriarchy?<p>That&#x27;s complete non sense by the way. You will be hard press to find any research supporting that.<p>&gt; Oh so there is a hierarchy?<p>Oh but certainly, if you mean children being subordinated to their parents, yes, there is a hierarchy. Thankfully, my original post mentioned &quot;complex fixed hierarchical structure&quot; and I will hasard that you are clever enough to understand it implies I am not talking about the link between parents and immature children common to basically every mammals.<p>What people usually think of however (you included given your answer) when they speak of wolf pack hierarchy is a fixed segmentation with alpha on top followed by beta finishing with omega and an individual ranking. This part simply doesn&#x27;t exist in the wild.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t have any confusion. You are confused. You say there is no hierarchy and then use words describing a hierarchy.<p>I am going to be frank. I think you are being intellectually dishonest, looking at this discussion in bad faith, extremely condescending and very reluctant to assume you might be wrong. I kindly suggest you rethink the way you act if you hope to have any form of meaningful conversation.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolf.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2013&#x2F;09&#x2F;267alphastatus_english.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wolf.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2013&#x2F;09&#x2F;267alphastat...</a>')
