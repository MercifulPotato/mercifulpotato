I don&#x27;t know how on earth they could be criticised to be a propaganda outlet for the state. I personally know someone who works for the journalistic side of the state TV and I can assure you that he has all the journalistic freedom he needs.<p>That being said, i fell like the state TV is the opposite. Only neutral news, facts without much of an opinion. For me it&#x27;s not enough to follow the news since I can&#x27;t be an expert in everything. I need voices from a certain my political spectrum that write what they feel about laws and processes. Environmental activists commenting environmental laws etc. Thats why I read the newspaper additionally. It&#x27;s certainly not unbiased, but still independent.')
