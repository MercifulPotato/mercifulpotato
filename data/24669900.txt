Not in this country. It&#x27;s a regression. These aren&#x27;t silly, cheap gaming consoles where teenagers often have more than one. For many people, their phone represents their only access to the internet. It&#x27;s how they conduct their life - banking&#x2F;payments, job search, dating, contacting friends and loved ones, photos, and an endless myriad of other functions. A company shouldn&#x27;t own that entire stack.<p>You and I aren&#x27;t going to agree, and that&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;m writing my legislators. You write yours.<p>The solutions I&#x27;m proposing to Lucy McBath are:<p>1. Requiring that phone operating systems allow installs from the web and&#x2F;or USB. Companies are free to maintain their marketplace and charge whatever they want.<p>2. In the extreme case, break the companies up into hardware and software services. This is more relevant to Google, which has a dangerous control over advertising, search, and the browser. Their browser needs to be taken away, along with AMP and their interest in web standards.')
