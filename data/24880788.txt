It&#x27;s closer to electrical engineering or mechanics then &quot;programming.&quot;<p>&quot;Programming&quot; inherently rewards extendability, interoperability and readability, therefore it rewards OOP. Now obviously computers have Both mechanical and extendable use cases so it&#x27;s up in the air.<p>Stuff that&#x27;s written better functionally tends to be optimized into oblivion very quickly, it becomes more of a hardware&#x2F;math&#x2F;physics problem.
