Item(by='newacct583', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610040883, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25667432, text='&quot;Transparency&quot; isn&#x27;t free, though.  You take those boxes away and now a bunch of people who rely on them for easy access can&#x27;t vote.  Mail takes too long (and is subject to the same criticism).  People with long commutes can&#x27;t be at home on election day.  People with hourly jobs can&#x27;t take the time off.  People without cars can&#x27;t get there.  And all those demographics have a partisan skew.<p>So when you say &quot;transparency&quot;, in the absence of any proof of real fraud, is what other people hear as &quot;suppression&quot;.  We don&#x27;t think you care about voter fraud at all, we think you just want more republican votes.<p>Is that not true?  Then come to the table in good faith and find a compromise.  There are many (e.g. voting day holidays, guarded drop boxes, etc...).  Republicans have blocked them every time they come up.')
