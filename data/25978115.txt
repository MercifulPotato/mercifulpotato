Here&#x27;s another way - are you better off with a phone? If so, then things are better for you. If not, why did you buy it, and why don&#x27;t you throw it away?<p>If you&#x27;re better off, who cares if someone else is even better off? There&#x27;s always going to be someone stronger, taller, handsomer, younger, wealthier, smarter, healthier than you. You&#x27;ll just make yourself miserable worrying about it.<p>I don&#x27;t spend my time worrying about Michael Phelps being a faster swimmer than me. I couldn&#x27;t care less that Usain Bolt runs faster than me. My genes are not favorable for excelling in sport, and I simply don&#x27;t care that other people have an advantage there.<p>P.S. my phone makes my life better every day. I could list all the ways, but it&#x27;s pretty obvious. Its benefit to me is far, far more than what I paid for it. I don&#x27;t want to go back to the 1970&#x27;s and have no phone. It&#x27;s free markets and inequality that made that phone.')
