Are the numbers used age-standardised? If not you&#x27;re going to see higher rates in countries with an older population. Are they using the same definition for death by suicide?<p>&gt; Rates are very low, statistically speaking.<p>Rates for the US and for Japan are high. Suicide is a mostly preventable death. Suicide is most common among people who are 40 and older, so it takes people well before they&#x27;d die otherwise. Suicide has a large impact on survivors (eg, relatives of the deceased) -- it significantly increases their risk of dying by suicide and it degrades their quality of life.<p>We need to pay more attention to suicide, even if people think the rates are low.')
