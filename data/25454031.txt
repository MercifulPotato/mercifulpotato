To each their own. I don&#x27;t see playing soccer or rock climbing as &quot;distraction&quot;, on the contrary. I mean distraction as in distracting your mind from the present moment.<p>For example, I used to go running and weightlifting while listening to music and podcasts for example, because I was in the mindset of physical exercise == unpleasant &amp; time consuming therefore I must distract myself &quot;to get it over with&quot;.
