Regardless, The non-existence&#x2F;unknowability of literal, absolute, objective truth isn&#x27;t useful. When people say &quot;facts&#x2F;truth&quot;, they not only do not mean that - they, by definition, <i>can not</i> mean that. When people say &quot;facts&#x2F;truth&quot;, they mean it in the context of the tools society has. If we can point something out as &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; and back it up with anything approaching holistic and objective evidence, then it is fair to attempt to do so. The trap of cherry picking to construct one&#x27;s own truth will always lurk, but it&#x27;s ridiculous to simply not engage with the concept of lying because of it.')
