The fact is: Someone has to change their mind and think something new. Either the old or the young.<p>I find the notion that old people are all stupid, racist bastards very insulting, even though I am under 30. Older people tend to be happier, kinder and have more perspective. Imagine how much more wisdom, knowledge and skill people could accumulate if they did not die so young. If they lived, what would Arthur C. Clarke, John von Neumann and Ludwig van Beethoven be up to today?<p>It is true young people in our world are often more radical. For better and worse. And for every good change there are other examples where young people changed the world for the worse. The nazis and communists were quite young when they rose to power.<p>Moreover, I can only reiterate. A fixed world assumption is not valid here. A world with little or no aging will be vastly different.')
