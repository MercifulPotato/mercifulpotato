You were also kind of expected to learn using the &quot;nightly&quot; version of the language, because much of the documentation and stackoverflow answers depended on that.<p>Is this still the case now that we&#x27;re about to enter 2021? Is it OK to learn rust by installing it via &quot;apt install&quot;, or is it still recommended to use rustup? Is it OK to stick just to stable Rust or should I expect that I will need to install the nightly version at some point?')
