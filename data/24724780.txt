What does validity even mean here? I was never told I had to check in with you when making decisions. Before docker I remember spending tons of time setting up dependencies locally on machines when starting a new job, or maintaining puppet scripts to do so. And then since machines change over time, and run a different OS, your dev environment never quite matches prod. A $500 CPU is drastically cheaper than the bugs, headache, and time suck of maintaining a dev env.')
