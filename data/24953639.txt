Newer cars seem more and more to require specialized tools or equipment and are harder to debug. \n Generally the maintenance &#x2F; repair process is aimed at shops and professionals, not the end user.  This specialization is brittle, and unlikely to survive any significant systemic shocks.  We&#x27;ve been locking ourselves into this model for decades, and I don&#x27;t see an easy way out.<p>I look forward to some high quality open source EV hardware becoming available eventually.  That&#x27;s probably when I&#x27;ll get an electric car.')
