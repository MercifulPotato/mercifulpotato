That&#x27;s been on the table for along time, and we even have a nascent xargs from a contributor (that has languished -- I need help!)<p>Let&#x27;s discuss on the issue if interested: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oilshell&#x2F;oil&#x2F;issues&#x2F;843" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oilshell&#x2F;oil&#x2F;issues&#x2F;843</a><p>Oil is easy to prototype (it&#x27;s just Python code), so anyone who wants to make this feature their own should feel free to dive in :)<p>A lot of people have ideas, which may or may not be implementable with fork(), wait(), pipe() and dup().  Anything that can be done safely with those syscalls is basically viable.<p>The syntax is generally the easy part compared to the runtime execution.  Oil has first-class blocks already which will help a lot.<p>----<p>Related: I also want to fix redirect and here doc syntax (in a compatible way):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oilshell&#x2F;oil&#x2F;issues&#x2F;841" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oilshell&#x2F;oil&#x2F;issues&#x2F;841</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oilshell&#x2F;oil&#x2F;issues&#x2F;832" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oilshell&#x2F;oil&#x2F;issues&#x2F;832</a>')
