Once you&#x27;re rich enough you could only take compensation every other (3rd&#x2F;5th&#x2F;etc) year and pay property tax only then. Unlike compensation once the property tax year&#x27;s gone it&#x27;s gone, there&#x27;s no deferring situation (eg, vis a vis deferring comp where the big chunk in later years would still be taxed)<p>It&#x27;s not an unusual situation in urban CA for an elderly person to have bought a house currently worth many millions back in the day for &lt;$100k. Downsizing for them means still spending many hundreds of thousands of dollars, far beyond the tax basis of their current home. I think the current system encourages (or at least doesn&#x27;t disincentivize) older folks with expensive homes to sell and downsize, meaning the tax basis for that same home will increase a whole bunch for the new buyer (since tax basis is recast as the purchase price when sold), ultimately driving more tax revenue.')
