From the point of view of a single organization, raising a small amount of money may not serve as an efficient means to making a better world. Put another way, there is a non-linear relationship between money raised and impact.<p>When I think about giving money to an organization for a cause, I think about (at least): the efficiency of the organization; the importance of the cause; concentration (versus dilution) of <i>resources</i>; and concentration (versus dilution) of <i>power</i>.<p>For example, consider the difference between:<p>A. 1 million people giving $5 to one of 10,000 organizations evenly.<p>B. 1 million people giving $5 to one of 10 organizations evenly.<p>I&#x27;m not generally saying which allocation is better; I&#x27;m simply pointing out how concentration of donations makes a big difference. An organization with $500K can tackle different kinds of problems than one with $500.')
