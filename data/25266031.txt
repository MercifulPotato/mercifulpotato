My wife and I are exhausted after both working from home and pandemic parenting&#x2F;homeschooling every day. By the time the kids are asleep (10:30 for the older one) we &quot;need&quot; some time to veg on the couch, and end up going to bed at 11:30, when really we would have been better off going to bed 45 minutes earlier.<p>But the &quot;me time&quot; trap makes us somehow believe that the hour or so we spend on our phones is necessary for us, when in fact it&#x27;s stupid, wasted time, reading about politics or being on Twitter of whatever.<p>(Ok, we also have been teaching ourselves the piano, and playing chess and stuff, but many nights we still feel like we &quot;deserve&quot; some brain-dead &quot;me time.&quot;)')
