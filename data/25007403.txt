But even learning a language natively is done that way: you don&#x27;t give babies grammar books.<p>We do that as programmers as well: we get familiar with a syntax&#x2F;grammar just enough so that we could get to reading source code, learning idioms to <i>do things</i> such as open a file, or make a request, or use a regex. The quick tutorial + cookbook works very well in programming.<p>This is one reason I lean towards Stephen Krashen&#x27;s work on language acquisition, and his &quot;input hypothesis&quot;[0].<p>The way I learned every language was by consuming content that increased in complexity and variety. Patterns were acquired.<p>- [0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Input_hypothesis" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Input_hypothesis</a>')
