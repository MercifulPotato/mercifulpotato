It&#x27;s only on paper.<p>You have to be a cripple or not worked for like a year or two in order to be eligible for some very minimal sum a month, and even that is taken away from you if you don&#x27;t actively look for work and haven&#x27;t found it in 6 to 18 months.<p>The whole thing is crafted in a way that unless you are living in shanty towns and rely on your relatives stealing food and clothes for you, then you will not want to descend that low on the social ladder just to get something like 200 EUR or so. And that implicit and indirect discouragement works really well; people just don&#x27;t bother pursuing social help because it&#x27;s meaningless and 99% of the time you won&#x27;t get it anyway. Only the gypsies are persistent in it.<p>It&#x27;s every man for himself here in EE. I am not complaining by the way; I&#x27;ve never known any other state of things so I don&#x27;t actually care about social safety nets at all. But when we here in EE heard about the &quot;Corona stimulus packages&quot; (basically you get money because of the pandemic even if you didn&#x27;t lose a job) then a lot of us couldn&#x27;t help but laugh at the absurdity of the idea that something like that would ever happen here.')
