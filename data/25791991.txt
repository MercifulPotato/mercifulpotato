If someone decides they want to write a high performance, easy to use, cross platform native application and complain about C++ or Rust being too complicated, then they should find an easier job.<p>I disagree. I follow a lot of game developers and you&#x27;d be hard pressed to say they don&#x27;t do high-performance corss-platform native application development. They almost universally think C++ (and by extension Rust) are too complicated. They generally use C++ anyway because that&#x27;s the industry standard, but they think there is definitely a conceptually less-complicated way to do things.<p>See: Jonathan Blow and Casey Muratori, for instance. The former is so sick of C++ he&#x27;s making his own programming language, and the latter routinely complains about C++&#x27;s complexity and eschews all but the simplest features of it.')
