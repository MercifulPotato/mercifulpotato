K certainly isn&#x27;t faster than C. If you have a C guru, they should always be able to write faster code than K.<p>The difference is it should be a lot easier for someone like me (not a C guru) to write a K program that does something useful. I&#x27;ll also be able to see the whole program as it will likely be a few lines long. If I wrote some C code, it would take me forever and take forever to debug. I see this as similar to any scripting language (Ex: Python).')
