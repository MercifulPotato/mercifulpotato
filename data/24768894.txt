It happens. And it happens much more frequently when being in tech is part of your identity, like being actively in politics, or saving the oceans. A strong proposal is likely to cause a strong reaction, sometimes negative.<p>But while I understand why being &quot;political&quot; may be part of someone&#x27;s identity, I am more skeptical it is needed for a techie to have &quot;tech&quot; as part of their identity.')
