Sure, it&#x27;s <i>more</i> money if it&#x27;s customized, but ads can be non-personalized; even can be entirely embedded in the app, no network needed whatsoever - that&#x27;s the old newspaper model, and that worked for years.<p>If the upside to that model is that you manage to become the defacto platform across ios and android, I suspect the reduced add revenue is easily worth it.<p>Facebook simply wants <i>more</i>, now that they have the somewhat captive audience.')
