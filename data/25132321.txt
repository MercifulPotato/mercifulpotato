The expiration date doesn&#x27;t mark any meaningful real-world event that indicates the private key might be compromised... it&#x27;s just an expiration date. Why set off all the alarms and make the user freak out and make it so hard to visit the site as soon as the certificate becomes 1 millisecond too old? It seems to violate common sense.')
