This is explained at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11662380" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11662380</a> and the links back from there. Note that I described it as &quot;long-running&quot; and that was 4.5 years ago. None of this is secret.<p>I haven&#x27;t looked at the article but if a mod chose it for second-chance submission that&#x27;s because they thought it might interest the community, not because we care about &quot;pro-mask antidotes&quot;. The complete list of stories hasn&#x27;t been published yet (it&#x27;s on my list, I just haven&#x27;t gotten to it), but you can see a subset of them at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;invited" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;invited</a>. That&#x27;s entirely representative of the sort of stories we choose, and if anybody notices any bias in there at all, other than towards what HN might find intellectually interesting, I&#x27;d love to hear about it.<p>As for <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25320778" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25320778</a>, it set off the flamewar detector. No mod touched it.')
