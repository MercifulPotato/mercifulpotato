It is there to teach us critical thinking, and consequently, how to be a good citizen. An educated population is also less prone to fall into totalitarianism. Ex: Nazi Germany and Mao&#x27;s China burned books and persecuted the educated (1984 style).<p>Frankly, this sounds absurd. Having just been through this educational enlightenment I can tell you that&#x27;s definitely not what schools do. Higher education like a bachelor&#x27;s or master, sure. Definitely, even. But high school? Not at all.<p>It&#x27;s a lesson in rote memorisation of the _true truth_ which we know is true because _the teacher said it_. It is the opposite of critical thinking. And if I were a totalitarian vying for my own state I&#x27;d leave the high school system exactly as is, perhaps change the history books a bit.')
