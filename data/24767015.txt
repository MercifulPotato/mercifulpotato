I remember where it was claimed that OOP UI api&#x27;s could &quot;last forever&quot; because they were an abstract interface rather than implementation. However, they couldn&#x27;t handle the stateless-ness of the web because OOP is inherently stateful. It&#x27;s almost like having a printer API that assumes a color printer, and suddenly it&#x27;s being asked to translate into black and white. You&#x27;ll lose output meaning without reworking everything. Abstraction usually has to make assumptions, and these assumptions may turn out wrong down the road.<p>Re: <i>no one wants to budget for those activities</i><p>True. That&#x27;s one thing an org can and should plan for: money to pay for upgrading. In other words, you cannot predict future technology, but you <i>can</i> safely predict that adjusting to the future requires resources the vast majority of the time.')
