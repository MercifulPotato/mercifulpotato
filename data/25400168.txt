It is able to make IPv4 connections, which rather than going over the IPv6 route, are instead tunnelled to the network separately via the modem and the network applies CGNAT and assigned an ephemeral source IPv4.<p>I&#x27;ve described some of the NAT behaviour here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25399780" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25399780</a><p>I also I also use Three for my 4G+Wifi home router.  That doesn&#x27;t get an IPv4 at the moment, just an IPv6.  None of my home devices can make IPv6 connections over the LAN to my internet services.  They resolve ok, but then have no route.<p>Same applies when using my phone as a Wifi hotspot.  The hotspot is IPv4 only, even though the phone itself has an IPv6 uplink.<p>Now I know it&#x27;s an experimental partial rollout by Three, I wonder if I&#x27;d see the opposite if I swapped the two SIMs.')
