You screwed legs to it (sold separately), and thus had a simplest possible desk. Also, I agree that it was cheap, but it was a piece of furniture that has already shown signs of wear after a year and was ready for landfill after 3 years of usage. Under Polish law, I could probably successfully sue IKEA for selling me faulty product, because I could reasonably argue in court that no furniture, no matter how cheap, should be expected to last only 3 years. I mean, desks are not socks.')
