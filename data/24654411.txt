Ethically I wouldn&#x27;t work for two competing companies.<p>I agree there are tech jobs that are way more demanding, its true that I may have found good situations. I think theres also some truth to the fact that if you put your phone on do not disturb, and just concentrate on your work you can get a lot done. It also helps that although Im not a particularly talented developer, I do have almost 2 decades of experience so typically its just coding and not much research.<p>This can be tedious to be honest, but at this point in my life I have a family to take care of, Im prioritizing being a good provider over technical challenges that fulfill me.<p>I&#x27;m on pace to pay off my 20 year mortgage in 3 years. Once I&#x27;m debt free I may consider working less and doing something else with my time.')
