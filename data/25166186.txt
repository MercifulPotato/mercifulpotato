Shorting out the cap solved the problem.<p>Since they&#x27;d shipped these boards for a while it was pretty likely nobody was using them.  Since nobody wants to design around a part likely to be cancelled due to poor performance in the market...we figured nobody would be relying on this part.<p>I called it a &quot;pullup capacitor&quot; because it was where you&#x27;d expect to see a pullup resistor  and thus the name is funny.')
