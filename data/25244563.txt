Am I misunderstanding your point?<p>As someone you&#x27;d probably describe as a climate skeptic, I think governments are capitalising expertly on this. They have hysterical populations literally begging for bigger and broader taxation; all they have to do is not be greedy. Exploit as much as they can get away with, and no more. That means pandering to the cronyists and greenies begging for taxes (that they won&#x27;t pay) under the guise of environmentalism, without getting so carried away that the working class father decides enough is enough. That&#x27;s what they&#x27;re doing.<p>How is a conspiracy around government inaction going to work when I read about new regulations, committees, levies and taxes every time I open a newspaper?')
