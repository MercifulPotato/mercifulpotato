Even professional photo studios I&#x27;ve worked with always save their files (usually to TIFF), open them in a previewer to double-check then and then send them to the printer directly.<p>This isn&#x27;t one of those &quot;FOSS devs sticking to the UNIX philosophy to a fault, usability be damned&quot; situations. Printing is the kind of thing that is either done so rarely that the literally only two extra clicks aren&#x27;t going to matter or so frequently that you want to be using a batch workflow anyways.<p>No offense if it just didn&#x27;t occur to you at the time (I&#x27;ve been there), but &quot;I&#x27;ll just save the image and print that&quot; is something that I image the vast, vast majority of computer users could figure out in no time and is surely not a significant factor in Adobe&#x27;s market dominance.')
