They are way too into rewriting things for the sake of rewriting things.  You <i>have</i> to read the release notes because a routine pip upgrade can kill your whole installation.  In the five years, I&#x27;ve run it, they have 1) Introduced, rebranded, and retired a recommended install method. 2) Completely redone the web architecture. 3) Completely redone the Z-Wave architecture. 4) Routinely release UI features that are just placeholders and useless.<p>This has ramifications when you&#x27;re searching for a problem.  Often examples on blog sites or Stack Overflow are obsolete after only a few months.<p>Second, they are trying to target a wider audience by moving functionality and maintenance to the web interface, but they are so far away from this, it will take years.  They are trying to get around the inherent linux-ness of their project, which is a huge undertaking.  Troubleshooting pretty much still requires journalctl.  Because of this attempt hide away its linuxness, Home Assistant is now in an obnoxious state where some actions require you to start it in the web interface, but then you need to ssh in to finish the job.<p>Take deleting a Z-Wave node.  You first have to Delete it in the UI.  Some parts of it though, never work.  The &quot;Delete&quot; button is greyed out.  So then you have to ssh in and vi into the configuration file to delete it from config files.<p>Finally, the communication in terms of the UI and documentation are overly abstract.  Everything is done in terms of &quot;entities&quot; and &quot;nodes.&quot;  When you add a Z-Wave device, you get an entry for it in entities, nodes, switches, Z-Wave, and devices panels.  After five years, I can&#x27;t succinctly tell you the difference between them.<p>Do I use Home Assistant still?  Yes.  It still is the most flexible and open product out there.  Would I recommend it?  If the user did not have a background in linux, I would definitely not recommend it.  My biggest pet peeve with this project is how many people recommend HA regardless of audience, not taking into account the Linux knowledge required.  HA is not a magic pill.')
