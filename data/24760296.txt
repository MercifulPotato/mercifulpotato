I&#x27;ve been working for my current employer for over 30 years.  I&#x27;m not doing side projects to impress recruiters.  It&#x27;s an extenuation of the love of programming I picked up when I was first exposed to a Tandy Level I at my local junior high school.<p>I enjoy going hiking or going swimming in a lake or river or going to movies with friends when that was still a thing, but it&#x27;s mostly experiencing, whereas programming side projects is creating.
