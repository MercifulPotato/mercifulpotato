PDFs don&#x27;t behave exactly the same everywhere for things that goes beyond just reading documents. For example, I had a reply on the PDF that was visible on Preview but vanished when you tried to read on Acrobat Reader, that caused a lot of trouble with the publisher that claimed I didn&#x27;t answer... YMMV with regarding to these features and them working across apps.')
