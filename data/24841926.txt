Installation and&#x2F;or execution of software constitutes copying (the &quot;RAM Copy Doctrine&quot;) which is only lawful if the person currently using the software has been licensed or sold the software<p>2. Licensing restrictions can restrict license holders from exercising rights they otherwise would have as a matter of law<p>There is nothing prohibiting you from only licensing your software out under terms that prohibit licensees from exercising fair use or first sale rights. Indeed, this is one of Oracle&#x27;s main &quot;innovations&quot;: ever since Larry Ellison failed to get David DeWitt fired for daring to benchmark Oracle, they just made everyone who buys Oracle promise not to benchmark it. This is legally sound and the only way around it is to argue that the software transaction was actually a sale and not a license - as far as I&#x27;m aware, though, nobody has been able to successfully articulate such a claim.')
