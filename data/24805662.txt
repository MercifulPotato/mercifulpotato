The manufacturer does that for you, so you can obtain the required document quite easily for your car.<p>Aftermarket parts are regulated - you can&#x27;t install what you want, it needs to be certified for your specific make and model (and motor variant, etc.) - otherwise your car is not legal anymore.<p>This applies to chip tuning as well. Since you&#x27;re modifying a certified part, it looses the certification - obviously.<p>What new cars are allowed to emit, is strictly regulated.<p>Further, since this very month, we have a carbon-based tax on new cars (based upon the aforementioned certification from the manufacturer). Thus if the emissions of car are changed, you&#x27;re basically evading taxes as well.<p>Where I live, chip tuning is almost only done to get a few HP on the cheap. And it is unfortunately very popular and nobody really cares.<p>Edit: You can seek in individual certification for <i>some</i> modifications, added to your documentation, but a tampered with ECU is not one of them I think.')
