Item(by='PragmaticPulp', descendants=None, kids=[24829689, 24827230], score=None, time=1603117365, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24825860, text='The issue is that the bug was technically in a 3rd-party dependency:<p>&gt; even though the main fault that lead to RCE was due to a bug in Electron (CVE-2020-15174)<p>This may seem like an irrelevant detail if you’ve never operated a bug bounty program before, but you have to consider the incentives.<p>Paying researchers for bugs in 3rd-party open source software creates misaligned incentives. If you’re a security researcher and you discover a security bug in Electron, you have two choices:<p>1) Follow proper protocol to create a CVE, coordinate a fix, and properly disclose the issue through appropriate channels.<p>2) Keep the vulnerability secret and unfixed while you shop it around bug bounty programs looking for kind companies who will pay out for 3rd-party issues. To maximize profits, it’s important that you keep the security issue unfixed and secret as long as possible while you work your way across bug bounty programs.<p>The second option is a little publicized negative externality of bug bounty programs that don’t draw the line at 3rd-party dependencies. I’ve even had bug bounty participants beg us to not fix upstream code yet because they were still trying to collect bounties from other companies.<p>This is also why it’s important to have your security team read every CVE immediately and check against your software. It’s also why bug bounty programs don’t pay out as much, or even at all, for security issues that come from popular 3rd-party dependencies used across the industry.')
