Really, it’s extraordinary - sell a FSD package (before there’s any proof it’s even technically possible in the operating life of the vehicle) and then roll out random features and claim they meet the original commitment.<p>And, even better, their customers love them for it.<p>I could never do this - I would see it as an act of breathtaking dishonesty.
