But &quot;the South&quot; is diverse. Atlanta has a very large LGBT community (both in absolute terms and as a percentage) and culture that is completely different from areas just an hour away. It&#x27;s very possible that you and the people you are talking to had completely different experiences.<p>Both of you are almost certainly overgeneralizing your experiences when you say &quot;the South&quot;.<p>People who live in the South get upset that the country likes to pretend that the rest of the country outside a few urban centers is any different. That is, if you had left the South for the rural or suburban Midwest or most of Pennsylvania, you&#x27;d likely have had a similar experience.')
