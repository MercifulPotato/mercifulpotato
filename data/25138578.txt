Likely some people could be offended and some people wouldn&#x27;t. The more relevant question is, should we care about those people&#x27;s feelings. We could apply this suggested rationale to any hypothetical or actual use of language. What people find offensive tends to be deeply personal. Look at comedians who tell a joke that &#x27;cross a line&#x27; -- some people will say it&#x27;s nothing, some people will say it was far too much. Interpretation and judgment of offensiveness is largely shaped by individual life experience.')
