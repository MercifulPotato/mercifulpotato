Item(by='kmeisthax', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606684831, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25244692, text='Adobe Flash&#x2F;Animate provided a best-in-class animation and vector art package that still has little competition. Animate can actually export to HTML5, but they didn&#x27;t bother using the SVG&#x2F;SMIL animation model. Instead, they pre-render everything as a series of spritesheets and render them to a canvas.<p>I can see <i>why</i> they did this - the SVG and canvas vector rendering models are different enough to make blindly rendering SWF content to it cause rendering artifacts. (It&#x27;s one of our biggest longstanding bugs in Ruffle - canvas masks just look weird.) However, Adobe could have ameliorated this either in the exporter, the authoring environment, or by pushing for Flash-style mask options in web standards that deal with vector rendering. Instead, they went with the far worse but quicker option of prerendering so they could say &quot;hey we totally do HTML5 now&quot;.')
