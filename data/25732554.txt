Item(by='davewritescode', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610386810, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25732002, text='&gt; This is precisely my point! Who gets to decide what&#x27;s reasonable discourse?<p>If it escalates to violence it&#x27;s not reasonable, that&#x27;s it.  It gets muddy around state sponsored violence but the assumption is that we already have controls around that.  I think that&#x27;s a reasonable line to draw.  If I go on Twitter and make specific threats to other users I believe that Twitter is within reason to prevent me from using their platform.<p>&gt; I hate these idiots. Most reasonable people do. They&#x27;re dangerous (not as dangerous as the US military, but I still wouldn&#x27;t cross them). My objection is to the structural&#x2F;cultural development of a tiny handful of companies amassing for themselves a huge cultural and epistemological power. They&#x27;re increasingly able to shape reality in ways 20th century culture industry couldn&#x27;t even dream of.<p>I agree with most of what you&#x27;re saying.  We as a society have handed over what I believe to be the vast majority of our day to day communication to a handful of companies that have no motive in mind other than profit.  Social media has been shaping our society for the worse in way less overt ways for the last 15 years by driving eyeballs to controversial posts&#x2F;topics to keep up engagement.<p>I&#x27;m not pretending to have the answers, what I&#x27;m trying to point out is the phenomenon of big companies avoiding hosting questionable content is not new.  What is new is the ubiquity of social media in our lives and politics.<p>I think we&#x27;re better without it personally.')
