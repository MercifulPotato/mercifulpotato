My process is I wash my pan with soap and water, with a sponge. I don&#x27;t need special equipment. I don&#x27;t need to oil it afterwards. There&#x27;s enough seasoning, it&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;m using oil next time I cook.<p>Other people seem to have a bigger problem with burnt-on bits than I do. I don&#x27;t know why that is, but I&#x27;m inclined to trust my process.<p>Also I like washing all the cooking oil off so I don&#x27;t have used oil sitting around going rancid. Surfactants are good for that.<p>Acidic stuff is also fine. If my pan looks thirsty afterwards, I&#x27;ve got the squirt bottle and paper towels, it&#x27;s easy. Cast iron is the least sensitive, most versatile tool in my kitchen. I&#x27;m not babying it.')
