How is kakoune&#x27;s multiple cursors support better than that? How cool is it, so to speak?<p>I haven&#x27;t used the vim plugin but if vim commands work on each selection that probably gets you half way. Kakoune additionally provides &#x27;s&#x27; and &#x27;S&#x27; commands to sub select down from your selection iteratively. you might select all words, then select the _ in each word, delete the character and hit ~ to capitalize the next character to convert a selection of words in snake_case to camelCase. I think it&#x27;s cool.<p>&gt;Btw the reason I haven&#x27;t tried kakoune yet is that the command is `kak`, which means &#x27;shit&#x27; in my native language, Dutch.<p>I&#x27;ve actually heard this either on a forum, mailing list or a github issue at least once, lol. It&#x27;s unfortunate.')
