It&#x27;s evident from their marketing that there is no attempt to discern fancy cruise control from &quot;zomfg your car will drive you around in a year!!&quot;<p>Whether this is false advertising or even just moral is up in the air, but Tesla is making no attempts at educating consumers about the limits of their autonomy other than the bare minimum (yeah you technically <i>have</i> to keep both hands on the wheel, but that mechanism is easily defeated and you can even buy clips on Amazon that do it for you).
