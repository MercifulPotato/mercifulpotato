Also disclaimer that I&#x27;m not religious.<p>Off topic: This reminds me of what annoys me about &quot;Intelligent Design&quot; vs science.<p>It&#x27;s always about how the Earth is 6000 years old, he&#x2F;she&#x2F;they created all animals separately with no evolution, etc, etc.<p>And likewise what came before the big bang? Ultra dense, hot steady state? And before that?<p>While If I were any denominational god, I&#x27;d have created the rule set and frameworks for the entire system and then boot it up.<p>Why can&#x27;t &quot;god&quot; have created the big bang, evolution, the physics ruleset and just let it play out?<p>Of course we&#x27;ll never get the answer to any of that before (or not) the inevitable event horizon of death, but I don&#x27;t get the antagonism within the evangelical movement... other than the obvious loss of power to secularity and science&#x2F;agnosticism.<p>End of rant.')
