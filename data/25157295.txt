If the effective reproduction (R) of your country&#x27;s population is below 1 it won&#x27;t spread there, even if the rest of the world is letting it run wild and free.<p>And it&#x27;s likely we can get R below 1 for any given population with just strict mask usage and curtailing some higher risk social activities.  That&#x27;s my argument.  We don&#x27;t need to do messy lockdowns, ruin our social lives, etc.  If everyone just got on board with those simple measures instead of being selfish.')
