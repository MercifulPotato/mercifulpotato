No need to convince me of that.<p>What I don&#x27;t accept it the double standard. I don&#x27;t live in the US, but elsewhere in the West and I see sometimes on the news &quot;this country is racist because X happened blah blah blah&quot; and when you zoom out and actually look at it we have some of the most diverse populations living side by side in harmony with relatively little tension and an extremely welcoming attitude in general. You go elsewhere in the world and it&#x27;s not even close to the level we&#x27;re on as it&#x27;s a lot of monoculture and not much immigration, mostly people emigrating towards places like where we&#x27;re from. So there is no or very little culture of accepting that other types of people live where you live and that&#x27;s ok. If you hold both places to the same standard the non-Western countries are racist AF in comparison.<p>If it&#x27;s all just biology and that&#x27;s the norm, I&#x27;m just going to go back to that norm right here in the West. Oh wait... I can&#x27;t because that would be racist.<p>I know 1000x over that it&#x27;s absolutely the case that biologically speaking this is the natural state of things and you can never hope to override it at the deepest levels. But I bet my bottom dollar if immigration&#x2F;emigration we&#x27;re to reverse the places that became the new melting pots would be forced to lose those defaults as the West has. The only difference between us is they&#x27;ve never had large enough groups of people jumping up and down and getting in their face about it enough for it to change the cultural norms. We have.<p>I&#x27;m pretty tired of the End Racism narrative in the West because of this double standard. It&#x27;s like wait... If I were to go to your country and try to live the life you live here I&#x27;d get nowhere close to the acceptance and treatment you get here yet WE&#x27;RE the bad guys? Like fuck off. If people want to end racism there&#x27;s lower hanging fruit than the West which is comparatively doing amazing.')
