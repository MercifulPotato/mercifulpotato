They then sell them to rich people who pay 5x for taste and the feeling of eating local. It&#x27;s a quality-differentiated product, not a solution to food scarcity or security.<p>Until someone can grow cash crops, vertical isn&#x27;t gonna make a dent, and it&#x27;s gonna be really hard when competing with the free rain, free sun, and insane automation available for field agriculture already. Even Plenty with SoftBank&#x27;s extra &#x27;nutrients&#x27; tops out at strawberries.
