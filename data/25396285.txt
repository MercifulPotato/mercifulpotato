Item(by='ehsankia', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607756374, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25395881, text='I did know that, thank you for blindly assuming I didn&#x27;t.<p>First off, the reason why so many of these lawsuits are dismissed for procedural mistakes is because they are taken by awful lawyers, since real election lawyers don&#x27;t want to touch these with a 10 foot pole.<p>Secondly, again, while they claim fraud on social media and on TV, the lawyers actually don&#x27;t claim fraud in court, as that&#x27;s much harder to prove, and affidavits are just hearsay when it comes to proving fraud. The reality is that so far, across 50+ lawsuits, they haven&#x27;t managed to show any real proof of anything.<p>You explained the two SC ones but still fail to explain how the other 50 or more failed, or why none of them have been able to present any real evidence. Why is it that they all have lack of standing? Because you can&#x27;t overturn an entire election based on an affidavit of someone claiming they saw trucks full of ballots, with zero other evidence. And rightly so.<p>As for the Texas case, what a coincidence that such a baseless suit happen to have been brought by the Texas AG, who is coincidentally under investigation by the FBI, and is seeking a pardon from the President.<p>I&#x27;m honestly curious what YOU think the reason is. Is it just pure bad luck that all 50+ lawsuits just failed in the most miserable way? Is the court system broken? If they have real solid evidence (and no, someone signing an affidavit is not it), then where is it? Why have we not seen any yet?<p>But go ahead and assume it&#x27;s because of censorship if it makes you happy.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;d also add that many of these cases are dismissed early because, even the defense can show that even if everything the plaintiff claims is true, it still isn&#x27;t enough. In most of these cases, Trump&#x27;s team is trying to use irregularity with a 1-2 ballots to throw out hundreds of thousands of ballots, and that&#x27;s just not how it works. That&#x27;s why all those lawsuits are being dismissed without even being heard because even if they prove their point, they cannot overturn the election.')
