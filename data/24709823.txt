From qhat I&#x27;ve seen they&#x27;re pretty accurate and it&#x27;d be very low physical effort.<p>Although I think think the better answer here would be just using a keyboard. Use a keyboard layout like colemak. Support your arms somehow. Use software that support keyboard only use. And use macros to make things you can&#x27;t do or complex tasks easier.')
