If almost everyone of the same gender has the same fear, is it then a personal one? Isn&#x27;t it reasonable to assume it to be the result of structural&#x2F;cultural causes? Isn&#x27;t that a problem by itself which is worthwhile to address regardless if the fear is founded or not.<p>Sure, we should try to overcome our fears if they limit us, but I would claim, as a society we would be better of, if there wouldn&#x27;t be a need in the first place.<p>And yes, that applies to both genders, it just happens to be if we talk about career topics, it is usually one gender, that gets the short stick.<p>If we look at emotional problems (suicide, crimes) it is the other.')
