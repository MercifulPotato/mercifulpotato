Without that, we&#x27;re just eyeballing the auto-labels and saying &quot;looks good I guess!&quot;<p>Obviously we should expect that the auto-labeler fails on the test set, because we assume we&#x27;re exploiting some convenience that won&#x27;t be available at test time.  But we should still try - it might reveal that our task is too easy to need the model we were planning to train, or it might reveal that our test set is not actually representative.')
