It&#x27;s more like if the U.S. accidentally bombs a civilian caravan and the response is &quot;we should stop trying to assassinate terrorists&quot; in other countries.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t call that an &quot;invalid&quot; opinion or critique, and again I would think it&#x27;s an expected reaction. But it would be overly broad, based <i>solely</i> on that incident. Of course we don&#x27;t exist in a vacuum, so I&#x27;d expect that other information would be brought in to support such an argument. Fair enough.<p>However, an argument that draws an isomorphic relationship between the ability to target a document and the ability to target a bomb is probably attempting to draw outside the lines.<p>(Particularly since in this case, it&#x27;s equivalent to the victim of the bombing being the one who is reporting on the incident and quite clearly stating despite what they&#x27;ve been through &quot;I support the thoughtful bombing of terrorists, but that is not what happened in this case.&quot;)')
