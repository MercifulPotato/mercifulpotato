If it&#x27;s in Britain&#x27;s interest to have binding treaties that include outdated and unwanted EU regulatory text, wasn&#x27;t that the status quo? Or if it&#x27;s in Britain&#x27;s interest to not be bound by EU bureaucracy, doesn&#x27;t that mean Britain should not be bound by this treaty? Which of the two is it?<p>What is the principle that determines that this treaty is worth signing but also determines that staying in the EU is not worth it?<p>(Maybe the answer is just &quot;The people demanded Brexit out of a sense of identity, but they don&#x27;t want Brexit as an actual policy, and so this preserves national morale without affecting anything else&quot;?)')
