The lower productivity of those workers becomes a drag on everyone else.<p>Second: this is the worst. Instead of shedding the dead weight it insists on protecting the people who&#x27;ve been paying dues the longest, at the expense of young people.<p>No this is not what I call a just society.<p>A just society is one where people doing more work get more pay.
