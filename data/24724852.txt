From what we can see in this thread, when a recruiter &#x2F; hiring manager &#x2F; HR department makes it a regular practice to ghost interviewed candidates, it has a significant effect on the company&#x27;s reputation - that they lack common decency and respect. It does not seem worth it for whatever time&#x2F;effort they might have saved by such behavior. To put it another way, it seems it&#x27;d be worth spending time and effort to improve the process and experience, to improve such a reputation.')
