The two income households came first. Inflation doesn&#x27;t happen for no reason. It happens because everyone gets more bits of paper so everything costs more bits of paper because there are only so many things.<p>There&#x27;s a huge tax advantage to living in a two income house. Two people earning 30k each will pay significantly less tax than one earning 60k. It&#x27;s very difficult to raise a family with one income now and it&#x27;s tragic. Women are wasting their lives do menial make-work instead of the one thing they all want to do sooner or later but should have done sooner. We&#x27;re failing our women by making them work.')
