Mining is designed to be forever-easy. The coin is _designed_ for rapid deflation.<p>Yes, but the increase in coins is constant.  So as a percentage of available supply, the inflation rate approaches 0%.<p>Right now, there are 128,000,000,000 DOGE in circulation.  The block target for Doge is 1 minute, with a reward of 10,000 DOGE, which gives a yearly minting of 5,256,000,000 doge, which gives and inflation rate of 4.11%.  Next year, another 5.256T gets added, which is an inflation of 3.94%.<p>And of course, since it&#x27;s a cryptocurrency, there are bound to be permanent losses in the supply because of people losing their wallet files.  This is difficult to track because even with a public ledger, there&#x27;s no way to be sure if unspent DOGE is simply not being spent, or if the private key to spend it was lost.')
