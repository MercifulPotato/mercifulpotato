Russia for example, would be willing to escalate a conventional war to a nuclear one in the event of an imminent ground invasion of Moscow.<p>But the most likely wars are not ones of nuclear powers marching onto another&#x27;s capital, but instead wars over bordering countries. Neither Russia nor the US would escalate an invasion of the Baltic&#x27;s, Neither China nor the US would escalate an invasion of Taiwan.<p>Both of these hypothetical wars are potential conflicts because a victory for Russia and China in those conflicts would be extremely advantageous and desirable to the point that even a very low risk of nuclear esculation would be worth it to them.')
