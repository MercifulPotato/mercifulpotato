Something like PySimpleGUI totally misses this point, and juggling different kinds of files will be too complicated for kids.<p>What Scratch doesn&#x27;t get right is the card aspect. It&#x27;s like Hypercard with one card, and the patterns involved in making basic shifts from one mode to another, or one level to another, involve lots of global messages and setup code. It&#x27;s really bad. Making a Choose Your Own Adventure program will be very hard! It&#x27;s my biggest disappointment.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arcade.makecode.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arcade.makecode.com</a> is quite nice, but is more &quot;program&quot; like than Scratch, where I think Hypercard is more &quot;document&quot; like than Scratch... and so MakeCode isn&#x27;t exactly a move in the right direction. MakeCode is better for games, but not good for things that aren&#x27;t games. Scratch is also natural for making videos (Flash-reminiscent), documents, silly music players, etc.')
