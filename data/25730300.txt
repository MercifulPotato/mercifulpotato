Its really hard to make sure tests are fully comprehensive. About the best you could do is generative property-based tests, but then the feedback loop is not great as it may take minutes, hours, days or weeks for a particular problem case to be generated, while the static check would have caught it at compile time or even interactively in your IDE.<p>I don&#x27;t hate dynamic languages, but this is a pretty major weak spot for them, in my personal opinion, and one that&#x27;s bitten me a number of times.')
