Item(by='JadeNB', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609524000, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25603404, text='&gt; There&#x27;s a simple mathematical explanation for that. If we agree that a state diagram is a directed graph consisting of N nodes, then there are N^2 possible transitions (that&#x27;s the definition of a completely connected graph).<p>A state diagram is usually richer than a directed graphâ€”usually the edges are <i>labelled</i>.  This multiplies the number of possible transitions by the number of possible labels.<p>(Also, for anyone interested in comparing with the graph-theoretic terminology, the term &quot;complete graph&quot; (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Complete_graph" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Complete_graph</a>) is often used for undirected graphs with no self-loops, in which case there are only \\binom n 2 possible edges.)')
