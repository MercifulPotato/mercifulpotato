The garbage is not a tool to enable quick growth.  It&#x27;s not a shortcut.  It&#x27;s just garbage.<p>&quot;Technical debt&quot; conversations usually go something like this:<p>Me:  &quot;Could we spend a few hours getting a handle on what the data model should look like?  Maybe rough out a crude ER diagram?&quot;<p>PHB:  &quot;Oh slumdev, you&#x27;re such a Boy Scout.  Just blam it into a document store.  If something changes, we&#x27;ll just be Agile about it.  Technical debt is a tool!&quot;')
