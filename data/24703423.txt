I don&#x27;t know the exact regulation framework that would accomplish my intent but you understand what I mean.<p>I&#x27;m talking about all the people with bonafide degrees and skillsets. 4-year bachelor degrees, PhDs, MDs, and the like. These people should be treated as assets to the country. (Maybe just excluding masters&#x27; degrees is the answer, but I&#x27;m not sure.) It&#x27;s dumbfoundingly stupid as a national policy to invest so much in resources to train a person and then send them back to another country instead of giving them every incentive to stay.<p>Singapore and Australia (and maybe others I don&#x27;t know about) allow international students to apply for permanent residency if they meet certain very reasonable qualifications and it works out very much in their favor for retaining talent.')
