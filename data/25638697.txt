As a Googler (opinions are my own), to get higher ranks, you need to lead larger projects that are cross team (it&#x27;s even in our engineering ladder description) and do leadership type work.<p>BUT, I&#x27;ve met a few people where that is not always true.  They tend to be people that can come up with unique solutions to difficult problems that are actually useful in the long run.  They tend to be people that have PhD&#x27;s and thrive in that type of work (and are actually good at it, while also being able to work as a team).')
