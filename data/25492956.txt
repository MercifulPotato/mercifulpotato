Say, perhaps, black people make you uncomfortable, such that you&#x27;re inclined against hiring them and you preferentially hire whites instead. Then, you wouldn&#x27;t knowingly possess a racist motive but would be definitely acting racist and perpetuating racism.<p>That seems pretty clearly to be a racist motive. &quot;Black people make you uncomfortable&quot; is literally traditional racism, and action taken based on that motive is racist. Doing something like that without thinking through your intentions too hard doesn&#x27;t make the act unintentional, because the intent is there whether you consciously evaluate it or not, and it doesn&#x27;t change the motive. That person <i>wants</i> to be racist, and then directly is.<p>Someone who buys a chicken sandwich only because they want a chicken sandwich has no such motive or intent.')
