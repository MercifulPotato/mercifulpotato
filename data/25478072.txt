Remember one line of a poem? You can probably find the rest. Recall a Douglas Adams piece about rice farming in Bali or Java or something... you can find it. As you say, it took boolean gymnastics. But, that really just means modifying your search terms and scrolling through some results.<p>Being less powerful than 2020 google kind of put more power&#x2F;responsibility in users&#x27; hands. A user needed to use a search engine like a tool.<p>I want what you want too... Everything google (mail&#x2F;search&#x2F;youtube, etc)... but designed for more user effort. Finding the best-for-most result instantly is great, but sometimes you want the tool to help you find a result on page 112 within a few minutes.<p>Bring back a little bit of a directory feel even. Let me narrow down, refine and shape results gradually. Assume that I will rummage through a bunch of crap to find what I want.')
