You already hinted at this somewhat with your &quot;num = num + num&quot; example, surely that&#x27;s just a type system in disguise?<p>And well, personally I view types more like a way to denote pre- and post-conditions (with varying degrees of strictness). And a grammar just tells you what you are allowed to write, it doesn&#x27;t dictate semantics. This becomes a problem when you get stuff like &quot;daily_revenue + temperature&quot;, which <i>grammatically</i> makes perfect sense, but semantically does not. With types this can be fixed (admittedly in this case it might not be worth fixing), in a grammar this seem very hard to forbid.')
