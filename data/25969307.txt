They have clearly defined meanings.<p>Validity means the form of an argument is such that it&#x27;s impossible for its premises to be true while the conclusion is false i.e. if the premises are true then the conclulsion must be true.  Validity is a formal property of arguments and the relationships between premises. An argument can be valid even if its premises are false.<p>Soundness means that an argument is valid <i>and</i> that the premises are true (and therefore the conclusion must be true).<p>These are standard terms that have been used for over a century. You&#x27;re going to generate a lot of confusion if you choose to use them differently to everyone who has ever studied elementary logic.')
