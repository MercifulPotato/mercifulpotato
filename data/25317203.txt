Here&#x27;s a list of some Google products that have been &#x2F; were around for 10 years or more before being killed (or are slated to be killed soon):<p>- Chrome Apps<p>- Cloud Print<p>- Fusion Tables<p>- Youtube Video Annotations<p>- Google Search Appliance (17 years old!!)<p>- Google Showtimes<p>- Google Code<p>- Picasa<p>- Orkut<p>- Postini<p>That&#x27;s not even close to the full list of things that were more than 10 years old when Google shut them down. I left a bunch off for brevity&#x27;s sake - but browsing <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;killedbygoogle.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;killedbygoogle.com</a> is a really eye-opening experience. They really <i>have</i> shut down a lot of stuff - and if you loosen the requirement to &quot;&gt;= 7 years&quot; the list gets very, very long.<p>Again - I understand what you&#x27;re trying to say. But it&#x27;s just not simply a &quot;zero effort joke&quot;. Google has killed a lot of things, and a lot of the things they killed were well used, long lived, and <i>popular</i>.<p>They&#x27;ll keep Google DNS running as long as it provides business value to them, and that&#x27;s it.<p>(Edit: I&#x27;m bad at list formatting, sorry)')
