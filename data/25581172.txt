But in the back of my mind I figured I might be able to make some affiliate revenue out of the traffic but it never took off.<p>It has failed so far because: it is a small niche (most people just use Spotify these days), I haven&#x27;t marketed it very well and haven&#x27;t found the niches where likeminded people hang out (building is definitely easier than marketing). I could definitely do more on the homepage to explain the features, particularly around tracking artists and being notified when they release new albums, but at the end of the day I just haven&#x27;t been able to market it (nor did I spend a lot of time on this aspect of it). For a long time it only worked in the UK (an even smaller audience compared to the global market), although I did just roll out an update for it to work in the US, but have not done anything to advertise the fact.<p>Feedback welcome!')
