My laptop is a mid-2014 MBP.  I can build a kernel about 8x faster on the AMD than in a VM on the mac. So when I&#x27;m away from my desk, I use the MBP to ssh to the AMD and do all my dev there.<p>My biggest problem with my current MBP is that the battery life is down to 1-2 hours.  Less if I have a video call.<p>I could maybe just use a chromebook or windows laptop, but the Mac &quot;just works&quot; for all kinds of corporate stuff and is the path of least resistance.')
