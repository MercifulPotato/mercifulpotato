Item(by='radoslawc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606265380, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25199976, text='&gt; For all metrics my rule of thumb has always been to just do my job as best as I can and ignore the metrics. If a manager ever says anything about them, I ask them what they think of my actual performance.<p>I was like this once. But metrics are not always going in pair with actual performance or logic for that matter. And sometimes manager&#x27;s hands are tied, even though your performance might be good, manager sees your good work etc. \nThat happened to me actually, long story short I was given a lot of complicated cases which resulted in &quot;bad performance&quot; based on case&#x2F;time ratio and by newly implemented corporate performance enhancement program I was downgraded &quot;temporarily&quot; to do grunt work that I magine was like in primary school punishment: &quot;so I had time to think about my behavior&quot;.\nAfter a month I&#x27;ve given my resignation letter, without even having next job (which turned out great move, but that&#x27;s other thing) I was so fed up.')
