Although importing data from a CSV file has migrated from their obtuse &quot;Text Import Wizard&quot; to PowerQuery in the most recent versions of Excel, so more people will be stumbling on it.<p>And also yes, the Power Query Editor interface sucks. It&#x27;s intended to be intuitive for Excel users, which inversely makes it a bit counterintuitive for someone coming from a dev background. The GUI functionality is also pretty limiting and only exposes a fraction of the overall capabilities. That said, there&#x27;s an &quot;Advanced Editor&quot; button in the Ribbon that&#x27;ll open up a modal that&#x27;s far more familiar for a dev; shows you all of the code&#x2F;Steps for the query all at once and has IntelliSense for code completion. Still crude as far as a dev environment goes, but far more productive than flailing around in the GUI the whole time.<p>Since you&#x27;re coming from a dev background, I&#x27;d highly encourage that M primer[1] I referenced. It&#x27;s a crash course on everything that&#x27;s relevant to a developer (type system, error handling, patterns, antipatterns, custom functions, execution logic, etc). Between that and glancing over the standard library[2], you can avoid using the GUI entirely except for when it&#x27;s convenient (such as scaffolding out some tedious stuff to then clean up in the Advanced Editor).<p>&gt; and the performance was painfully slow (compared to an RDBMS).<p>Also of note is that Excel is only one of the data sources PowerQuery supports. There are a ton of others[3], including many RDBMSs natively supported and generic ODBC support if you have the appropriate driver installed.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bengribaudo.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;11&#x2F;17&#x2F;4107&#x2F;power-query-m-primer-part1-introduction-simple-expressions-let" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bengribaudo.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;11&#x2F;17&#x2F;4107&#x2F;power-query-m-p...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;powerquery-m&#x2F;power-query-m-function-reference" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;powerquery-m&#x2F;power-query-m-...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;power-query&#x2F;connectors&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;power-query&#x2F;connectors&#x2F;</a>')
