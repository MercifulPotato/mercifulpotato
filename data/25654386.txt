I distinctly remember reading about PRINT and running to my mom and dad to tell them I could make the computer output something.<p>This was in 1991 or so, and the books were from 1978..... I had no idea even where to TYPE the stuff I was learning into. My dadâ€™s friend came over and gave me Qbasic. 30 years later, I still love to code.')
