Item(by='bumby', descendants=None, kids=[24711086], score=None, time=1602087141, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24709415, text='&gt;<i>donâ€™t represent their interests</i><p>Can you put a finer point on what you mean by &quot;their interests&quot;? Is this relegated to just economic interests?<p>If it extends beyond economics, I see no reason why those two statements can&#x27;t coexist. For example, I can vote against my own economic interest if I vote for higher taxes that I don&#x27;t directly benefit from on the grounds that I want to support a more equitable society. Or I can vote against government run healthcare that I may also benefit from if I don&#x27;t think that is the role of government. Both can be examples of voting against my economic interests to reflect my moral interests.')
