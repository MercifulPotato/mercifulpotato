That means 2b from somewhere else in the market.<p>Questions I&#x27;d have:<p>- even balanced book in my mind means they hedge risk and shouldn&#x27;t lose across the board 30% in a week otherwise they are incompetent... and they seem far from that.<p>- with that in mind, how would they lose 2b in the rest of the market?, that means they dont hedge properly.<p>- As for GME, they didnt do proper risk management but that seems the only place they got blindsided. (Still surprising they had no insurance for a short squeeze...)<p>- Overall the stated losses were 30% of portfolio in a week... with only GME moving... you can see why I assume it was more then 14% and your logic seems flawed.')
