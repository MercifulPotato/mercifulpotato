Just today I&#x27;ve encountered this article from Alibaba [2] in which they state that according to them they developed the first hardware accelerated database system which is used in production:<p>&quot;This marks the first time that hardware acceleration was applied to the storage engine of an OLTP database&quot;.<p>Doing hardware acceleration seems very logical in database systems and I&#x27;m wondering why any FAANG or similar company didn&#x27;t do it before. Unless I&#x27;m mistaken?<p>[1] original HN question - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25006725<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alibabacloud.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;new-insights-into-x-engine-the-new-storage-engine-of-rds-for-mysql_596209')
