Zip ties, several guns, 11 molotov cocktails, 2 pipe bombs.<p>Guliani also asked Tuberville to object to every state which if acted on would have required at least 11 days of 12 hour sessions with an armed angry mob outside.<p>When they finally attacked it took hours to authorize the national guard to defend the capital giving the mob maximum time to terrorize congress.<p>It we examine the possible failure modes in this situation we can imagine.<p>- The mob could have slaughtered burned or blew up our congress or enough to frighten the rest into compliance.<p>- The mob could have destroyed the physical copy of the ballots delaying the matter giving the mob more time to intimidate legislators further.<p>- The legislature might have lost heart over 11 days of being terrorized by the mob outside and come to some compromise like allowing congress to vote on the matter one delegation one vote allowing the republicans to pick the next president.<p>This would have only required all of the republican party and 6 democrats in the house to join to enact. They would simply have had to vote with the republicans to reject 36 states worth of EC votes in order to throw the election to the house.<p>It is foolish to suppose this couldn&#x27;t possibly have succeeded just because they are very very incompetent. They could never have enacted a traditional coup because the military was never on their side. This could actually have worked if our congress had lost heart.<p>This was absolutely an attempted coup and we would be stupid to treat it as less.')
