In software shops it usually seems to look like a few process changes which change what &quot;good&quot; performance looks like, derailing promotions and other career advancement for people not in the know for the new normal.  Coupled with asymmetric expectations e.g. loud criticism of other teams forcing them to move to the new normal while vocally defending their own team.  Usually people who were on their way up just choose to leave at this point rather than slog it out.<p>The best move I&#x27;ve seen in a senior reshuffle is to setup a 1:1 with the new leaders, I&#x27;ve done this with leaders up to 3 managers up.
