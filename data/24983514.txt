Lots of really good points.<p>In a vacuum, I&#x27;m actually totally fine with either option (public transportation or cars) and not particularly married to see either one built or against either one being built and both have their utility. Personally, I think both need to be built. My main concern is really about who is going to pay for it.<p>Such projects really disproportionately benefits those that will be commuting into and out of Seattle and those people in Seattle that live in parts of the city where they don&#x27;t have parking and are likely to live near a station.<p>I&#x27;m a huge proponent of people paying for those services they use and for services to be financially self sustaining.<p>People who take the train should fund the train. People who drive cars should fund the roads and the DMV.<p>Furthermore, the same argument for greater throughput of a system should also support the argument that such a system should generate greater revenue and be naturally self sustaining. But for this to be true, all calculations shouldn&#x27;t be based on theoretical limits but actual predictions of how many more people will be moved per hour per direction and that needs to be compared to the revenues and the costs to figure out if the current design of the system is sustainable (a lesser more modest design might be warranted once faced with the reality of how many riders are actually expected).<p>&gt; It&#x27;s worth noting that this figure is not qualified by how much road projects cost per road user, because this is not meant to be a comparative talking point. Roading projects are just as expensive, if not more due to higher land requirements; yet they are not scrutinized to the same degree.<p>They should get the same scrutiny. One proposed system getting this scrutiny isn&#x27;t an argument that neither should get the same scrutiny.<p>&gt; The SR 99 tunnel we just built cost $3.2B for two lanes in each direction with no exits.<p>And it has tolls, but the tolls should probably be 3x higher than they currently are. Every system, roads or rail, should pay for itself. Any system that isn&#x27;t priced appropriately is distorting the market and making it harder to figure out the true cost and plan effectively.<p>One thing I would love to see adopted in the US is a public transportation tolling system like they have in Japan where you pay for distance traveled and the cost of your commute in general.<p>In the interest of stating my biases, personally, I purchased a home in a part of Seattle that is unlikely to ever see much if any benefit from a subway system. I&#x27;m familiar with the geotechnical concerns where I live and the only public transportation which will ever serve my home and my neighborhood is likely to be a bus (this is not too dissimilar to the reason why Beacon Hill will also not benefit). I am, however, in favor of buses and would also like to see investment long term in smart streets that provide a foundation of an autonomous vehicle system.<p>Lastly, thanks for engaging in good faith discussion unlike other commenters here.')
