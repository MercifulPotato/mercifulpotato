Ie, I could already run my arbitrary function from the CLI by building a simple wrapper that reads a JSON file and sends it in. Or wrap it in a simple HTTP server.<p>The debugging story using that tool is worse than how I would already do it pre-SAM and they don&#x27;t even have documentation for every runtime they officially support:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;serverless-application-model&#x2F;latest&#x2F;developerguide&#x2F;serverless-sam-cli-using-debugging.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;serverless-application-model&#x2F;lat...</a><p>It doesn&#x27;t allow you to test any of the interesting bits, which is what the blog post was alluding to.<p>- What happens if I have an SQS Lambda with 100 concurrency and a few of the containers get into a bad state? Do the other ones keep going or does the whole thing grind to a halt?<p>- What happens if I have a Lambda that consumes from 50 Kinesis shards and some of the containers get into a bad state?<p>- What happens if my Lambda throws an exception, what happens to my SQS message or Kinesis record?<p>If you outsource the plumbing you can&#x27;t actually test the system locally you can only test &quot;units&quot; of it and in a lot of cases you either have to do remote tests with print debugging to figure out what&#x27;s going on or what is more common is blindly assume the plumbing works how you intend, ship it to Prod and then fix problems as they occur.')
