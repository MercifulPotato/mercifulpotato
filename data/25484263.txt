We could get to an automated society with far less pain and much faster if it was decided collectively though.<p>I disagree. I think we have decided collectively to progress towards automation as fast as possible without unduly impacting people&#x27;s quality of life.<p>&gt; Look at car automation: if a city wanted to make automated cars a reality in their streets, there are tons of accommodations they could do: from radio beacons to official maps, standards on how to signal construction work, purposefully designed roads...<p>I believe there already are official maps and standardized signs in the developed world. I agree that incremental improvement is possible and desirable, I also think people are working on these things already. It is possible that signs could be redesigned to make them easier for machines to read but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s much of a bottleneck.<p>&gt; Instead, we are trying to design automated cars with the assumption that zero efforts will be made to promote them.<p>I see lots of effort to promote them, they just aren&#x27;t technologically ready to perform at scale yet.')
