It&#x27;s actually an interesting system, where an alphabet (abjad, sort of) exists, but is not usually used in isolation from pictographic writing, nor can most Egyptian words be expressed entirely pictographically. For example, &quot;Nile&quot; is written &quot;i t r w picture-of-water.&quot; &quot;Sun&quot; can be written as either a picture of the sun (with a single stroke added, indicating it is a logogram) or as &quot;r &#x27; picture-of-sun.&quot; The &#x27; is the common transliteration for the arm hieroglyph, and my understanding is that it&#x27;s likely pronounced something like the Arabic ayin.')
