I took a computer architecture class in Jan-Feb this year, and it was one of my favorite things in a long time. I&#x27;ve written software for ~6 years but I didn&#x27;t really know much about how CPUs work, what an instruction is, what registers are, etc. so I learned a <i>lot</i>.<p>I thought a lot of these details could be boring or hard to grasp, but it was the oppositeâ€”to me, things like how logic gates worked, how we remember values between computer cycles were all very fascinating, especially compared to the kind of work I&#x27;ve done for a long time.<p>I&#x27;ve learned a bit more about operating systems and databases since then, and I think knowing a bit of computer architecture helped me understand several topics in much better depth. So even if knowing these things doesn&#x27;t have a very direct ROI in terms of getting a job, I think it&#x27;s worth spending the time to learn at least the basics.')
