Security, scalability and ease-of-use is practically solved in PHP.<p>PHP is inherently stateless, making it easy to scale up. Facebook has had pretty close to a 100% availability rate since launch and PHP is still responsible for large swathes of their functionality.<p>Most people attacking PHP read a snarky article written in 2012 about PHP&#x27;s limitations and cannot actually provide reasoning for why it&#x27;s so awful.<p>Wikipedia, huge portions of online retail, forums and Facebook. Are these things inherently less secure or available than companies with a &quot;modern&quot; stack? Not really, in fact pretty much the opposite.<p>I&#x27;ll let you in on a little secret: your customers could not care less about your shiny modern stack. As long as it&#x27;s not preventing performance, security and new development then they don&#x27;t care.<p>My PHP endpoints respond in &lt;100ms, which to my customers is perceptionally instantaneous. They wouldn&#x27;t benefit from any shiny modern language at all (but I do use them).')
