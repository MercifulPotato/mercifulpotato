Item(by='sidlls', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607030070, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25294254, text='&quot;The root issue&quot; is quite complicated, though.<p>I think it&#x27;s great someone who comes from an area where US$5k&#x2F;month makes them extravagantly wealthy can get a job paying $10k&#x2F;month. More power to them, and good for them for having that opportunity!<p>Then I think about it in another context. One that considers the huge subsidies (direct payments, defense) the US provides these countries, and in the context of the market wage in the absence of these visa programs. That is, the context in which a US (permanent resident or citizen) worker&#x27;s already tiny salary negotiation leverage is diminished by the existence of this labor pool. That&#x27;s not such a great thing, in my opinion.')
