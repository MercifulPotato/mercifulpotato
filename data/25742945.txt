Good luck with that.<p>When I pay for some physical product it is MINE. If you put something fancy in there, you sold it to me, IT is MINE. I can&#x27;t copy it and sell the copies, that&#x27;s fine.<p>If it&#x27;s a truly great product, I won&#x27;t have to fix it. If it wasn&#x27;t as good as you could make it, you&#x27;ve cheated me. If I can&#x27;t fix it then you&#x27;ve cheated me in an attempt to keep not just the product but me tethered to your stockholders. Sad.<p>Sad for you. If it&#x27;s <i>worth</i> fixing, and you expect to bleed me to fix it, I can fix it myself, or find someone who can. That&#x27;s a LOT easier than before. And you&#x27;ve lost another customer for a lifetime, one who will spread the word at every chance.')
