For occasional uses, it&#x27;s the worst choice - dried ink will completely clog the printer head, even running multiple &quot;flush&quot; cannot fully declog it. For an ink-cartridge based printer, the head is replaced after each cartridge replacement, but with an ink tank printer, the broken lines will stay with you forever.<p>Also, an ink tank printer also includes a planned obsolescence feature: waste ink pad counter. For each &quot;flush&quot; operation, the counter increments. When it reaches a threshold, it will disable the printer and force you to send the printer back for maintenance (effectively making many people to throw out the printer). Occasional users suffer the most, since flushing the printer is needed all the time to declog it. The waste ink pad is not something magic, it&#x27;s just a sponge pad and trivially replacable, but manufacturer won&#x27;t tell you in the user manual and won&#x27;t let you reset the counter after replacement. Fortunately, you can find the leaked OEM tool on the web.<p>Laser printing is the way to go. Unfortunately a color printer is still 3x more expensive than an equivalent inkjet printer.')
