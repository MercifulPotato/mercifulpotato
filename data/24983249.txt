Item(by='malandrew', descendants=None, kids=[24984998], score=None, time=1604432871, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24978940, text='I cited one very high profile example of ridesharing making a public transport project completely unviable within a few short years leaving taxpayers stuck with the bill and you call such skepticism bullshit even when there is clear evidence for voicing concern? If there is any bullshit here it&#x27;s more likely to be the person who &quot;hitched their online persona to being an expert with an opinion on the topic&quot; than the person who was raising legitimate concerns supported by evidence.<p>You&#x27;ve just lost any chance at my support and gained someone who is now more extra dubious of this Seattle Subway project than I was previously all because I now believe it is you that isn&#x27;t engaging in good faith. It&#x27;s going to take someone knowledgeable and acting in extra good faith to undo the animosity you&#x27;re directly responsible for creating.<p>Whenever Seattle Subway comes up in any discussions, I&#x27;ll be sure to reference how Ben Schiendelman responded when someone raised legitimate concerns. Good job.<p>&gt; and theyâ€™ve been used as anti-transit hobby horses for almost 50 years now<p>Because there is so much in common with 1970 vs 2020. Ridesharing only became a thing 10 short years ago. Waymo has been providing autonomous rides in Arizona for a few years now. Companies like Segway and LIT motors have pioneered the use of gyroscopes in transportation such that a completely enclosed motorcycle sized vehicle is nearly viable. The possibility of autonomous pods has never been more viable than is is now. It may have been a bullshit argument 20 to 50 years ago, but it&#x27;s certainly not a bullshit concern in 2020. Sorry if the future is finally catching up with a career you&#x27;re heavily invested in, but that&#x27;s not an excuse to behave as you have here.')
