The organisation in question ended up using password-protected Word files with forms (a royal pain). Before that, they had been using Excel files (apparently it&#x27;s easier there to lock parts of the sheet you don&#x27;t want users to mess with) but this was an even bigger pain as Excel still has this decade-old bug even in its latest version which distort graphics when row height is changed...).<p>Long story short, I&#x27;d be curious how you solved this and what software you used.')
