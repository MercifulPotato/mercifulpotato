Why didn&#x27;t Barr, a heavily partisan and biased Trump sycophant who meddled with prior investigations, not investigate all that being the head of the DoJ? If he somehow turned rogue, why didn&#x27;t Trump fire him and replace him with someone who would investigate?<p>Do you have any reasonable explanation for the above?
