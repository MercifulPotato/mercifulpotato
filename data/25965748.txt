Item(by='Phrodo_00', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611977742, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25965709, text='Mebibyte comes from pedants (like myself) that say that the Mega prefix in SI means 10^6, but in computing we often take it to mean 2^20. Mebibyte is unambiguous, and if everybody used it (unlikely. I don&#x27;t think either MacOs or Windows use it), then Mega would also be. Right now, when you see mega in a computing context you&#x27;re not sure if it means 10^6 or 2^20, although a lot of times it doesn&#x27;t even matter.')
