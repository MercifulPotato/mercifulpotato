If we want to continue this analogy it might be a victim that walked uninvited into a house with a big sign &quot;you will be raped if you walk into my house&quot;, but is still a victim nevertheless. I do think that solely blaming the care provider for their failure to protect is incorrect because a non-victim can hardly file charges against the perpetrator.<p>Of course, I agree that the care provider <i>also</i> did something wrong (as well as the hacker(s)) and that the people are also victims, but &quot;the people vs. the care provider&quot; is a separate matter from &quot;the care provider vs. the criminal&quot;.')
