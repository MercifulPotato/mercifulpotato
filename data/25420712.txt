Same with a lot of other webapps or platforms I&#x27;ve found for online learning - a lot of it is  text-dense (hard for a kid who barely reads to figure out the instructions), and&#x2F;or requires additional content or materials not just readily included in the app.<p>Kiddoo is a super simple fill-in-the-blank style learning tool for kids to work on their reading, writing, and math.<p>Right now I just have reading&#x2F;writing going, but I have configured the platform for easily extending exercise content, including to other topics such as math or science.<p>Would your kid(s) use something like this? Would it be beneficial to your schooling experience?<p>Thanks!')
