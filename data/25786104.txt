There&#x27;s no lockdown funk here, just too busy working on Ardour.<p>One of the 2 netjack implementations uses Opus - great stuff.<p>Absolutely right that the good stuff (i.e. not zoom) requires way too much setup, and even then (as you note) you&#x27;re not guaranteed reliable function because you don&#x27;t control all the hops.
