Duct tape at least attempted to balance things. The light was only available on the shotgun and machine gun, and had a smaller cone of light projected compared to the full size flash light. BFG Edition&#x27;s flash light added a battery that drains slowly and recharges very quickly. I&#x27;m not sure why they bothered with the battery since in practice it&#x27;s unlimited use.')
