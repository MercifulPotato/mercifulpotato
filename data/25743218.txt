I feel like that&#x27;s really the only way to verify what you&#x27;re proposing. Steam likely has logs of all the IP addresses that attempt login to whatever account.<p>I&#x27;m skeptical of what you&#x27;re proposing because it&#x27;s not hard to design a system that freezes mass random IP login attempts to an account after &#x27;x&#x27; low number of random attempts and then only allow the past successful IP addresses to continue with a successful login. As well, as do an email verification if the password is successful but being used from a new IP address.')
