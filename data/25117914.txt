Can you explain why you think that this is not a legitimate need to authenticate a document?<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not sure (and decline to speculate) whether you&#x27;re confused or malicious or some other problem entirely, but you are wrong.<p>You &quot;decline to speculate&quot;, and then proceed to speculate anyway?
