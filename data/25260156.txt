The reason for experimenting with a sort of blow-by-blow report style here and detailing the full and true journey of the idea was that I feel the whole process from idea to artifact is not written about enough.<p>That said, it can often be hard to fully pinpoint the actual inception of an idea and just thinking about this one yesterday I realised that the idea likely came up while traversing  a long chain of quote tweets. I really appreciate the feedback though—it&#x27;s especially useful as I&#x27;m only starting to publish regularly now so have lots to learn—so thanks again.')
