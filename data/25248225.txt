Allows us to permission control who sees what and who has access to things.  Honestly, it makes things super easy overall.  Not saying it is perfect, but it takes a lot of the effort out of the process.<p>We will probably start looking at a way to automate the downloading of the files from 1Password via the command line tool, that way it can be fully automated for deployments right from our deployment box.  Right now a human still has to grab the secrets file and make it available for the deployment script, which isn&#x27;t as ideal but it is simple and better IMO then sending a file around where multiple copies start to exist which could cause a problem with deployments.')
