Compare it to security cameras where you&#x27;re recorded almost everywhere, but the video is relatively transient and often only reviewed &#x2F; saved if a crime or disturbance occurs.<p>That&#x27;s a lot different than companies tracking me via facial recognition, storing the data in databases that never get deleted, and combining it with behavioral data.  It&#x27;s going to lead to all kind of abuse.  We&#x27;ll end up with many variants of redlining, but digital.<p>What happens when that type of data is collected for today&#x27;s youth and 20 years from now employers start using it to screen job applicants?  What if the machine learning algorithms can&#x27;t distinguish between correlation and causality?  Does the &quot;profile&quot; of a successful person become someone from a rich neighborhood as a result of naive correlation?<p>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be amazing for wealthy people and terrible for poor people.  If I&#x27;m rich and walk into a mall, I get treated like a VIP.  If I&#x27;m poor, maybe the doors don&#x27;t even open.')
