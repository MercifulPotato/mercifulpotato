Read and code and improve between each interview. You can’t lose. Don’t burn yourself out. Also, Leetcode can get in the f@@&amp;ng sea. If employers are seriously giving so much weight to Leetcode tests theses days to grade candidates then I really do despair. The interview process is broken.<p>Ps. Don’t get too disheartened by all the rejections. I was also laid off due to Covid. Overnight the job market was flooded and the bar got raised extremely high for all jobs. It’s not a normal situation and many others are probably feeling the same as you.')
