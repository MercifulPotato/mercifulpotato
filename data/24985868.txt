It makes me wonder if the ECP5-5G SERDES supports 1 G Ethernet.. the datasheet claims that it does..<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latticesemi.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;Products&#x2F;DesignSoftwareAndIP&#x2F;IntellectualProperty&#x2F;IPCore&#x2F;IPCores01&#x2F;SGMIIGbEthernetPCS" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latticesemi.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;Products&#x2F;DesignSoftwareAndIP&#x2F;...</a><p>Most people would use a separate PHY chip for Gigabit Ethernet, but we are in a space constrained design and wanted to avoid it (it&#x27;s a custom camera).<p>Actually, I could not get Lattice&#x27;s SGMII PCS IP to work, so I ended up writing my own (I also wrote the MAC, IP and UDP layers- avoiding all for-pay IP for this project, so in fact I could use the open-source tool chain).  I should try it on the ECP5-5G dev. board...  I think I will do that..<p>We see the issue on both the ECP5 Versa card and our own custom card.')
