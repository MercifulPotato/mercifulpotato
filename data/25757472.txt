I was able to script conversion of my transactions to ledger format. It was good to see where my money goes. But like you said, I don&#x27;t care much about budgeting or tracking my personal expenses. As SWE (not to brag) I make enough money to not think about these things. I&#x27;m also pretty frugal person, so majority of my expenses are just food.<p>Now, I also have a small LLC. And I used to track my business income&#x2F;expenses. It&#x27;s useful, but also, I don&#x27;t have that much volume to really care about ledger it&#x27;s just too much work right now. Last year I did taxes with ledger, it was PITA to import everything. This year I just dumped my transactions into google sheets and setup pivot table, which accomplished exactly what I needed for tax return.')
