Clearly, you don&#x27;t have any experience with a narcissist because, no amount of hand-wringing and kumbaya is going to fix it. I was the good son. I did that for two decades, it didn&#x27;t help. My experience is that there is absolutely no hope for narcissistic parents. Get away; Adopt a policy of non-contact; and Don&#x27;t look back. Just remember that when you pontificate (and name-call) about something like this: not all of us were blessed with rational, stable, straight-edge people for parents.')
