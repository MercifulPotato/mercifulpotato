What exactly would be illegal if I was on the right side of a short squeeze on purpose? Predicting it? holding stocks until it happened? Explaining to people less experienced than myself how a short squeeze works?<p>You say &#x27;intent&#x27; but what intent is discussed on these message boards that is so nefarious people with better Lawyers don&#x27;t discuss it openly?')
