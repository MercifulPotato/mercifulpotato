Because each project makes the others more valuable, if you get stuck need to do some Yak Shaving on one particular project and it&#x27;s burning out your enthusiasm, you can just switch to another of the projects and make progress there which increases the value of the previous project to a point where it&#x27;s now worth it to go back and finish what you were doing.<p>Yak Farming.')
