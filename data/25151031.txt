A few months ago, YouTube switched it to an opt-out system, helpfully enabling them for all then-existing videos that hadn&#x27;t opted in:<p>&gt; Starting in late July, videos that are longer than eight minutes will be eligible for mid-roll ads. As part of this change, mid-roll ads will be turned on for all eligible existing videos and future video uploads, including those videos where you may have previously opted out of mid-roll ads. Videos that already have mid-roll ads turned on will not be impacted.<p>(As I understand it, there is no way to disable the mid-roll ad on all videos, so you&#x27;d have to manually flip it for <i>every</i> single video. How kind of YouTube.)')
