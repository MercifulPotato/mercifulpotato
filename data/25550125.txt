We are migrating from our old ably.io domain to our new domain ably.com. We&#x27;ve been contacting Facebook through public channels, and private channels (our network) for around 7 months, and we&#x27;re hitting a brick wall.  Facebook is touting how they are doing what they can to validate what people are publishing on their platform, yet they incorrectly classify our domain ably.com as  &quot;the content doesn&#x27;t meet our Community Standards&quot; yet won&#x27;t reclassify, respond, or engage in any way to change that (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.facebook.com&#x2F;tools&#x2F;debug&#x2F;?q=ably.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.facebook.com&#x2F;tools&#x2F;debug&#x2F;?q=ably.com</a>).  Like Alex from JitBit, Facebook truly is a tiny channel for us, but we have found it has a wider impact for us it stops people sharing links with the domain in it in other Facebook owned media too.<p>If anyone knows how on earth we can actually get Facebook to respond, I&#x27;d be hugely in your debt. This issue has blocked us for 6 months in migrating over our primary traffic from www.ably.io to ably.com.<p>Contact me at matt at ably.com')
