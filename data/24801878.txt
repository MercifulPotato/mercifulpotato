If an uncharitable read of your comment is that you are mocking people and trying to gain hipster points by knowing about it before it was popular, then maybe a charitable read is that &quot;we are too quick&quot; is a warning of some hazard or danger that happens if we ooh and aahh about things too quickly which (in some way) objectively haven&#x27;t earned it, by not being first, and that being first is in some way a majorly important criterion. If so, what is it that you are warning about?<p>What exactly is your problem with people being excited or impressed by something that was done before, which makes it worth a comment?')
