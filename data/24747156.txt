Not sure about your definition of “more flexible”, if that entails breaking existing code then it may rightfully meet resistance.<p>Not sure why you’re implying other languages’ proposal processes are about pleasing a single core developer or playing some politics game. Sounds like either you have a lot more experience than I do and hence have been exposed to politics games or anything else non-meritocratic (that I haven’t sensed in CPython development, at least), or you just don’t have as much experience contributing to other languages.<p>(I&#x27;m a bit cranky today. Sorry if I sound aggressive.)')
