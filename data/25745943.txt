Item(by='PeterisP', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610454540, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25742501, text='&quot;That money&quot; is the money right now in savings accounts - it does not belong to the people who would use for &quot;paying down rent thats been placed on credit cards and payment plan&quot;, it belongs to the part of population whose income was not harmed by the epidemic, but whose expenses were limited - or, as the article argues, postponed.<p>As the article states, there are two worlds, and they don&#x27;t really overlap. The amount of total household savings has greatly increased at the same time as most households are running out of savings; and it&#x27;s not about the 0.1% magnates - as the 2&#x2F;3 poorer households are becoming poorer, the 1&#x2F;3 wealthier households are becoming even more wealthier. As the numbers show, one world has an unprecedented amount of available money, and they are going to spend it, kickstarting the economy - all while while the &quot;other world&quot; is experiencing all the things you describe. But since the gap between them is so large, it&#x27;s counterproductive to talk about &quot;the average american household&quot; as in this bimodal distribution talking about the average is just as meaningful as saying that the average american has one testicle and one breast.')
