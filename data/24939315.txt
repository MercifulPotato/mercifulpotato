Anxiety I often offset with significant amounts of CBD (a $100&#x2F;month expense).<p>And while there are drawbacks, I can&#x27;t bench press 215lbs anymore, the overall benefits have been pretty significant that I will keep doing it.<p>My weight was pretty erratic, given the high stress load and super active lifestyle I could fluctuate 8lbs in a day. Now my weight has stabilized and my head is clearer.<p>I studied biology with an understanding of autophagy and I only ate once a day for nearly a decade now (2011), but I used to eat 3000+ calories in one sitting, but now I&#x27;ve decided to limit my overall caloric intake (1500-2000) and reduced it to a 8-4 hour window and saw even better results.<p>Also, as a former chef, I now savor my food way more and take the time to enjoy it more than when I tasted and ate all day and suffered from a sort of <i>palate fatigue</i> and made my gravitate to salty, greasy food late at night when I actually had an appetite.')
