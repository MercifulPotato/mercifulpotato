You could only demonstrate that by showing that <i>most</i> of the effort in software at large is of this kind, and that the improvement is due to language design and&#x2F;or programming methodology.<p>When distilled, Brooks&#x27;s claim is that the <i>relative</i> size of accidental complexity in programming <i>overall</i> is (or was) &quot;low&quot;, i.e. less than 90%, while Dan wants to claim it is (or was) &quot;high&quot;, i.e. more than 90%. His experiment does not establish that.')
