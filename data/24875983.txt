Therefore, I can&#x27;t write a program in the Python REPL just as I&#x27;m doing stuff normally and copy it into a file for further editing and polishing. I have to port whatever I did in the shell to whatever other language I&#x27;m using, which is more porting than I want to do for most shell scripts, especially ones which are mostly pipelines.<p>Heck, Python isn&#x27;t even a good language for one-liners. Not saying it should be, but it further demonstrates that I can&#x27;t use Python live the way I can use zsh live.')
