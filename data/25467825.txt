Everything takes ages and costs enormous amounts of money and they seem to botch up even the simplest things. From not being able to craft proper HTTP headers to messing up UTF8 encoding. When we asked one of them to help one of our clients with his ERP they said they&#x27;d be able to help us in 6(!) weeks. Mind you this was a small ask.<p>I truly hope my company will not turn out like that, because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll survive that. I&#x27;ve been in the game for a while, but I&#x27;ll need to survive at least another 30 years of working. God help me.')
