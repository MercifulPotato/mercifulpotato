Maybe it was my fault for using the wrong word.<p>Have you ever tried to play an old game on a widescreen monitor? Even a lot of modern, triple-A games have weird HUD layouts on ultrawide monitors because they have to be re-hard-coded for that aspect ratio. So if they haven&#x27;t, you just get the layout they&#x27;re hardcoded to for widescreen monitors.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it would make sense to trade performance for robustness in the case of games specifically, because they&#x27;re always going to be full-screen and usually target one of only a handful of aspect-ratios (at least for consoles and PC; mobile may be a different story). I&#x27;m just saying they definitely get to skip a whole lot of hard problem-solving due to the constraints of the end product.<p>I don&#x27;t have time to read more than the first part of your reply right now; maybe I will later.')
