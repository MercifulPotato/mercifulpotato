I don&#x27;t get &#x27;stuck&#x27; often and generally feel competent, but I am far from an expert or a master. I think CSS is difficult to understand because there are so many ways to accomplish a task, and so many of those ways lead to (sometimes) unforeseeable consequences, and nearly all of the APIs (possibly with the exception of css grid) don&#x27;t feel very coherent...  in my experience. I think it is difficult to learn because there&#x27;s no real apparent holistic design to really grok.<p>I tried mdgriffith&#x27;s elm-ui on a personal project and it was a breath of fresh air. It felt like an utterly excellent abstraction and I hope someone ports it to Typescript&#x2F;React&#x2F;JSX some day.')
