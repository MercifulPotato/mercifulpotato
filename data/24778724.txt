I have no idea why it&#x27;s not more popular for &#x27;average&#x27; users&#x2F;orgs. I don&#x27;t know what issues may come up with scaling this up, but in our small org we&#x27;ve been running 20-30 (mostly unprivileged) LXD containers in production for several years now for all sorts of intranet and external-facing services (auth, DB, web, etc).
