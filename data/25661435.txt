No, it doesn&#x27;t. Sometime it&#x27;s faster than what you want to be. For example an old DOS program that was cycling ON&#x2F;OFF between the keyboard LED&#x27;s for CAPS LOCK &#x2F; NUM LOCK and SCROLL LOCK was making them to be too fast, while generating sounds too. When I ran it a few years ago to show off to my son, it was horrible. I had to fire up Turbo Pascal inside that DosBox emulator and introduce delays in the program to make it behave like it did in 1995 when I wrote it on a 286.')
