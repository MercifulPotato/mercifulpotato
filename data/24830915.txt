Item(by='jiveturkey', descendants=None, kids=[24831603, 24831554], score=None, time=1603140970, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24830669, text='&gt; There&#x27;s no reason Apple needs to know either the specific piece of hardware<p>In order to revoke a specific device without cooperation of the device itself, which is one of their advantageous claims, they do.<p>Disregarding that property, Apple needs to know that the &quot;CSR&quot;, ie attestation request, is coming from the secure enclave. That means that the &quot;CSR&quot; needs to be signed by some key. If the CSR signing key is unique per device, Apple receives device-specific information. This can&#x27;t be an ephemeral key, as there wouldn&#x27;t be a chain back to the secure element. If OTOH the CSR signing key is shared, it is probably exposed, or at least accessible for malicious signing, via the now known T2 compromise. There is much to be gained by such an exploit, so this isn&#x27;t merely a thought exercise.<p>This complexity is all avoided by on-device attestation. EPID or EPID-like scheme could have been used, vs batch attestation.<p>Honestly, Apple is derelict in not describing this in more detail. Had they not made claims, it would be ok. But they are directly claiming to be better. I think we can be 100% certain they are aware of this depth of detail internally. Apple is not amateur hour.')
