But we do know why that one stopped again: A terrible wave of spammy contact requests. They were able to fight intra-gtalk spam much more effectively than spam that originated via XMPP.<p>I think you&#x27;re mistaken to believe this over the fact that Google was going through one of its turbulent internal transitions. The whole of Google Talk got replaced by Hangouts (which is now facing its own complex demise: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;gadgets&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;the-great-google-hangouts-shutdown-begins-october-2019&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;gadgets&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;the-great-google-han...</a> ) and the whole Google+ shift undoubtedly played a part.<p>Spam is not the problem. I have a Gmail account, and I receive tonnes of spam daily. I&#x27;ve had spam in Hangouts, I&#x27;ve had spam in Google Docs. Meanwhile independent and voluntary public XMPP server operators have quite a good handle on spam on the network today. I refuse to believe that Google&#x27;s resources were unable to solve this, rather than that they were unwilling to solve this and took it as an excuse to wind down their participation in an open network.<p>I&#x27;m all for more research into anti-spam solutions, any open network has to deal with it. But so far none of the well established open networks (phone, email, physical mail) have yet solved the problem.')
