If Yelp reduces the choices for you down to a ranked list, it introduces a huge amount of bias in your decision. And if you use it relatively deterministically, you&#x27;ve consequentially changed your behavior in a way such that an outside observer will eventually be able to predict your behavior with high probability, if they understand what Yelp is showing you. In that sense, &quot;telling you&quot; starts to be a sane thing to think, even if it&#x27;s not literally telling you the exact singular place to go.')
