Maybe, if you pay them well enough.<p>&gt; You need testing<p>Because &quot;enterprise&quot; software is bug free. Just because someone sells you software and pretends they test, or even if they do actually, you still have to test in your environment.<p>&gt; You pay for all of the above<p>Yes, either in manhours of employees or cash to a vendor.<p>&gt; There are very,very,very few world-case FOSS projects around (like: redis, clang, elasticsearch, linux, ...) that maintain themselves on an enterprise-quality level, so be prepared to upstream <i>a lot of bugfixes yourself</i><p>There are many more, and even stuff like Hashicorp&#x27;s projects are at a better level than say Atlassian&#x27;s crap in terms of &quot;enterprise quality&quot;.<p>&gt;  Where there&#x27;s no money there&#x27;s no priority<p>Are you under the impression that just because you&#x27;re a paying customer you&#x27;re somehow a priority to the vendor? You can tell that to all the people with stuck feature requests or unanswered&#x2F;unfixed bug reports. At least with FOSS you can actually take a look yourself if nobody else wants to.')
