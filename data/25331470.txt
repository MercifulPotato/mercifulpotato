Your immediate instinct being to reject reality and substitute what fits your own world view better.<p>I&#x27;m not being needlessly mean to you. People like you put other&#x27;s lives in danger. Your bullshit attitude is so incredibly backwards, historians will look down on you decades down the line and wonder &quot;what the fuck was going on in these people&#x27;s heads&quot; with the same disdain as ours when looking at people burning witches or sacrificing babies. Excuse me if I don&#x27;t want to be part of that footnote.<p>You live in ground zero? Then go to a damn hospital and observe a bit what it&#x27;s like at the front lines. Maybe you&#x27;ll walk out a bit more humble.')
