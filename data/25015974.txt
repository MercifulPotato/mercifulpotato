While technically the illuminator and receiver are different components manufactured by different vendors, they are integrated into one module well before final assembly - and generally when you buy ToFs from semiconductor manufacturers, you get a single mostly rigid part that has everything attached to it.<p>I suppose I could also imagine someone challenging my assertion that industrial 3D scanning uses structured light, because there are some vendors that use -temporal structured light-, where you flash different patterns to resolve different spatial frequencies on a stationary part. But beyond that I am as confused as you are.')
