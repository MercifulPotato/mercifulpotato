The plain reading of the license is &quot;APLv2 but AWS Can&#x27;t Sell a Hosted Version&quot; so of course AWS forks the last APL version and plows ahead.<p>Note, I&#x27;m not trying to side with either AWS or Elastic here and I fully recognize that both Elastic re-licensing and AWS forking are within each org&#x27;s rights. I really just think it is funny how beside the point AWS&#x27;s press release is here.<p>EDIT: an apostrophe')
