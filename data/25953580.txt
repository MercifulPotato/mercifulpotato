I&#x27;ve been hand-curating Remote jobs from Hackernews for a while. It&#x27;s carefully curated by hard and tagged properly, everything listed on the page is 100% remote jobs. I was also planned on writing a report to see how remote jobs % is increased over the period of time and what tech trend is growing. But not finding time. This is an interesting report.  If would like the data, I&#x27;m happy to share the last 12 months of data. Feel free to ping me on Twitter(@abinaya_rl)')
