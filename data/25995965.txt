Inconsistent storage? DeltaLake. Slow Spark queries? Databricks Delta. Model management? MLFlow (I haven&#x27;t adopted this, but can&#x27;t pin down why -- on face value it seems great). Development environment? Databricks Connect. Cluster management? Core.<p>But the same is not true for SQL analysts. Today&#x27;s offering does not empathise with them. I&#x27;m unsure integrating Redash is a genuine reply to their needs.<p>The upside here is that (1) Databricks (or at least, Databricks&#x27; marketing) appears to be prioritising this need, and (2) A lot of people are betting a lot money that they can do this well.<p>Tomorrow looks sunny.')
