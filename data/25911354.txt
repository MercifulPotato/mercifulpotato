I&#x27;ve found that I tend to speak a lot louder when wearing some sort of headphones due to the fact that I can&#x27;t hear my voice as well, so I tend to do calls using my webcam&#x27;s microphone and an external speaker so that I can talk normally. This might not be an option for you if you don&#x27;t live alone, but if you have some degree of privacy while writing, I&#x27;d highly recommend trying this out!')
