I assume they had a &quot;ground truth&quot; financial order book somewhere (which presumably was held to much higher standards of correctness) and that the support staff manually verified their balance.<p>But ... that logic doesn&#x27;t work if you chase down the implications. And sadly I was both too shocked and too young to press my coworker for details. (He was a cool older fellow who seemed as amused with the craziness.)<p>Eventually I became a pentester at Matasano. During my one-year stint, I was parachuted into around 70 codebases. I got to see first-hand that Scottrade wasn&#x27;t an outlier; they were the average. Most companies have similar WTFs, and the codebases are just as onerous.<p>The world is held together with duct-tape. That&#x27;s why pentesting is so crucial.')
