It&#x27;s not exactly common.<p>Edit: because of course I triggered a storm. Maybe it&#x27;s common elsewhere. I&#x27;ve lived in few EU countries, rented then owned a few houses, exactly only one of them had an oven with the self cleaning(by heating up to like 500C) feature, I don&#x27;t think we ever used it. When we bought our current oven none of the ones we looked at had that function. A fancy Candy we looked at had a function where it cleans itself with steam(where you fill up a provided container with water and then it heats it up to fill the oven with steam and in theory that softens the gunk. No idea if that actually works).<p>If it&#x27;s common where you live, then my apologies for this comment.')
