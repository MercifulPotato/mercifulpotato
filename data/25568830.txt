I already told my wife that if and when we&#x27;ll be moving to a country house, I want to have walls made like on starships in Star Trek - with space in the walls through which cabling runs, covered by disguised access panels that can be taken off.<p>(I&#x27;m not sure she fully understands how serious I&#x27;m about it, and the extent to which I want to push it. I want them across the whole wall, i.e. so I could, if need be, reroute any cabling throughought the entire floor.)')
