Netflix called it &quot;paved path&quot;, and it worked really well too for Netflix. Over the years, though, the &quot;paved path&quot; expanded and extended to more services. It&#x27;s worth noting that EC2 alone is a huge productivity booster, bar none. Nothing beats setting up a cluster of machines, with a few clicks, that auto scales per dynamic scaling policies. In contrast, Uber couldn&#x27;t do this for at least 5 years, and their docker-based cluster system is a crippled for not supporting the damn persistent volumes. God knows how much productivity was lost because of the bogus reasons Uber had for not going to cloud.')
