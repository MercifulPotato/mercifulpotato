But if the technique is to use a USB dongle then we should also be able to modify the source code of Suicide Linux to do the same with the modified default terminal. </i><p>Defense-in-depth, you add a bit of countermeasures at every level. For example, the USB self-destruction will immediately kick in (if the law enforcement decides to seize the computer alive, a mouse emulator is likely to be used immediately), erase the header, and halt the computer, even before anyone has a chance to perform any forensics. If the LE was able to take the computer to a lab, it&#x27;s possible to do a live memory extraction via cold-boot attack while the computer in still running, for example.<p>Again, the tricky part is balancing the sensitivity of the self-destruction mechanism and the risk of data destruction from an accidental trigger... A possible workaround is adding an &quot;armed&quot; switch - the most sensitive tamper-detection code is only activated after the switch is flipped if the perceived risk is high, for example, before you take your laptop to a coffee shop.')
