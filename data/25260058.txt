Item(by='ashtonbaker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606776612, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25259728, text='&gt; It&#x27;s pretty clear what solving means, it means to have an exact representation of the 3D structure.<p>That&#x27;s not clear at all, because perfect measurement doesn&#x27;t exist. I agree that improving is always a worthy goal, but clearly we don&#x27;t need 100% accuracy to consider something &quot;solved&quot; for the purposes of science. Also, &quot;3D structure&quot; of a protein is not a fixed truth, the parts are in motion all the time and may even have multiple semi-stable conformations. Rather than focusing on X,Y,Z perfection, I would imagine getting the angles between bonds, or the general topological conformation right would be more valuable.<p>&gt; if you assume that experimental methods can&#x27;t get better ...<p>I&#x27;m saying that if your definition for &quot;solved&quot; is &quot;perfect knowledge&quot;, then we might as well not discuss whether method X or Y solves the problem, because they obviously do not.<p>The more I think about it, the more I think we should just drop the whole debate over the word &quot;solved&quot;. Clearly different experiments and different proteins will have different requirements which may or may not be met by this or by other techniques - I agree that I would be interested to hear an expert weigh in on those requirements.')
