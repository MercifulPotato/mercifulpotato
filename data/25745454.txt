And you don&#x27;t have to pay for people&#x27;s healthcare, so it might be cheaper from a &#x27;total cost&#x27; perspective.<p>Sales tax is a few % points more, property tax is actually less in general for new buyers unless you&#x27;ve owned a place for +15 years in CA.<p>You don&#x27;t get a mortgage interest tax deduction, but you have an UNLIMITED cap gains exemption on the house you live in that you sell in Canada, while the USA has a limit.<p>The tax system is overall more straightforward and not a pile of fade outs and patches like the US tax system is.  Compare Canadian RRSPs &amp; TFSAs to the entire 401k, IRA, Roth IRA, mega backdoor roth 401k, etc mess that they have in the US.  There isn&#x27;t a penalty to withdrawing from your RRSP so there really isn&#x27;t much of a loan concept for them either. I don&#x27;t think something like AMT exists in Canada.<p>Cost of goods in Canada are overall more expensive than the USA.')
