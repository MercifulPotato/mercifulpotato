Of the 8 I talked to around the neighborhood and explained the situation and said &quot;between X and Y time&quot;, only 1 showed any hesitancy at all.<p>I suspect most saw it as a way to help their neighbor and since I was specific, it was easy for them to check quickly and share the video if they found what I described.')
