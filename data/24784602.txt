Ultimately, it was important to me to protect the privacy of the founders I work with, and was worried that any non-meta example I used would be taken to resemble any company I had worked with. I also didn’t want founders to copy the deck wholesale, but instead to adapt it to their specific situation, so I chose an example that doesn’t apply to any startup. Of course, the numbers used shouldn’t be taken too seriously anyway :)')
