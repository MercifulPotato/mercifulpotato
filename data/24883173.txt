Item(by='segfaultbuserr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603589161, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24881202, text='Formatting support on HN is bare minimum, the only options here are italic text (two asterisks) and codeblock (four-space indention), and there&#x27;s nothing more. It&#x27;s <i>very unlikely</i> that Hacker News will add any new styles, since the minimalism is intentional, which can be a bit limiting. However, you can use plaintext mailing list and forum traditions for everything else (e.g. manual blockquote mark &quot;&gt;&quot;, deletion mark &quot;^H&quot;, sarcastic mark &quot;&#x2F;s&quot;, new subsection mark &quot;- title&quot; or &quot;* title&quot;, etc). I usually use the more readable HTML &lt;del&gt;&lt;&#x2F;del&gt; markup for strike text. Of course, Unicode abuse is always possible, just like what you&#x27;ve did here...<p>Only one thing to beware: To make a newline, you must make a new paragraph by creating an empty line (e.g. &quot;line1\\n\\nline2&quot;), merely a &quot;line1\\nline2&quot; doesn&#x27;t work. Just like LaTeX or Markdown, a line break in the source code is not the same as a logical paragraph in the output, it makes sense, but the lack of other formatting options makes it a bit inconvenient to making a list. But it&#x27;s tolerable in the end.')
