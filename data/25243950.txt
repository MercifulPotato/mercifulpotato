Maybe they consider rivets uglyâ€”or consider making such a thing without rivets to be a demonstration of their skill (which it would be).  I&#x27;d agree you can&#x27;t assume for certain they wouldn&#x27;t use rivets, but I&#x27;d say it seems <i>likely</i> they wouldn&#x27;t.<p>(Of course, the chance they&#x27;d choose to make rivets in an exact shape and size and style that is presumably mass-produced somewhere on Earth is very unlikely unless they wanted to make something to blend in.)')
