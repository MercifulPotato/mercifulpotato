It&#x27;s estimated that around 4M acres burned annually in CA before modern firefighting, so unless you&#x27;re proposing controlled burns on the order of millions of acres I don&#x27;t see how that makes it sensible to deploy this particular technology in any widespread way.<p>Given how calfire abuses the tools they do have (e.g. aggressively stopping wildfires that pose minimal threat to human settlements), I wouldn&#x27;t trust them not to abuse this one as well.<p>But how much does it even really matter? Far more fires are started by humans than lightning.')
