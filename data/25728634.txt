USB killed external SCSI.<p>&gt;Up to that point in time, it was a good tech stack.<p>USB 0.9 was 1995, USB 1.0 1996. Two years later we had Bill Gates getting embarrassed by Windows 98 BSOD on stage <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IW7Rqwwth84" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IW7Rqwwth84</a>. By ~2002 we ended up with 6 separate incompatible proprietary variations on micro USB. Pretty much every second Camera vendor had its won &quot;standard&quot;.<p>&gt;USB-3.X cables features 8 wires .... and the other six carry data<p>Sadly just adding even more confusion to the mix. 24 pins, up to 13 signals, 4 pairs (8 wires) dedicated to USB 3.2 alone.<p>&gt;Thanks to DP 1.4, the bandwidth requirement can be lowered via DSP lossless compression<p>oh its very much lossy, Display Stream Compression (DSC) is &quot;visually lossless&quot; :--------) it works similar to Texture Compression, but works on blocks of lines instead of rectangles, still it does destroy information by cutting off color accuracy.<p>At the end of the day USB is still trivial compared to Bluetooh.')
