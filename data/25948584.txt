They pay for the privilege of either trading against Robinhood based orders or routing them to an exchange.<p>Not allowing buys can happen for a wide variety of reasons from technical, business to legal to counterparty demands and isn’t necessarily signs of collusion.<p>That said there is certainly the appearance of a conflict of interest and I’m sure Robinhood will be addressing that in court and to investigators presently.')
