Life is much harder at those ranks, and there&#x27;s not much needed to start a seemingly unstoppable demise.<p>Those few percent off of a paycheck can mean you now cannot pay off your month&#x27;s credit balance. Next month the debt is larger (due to the outrageous interests), but you still cannot pay it off because your car broke down and you had to fix it to get to work. Next month your mother got sick and you had to help her pay for some medication. Now your debt is growing faster than you can pay it off.')
