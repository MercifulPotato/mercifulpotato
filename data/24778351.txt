And most of them, including Netflix, also pick up things other houses have cancelled without a satisfying conclusion and extend them to provide one, or at least another chance at one.<p>The only substantive difference I see with Netflix is that they are taking far more shots at potential tentpole series than any other single outlet.<p>&gt; Don&#x27;t expect people to come back after getting burned once<p>I expect Netflix has a lot better behavioral data driving decisions than your “I can obviously only talk for myself” and then drawing conclusions from that to what is “definitely the worst business decision to do for Netflix” as if you were the whole market.')
