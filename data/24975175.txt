I am salivating.  One of the things that people in the UK and Ireland do not realize is how lucky they are to have varieties of potatoes.  I have never seen anything other than the classifications of Red&#x2F;Russet&#x2F;Yellow&#x2F;White  in North America.   Perhaps there are some regional growers of Kerr&#x27;s Pink or Maris Piper but they certainly do not stock the supermarkets with them and I have never seen them in farmer&#x27;s markets.')
