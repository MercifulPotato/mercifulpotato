So, no, that would be just a down payment for a plant that <i>might</i> produce power at great additional cost a decade or more later, if not abandoned first. Solar could begin producing power immediately, during build-out. <i>And</i> at night, from stored energy.<p>We have decades of actual records on the actual performance of fission power.  It stinks. It has been a massive publicly subsidized boondoggle for 70 years. Too much is enough.')
