I love the general flair of keeping the process light. I do have a couple more questions:<p>a) When does your google doc go &quot;stale&quot;? (The next 1:1? At the end of the year? When you stop having 1:1s with that person?)<p>b) In your approach, are there things you don&#x27;t want to share but want to make note of (performance related notes, future ideas etc)? What do you do in these cases to stay organized?<p>c) If you are managing a team of several people over large time periods, that&#x27;s a lot of google documents. Do you have the need to stay organized over time? How do you do it?')
