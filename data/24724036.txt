Spikes in other DVE threats probably will depend on political or social issues that often mobilize other ideological actors to violence, such as immigration, environmental, and police-related policy issues.<p>WSEs have demonstrated longstanding intent to target racial and religious minorities, members of the LGBTQ+ community, politicians, and those they believe promote multi-culturalism and globalization at the expense of the WSE identity. Since 2018, they have conducted more lethal attacks in the United States than any other DVE movement.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dhs.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;publications&#x2F;2020_10_06_homeland-threat-assessment.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dhs.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;publications&#x2F;2020_10...</a>')
