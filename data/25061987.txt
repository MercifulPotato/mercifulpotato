Next, they need to do like Reddit and start making &quot;dead&quot; account names available for re-use. (Something Reddit does for sub-reddits and which Google seems to not do for, say, BlogSpot.)<p>Edit: I say this as someone with old, dead google accounts I will never recover and I would rather the data be deleted than fall into the hands of nefarious third parties. Also, we bellyache about the amount of electricity used for Bitcoin as an environmental hazard, but we think Google should keep abandoned accounts intact indefinitely? Why?<p>All systems need some means to clean out the cruft and recycle stuff and not just permanently freeze it for people who may be dead, who may have forgotten they made that account while high that one night, etc.')
