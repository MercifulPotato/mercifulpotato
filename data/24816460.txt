The territorial distribution is also much more even this time, so it is easier to cope for the healthcare system.<p>My point is that any a priori estimate of the IFR falls apart if the healthcare system fails and the purpose of lockdown is to avoid that. You don&#x27;t lock down because it&#x27;s the only way to keep the IFR down; you lock down when you realize that tracing is failing to capture and&#x2F;or isolate many cases, and therefore lockdown is the only <i>remaining</i> way to keep the IFR down.')
