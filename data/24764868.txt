I&#x27;m not comfortable legally enforcing that preference. The only thing that needs to be accepted is that laws and ethics aren&#x27;t necessarily equivalent. Just because something is legal doesn&#x27;t make it ethical. If you accept that, then it&#x27;s easy to see how one might choose a permissive license even if one finds certain actions allowed by that permissive license to be unethical.<p>If you think laws and ethics are the same or should be, then I suppose that&#x27;s a deeper disagreement and not one I mean to explore here. :-)')
