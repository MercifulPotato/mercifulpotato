It gave a free for all to the private run companies that they did not have before. In my comment, I even stated that deregulation is different taking gov&#x27;t run institutions private. It seems that I needed to expand the thought further. As you stated, private companies have been running vital services for a long time. However, they were <i>regulated</i> to keep things in balance. It was the removal of those regulations that sent things down the slide we&#x27;ve seen. Again, it started with Reagan, but it has taken until more modern times to fully feel the repercussions.')
