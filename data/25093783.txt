It&#x27;s good that in this case it chose the authoritative site over the conspiracy theory one. Even better if they chose it <i>because</i> it was more authoritative rather than because they calculated they could show you more ads that way, but I won&#x27;t give them credit for that just yet.<p>They didn&#x27;t censor the other site completely. If I search with site:dangersofvaccines.com I get results from it. I can&#x27;t get results from it any other way though, including searching text that only appears on that site - they&#x27;d rather tell me there are no results - so I agree that&#x27;s an unpleasant level of censorship&#x2F;nannying.')
