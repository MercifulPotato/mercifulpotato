Victory for your team dominates any actual effect of policy on human beings. And it&#x27;s constant -- the game is going on at literally every instant, with a SuperHyperDuperMegaBowl every four years.<p>Our choices of elections teams are only slightly less arbitrary than our choices of sports teams. Once chosen we get a continual barrage of cheerleading for us and against our arch-rivals. It&#x27;s not just the ordinary mental failings of refusing to consider things from others&#x27; point of view (while telling ourselves that we have carefully considered and rejected it). It&#x27;s the continual thrill of the match, with both points for and points against creating mental rewards to cheer harder and not look away for a moment.<p>We&#x27;ll all be healthier if we stopped looking at it like a sports match. And the first step, I believe, is to turn it off, so that we can engage with it at a greater distance, without the dopamine hits and troughs that make it so addicting.')
