A very small percentage of people would scroll all the way to the bottom especially on a relatively long page like this (5583px tall on desktop). Speaking of actually visible branding, there&#x27;s a DuckDuckGo logo (without wordmark) in the top left corner and that&#x27;s about it. To most people who aren&#x27;t familiar with the DuckDuckGo logo, this would indeed look like the site of some privacy advocacy group.<p>Edit: Didn&#x27;t notice that the sticky header once you scroll down does say &quot;DuckDuckGo Blog&quot;. Not sure why it can&#x27;t just say that in the actual header; intentionally vague or baffling design?')
