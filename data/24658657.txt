At first she didn’t want to use it at all which was disappointing, but then it become a huge hit when all the restaurants closed down for Covid. Home hot pot has now turned into our fun date night tradition on Friday’s where we eat together for a few hours while talking.<p>Here’s our list of ingredients we like if anyone is curious. Would love to hear other recommendations to try too:<p>King oyster mushrooms, Shitaki mushrooms, Tofu skin dried, Frozen bean curd rolls frozen, Fried tofu, Bean curd nuggets, Choripdong Oriental Style Noodles, Bok Choy, Broccoli, Corn on cob, Lotus root, Beef (thin sliced), Shrimp<p>Part of the fun is plating the ingredients before eating and working on our presentation skills together. It’s really rewarding when we can make it look like they do at the restaurant.<p>After some trial and error, we also recommend the Little Lamb broths. They comes in different spice levels and taste just like the restaurant. All you need to do is add six cups of water: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Little-Sheep-Soup-Base-235-Grams&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B004XY6IPK" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Little-Sheep-Soup-Base-235-Grams&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B...</a><p>FYI that’s not an affiliate link, I just like hot pot and wanted to share.<p>(Edit - formatting)')
