I can guess, but maybe it would be better if you wrote something more expository or discursive.<p>For example, is &quot;Speakeasy, Lightouch, Jazz&quot; intended to be a single noun?  A single thing?  Or is it a collection?  A sequence?<p>What do you mean by &quot;getting stable shelter&quot;?  Or to &quot;hand off notes to people&quot;?<p>Have you written something already?  is there a link?')
