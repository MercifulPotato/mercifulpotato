It&#x27;s just that usually, stuff at work can get boring. It&#x27;s just something you might not get away from, but it is what it is.<p>However, stuff that I can&#x27;t do without effort, that is just absolutely fascinating and feels like above my pay-scale keeps me going. Also, finding old but still extremely useful tech (specifically older laptops that I want to use, particularly ThinkPads) are more exciting to find, obtain and repair than any newer laptops&#x2F;gadgets.<p>In many ways, this attitude has never changed for me. In one way, it&#x27;s more meaningful that I can do something for myself with something than something that is just some appliance. I mean, like a smartphone is just a requirement now, whether I care for it or not. (I&#x27;d probably want to invest and spend time researching a high quality washing machine, etc. than worry about a smartphone - if the washing machine doesn&#x27;t have some IoT thing in it, I at least know it only serves me :) )')
