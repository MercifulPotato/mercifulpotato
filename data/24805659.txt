Now, as it was always the same psalm, illiterate people could memorise the psalm and recite it as if reading.<p>IIRC, until the literacy test was abolished and the benefit made generally applicable to first-time offenders, the judge had the option of demanding a different work.be read if he suspected the privilege was being abused.<p>&gt; (of course this was a legal fiction to allow courts to avoid handing out death sentences to all comers).<p>Well, it evolved into such a fiction (and eventually even the literacy test was removed). But it didn&#x27;t originate as one, and didn&#x27;t originally involve a sentence reduction but transfer to ecclesiastical court from secular court.')
