Classics departments like History and English etc.  It was incredibly liberating when folks got the computer involved in their non-computer specialties.<p>The tidbit I didn&#x27;t know was that (like ForTran) this BASIC system didn&#x27;t require spaces on a line. I expect it recognized the keywords rather than looking for a space, and then comparing what word they found with a list of keywords.<p>Is the source code for the original BASIC available? What kinds of techniques did they use ?  I think I read it was an actual compiler. Does anyone know what limitations were attached to BASIC from that compile-only implementation?')
