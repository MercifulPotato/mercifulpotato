Riot&#x27;s rootkit shit is a small price to play enjoyably with friends. I care more about the experience than I do about the risk of Riot fucking up my Windows install.<p>Keep doing what you&#x27;re doing. Just, if you&#x27;d leave the anti-cheat off friend-to-friend-PvP games, that would be cool. I don&#x27;t care if my younger brother &#x27;cheats&#x27; against me. He&#x27;s not going to and if he is &#x27;cheating&#x27; it&#x27;s probably some mod or something.')
