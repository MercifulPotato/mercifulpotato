If you don&#x27;t know how to disable them if you don&#x27;t want them, the right course of action is not to blame systemd.<p>People who grew up on SysV init like to shit on systemd as it erases their existing knowledge, but to pretend that SysV init wasn&#x27;t a total, inconsistent mess or that anyone was maintaining consolekit before logind came around is distorting the truth, to put in mildly.')
