Item(by='bluejekyll', descendants=None, kids=[25634412, 25633430], score=None, time=1609773803, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25620411, text='I don’t understand this:<p><pre><code>  A, AAAA, TXT - set record\n\n  A, AAAA - check key\n\n  TXT - read value\n</code></pre>\nDynamic DNS supports all of these options directly. Why are additional records used for the key and value? IXFR could instead be used to check if a record is up-to-date rather than overloading A and AAAA in their meaning?<p>I’m probably missing something about how these records are meant to be used together. Is there a protocol doc available?')
