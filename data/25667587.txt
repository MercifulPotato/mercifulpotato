(I mean that literally, tribal humans or proto-humans murdered or outcompeted with less tribal humans at the whims of their tribal leaders and we are the result.)<p>Anyway I am under no illusions that we are going to have a change in policy and stop caring about aristocrat&#x27;s feeling more than our own well-being (Donald Trump is sad, let&#x27;s storm some buildings you guys. Jeff Bezos treats warehouse workers bad- but he needs to be able to do that cause it would hurt his feelings if the workers ran the company instead.)  So there&#x27;s no reason to debate it other than intellectual fun.')
