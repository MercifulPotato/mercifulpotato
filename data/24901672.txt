This is the exact same reason behind the algorithmic timeline: since you can&#x27;t easily tell whether you&#x27;ve reached the end (up to where you left off last time), you keep scrolling more, thus more time spent and more opportunities for ads to show up.<p>This trend will continue until users revolt against this by refusing to use engagement-funded services in favor of service they actually pay for, so that the incentive is no longer to waste the user&#x27;s time to generate engagement but to give the user what they want in the most efficient way possible in order to keep them paying for the product.')
