The first one was free (public domain) but the formatting was so terrible I couldn&#x27;t get through the first page. The text was center aligned, missing periods.<p>Then I bought a version of it for $3 thinking the formatting must be better if I&#x27;m paying for it. It was not. I finally bought a $10 version of it and the formatting was still awful enough that I couldn&#x27;t get through the first 5 pages.<p>For older books it feels like you have to buy a paper copy otherwise the formatting is somehow unreadable.')
