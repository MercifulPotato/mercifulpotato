News agencies have many channels, probably some of the largest being FB and G (hence this post) and now they&#x27;re looking to cut out the middle man because they believe it doesn&#x27;t provide them value and apparently detracts from it. However, note that there&#x27;s an inversion of power at some point when a platform becomes much bigger than its customers. News agencies will pretty much die out without G and FB (if they are indeed by far the largest channels) because someone will just post the news from their platform onto G and FB obfuscated enough to bypass copyright because people want news on G and FB.<p>It stopped being about &quot;I want news, oh cool G and FB have it!&quot; And started being about &quot;I read news on G and FB. What is this WSJ you are talking about&quot; a long time ago.<p>Platform inversion of power taken to its extreme, some might even say perhaps Google and Facebook should demand revenue share from ISPs and computer&#x2F;mobile manufacturers for incentivizing people to buy plans and devices to get on the internet?')
