Clearly your lived experience must be radically different from mine.<p>I&#x27;ve been a software developer for 30 years now, and never got a degree. I do have friends that are doctors and lawyers, and I prefer my career path to theirs. I started working and earning at 18, rather than going through 8 years of expensive schooling. All these years later (your 15 years doubled), I&#x27;m still in-demand, still earning reasonably well, and don&#x27;t experience the levels of stress or work the long hours my doctor and lawyer friends do.<p>But hey, when I was young, it was just doctors and lawyers who earned big money. Now it&#x27;s doctors, lawyers, and software developers, so that&#x27;s a huge gain for software! And still, only about 75% or so of software developers have degrees at all, let alone eight years of school and two degrees like are required to be a doctor or lawyer.<p>I&#x27;ve spent the last month interviewing for new &quot;Senior Java Developer&quot; positions, and I can assure you, having a degree does <i>not</i> mean one&#x27;s prospects are automatically good. Or that one know what one is doing, even.')
