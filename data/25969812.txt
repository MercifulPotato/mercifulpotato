Item(by='jbullock35', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612020459, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25969747, text='&gt; Kindle has mediocre UX compared to eg iPad, but is much much cheaper (leveraging that supply chain)<p>Does the supply chain really have anything to do with why the Kindle is cheaper than the iPad? I grant that Amazon has a good supply chain...but Apple seems to, too.<p>I would&#x27;ve thought that the Kindle is cheaper than the iPad because Amazon set out to build a product that is cheaper in every way. (I don&#x27;t mean that as criticism of the Kindle.)')
