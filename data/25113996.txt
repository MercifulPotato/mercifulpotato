An ad or not? Then of course if, according to your definition there are no ads there is no place for the mandadated government paid slots which aren&#x27;t ads to run. If you&#x27;re a non-profit, like say a church, selling any of the things churches sell, then that&#x27;s an ad for that stuff that&#x27;s not an ad so that&#x27;s then ok. If the profit you make is by being elected and then being a crook, then that&#x27;s not an ad. If you&#x27;re just doing brand awareness and recognition and promoting the fact that your company does charitable good works that&#x27;s also not an ad. In fact the majority of ads I&#x27;ve seen don&#x27;t have an explicit &quot;you should buy this&quot; line in them at all. The construction is obvious and basically nobody misses it but it&#x27;s not actually explicitly there. Certainly Chanel&#x27;s stink ads, which are the epitome of everything I hate, don&#x27;t.<p>The grey areas here overlap so badly and based on opinion alone that it really is a distinction without a difference. Any rule you set up I&#x27;ll show you as many exceptions that show it&#x27;s futile until boredom takes over.<p>You slice it any way you like. Do they take money for services? Ok so UNICEF information is ads but political advertisements are not. The Coca-Cola company endorses being nice to puppies and supporting your local shelter.<p>There can&#x27;t be a clear distinction. There can&#x27;t be sensible policy that fairly discriminates between good and bad paid 30 second television slots or between good and bad magazine spreads, between good and bad PR influenced news articles or anything of that nature.<p>The Covid information adverts that probably saved lives. They could easily have had the opposite information content and cost lives. Without verifying it, i&#x27;d be sure that somewhere in the world they were and activists were advocating a better response with paid ads which were funded by industry groups.')
