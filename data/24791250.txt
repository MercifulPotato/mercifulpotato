They could have easily been hacked.  But, what portions of the actual story are false?<p>The Biden campaign&#x27;s refutation was not to say that the emails were doctored.  They only said that they have checked the official schedule of Joe Biden from the day in question and there is no mention of a meeting with the Burisma executive (they don&#x27;t say categorically that he did not meet with him, just that it is not present on the official schedule).<p>Other then the meeting w&#x2F; Biden, I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a detail that has been specfically contested.')
