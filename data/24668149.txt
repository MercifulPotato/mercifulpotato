Many of my Indian-American classmates exhibit the behaviors described in this article. For example, in my high school (a magnet program for gifted students), there were several Indian-American students, many of whom were &quot;high-achieving&quot;. Most of them put a lot of effort into trying to buff their resumes to get into good colleges, for example by volunteering on causes they didn&#x27;t really care about. Cheating was rampant; the attitude many students seemed to have was why actually learn stuff when you can just cheat and get the same career rewards? Almost all of them followed very conventional (read: boring) career paths; in fact most of them became doctors. True creativity and risk-taking was not a personality trait I commonly observed, I&#x27;m sorry to say. I was lucky to have very &quot;Americanized&quot; parents who didn&#x27;t raise me with these backward attitudes.')
