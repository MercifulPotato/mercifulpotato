Item(by='falsaberN1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605073691, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25043587, text='For me, my brother passed away recently, he was there all normal when I went to class, he was dead when I came back. \nI am one of those who had no one reaching out to me. Nobody cared. I try to mention it and people changes the subject immediately, or goes like &quot;life&#x27;s cruel to everyone, I cannot go online to play my game tonight!&quot; or some other minor inconvenience to &quot;compare&quot; to my grief. I wasn&#x27;t even given some leisure about missing classes. I had to be back there immediately after the cremation.<p>I truly loved my brother. I have been with him all of my life, he was there when I was born and was there until his last day. I have lost family and friends before, but I was not as close to anyone else as I was to him. In all of this world, he was the only one &quot;on my level&quot;. He knew what I was talking about anytime, I knew what he was talking about anytime. We shared the same pains and trials that to everyone else sound like fiction. We never had a serious fight, and even if we argued it was a matter of hours before returning to good terms. I had no tears left by the time his remains got incinerated. I miss him so much.<p>Yet...for people, it&#x27;s more inconvenient to have to wear a mask or have an ISP downtime, or being unable to go to the bar because of an airborne virus. I had people literally stop talking to me during the first week because &quot;I was cramping their style with the sadness&quot; or people being all &quot;toughen up emo kid life is shit for everyone&quot; while the corpse was still being examined...<p>I am not a charismatic person. I am aware of that. I ramble about things and my writing style is verbose. But, why I am not deserving of any pity? All I wanted was to talk to someone after losing the one I had the closest relationship with. Then the pandemic happened and got even more isolated. I still haven&#x27;t managed to talk about it to anyone, to get it off my chest. My opinion of society at large is so low it might never bounce back.<p>I probably have the same thing that led to his death. Still going through testing because the pandemic slowed everything to a crawl, having to be reminded of it every day for way longer than it should be reasonable. It&#x27;d be sad to die this bitter.<p>If someone bothered to reach to the parent poster, that means they cared, even if just at a small level. Some people don&#x27;t even empty platitudes out of courtesy and are expected to still perform as normal or else.<p>Life is not cruel, it has no sapience nor sentience. People, however, can be unbelievably cruel.')
