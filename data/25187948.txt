This appears just before it:<p>&quot;What sorts of subject matter are appropriate for a game? Before you rush to answer, ask yourself how you would feel about, say, a version of Transport Tycoon where you have to move Jews from the cities where they live to the concentration camps where they will die.&quot;<p>If one feels completely comfortable with that, then the argument afterward can be disregarded. However, the author makes that argument on the assumption that you will feel uncomfortable with the above (as I&#x27;m sure a lot of us would) and posits that <i>Panzer General</i> should make you equally uncomfortable.<p>Further, I think it is unwise to brush aside any argument that the nature of the media we consume does not affect how we interact with the real world without consideration. Just because it turns out that old 90s arguments about DOOM turning us all into violent murderers was wrong doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t effects that might be harmful.')
