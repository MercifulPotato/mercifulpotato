For all of humanity&#x27;s advancements, quarantine-like behavior is our best bet against novel diseases.<p>In fact, many governments only implemented half-assed &quot;soft&quot; lockdowns. They should have acted immediately and decisively. Lockdown early and hard, at the very first signs that this thing was becoming a pandemic. And don&#x27;t let go until it&#x27;s under control.<p>Instead, we got this lame lockdown-but-not-quite (places of worship open, are you serious?), no mask mandate, nothing. And as soon as things start to look better, reopen. Oops, bad again, close. And now are are only prolonging the suffering.<p>Developing countries are once again in a bad shape, but richer countries should know better. Treat this as a war, support your citizens. Even though large companies like airlines are important, most of the focus should have been towards small businesses and individuals. Also on PPE at the very beginning.<p>There is enough money in the developed world to help with the problem. Make some fewer F-35 (at 200M a pop) if need be. That&#x27;s a lot of food and rent money.')
