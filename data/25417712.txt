Assume good faith.&quot; Reinforcing my claim that violation of the guidelines is the norm here rather than the exception.<p>My point was that authors of HN submissions are almost <i>always</i> treated with disrespect by HN commenters, and I was citing my repeated personal experience of having been such an author. (I believe the HN moderators are in denial and view the site through rose-colored&#x2F;orange-colored glasses). I don&#x27;t view having been #1 on HN to be an &quot;accomplishment&quot;. I don&#x27;t find it useful at all, because I run an independent business, yet being #1 on HN never increases my software sales at all, so it&#x27;s pretty useless as far as I&#x27;m concerned. It just increases my server usage. I&#x27;ve sometimes considered (as I&#x27;m sure many people have) simply blocking Hacker News referers on my server. Could still happen...<p>In fact I finally created an account on HN simply to try to have some &quot;control over the narrative&quot; in HN comments about my own authored articles, because there are often some really dumb misunderstandings in the comments. Not sure it has been worth it though.<p>Technically, I &quot;lost it&quot; on HN about 3 weeks ago, when I got sick and tired of accurate information being downvoted. The only reason I&#x27;m still here now is that I have way too much free time on my hands due to the pandemic&#x2F;social distancing.')
