Novel natural bat SARS-like coronaviruses have been found in caves hundred of miles from Wuhan... but are brought to Wuhan for study.<p>Here – <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;PeterDaszak&#x2F;status&#x2F;1197631383470034951" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;PeterDaszak&#x2F;status&#x2F;1197631383470034951</a> – an expert on the topic &amp; scientific collaborator with a Wuhan lab describes research he was proud of in November 2019:<p><i>&gt;  we’ve made great progress with bat SARS-related CoVs, ID’ing &gt;50 novel strains, sequencing spike protein genes, ID’ing ones that bind to human cells, using recombinant viruses&#x2F;humanized mice to see SARS-like signs, and showing some don’t respond to MAbs, vaccines...</i><p>Lab accidents leading to investigator infection &amp; escape are distressingly common. So why should &quot;wet market vendor&quot; or &quot;wildlife trader&quot; or &quot;farmer&quot; be a more presumptive index-case than &quot;researcher modifying bat coronaviruses searching for those that are most dangerous in humanized animal models&quot;?')
