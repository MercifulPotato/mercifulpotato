I think products which have efficiencies of scale - or low marginal costs of reproduction - suck up more capital, which raises certain basic levels of standards and polish and marketing, but also greatly increases capital risk and thus reduces investor risk appetite for product novelty. These mass market products starve the mid-market of attention, which makes the mid-market less capital efficient, which means the mid-market needs to get cheaper and cheaper, lose polish, until it&#x27;s less attractive to the mass market of consumers, and so on in a spiral until a certain spartan rawness becomes its own aesthetic - indie games, indie films, indie music.<p>I think there&#x27;s a concrete example which demonstrates the actual absence of that long tail of interesting content, and not just that it&#x27;s harder to find: blogs.<p>Blogs were great in the mid 2000s. The market did two things: it matured - the best blogs got more mindshare and turned into something closer to media organizations, much more capital intensive with full time paid writers, while and Facebook and Twitter sucked up the mass market of newsfeed consumers, both on the producer and consumer side, making it easier to produce low-value inanities and easier to consume tidbits from celebrities. This sucked the air of attention from blogs; being long-form, they were too hard to write and too long to read; and being unpaid, they didn&#x27;t have slick editors or snazzy design. So a lot of them shrivelled up. There are still niche blogs, plenty of them, but a <i>lot</i> fewer - and we can track this loss, because we have (or had) them in our newsreaders.')
