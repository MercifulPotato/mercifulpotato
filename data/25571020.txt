At the beginning of playing &quot;The Last of Us&quot;, I sort of felt bad whenever a (non-zombie) human died (either by my hands or part of the story). I especially felt bad when I made a 14 year old girl kill someone. But by the end I remorselessly hunted and executed every human I came across no matter which character I was.<p>Of course, that didn&#x27;t translate to any real life loss of empathy (I don&#x27;t think), but it was interesting how quickly the game desensitized my regard of fictional humans so that I stopped seeing them as anything of value but rather an enemy&#x2F;monster to be unquestioningly destroyed.')
