A whole generation of engineers seem to believe deprecate means to “remove support” or to remove entirely. Like “I just deprecated that function and deleted 100 lines of code.“<p>It actually means to “discourage use”. It’s the first step for a feature to be removed. You deprecate something and let the users know that they shouldn’t use it if possible and in the future it will be removed.<p>If you used a deprecated API, it means the API is no longer encouraged to be used, but it doesn’t mean the API is removed or that support is withdrawn.')
