My older brother was into PUA stuff, I was dumped recently so he recommended me to read some things. All the other books and blogs were like &quot;you have to do this one trick to get laid&quot;, but this book was a bit deeper. It changed my mind about being a happier and more fulfilled person by myself, and don&#x27;t stress over being liked by other people, which in turn makes you more likeable.')
