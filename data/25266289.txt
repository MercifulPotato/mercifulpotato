He says the main issues for all editors, regardless of what software they use, are rendering times and preparing viewable videos for clients to review â€” and that the M1 should help with both.<p>&quot;They are computer-processing-intensive actions,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to see if this new M1 chip speeds that up. It should. Dramatically. Then Avid, Adobe and DaVinci... have to use those hardware and OS advances in their software development.&quot;<p>--------------<p>Notice all the hedging. &quot;We&#x27;ll have to see...&quot; and &quot;it should ...&quot;<p>&gt; A college student now has access to the kind of video, graphics and sound production and editing capability that required a $4000 or $5000 workstation a few years ago.<p>Sure. That&#x27;s the usual march forward of computer technology for the last 30 years. But note: the fastest standard architecture system you can buy <i>STILL</i> costs about $5000, and it does mind-bogglingly more than that college student will be able to do on their M1.<p>So this isn&#x27;t changing the game at all, it&#x27;s just a continuation. A few years ago, almost nobody talked about being able to edit 8k video, but how that&#x27;s more or less a given. The requirements expand, the machines get faster.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m tremendously impressed by what Apple  appears to have done with the M1 (there&#x27;s me hedging too). I just get tired of it being described in a context where the comparisons don&#x27;t include a wide enough range of possible options. Before the M1 there were much more powerful systems available than anything Apple offered. After the M1, there continue to be more powerful systems available than anything Apple is offering. That doesn&#x27;t mean that an M1 Mac Mini is a dumb choice - it might indeed be the perfect combination of CPU&#x2F;Watt&#x2F;$. But it&#x27;s not changing what the high end is (yet).')
