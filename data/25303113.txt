Item(by='4cao', descendants=None, kids=[25305891], score=None, time=1607094898, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25300238, text='&gt; The best analogy I can think of between traditional vs simplified is akin to American English vs British English, except English learners don&#x27;t make a big fuss about which version they should learn first.<p>There isn&#x27;t really much of an analogy here, and on a general note, trying to approach a new problem by seeking an analogy to something we already know isn&#x27;t really the best way to gain insight: simply put, not everything we are about to see is going to be like something we have already seen, or even close to it.<p>With that in mind, if you really wanted to compare this to the varieties of English, I can offer this analogy:<p>The word &quot;curb&quot; in American English has a number of meanings related to &#x27;restraint&#x27;, or it can also mean &#x27;a raised edge of pavement&#x27;.<p>However, in British English, when used to mean the latter, the word is spelled &quot;kerb.&quot;<p>So, if you are familiar with British English and want to learn American English, all you have to do is remember to always spell it &quot;curb&quot; and never &quot;kerb.&quot;<p>However, if you are going the other way, you have to remember the new spelling of &quot;kerb,&quot; but also only to use it with a certain meaning, and not the others.<p>In this example, going from British to American English is easier than the other way round, just as going from traditional to simplified characters is easier than the opposite.<p>Yet another example could relate to the distinction between &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will,&quot; which some people make, and many (if not most) don&#x27;t. If you are used to making the distinction, and want to stop (go &quot;simplified&quot;), it is effortless: all you have to do is to start using &quot;will&quot; all the time. However, going the other way you&#x27;d have to learn the rules of using it, or face the risk of drowning:<p>(a) &quot;I shall drown, no one will save me!&quot;<p>(b) &quot;I will drown, no one shall save me!&quot;<p>Which one do you choose to be rescued?<p>Answer here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shall_and_will#Uses_of_shall_and_will_in_expressing_futurity" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shall_and_will#Uses_of_shall_a...</a>')
