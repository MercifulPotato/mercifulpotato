We talked to a small R&amp;D firm years ago that had proposed putting power stations in remote areas where energy is immediately converted into a metal hydride; in their case, magnesium hydride. I remember the process of reforming magnesium hydroxide back was fairly energy intensive, perhaps too much to be considered efficient.<p>The benefit of storing magnesium hydride is it&#x27;s much easier to store safely in large volumes than hydrogen gas. Hydrogen gas leaks through everything, it&#x27;s just so small. On the other hand, you have to collect spent material (presumably at &quot;gas stations&quot;) and return it to the energy farm, which is more complex than the one-way delivery system you&#x27;d have with hydrogen. Still seemed like an interesting idea.')
