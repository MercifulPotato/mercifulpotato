The bureau notes that most of these thefts were older models that lack the anti-theft technology of todayâ€™s models.  In fact, there were 6,707 thefts of the 1998 model year Civic, but only 388 of the 2017 Civics.<p>But, never underestimate the sheer incompetence of car owners:<p>&gt; More alarming is the finding that there were 229,339 vehicle thefts with keys or fobs left in the vehicles between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2018.<p>I don&#x27;t know how many times I&#x27;ve read a nextdoor article that states: 1. the car was stolen or broken into, but, 2.) they didn&#x27;t lock their 90s-era Honda.')
