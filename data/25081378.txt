I don&#x27;t watch movies or TV shows anymore except for the occasional trip to the big screen (last movie was Avengers, next movie I&#x27;ll go will be Tenet).<p>Not to mention I don&#x27;t have a credit card and can&#x27;t pay for stuff even if I wanted (last tv show I watched was HBO&#x27;s Westworld will probably skip next season though).<p>Only thing I pay for is Spotify through a family plan, relative has a credit card of course.')
