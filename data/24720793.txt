Our core philosophy is what’s different, we focus on building something for the everyday developer, where we abstract as much overhead as possible. A example of this is how you log into the Doppler CLI when developing. The “doppler login” command takes you to the browser and you sign in like how you would any other site. There is no need to remember API keys, everything is handled behind the scenes for you. Other things that set us apart: audit logs, versioning, and rich integrations with production infras like AWS, GCP, Heroku, Vercel, Netlify, etc.. Besides that, our pricing is much more friendly, we offer a free tier for unlimited users for all the core functionality.')
