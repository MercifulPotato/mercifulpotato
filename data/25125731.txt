But then you throw in something like this from All the Pretty Horses and it&#x27;s got strong opinions...<p>&quot;In the evening he saddled his horse and rode out west from the house.  The wind was much abated and it was very cold and the sun sat blood red  and elliptic under the reefs of bloodred cloud before him. He rode where  he would always choose to ride, out where the western fork of the old  Comanche road coming down out of the Kiowa country to the north passed  through the westernmost section of the ranch and you could see the faint  trace of it bearing south over the low prairie that lay between the  north and middle forks of the Concho River. At the hour he&#x27;d always  choose when the shadows were long and the ancient road was shaped before  him in the rose and canted light like a dream of the past where the  painted ponies and the riders of that lost nation came down out of the  north with their faces chalked and their long hair plaited and each  armed for war which was their life and the women and children and women  with children at their breasts all of them pledged in blood and  redeemable in blood only. When the wind was in the north you could hear  them, the horses and the breath of the horses and the horses&#x27; hooves  that were shod in rawhide and the rattle of lances and the constant drag  of the travois poles in the sand like the passing of some enormous  serpent and the young boys naked on wild horses jaunty as circus riders  and hazing wild horses before them and the dogs trotting with their  tongues aloll and footslaves following half naked and sorely burdened an  above all the low chant of their traveling song which the riders sang  as they rode, nation and ghost of nation passing in a soft chorale  across that mineral waste to darkness bearing lost to all history and  all remembrance like a grail the sum of their secular and transitory and  violent lives.&quot;')
