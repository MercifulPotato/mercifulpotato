I suspect the people who claim climate change as an existential threat and denounce nuclear because of reasons like nuclear waste, don&#x27;t really believe climate change is an existential threat.<p>&gt;types who oppose it even now because &quot;it&#x27;s too late now&quot;<p>They aren&#x27;t wrong about that because we set ourselves a timeframe of 2030-2060 to completely decarbonize. Restarting large-scale nuclear deployment would take decades and wouldn&#x27;t really fit within that timeframe.<p>The brutal reality is that we will not decarbonize by 2060 with renewables - so we keep wasting time by not investing in nuclear. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I firmly believe we will get back on the nuclear wagon, because we live in a world that is still growing in population and per capita energy use and there is nothing as energy dense as nuclear.<p>I&#x27;m also surprised that for all the talk about decarbonizing to fight climate change, there is very little discussion on what we need to do to live with the effects of climate change. It&#x27;s pretty obvious that no matter what we do, we&#x27;re not going to be removing the existing carbon from the atmosphere anytime in the next few hundred years.')
