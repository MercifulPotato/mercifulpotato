I don&#x27;t care if it means there won&#x27;t be more doordashes if the only way those companies can exist is by scamming customers and exploiting restaurants. I don&#x27;t see why this is a problem. They&#x27;re called &quot;growth hacks&quot; for a reason. If your concern is that people won&#x27;t be able to compete with DoorDash now without breaking the law, maybe DoorDash should be penalized for past misbehavior... If you follow this &quot;but banning this will prevent competition!&quot; logic to its conclusion now it&#x27;s logically inappropriate to make all sorts of things illegal because fraudsters got rich doing them and it would prevent competition.<p>Personally I think it&#x27;s possible for delivery apps to succeed without breaking the law. Similarly I believe a cab-hailing app can succeed without breaking the law. The fact that the big players in both markets have made &quot;regulatory arbitrage&quot; and lawbreaking a core part of their business model (protected by massive amounts of venture capital and highly paid lawyers) is not a reason to get rid of the laws they broke.')
