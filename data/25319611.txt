Timnit Gebru was severed from Google because of a conflict between her and the research practices at Google. Moreover, the story begins with her offering an ultimatum and Google preemptively accepting her resignation. No part of this story reasonably involves the &quot;gender differences&quot; and &quot;difficult truths&quot; you&#x27;re invoking.<p>Dropping boilerplate ideological provocations onto unrelated threads isn&#x27;t good-faith conversation. Whether you mean it to be or not, it has the effect of trolling, and on HN, trolling is a strict-liability offense; your mens rea matters less than the outcome.<p>Please don&#x27;t do things like this on HN.')
