Item(by='mxuribe', descendants=None, kids=[25942114, 25942095], score=None, time=1611841262, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25941255, text='I have anecdotes from friends who have tried to object to terms...and they never seemed to have leverage in the negotiation.  In almost every case, their direct boss was in favor of adjusting the terms to appease the employee (my friends) - because the supervisor saw the value in the employee...But either senior management or legal teams on the employer side - not understanding or caring for the value of the employee - are resistant to any adjustment of terms. For those senior members it almost becomes a mini war. Usually they respond within the kind of comments like &quot;if you don&#x27;t like the terms, go work elsewhere&quot;.  In essence the majority of direct supervisors want to help employees, but the higher ups act like owners of a factory in late 1800s!  So, yeah in theory an employee can object and try to negotiate...but in my almost 3 decades of professional career (as a technologist across numerous different industries), I have *never* heard of any good outcomes for an employee - they either have to accept terms or leave. (If things have turned out great for you, then huzzah for you; I count you in the minority!)')
