Basically it&#x27;s a strong signal of lack of independence and a strong sign of dependence, dependency upon a parent who is the one taking care of business in some way that keeps the bills paid and the both of them alive. When the parent passes on how will these individuals function and survive I think is the big gaping question.<p>To further aggravate things too I suppose, if the parent&#x27;s health declines and requires the financial help of their children who cannot provide it then you&#x27;re left with a situation where two dependents are present to the situation.')
