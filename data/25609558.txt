Remember the whole PS5 hoarding saga from like a week ago - if you let the free market figure out the vaccine, someone will decide they can buy thousands of doses and resell them for profit in a couple of weeks once supply becomes smaller, and in the meantime, as the author worries, exponential spread will continue.<p>Even if you apply rationing (you could say that every dose purchased must be associated with a natural person who is going to get the vaccine as soon as it&#x27;s shipped), the <i>vaccine maker</i> is now in the same position - why sell the vaccine for $100&#x2F;dose to Hospital A today if they suspect that the bigger, richer, more bureaucratic Hospital B will get around to making an offer for $110&#x2F;dose tomorrow?<p>So the &quot;free market&quot; solution here involves compelling the vaccine makers to accept any price offered immediately as well as preventing a secondary market, i.e., killing every mechanism for price discovery, which is the core mechanism of free markets. You can&#x27;t really call it a market at that point, and all your intuitions about market efficiency go out the window.')
