E.g. I&#x27;ve fairly often had cases where I want to temporarily remove a check, to see if something behaves as I expect:<p><pre><code>  &#x2F;&#x2F;if (some logic) {\n    do something\n  &#x2F;&#x2F;} else {\n  &#x2F;&#x2F;  something else\n  &#x2F;&#x2F;}\n</code></pre>\nOr in other cases collapse two if&#x2F;else blocks together, or stuff like that.  It&#x27;s not as common as commenting out a logical unit, definitely, but it&#x27;s far from <i>uncommon</i>.<p>How would you achieve that in Clojure?  Seems like you&#x27;d need to copy&#x2F;paste, like this?<p><pre><code>  #_(if (cond) thing other_thing)\n  thing</code></pre>')
