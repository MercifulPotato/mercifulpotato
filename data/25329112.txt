Maybe having beer and liquor bottles in the kitchen or snack room or whatever but half empty bottles littering the CEO&#x27;s desk and every employee or even every team having their own mini-fridge is odd.<p>I&#x27;ve worked at startups with a &quot;drinking culture&quot; and startups with a &quot;board game culture&quot; and I&#x27;ll take the board game culture every time. Doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t let loose and drink, too - but drinking as the central activity quickly turns a business into a frat house. I do have some great memories celebrating milestones, new hires, etc with early stage coworkers :D')
