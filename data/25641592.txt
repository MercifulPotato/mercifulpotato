Facebook and Twitter won&#x27;t care if Section 230 is repealed; they can afford enough lawyers to handle any lawsuits thrown at them. In fact they would probably like it, since it would mean even less competition for them than they currently have. So repealing Section 230 would actually make the situation worse, not better.<p>A change that might improve the situation would be to pass legislation clarifying the boundaries of &quot;good faith moderation&quot;, which is the part of Section 230 that Facebook and Twitter are abusing. Unfortunately, nobody seems to be talking about that.<p><i>&gt; HN is a rare exception.</i><p>Maybe, but the fact remains that it exists, and we can come here and have discussions and not have to even pay attention to all the dreck that is out there. I don&#x27;t use Facebook. I don&#x27;t use Twitter. I do use HN and sites like it. <i>Those</i> sites are not replaceable, and they <i>need</i> the protection that Section 230 offers.<p><i>&gt; personal blogs, company sites, LWN and other news sites</i><p>I don&#x27;t want &quot;news&quot;. I want <i>discussion</i>. And the whole point of Section 230 is that we can <i>have</i> sites like this one where actual discussion can take place, not just someone posting their thoughts on blog A and someone else responding on blog B. The <i>reason</i> sites like this exist is that everyone just posting what they think on their own blog is not a good way to have online discussions. I don&#x27;t want to give up the added value that discussion forums provide. Nor, as I said above, do I think giving it up by repealing Section 230 would actually improve anything.')
