My initial reaction was to disagree that google was a software company and that it&#x27;s more of a &quot;tech&#x2F;search&#x2F;social media&quot; company. Microsoft is a software company, not google. But the longer I think about it, the more it becomes apparent that google is a software company. It just provides its software as a service&#x2F;subscription for your data.')
