Item(by='tiew9Vii', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610969179, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25819761, text='Basic carbs mainly oats, rice or potatoes etc. Lean meat mainly chicken or fish. Lots of green veg, often steamed, a salad etc. Fats are from things such as nuts, avocados, eggs etc not cooking oils. Maybe a banana or odd piece of fruit but generally lots of veg and greens over fruit to avoid sugar. Avoid dairy as calorie dense.<p>Carbs will be reduced compared to non cutting but still consumed regardless. Normally it’s carbs that get manipulated, lowering them slightly or increase slightly depending on if cutting or bulking.<p>It’s simple and unglamorous and that’s likely why most people don’t eat like that as it’s simple or as people will say bland and boring. Even if you mix it up with spices and how you cook&#x2F;prepare it, it’s the same basic core meal.<p>If you are not bodybuilding and only interested in loosing fat you can likely reduce the amount of protein (meat). You then end up close to a “whole food” diet I see people talk about these days minus the oils and sauces which are calorie dense.')
