Take farming, for example. Fundamentally farming is 100,000 years old. Getting up to speed on modern methods is just adding something else to the stack and, while complicated, those methods aren&#x27;t totally foreign for someone who understands what farming is.<p>Something like coding is so alien to a 70-80 year old it&#x27;s basically incomprehensible. That won&#x27;t be the case with us in 50 years when were that age because we understand it, but there will probably be other things at that point that are equally incomprehensible.')
