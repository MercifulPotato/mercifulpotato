I lost my voice for a few days during an otherwise &quot;normal&quot; cold … and it never really came back. The ability to talk came back, but the ability to sing didn&#x27;t, not fully. (I could <i>hear</i>, in my voice, that something wasn&#x27;t right, but beyond that it was hard to describe. Also, I think that was the first &amp; only time I&#x27;ve ever lost my voice. I … didn&#x27;t <i>really</i> believe people, when they said they&#x27;d &quot;lost their voice&quot;. I always just sort of assumed they were whispering because their throat hurt, and talking was painful, and they didn&#x27;t want pain. No! Turns out that losing your voice is a <i>thing!</i>)<p>I got referred to an ENT pretty quickly. From there … it got a bit bad-healthcare interesting. The first attempt at getting a look at my vocal chords, as I recall, was with a fiber optic scope up the nose. They numb your nose first, and it wasn&#x27;t painful, but it was beyond uncomfortable, and apparently I nearly blacked out. (And apparently that&#x27;s common.)<p>The second attempt was a camera down the throat, and while that was also not great, it got the image of the throat the ENT wanted, and showed the polyp. I wish I had the image; the doctor was not sure how to transfer that to me, so I never got it.<p>The bill though, was something else. It was like $4k, just to get a look a my throat. Thankfully insurance cut that back considerably, but I instantly paid my deductible for the year. But I can&#x27;t fathom what actually cost that, unless the camera they stuck down my throat somehow couldn&#x27;t just be wiped clean &amp; reused.<p>The surgery to remove the polyp, AIUI at the time, had a prognosis of like a 50% chance of the polyp just coming back. The ENT prescribed some voice exercises, but they were hard to keep up with. So I ended up just taking it easy for a while, and the problem went away. (Though if the article is to be believed, I&#x27;d best never run into a vocal specialist in an elevator if I want to keep on thinking that…; but I&#x27;m also not a singer.)')
