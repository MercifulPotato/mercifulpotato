Item(by='hinkley', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604356514, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24974120, text='There was a horror movie that came out a year or two ago, involving haunted woods or somesuch, and I can&#x27;t tell you anything more about the movie because all I could process was the fact that the &#x27;forest&#x27; they showed was trees planted on like a 4 or 5 foot center, in perfect rows.  Math says that&#x27;s somewhere ~2000 trees per acre, which I think is the real horror story.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how you&#x27;d even log that. Every tree that dies is going to kill a few of its neighbors, until there are giant triangles of dead trees.')
