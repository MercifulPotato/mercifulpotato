Why can&#x27;t reddit do the same thing? 4chan exists as well yet they haven&#x27;t been taken down.<p>This is why I disagree with the argument that reddit hasn&#x27;t taken down any subreddits that &quot;werent vile.&quot; If someone is on the internet, they&#x27;re going to find something they&#x27;re interested in. ISP&#x27;s can&#x27;t stop it for web traffic, why should reddit be treated any differently?')
