I actually lived in New Orleans for 3 years and, when I was in the city, it was pretty much a matter of going from AC to AC for multiple months a year. I didn&#x27;t really do outdoor activities.<p>The one time I was in Austin over a weekend relatively recently--I had events on either side--I did go up to Fredericksburg one day but mostly I just hung out until evening when the bats came out.<p>The only thing that really bugs me about snow is commuting&#x2F;traveling.
