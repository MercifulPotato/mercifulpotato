Fine, so he was just treading water till his own bonuses cleared, but that was his choice.<p>You&#x27;re desperately trying to blame the victim for some reason.<p>Your desperation is such that somehow you&#x27;ve tried to spin the victim getting paid for his work according to his contract as somehow a failing.<p>&gt; (...) That was his choice.<p>Victim blaming aside, it&#x27;s rather odd that you&#x27;re trying to bash the victim for &quot;choices&quot; like doing his job and getting paid for his work and not being subjected to abuse.<p>It sounds like somehow you believe people don&#x27;t have the right to think for themselves, to not tolerate abuse and disrespect, and have their best-interests in mind.<p>I&#x27;m done with your comment, frankly. I won&#x27;t read any more of it. I don&#x27;t believe anything of value can come out of this absurd line of reason that sounds like a sociopath bashing his victims for the inconvenience they created by stopping being abused. This is not a reasonable conversation that reasonable adults have, and for this reason I&#x27;m out.')
