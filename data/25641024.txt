The person claimed that I would not be worse off.  And that person was wrong.  And I have described specifically how I would be worse off.<p>You keep trying to redirect to something that is not relevant.  The relevant question was whether or not I would be worse off with a union.  And the answer is that I have giving an exact answer as to how I would be worse off.<p>Glad that you agree that the original person was wrong, and that I was right on how I would be worse off.<p>Nothing that you said at all disagrees with me regarding this specific issue.  You have made no statement that disagrees with the true fact that I would be worse off by having to be under the union contract.&quot;<p>This conversation is about whether or not people are harmed by unions in this way, and bringing up irrelevant stuff does not change that.<p>Nothing that you said is an actual convincing argument as for why unions do not harm me, when I have laid out specifically how it makes my situation worse.')
