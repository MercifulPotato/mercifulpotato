Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re standing at the edge of a pond, and you see waves rippling across the surface. The deviation in height of the surface of the water is described by h = cos(r + t) where r is the distance from the centre of the pond and t is the current time.<p>Why can you see the solution of the equation for the entire surface of the pond at once, but only for a single instant of time at any given moment?')
