This is a well known issue with divisions(modulo) in generating random numbers.  This is literally why there is an injunction for people not to create their own crypto.<p>Of course, the meeaning isn&#x27;t that people aren&#x27;t to work on crypto but that people shouldn&#x27;t create RNGs like this thinking they are better than the prior-art, when they actually regress with already solved probems.<p>This is the exact different between arc4random() and arc4random_uniform().<p><pre><code>  arc4random_uniform() is recommended over constructions like\n  arc4random() % upper_bound as it avoids &quot;modulo bias&quot; when\n  the upper bound is not a power of two.\n</code></pre>\nUnfortunately when I google for <i>ios random number</i> The <i>very</i> first return says<p><pre><code>  We can use the C function rand() for this:\n  int i = rand()%10+1;</code></pre>')
