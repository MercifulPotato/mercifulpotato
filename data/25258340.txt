The difference in great-circle lengths based on nonspherical oblateness (tens of miles) would account for up to a minute difference in arrival times at the antipode.  At most it would be a sustained rumbling.<p>And on a global scale, there are many differences in pressure and wind speeds and temperature that do slightly alter the speed of sound.  I don&#x27;t know the magnitude of that, but it would further disperse the arrival times at the antipode to at least some extent.')
