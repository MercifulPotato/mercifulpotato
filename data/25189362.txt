The names of these formats just doesn&#x27;t come immediately to mind, but having worked with antenna models, we&#x27;d stay with text representations whenever possible, and it worked just fine.<p>&gt; - Mutli-dimensional sequences: Images, Videos, etc.<p>&gt; - most domain specific problems &#x2F; formats<p>&gt; - ... almost everything else<p>This is where things get tricky, and again, I don&#x27;t have experience in these domains. I can say, I&#x27;ve worked on projects where binary assets were tracked in Perforce. Not sure how efficient it was with diffs, but I know it worked, and probably better than git, which yes, doesn&#x27;t know anything about binaries.<p>Note: I am not a fan of Perforce, for other reasons, but I am not blind to the fact that it handles binary versioning better than git.<p>Note2: I will also add, SVGs are just one image format that can be stored as text.
