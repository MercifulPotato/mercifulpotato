A planeful of middle-aged Asian gentlemen in suits would land in the morning, take a private bus tour around open properties, pay the asking, board the plane and leave. Developers were literally building high-rises to give foreign &quot;investors&quot; something valuable to buy. This all but priced every normal family the fuck out of the market.
