Item(by='ParadigmComplex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612190290, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25985649, text='&gt; You mentioned both Arch and AUR in the target user part, which makes me wonder if you were mainly a Arch user before,<p>Before Bedrock Linux I was mainly a Debian user.<p>I did briefly run Arch Linux before working on Bedrock, but I found the churn bothersome.  While I was running Arch, it updated AwesomeWM from 2.X to 3.X, which changed AwesomeWM configuration formats and functionally broke on my system.  Arguably, this wasn&#x27;t a mistake on the part of Arch Linux developers; the expectation is that the user reads about updates before applying them.  Had I done this diligence, I could have withheld the AwesomeWM update.  However, I didn&#x27;t feel like I was able to apply this diligence with the expected regularity.<p>Personally, I prefer Debian&#x27;s pattern of only releasing security updates with any regularity, only making breaking changes every few years which can be applied when I have time to dedicate to understanding and handling them.  Bedrock lets me get _most_ of my system from Debian, but still get newer packages from Arch or rare packages from the AUR when the trade-off of new-ness vs churn is worthwhile for me.<p>&gt; and what triggers you do start this project.<p>I didn&#x27;t actually set out with the goal to combine distros.  Rather, initially (circa 2008) I worked on a sandbox technology.  My aim was to fluidly transition resources between security contexts, minimizing user friction while maintaining permissions segregation.  I realized only afterward that the technology I developed could be used to fluidly combine features from different distros.  Once it occurred to me I could do this, I started seeing use cases everywhere, and pivoted direction to what became Bedrock.<p>&gt; As an satisfied Arch user, I always find AUR has already included something I need. Better, sometimes I just found them already in community repo.<p>In that case, I fully encourage you to stick with Arch rather than switch to Bedrock.')
