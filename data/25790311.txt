Having small speakers on desk is a functional compromise. People working professionally with sound will buy studio monitors which take way more space but they can take it because sound quality is important because it is their job.<p>- multiple speakers producing low end == timing and interference issues. When you have multiple speakers producing low end, you will hear interference as you move your head around as different lengths of waves cancel or reinforce at difference places.<p>Since you don&#x27;t need stereo for low end (your brain can&#x27;t discern direction of very low end sound anyway) it is better to avoid that issue by having single speaker.<p>Now, single speaker avoids those issues and allows you to be basically anywhere in the room and have acceptable sound, but adds discontinuity between your low and mid range. Audio professionals will prefer studio monitors because they care for for the sound to come undisturbed so much, they can place their speakers symetrically and keep their head at exactly right spot when listening.')
