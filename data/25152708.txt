The government does actually have to grapple with questions like that, and even the best government will necessarily accept medical deaths to prevent a larger number of starvation deaths in the short term, or mass poverty in the long term.<p>The trick is adequately figuring out what is an  &#x27;essential service&#x27;. Really, it&#x27;s more like figuring out what&#x27;s inessential....<p>I&#x27;m lucky enough to be a Canadian and the CERB benefit has helped family members and friends who work in inessential industries like tourism that have been hurt badly by this. I support programs to help with that so those folks don&#x27;t become poor. But no amount of money is going to let us close grocery stores, at least not without some other food logistics system in place.')
