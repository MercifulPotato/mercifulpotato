A full-chain zero-click remote complete compromise for either system is only $2-3 million. That is absolute chump change. 4-6% of households in the US [1], 5-8 million households, have sufficient assets to fully compromise every iPhone or Android in the world. If we consider businesses, I bet that is within the reach of no less than 50% of the businesses (including small businesses) in the US. That is an absurd number of entities where that price point is totally doable.<p>If a bad actor can derive just $10 on average per phone they attack, then all they need to do is find a way to deploy their $2-3 million exploit to 1 million phones for less than $5 million to make a tidy profit. Given that we are talking about zero-click remote compromises, which means the victim only needs to receive the payload, this means that it is profitable as long as the cost per victim impression is less than $5, a CPM of $5000. With that sort of budget you can embed your attack into an ad and then outbid everybody else by a factor of 10 for placements. You can buy a mailing list and embed your attack as a &quot;payload pixel&quot;. If it is a zero-click text message attack then you can buy access to the spam-callers and mass deploy it that way.<p>These systems are between a factor of 10-100x off of adequate. To care about their relative differences is like debating whether paper mache or tissue paper is better at stopping bullets. One is probably better than the other, but neither provides meaningful protection, so it hardly matters. You need fundamental, qualitative improvements before differences between the solutions provide meaningful effects on outcomes.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dqydj.com&#x2F;average-median-top-net-worth-percentiles&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dqydj.com&#x2F;average-median-top-net-worth-percentiles&#x2F;</a>')
