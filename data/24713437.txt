I left my job as a PM at Lyft (Citi Bike, technically) in March to dive full-time into my passion project (watercoolertrivia.com). As of two weeks ago, our tiny team of three (and I&#x27;m the only one full-time) crossed the 100k ARR mark. It&#x27;s been a complete blast to bootstrap this into existence. One of the co-founders and I hosted pub trivia in college which was the genesis of this idea, 7 (!) years ago.<p>Happy to answer any questions at all about the business or about our decision to bootstrap instead of raise venture money.')
