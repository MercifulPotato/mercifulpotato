It doesn&#x27;t help <i>generate</i> quality results in the first place. Google&#x27;s main first innovation was PageRank, not click tracking. Click tracking is just a metric to <i>judge</i> the underlying algorithms.<p>(There is one exception: it can be used to fine-tune the order of the top 5-10 results for the most popular queries, but of course most of search is in the long tail where that fine tuning can&#x27;t be done. And in any case, you still need excellent candidates for your first 10 items to begin with.)<p>Click tracking does nothing for parsing a query, nothing for ranking the top 10 items out of a million matches, and nothing for extracting information.<p>And why are you talking about the top 1,000 sites? My whole point is crawling the web is the <i>easy</i> part.')
