It doesn&#x27;t help <i>generate</i> quality results in the first place <i>at all</i>. (Google&#x27;s first innovation was PageRank, not click tracking.) It&#x27;s a metric to <i>judge</i> the underlying algorithms. (And some fine-tuning of the order of the top 5-10 results for only the most popular queries, but most of search is in the long tail of course so that fine tuning can&#x27;t be done.)<p>Click tracking does nothing for parsing a query, nothing for ranking the top 10 items out of a million matches, and nothing for extracting information.<p>And why are you talking about the top 1,000 sites? My whole point is crawling the web is the <i>easy</i> part.')
