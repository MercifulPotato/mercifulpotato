Her initial goal was to work in a cancer unit in a hospital. She worked in a couple different hospitals and hated all of those positions, even though she was quite interested in cancer treatment. She had really shitty coworkers, poor managers, and terrible hours (night or switch shifts).<p>The job she&#x27;s liked the most is at an internal medicine clinic at a downtown hospital. The hours are good, she gets along with most of her coworkers, and she likes the diverse patient population she works with. So even though it&#x27;s not her area of greatest interest, it turned out that this was by far the _least_ important aspect of what gave her job satisfaction.<p>When we discussed this she was a bit surprised to realize this, but it wasn&#x27;t a surprise for me. My current Team Lead position at ActiveState is my favorite position of my career. I really like the team I manage, I like the company&#x27;s management and all of the people I work with. It&#x27;s not perfect (nothing is), but overall it&#x27;s just a really pleasant place to work.')
