Clearly, ISIS didn&#x27;t need YouTube to spread. It conquered large parts of Syria and was defeated via military means. Plenty of ISIS sympathisers turned up in the west later, but I don&#x27;t recall reading about many that were radicalised by watching YouTube. Normally they&#x27;d either been to Syria, or it was local mosques.')
