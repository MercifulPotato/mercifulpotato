How is a non-RIAA equalized record supposed to be played? All palyback equipment&#x2F;setups have built in equalization that converts the RIAA equalized signal from the vinyl back to normal. It&#x27;s either built in to the vinyl player, or done via a phono-preamp usually in the amplifier or a mixer. This isn&#x27;t usually explicitly stated anywhere on the equipment as it&#x27;s an industry standard.<p>So if you have a record that doesn&#x27;t have the RIAA curve applied, what are you supposed to play it on? The RIAA correction is pretty much unavoidable on any standard playback equipment.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m willing to believe this if you can reference me to some example of modern non-equalized&#x2F;non-RIAA vinyls.')
