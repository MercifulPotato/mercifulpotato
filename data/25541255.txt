Item(by='Pfhreak', descendants=None, kids=[25542252, 25542235], score=None, time=1608955002, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25539539, text='&gt; Sorry but almost everyone does have ID on them at all times.<p>This is objectively false. 11+% of Americans don&#x27;t have a government issued photo id. Presumably many more forget their id on any given day. The folks who don&#x27;t have IDs are disproportionately minorities and the elderly. In some places, as few as 55% off eligible Black people had IDs.<p>Millions more are here illegally, and yes, we should design our society to accommodate them. &quot;Maybe they shouldn&#x27;t be here&quot; is both callous and unrealistic. No one should have to live in fear that they&#x27;ll be spotted on some camera and have their life ruined.<p>&gt; All this fear mongering about false positives is irrelevant because there is a human in the loop.<p>Humans in the loop won&#x27;t fix failures. Last week we were all discussing how hospital administrators blamed &quot;the algorithm&quot; when vaccines were issued to admins rather than front line workers. People <i>constantly</i> say, &quot;well, the computer says...&quot; when the computer is obviously making a mistake. The TSA regularly screws up people&#x27;s travel because they make mistakes about the no fly list. A human can be in the loop, but in practice the human isn&#x27;t going to meaningfully question the outcome.')
