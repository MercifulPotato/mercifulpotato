As the actual troop leader often said, if the adults are sweating something is not being done correctly; the kids should be doing all the work and the adults are mere safety advisor guests of the kids.<p>Some kids in some subcultures are able to safely with minimal adult supervision, for example, whittle wood sticks into smaller theoretically artistic sticks at age 8 whereas others STILL cannot responsibly whittle at age 24.<p>I spent a lot of time as a dad parenting at a laptop on the deck occasionally saying &quot;no, there&#x27;s a buried gas line there, dig for fossils over there&quot; and the kids would make their own &quot;discoveries&quot; underground.<p>Its kinda like being in management where some folks (or kids) need near hand-over-hand supervision sometimes, yet others you just kinda check on every day or so.  Ideally by the time the kids are adults (16, 18, 21, ..., ?) the parents shouldn&#x27;t be doing much other than occasional management checkins and providing of advice.<p>There&#x27;s a big difference between leading and enabling the kids while knowing exactly what they&#x27;re doing in a safety sense, vs not being involved at all.<p>For example I know next to nothing about welding (well, I know a little but I&#x27;m no certified nuclear boiler welder...) so I was quite happy to have one of the boy scout dads who&#x27;s all certified up in welding teach that badge &quot;in my place&quot;.  He teaches older apprentices how to weld gas pipelines so he&#x27;s certainly qualified to teach... All I really did as his partner was make sure everyone stayed hydrated LOL.<p>For little kids a lot of parenting is you just need a parent figure at the park to occasionally say &quot;no&quot; and redirect.  &quot;Yeah I see the league has a ball game at the diamond so you can&#x27;t play there, but no you&#x27;re not playing baseball in the busiest street in the city get back on the grass now&quot;<p>A better analogy is something like you&#x27;re claiming if a bank hires a security manager who enforces security policies then the bank is not providing actual &quot;uniformed dude standing at attention&quot; security.  Yet some kind of manager role may be the most important time&#x2F;money the bank can spend WRT security...<p>When they&#x27;re younger toddlers they need a lot of parenting until they discover lego or whatever, but that&#x27;s a rather short phase in their lives.')
