I obtained &#x27;a&#x27; GPU and spent a week trying to learn how to fine-tune GPT with it, and the results were terrible. Maybe this isn&#x27;t the kind of thing suitable for hacking on as a hobby, unless you&#x27;re a researcher or employee with access to a lot of capital and dozens of GPUs.<p>Still wish the old talktotransformer model was released, instead of monetized behind a new company. I haven&#x27;t been able to find a comparable model yet.')
