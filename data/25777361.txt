And while you may (I&#x27;m assuming this is in reference to you) be able to weather the &quot;ginger menace&quot; remark, I&#x27;m not sure how well that translates elsewhere.<p>To wit: I once had a new friend call me a terrorist in a similar manner to the aforementioned &quot;ginger menace&quot; introduction after a few times of having met. That was the last time we spent time together.<p>I feel pretty odd using the phrase in quotes. Mind if I stop? I recognize it&#x27;s probably not offensive to you, but I hesitate continuing to use it.')
