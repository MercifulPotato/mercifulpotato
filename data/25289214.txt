On the contrary, we put a lot of effort (and 7,000+ words) into trying to explain everything that we did - just as we&#x27;ve done with other benchmarks which others have linked to.<p>The TimescaleDB test did not use continuous aggregates for these test, only raw time-series data stored in hypertables.<p>For each database, we (and other contributors) do our best to use features in all cases that take advantage of the DB. For TimescaleDB, a function like LAST() happens to be really powerful for most workloads and is really, really fast. That&#x27;s not cheating, it&#x27;s using the software properly! :-)<p>The SQL that we generate for each database can be examined here (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;timescale&#x2F;tsbs&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;cmd&#x2F;tsbs_generate_queries&#x2F;databases" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;timescale&#x2F;tsbs&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;cmd&#x2F;tsbs_gener...</a>) and as an open source project, anyone is free to contribute!')
