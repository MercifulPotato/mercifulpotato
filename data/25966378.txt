They have rapidly lost that trust, in my mind. Once a party violates some level of implicit trust, you have to distance yourself from that party. Big tech has shown their true colors. They will abuse their monopoly power to exploit politics, manipulate people, cut up and coming competitors off at the knees, and censor anything they don&#x27;t agree with. This is not the web I signed up for. This is not the revolutionary open tech that kids like me that grew up in the 90s gushed about. This is a dystopian Orwellian nightmare. It&#x27;s time to get off the ride.')
