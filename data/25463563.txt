I already have this problem with services that decide they really need to send me some code by email because they don’t recognize my device (because it’s been more than 30 days and Safari killed their cookies). And then every once in a while the email doesn’t show up for 45 minutes for some reason, leaving me with no recourse.<p>It&#x27;s incredible to me how impatient we&#x27;ve become as a society.<p>As everything is given to us faster and faster, with less and less financial cost, the more we demand this of everything going forward. Anything that comes shy of this demand by mere minutes is shunned as unacceptable.')
