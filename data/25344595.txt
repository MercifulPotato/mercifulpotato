They overstate COVID lethality and downplay people&#x27;s worries about the side effects.<p>If this article is representative of the public messaging on the vaccine people are going to start being hesitant to take it. We&#x27;ve already seen some of this.<p>They should instead be talking about the # of people to whom the vaccines have been given and compare their outcomes to accurate COVID stats. This is how I&#x27;ve worked with people who are nervous, but I don&#x27;t actually have the vaccine trial outcomes (other than # who got COVID) because I don&#x27;t think they have been published!')
