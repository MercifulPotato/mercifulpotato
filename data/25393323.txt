Good all around useful info!<p>There is a restraining order, active court cases, bail, all that stuff. The victim is packed up and moving out of their shared apartment today to a neutral location. I guess what I meant by that is that we are in a rural area. Police response time to a 911 call is regularly 45+ minutes. A violent spouse can do a lot of things in 45 minutes. Best to avoid that entirely.<p>I&#x27;m reasonably sure that the victim&#x27;s physical security will be assured as of this evening. I&#x27;m looking forward, trying to think ahead of any ways (technical or not) that the abuser could use to find their new location.')
