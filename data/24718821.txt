Cracking down on pill mills and making Oxy less abusable has pushed more and more to heroin&#x2F;meth&#x2F;synthetics. The drug problem is still rampant in the area. People need help and the barrier to receiving help in this country is too high.<p>I had a friend begging for help with treatment and the only in patient place at the time for substance abuse in the area had an 8 week waiting list... and you had to pay your way so unless you had a family&#x2F;friend with extra resources you were on your own.<p>We wonder why the drug problem still exists in this country where we punish those struggling instead of help them.')
