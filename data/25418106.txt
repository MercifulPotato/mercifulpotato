That’s why you think it’s worse than Facebook.<p>A Star or Galaxy can’t delete your planet. Not like Facebook can. You are a true “land owner” on urbit.<p>There’s a lot of people that got unpersoned by Facebook and others today and the damage is done. Government regulation doesn’t undo that damage.<p>Planets will likely not increase in price, nor do they want them to. If any money is to be made, it’s through the sale of Stars. But even then, they seem pretty consistently priced, not fluctuating much.<p>Fair enough point about the French Revolution. Did you get that take from reading Yarvin? :P<p>Personally, I am on the fence about true decentralization. I support projects for these networks, but I also have in my mind that anarchy may not be desirable at all. But we just need to see different ideas and different projects play out and explore, in my opinion.')
