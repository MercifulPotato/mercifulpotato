I.e. it will overproduce in anticipation, but then your blood sugar drops into oblivion, because well, you didn&#x27;t actually eat sugar. Is this bad?

I can tell you my body is very sensitive and artificial sweeteners (I literally tried all different kinds) make hell break lose in it, much worse than sugar could ever be. So perhaps they aren&#x27;t such a great replacement after all? This usually applies to everything humans try to lazily swap out in foods. Oh so I am vegan?
