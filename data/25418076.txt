If the product seller pays then it&#x27;s an advert. If the product buyer pays it&#x27;s not. The difference in economic incentives is... stark.<p>Ad supported media has a similarly skewed structure. If I&#x27;m paying for media I better like it. If adverts pay for it, the key is lots of people spend lots of time looking at it.')
