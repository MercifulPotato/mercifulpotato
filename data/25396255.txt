After 1865, the Federal government consolidated power, and more so after the 1940s [2].  It&#x27;s just that in the US, most calls for more decentralization (aka &quot;states rights&quot;) were considered a &quot;dog whistle&quot; for pro-slavery sentiment (or at the least, pro-racist thoughts).  I think it&#x27;s crazy that the US President has the power that he has (and have felt that way for the past few Presidents) and that Congress have shirked their &quot;checks and balances&quot; [3]---it&#x27;s just been the most blatant for the last two Presidents.<p>It&#x27;s funny you mention the school systems.  They aren&#x27;t centralized in the US.  Heck, they aren&#x27;t even necessarily centralized by the states!  In the areas I&#x27;ve attended school, it&#x27;s been by county.  And even the one I graduated high school under was administratively treated as three separate school systems (because even at the county level, it was pretty large).  It&#x27;s one of the few areas left that haven&#x27;t been completely taken over by the Federal government.<p>Yes, English is widely spoken in the US, but there are areas where it&#x27;s a distant second.  It may surprise you to learn that the US has no official language.  I live in South Florida and it&#x27;s not rare to encounter areas were on Spanish is spoken.  There&#x27;s an older dialect of German still spoken in parts of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana.  And there are areas on the West Coast where Vietnamese, Japanese and Mandarin (I think it&#x27;s Mandarin is the most widely spoken Chinese language) are spoken.<p>I am surprised at the 20% (I found figures saying it was as high as %24) in Switzerland, but I would still contend that the US is still diverse.  There are cultural differences between New England, the South, Texas, the Midwest, the Southwest and the West Coast that are probably just as deep as the French&#x2F;German divide in Switzerland.<p>[1] Just prior the the US Civil war.<p>[2] Just after the Great Depression and World War II.<p>[3] And for all my voting life time, Congress has had lower polling numbers than any President, yet we keep electing the same yo-yos to office (&quot;Congresscritter X is an idiot, but X is <i>my</i> idiot!&quot;).')
