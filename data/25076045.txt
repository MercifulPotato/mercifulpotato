Item(by='tirz', descendants=None, kids=[25082856], score=None, time=1605220002, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25074053, text='I used it for a long time (and 2 years as my main search engine) for 3 reasons...\n - it is french\n - it is working in Europa&#x2F;USA&#x2F;China (I studied in Paris&#x2F;San Francisco&#x2F;Tianjin)\n - my best friend used to works their.\nWe had some good talks about Qwant, but it will not be relevant for my user review.<p>So here we are:<p>1. They are not Open-Source (as opposite to Searx).<p>Only the plugins are.\nCan we trust them when they say to respect our privacy ?<p>2. They are not TOR friendly.<p>Full of captchaS !!!<p>3. They have no onion site.<p>DDG have one.<p>4. They run some kind of weird analytics.<p>Each time we click on a search, the JS code trigger a fetch to `<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.qwant.com&#x2F;api&#x2F;action&#x2F;url" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.qwant.com&#x2F;api&#x2F;action&#x2F;url</a>` and include:\n - our current language\n - the query we searched\n - the link we clicked\n - etc...\nThey were backed by Bing before, is it still the case or are they running their own stats engine? I do not know.\nIf we trigger ourself some false fetches, can we show &quot;twitter&quot; as first result when someone searches for &quot;facebook&quot;?<p>5. Their lite version is not lite (=&#x2F;= duckduckgo.com&#x2F;html&#x2F;).<p>They redirect all our clicks to be able to run their analytics without the JS&#x27;s fetch API (proof: `<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lite.qwant.com&#x2F;?l=fr&amp;q=hacker+news&amp;t=web" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lite.qwant.com&#x2F;?l=fr&amp;q=hacker+news&amp;t=web</a>` the first link does not offer `<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com</a>` but `<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lite.qwant.com&#x2F;redirect&#x2F;yFOdE8r1P1LTSLsA9IIBNKaZmDF1YXtAXz3SH6wFIVw%3D&#x2F;https%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com%2F?position=10&amp;query=hacker%20news&amp;t=web&amp;l=fr" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lite.qwant.com&#x2F;redirect&#x2F;yFOdE8r1P1LTSLsA9IIBNKaZmDF1...</a>`).\nPossible attack with `<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lite.qwant.com&#x2F;redirect&#x2F;yFOdE8r1P1LTSLsA9IIBNKaZmDF1YXtAXz3SH6wFIVw%3D&#x2F;https%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com%2F?position=10&amp;query=GOOGLE%20news&amp;t=web&amp;l=fr" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lite.qwant.com&#x2F;redirect&#x2F;yFOdE8r1P1LTSLsA9IIBNKaZmDF1...</a>` (see the fake &quot;&amp;query&quot;) ?\nAlso, They cannot store the config: go to settings, do whatever you want, do your search, switch tab (go to &quot;news&quot; for example) =&gt; your settings are reset to default. You may fix it by adding your settings to the link &quot;&amp;l=fr...&quot;.<p>6. Their front-side is broken.<p>If we visit their site without user-agent, we have an exception in their JS which crash the page (blank page).\nAnd their is more.<p>7. They do not care.<p>I emailed them maybe 5-6 bugs, they never replied nether fixed them.<p>8. Their API is sometime weird (just because not documented ?).<p>I ran a custom front-end without Qwant&#x27;s analytics and the minimum working request is: `<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.qwant.com&#x2F;api&#x2F;search&#x2F;web?q=hackernews&amp;count=10&amp;offset=0&amp;uiv=4&amp;t=" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.qwant.com&#x2F;api&#x2F;search&#x2F;web?q=hackernews&amp;count=10&amp;o...</a>`. What is &quot;&amp;uiv=4&quot;? Why can&#x27;t it be null or 0? What is &quot;&amp;t=&quot;? Is it really needed? Why is it not needed everywhere? =&gt; `<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.qwant.com&#x2F;api&#x2F;suggest?q=duckduck" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.qwant.com&#x2F;api&#x2F;suggest?q=duckduck</a>`.<p>In sum up, in a customer point of view, Qwant is just a frenchy Google hosted mainly in Europa and allowed in China. Nothing new here, I recommend to stick to DDG for the moment.<p>Edit: fix minor typo + add proof for QwantLite analytics')
