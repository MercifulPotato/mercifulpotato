Democratic priorities are (a) <i>Forcing</i> everyone into a government-run health care plan whether they want it or not, because allowing private health care plans is classist and therefore racist. (b) Making all illegal immigrants immediately legal, with all the free stuff that implies, to the detriment of would-be and actual legal immigrants; because to do otherwise would be racist. (c) Eliminating government spending on coal and oil and (for some fucked up reason) nuclear, where increases in spending on &quot;green&quot; (much less green than nuclear of course) energy are just a shiny byproduct; because something something all white people are racist.<p>So no, <i>messaging</i> is not the problem, and by making that unsupported claim you&#x27;re just perpetuating the actually classist and actually racist argument that Trump voters are stupid.')
