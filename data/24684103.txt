Item(by='sriku', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601866133, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24683137, text='&quot;calliagnosia&quot; or &quot;the inability to perceive prettiness&quot;. Ted Chiang&#x27;s works are mind-blowing and I recommend this. It is a great piece on giving different perspectives on this issue from different parties&#x27; perspectives .. like journalism embedded in sci-fi.<p>As for the article itself, I find myself gravitating towards not trusting Google&#x27;s (or such org&#x27;s) motives in this. After all, if such a touchup feature were activated by default, it would skew Google&#x27;s face dataset away from real faces and embed a notion of &quot;Calli&quot; in their face models.')
