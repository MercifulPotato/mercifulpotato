Prepare same amount of crapload of wallets for bitcoin as well. Split this new wallet into those bitcoins wallets. Use them to exchange to monero on your most convenient exchanges - preferably outside US so coindesk&#x2F;Coinbase is out of question here. Use monero mules to mix them with other cryptocurrencies - this is the point where you lose your FBI&#x2F;NSA tail. Get them out on crapload of hard currency bank around the world. By the time somebody will finish tracking to a single person a century would&#x27;ve passed and you&#x27;re dead. End of game.')
