I did not feel like I knew my teammates better after the experience, and \n2. it wasn&#x27;t that fun<p>The most fun I had was actually playing Among Us with the team. But even that game has a couple of issues that makes it no 100% suited for team building.<p>My guess is you&#x27;ll probably have to continue experimenting with games. I&#x27;m not sure if all in-person games will translate well to zoom, but some will do better than others. You def want people to be engaged, work together and change teams often.<p>It&#x27;s also always great to hear that your games are helping someone â€“ e.g. actors that are out of work.<p>Good luck! I&#x27;ll be keeping an eye on your website and I&#x27;m already thinking of recommending it as an option for the next time we do a team building activity.')
