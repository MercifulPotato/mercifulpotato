There is no single magic reason the M1 is so good, just a lot of things coming together. They start with a better instruction set than x86, have of course the best process available, and perhaps the largest part, they have built up an increadible team over a decade. And they are extremely focussed in what they target.  If anything, that is Apples &quot;magic&quot;. They are not making a chip which is built in an abstract manner to be sold to random customers. They have exactly their needs in mind and execute towards those. \nIn a sense AMD did that with the chips for the Playstation&#x2F;XBox. Like the M1 it is basically a SOC. There optimized for great graphics performance. Unfortunately, those chips are not sold separately for building your own PC.')
