Harder to read because there are less sub-characters due to there being less lines. Judging from what you wrote, you probably understand my point just adding it just in case.<p>Yeah, I&#x27;ve been gone a long time and I&#x27;ve been assimilated i.e. I don&#x27;t read and write often anymore so you&#x27;re probably right.<p>&gt; or characters are so frequently used that you will have to memorize anyway<p>This is why I feel it makes it harder, especially for less common words. It&#x27;s just more unnecessary work.')
