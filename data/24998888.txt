It is overall a property tax <i>increase</i>, not a decrease, and was promoted as a revenue <i>source</i>.<p>Also, he misrepresents the opposition to Prop 21 as opposition to rent control, even though the argument against Prop 21 included (and this was Gov. newsome’s position) that the new local rent control powers it created were unnecessary because the state had just adopted <i>statewide</i> rent control and the i itiaitve undermined the statewide policy.<p>&gt; The election seems to be heading to a never-Trumper Republican&#x27;s dream: Biden wins by about 1 electoral vote. Trump rides into the sunset. (Starts a new show on Fox?) The Senate stays Republican<p>Never-Trumper Republicans have mostly been arguing that in this election, Democrats should be preferred for federal office generally, not advocating ticket-splitting, so I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true.')
