In happier cases this is provided by parents and close family friends; teachers come and go and the family might move, but the parents provide emotional stability in the child&#x27;s life. In less happy circumstances the issue is that some teachers and some foster parents might be <i>great</i> at what they do, but they only exist inside the child&#x27;s life for a very short period of time.<p>Again, I am far from an expert here.')
