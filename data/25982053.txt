Take a look at table 2 and chart 1 of this report from the social security administration[1] for some examples of rates in different states.<p>&gt;In 2018, one-quarter of state and local government employees—approximately 6.5 million workers—were not covered by Social Security on their current job<p>I find this offensive because one of the main functions of SS is to subsidize the retirement of low earners at the expense of higher earners. As a private citizen, I don&#x27;t get to opt out of this social obligation just because my 401k gets a better return.<p>Not only that, but as a tax payer, I will be on the hook for bailing out the public employee pension funds when they go belly up.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ssa.gov&#x2F;policy&#x2F;docs&#x2F;ssb&#x2F;v80n3&#x2F;v80n3p1.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ssa.gov&#x2F;policy&#x2F;docs&#x2F;ssb&#x2F;v80n3&#x2F;v80n3p1.html</a>')
