It&#x27;s all SCSI or SAS. Secondary markets like Ebay have made this surprisingly affordable (used drive, unopened older media).<p>LTO is nice in that they mandate backwards compatibility by two revisions, which come out once every 3 years or so. So that gives you time to roll forward to new media onto a new drive without breaking the bank, and giving time for the secondary market to settle.<p>Adding: This was a deliberate decision by the LTO Consortium; they wanted users to perceive LTO as the safest option for data retention standards.')
