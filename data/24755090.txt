I like it better how it can be done at e.g. reddit: make other groups able to link to the content&#x2F;discussion and show this link to the reader of the original content. Then the reader gets to notice that the topic is controversial and discussed in other places and can make up their own idea based on different views. It shouldn&#x27;t be difficult to convince a naive reader of conspiracy theories.<p>This has many advantages:<p>1. It does not force groups into underground forums<p>2. It raises visibility to everyone that there are people with strange ideas and how many of them there are (which I personally think is a problem if it grows too big)<p>3. It removes the potential argument of such a group that they are suppressed or that online content is moderated by people that &quot;try to hide the truth&quot;<p>4. It removes the ability to easily censor valid criticism&#x2F;movements (Hongkong?) because the censorship infrastructure is already in place<p>5. It leaves some really strange and sometimes funny content that I can dive into if I get really bored, such as believers in flat earth. It can be good entertainment<p>I believe that if such content really has to be banned, we have already lost the war')
