I personally found it hard to read as something he believed was real, ... assuming he actually had those conversations at all.<p>One of these discussions goes something like this:<p>Crook: Sorry dread pirate, I don&#x27;t want to extort you but a big bad nasty dealer is demanding money from me.<p>DPR:  Put him on, let me see if I can work it out.<p>Crook-wearing-nose-and-glasses: This big bad dealer.<p>DPR: Okay why don&#x27;t I pay you what the &#x27;other guy&#x27; was demanding, and you make him go away forever.<p>Crook-wearing-nose-and-glasses: Can do.<p>I can&#x27;t be the only person that read that as a subtext of &quot;I know I&#x27;m just talking to you, but I want to make it clear that you&#x27;re not going to get to try this stunt multiple times&quot;-- arguably an assault.  But I would just assume that getting death threats is just a cost of doing business as an extortionist.<p>Of course, there is no allegation that anyone actually died at all.<p>Keep in mind that much of this evidence was collected by a couple of phenomenally corrupt officers who compromised the silkroad systems and robbed it blind (some of whom have now been convicted but it appears there may have been an additional one who wasn&#x27;t caught).  Ulbrecht&#x27;s defence was denied access to large amounts of potentially exculpatory evidence because the prosecution completely concealed the corrupt officers from the case.<p>It is absolutely a miscarriage of justice to hold the murder for hire allegations against him when the prosecution dare not have charged any of it because doing so would have forced them to expose that the chain of custody of their evidence went through extremely corrupt LE who had a tens of millions of dollar incentive to keep all the attention on someone else while they lined their pockets.<p>But I&#x27;m just some internet hothead.<p>Here is what the National Lawyers Guild said:<p>&gt; “The sentence was based on judicial findings related to allegations of serious crimes that not only were never found by a jury but were not even among the charges leveled at trial.”<p>Because of this I think we can never know the truth, but it a basic bedrock principle of our legal system that when the prosecution is corrupt and engages in misconduct such that we can&#x27;t be sure of the truth,  we&#x27;d rather let a guilty person walk than wrongfully convict or reward unethical and inequitable conduct by the state.')
