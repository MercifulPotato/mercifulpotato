Police oversight will always be a totally unbalanced fight for power. Police obviously do not want their behavior analyzed because of the obvious and frequent abuse of that power. For some reason, lots of america believes that being a police officer should come with total unchecked power amongst their communities - even so much as scrutinizing their use of excessive force has become a politicized nightmare.<p>So no, it is in no way surprising that police oversight is garbage and continues to give police easy outs.')
