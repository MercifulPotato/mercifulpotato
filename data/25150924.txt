And I just noticed that a direct search for one of my apps, Cursorcerer, is now ranked #2 behind an  entry for it on MacUpdate. A little frustrating. I guess I could redesign for mobile, but I would really rather not. Over 90% of my traffic is from desktops for a reason. Whatever happened to getting &quot;the full Internet, not a mobile Internet&quot; on your phone?')
