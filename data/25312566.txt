I think we need more people like you. Disagreements about issues and these things happen all the time. My fear was founded in the fact that people perceive me as either 1) Faking as a non-white person (see some accusations here) 2) On top of that, accusing me of being racist. The truth cannot be more further from that. 3) Downvoting because its a difficult conversation. 4) Perhaps tracking me down and finding my identitity and may be someone crazy can go nuts and cause harm to my persons or my career.')
