We’re working with local officials to determine when sites can open based on local vaccine availability.&quot;<p>I wonder how accurate the data will be compared to a &quot;patient-side researched&quot; site like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vaccinateca.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vaccinateca.com&#x2F;</a>')
