They will be creating all possible configurations and you are going to have to pay whatever premium Apple thinks they are able to impose on you which, extrapolating from the past, is going to be hefty.<p>But,<p>I think M1 is amazing piece of technology and would switch in no time if not for other reasons.<p>I also think competition is going to take a hint and we can expect more of this in the future.')
