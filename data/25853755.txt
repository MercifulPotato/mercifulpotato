Or would Apple share documentation and expertise, under the logic that Windows support will increase Mac hardware sales, if only a small amount?<p>I realize that Marcan isn&#x27;t Microsoft—but he&#x27;s not quite &quot;a random guy with a Patreon&quot; either. He&#x27;s a professional freelancer, and I&#x27;m sure he has an LLC† and a set of professional references he can point to.<p>Put another way—on a scale between &quot;Marcan&quot; and &quot;Microsoft&quot;, where is the threshold in which Apple would be helpful? I don&#x27;t personally see a huge difference between a one-person LLC and a 100,000-person company in this regard. If anything, the 100,000 person company offers more opportunities for things to get leaked.<p>---<p>† Or something similar.')
