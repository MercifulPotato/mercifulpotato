Joe Biden would be a center-right politician in most western democracies, despite being considered the &quot;left wing&quot; candidate in the United States.<p>Republicans need to take fewer steps to the center to build a winning coalition. For example, there&#x27;s a real chance Trump could have won with a 2nd round of COVID stimulus checks, but he was ultimately talked out such measures by conservative economic advisors (despite majority of his own supporters wanted a more robust stimulus plan for COVID) So it would have been a win-win. Unfortunately, by capitulating to a specific niche in his party it cost him popular support and ultimately the election.<p>The sad truth is, if Trump listened to his own supporters and actually <i>governed</i> as a populist he would have easily won reelection and this whole mess would have been avoided. But instead, he merely <i>communicated</i> like a populist but chose to govern more like a crummy Jeb Bush. If you look at the bills passed by the 115th congress[1] nothing looks particularly populist or even &quot;Trumpian&quot;. Branding vs execution.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;115th_United_States_Congress#Enacted" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;115th_United_States_Congress#E...</a>')
