In my view he should return to this job and stop listening to the Melinda Gates and Lorraine Jobs of the world encouraging him to work on saving the universe when Windows has been going downhill ever since he left.<p>If Bill were to start with a Windows XP sp3 base, here are a bakers dozen of  tasks to get him and his new software team started.  I am calling this new product Windows XP-TNG for now.  Feel free to add to this list:<p>1. WinXP-TNG should be 64 bit only, at the same level of reliability or better as Win XP 32 bit.  Support for disks larger than 2tb and main memory greater than 4gb.<p>2. USB 3 support.<p>3. Investigate if and how this 48 bit address business could be expanded to the full 64 bits.<p>4. DirectX 12 support<p>5. Directory printer option (like the best add-on utilities provide)<p>6. Print to PDF file print driver (better than the best add-on utilities provide)<p>7. Integrate the old Office 2003 into Windows XP-TNG without separate activation.  Customers that really want a newer Office would buy a Cloud version or the Windows 10 native app.<p>8. Integrate a “cleaner” utility that would remove any malware from PDF, and, if needed, epub files.<p>9. Deleted file recovery (beyond restore points).  Search entire disk and rebuild desired directory entries functionality (much better than the best add-on utilities provide).<p>10. One button setup of  “classic” Win 95&#x2F;2000 options and developer settings like View-Details.<p>11. Fix bug that causes large, say 1tb file transfers, with Copy-Paste to fail.  Drag-and-Drop works ok.<p>12. Long-term bug fixing and cybersecurity support.<p>13. Option for automatic registry backups, user can delay and specify number of backups before recycling.')
