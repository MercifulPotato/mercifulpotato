We’re a new non-profit on a mission to build a community that helps discover and develop the potential in teens. We are building a global, mobile-first platform to help notice teens and connect them with opportunities (fellowships, scholarships, etc).<p>Our product is live on iOS and Android and growing quickly. In the few months since we&#x27;ve been live, we&#x27;re already placed over 350 teens from around the world with opportunities, and have a goal to place 2000 more by the end of 2021.<p>Sal Khan, founder and CEO of Khan Academy and Bill Jackson, founder of GreatSchools, are both on our board. The Eric and Wendy Schmidt Strategic Innovation Fund is our first funder and Schmidt Futures is our first customer. Our CEO is an education executive with 30+ years of experience, our CPO is a former startup founder and product manager from Khan Academy, and our CTO sold his previous company to Google.<p>Our tech stack uses Typescript + React Native on the frontend with a light Rails backend running on App Engine. We’re still early and nothing is set in stone, so there’s lots of room to craft and improve our stack.<p>We’re looking for generalists who can dive in wherever needed, including some frontend, backend, and some light data work. At our current stage we’re light on process, so you should enjoy working with a high-level of autonomy and decision making authority. If you’re looking to use your stellar tech skills and expertise to meaningfully impact the lives of talented teens around the world, this might be the place for you!<p>Apply here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;helloworld.recruitee.com&#x2F;o&#x2F;senior-software-engineer-generalist" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;helloworld.recruitee.com&#x2F;o&#x2F;senior-software-engineer-...</a> or email me at rohan (at) gethello.org')
