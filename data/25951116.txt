Maybe there won&#x27;t be many lasting positive effects from having their stock briefly worth a lot more than it rationally should, but on the other hand you could make a reasonable case that they have been significantly harmed by short sellers, and that if a bunch of hedge funds lost their shirts because of their short positions they&#x27;ll be more careful about shorting Gamestop or any other company in the future.  Maybe that&#x27;s a good thing.')
