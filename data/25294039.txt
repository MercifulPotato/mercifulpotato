With video, every person can tell the difference between 30hz and 60hz, if they at least know what to look for.<p>The easiest way to show this is by wiggling your mouse around quickly on a computer screen.<p>At 30hz - you&#x27;ll see the mouse teleporting around - hopping from spot to spot, but not moving. For example, if you stare in the middle, and jerk the mouse quickly to the right, you&#x27;ll see the 4 or 5 spots where it rendered.<p>With 60hz, you&#x27;ll see the 9 or 10 spots - and have a stronger illusion of movement.<p>With 120hz, it might even look as smooth as a real object flying across your screen.')
