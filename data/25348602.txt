We software engineers are trained to believe that any system that supports 1 of something is obligated to generalize and support N of them. But you&#x27;d be surprised how far just one sentinel value gets you.<p>I mean, one of the key observations underpinning having nullable (and thus <i>non</i>-nullable) types is that most places in your code need <i>zero</i> of these sentinel values. Most type, around 90% the last time I tried to count, don&#x27;t permit null at all, so needing <i>two</i> distinct absent values is quite rare.')
