Managers need power meetings, lunch meetings, shoulder-taps, etc.  They are tasked with watching you and making sure everyone is on task. Non-managers don&#x27;t care about in-person other than for the socializing aspect (or maybe they want to get away from the house).<p>I think that non-management can work effectively remote most of the time (unless u need to be doing physical labor of some sort). I&#x27;m betting that studies are going to prove this out. However, it&#x27;s not clear if _management_ can effectively function remotely. Management is heavily dependent on being both seen and heard and remote platforms make this harder not easier.<p>Many companies have 2 subcultures, the workers want remote and the management wants in-person. I think the conversation needs to be around how to get the managers to work remotely in order to succeed. This is a mind shift in how traditional management is done and will be much slower to adopt.')
