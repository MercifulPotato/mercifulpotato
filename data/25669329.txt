A few years ago at work, I was involved with a compiler from a DSL loosely based on SPJ&#x27;s Composing Contracts.  The compiler is a transpiler from contract descriptions to Cuda&#x2F;OpenCL&#x2F;ISPC code that runs a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate theoretical present value of the contract.  The use case is complex derivative pricing and risk management.')
