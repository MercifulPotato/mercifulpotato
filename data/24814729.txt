According to Wikipedia, the longest extended support so far was around five years, which would get us to 2034. And people often use operating systems many years beyond their end-of-life.<p>Keeping in mind that XFS is a filesystem format, it&#x27;s not hard at all to imagine a filesystem created in CentOS 8 and&#x2F;or RHEL 8 still being in use when 2038 arrives, even if the operating system was already upgraded to the next major version.')
