There are huge grey areas.  Very well-defined signatures often overlap into a blurry mess of lines.  Even within a single element, say hydrogen, there can be different signatures for different ionization states.  Rather than clean detections there is often much opinion and debate, for years, before spectroscopy evidence is agreed as a legitimate detection of a substance.')
