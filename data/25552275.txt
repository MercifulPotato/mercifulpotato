I had been coding since early high school so aced the programming courses. The last requirement was 200 level Math dept. &quot;Algebra&quot; or 300 level ECE &#x27;Discrete Math.&#x27;  Ruined my 4.0 in the minor and to this day I still can&#x27;t fathom why such a class was a requirement (though CS was in the math dept at the time).<p>As I recall, the emphasis was primarily on graph <i>theory</i> with no applications. Maybe its nice to have for a undergrad CS major but even there I wonder what percentage will go on to actually need&#x2F;use such material? I suspect it is fairly niche.')
