One of the problems with the diagnosis of psychopathy, and ASPD in general, is that psychologists hate their patients with this diagnosis, and ironically, feel very little empathy for them. The result is that pop-psychology paints them as incurably evil.  The problem is that if you give the standard psycopathy test to a random sample of the population, about 1% of people meet the clinical diagnosis, many of whom lead perfectly normal lives! \nWhile psychopaths are heavily over represented in prison populations, most criminals are not psychopaths, and most psychopaths are not criminals.<p>Psychopaths aren&#x27;t usually terribly dangerous.  Don&#x27;t lend them money, but almost certainly they won&#x27;t kill or steal from you!  (people with borderline personality disorder, a terrible and debilitating disease, are far more dangerous to the people in their lives)<p>Psychopaths are perfectly capable of behaving morally.  They lack to a degree the emotional aspects of personal morality, but they can certainly reason morally, and thus can be productive members of society.  The idea that they don&#x27;t have emotions is an exaggeration.  They do have emotions, though these emotions can be unusual or weak, and they can suffer. We should have empathy for them, even if they may not have for us')
