Outside of work for free online courses, I&#x27;ve only ever done linear regression, both from scratch and using scikit-learn. I learned that doing what I want to do would require neural networks (deep learning, which is best done with a GPU).\nI have a few questions:<p><pre><code>   1. if I&#x27;m using prebuilt models (the app consists of determining the probability that a song is X genre) do I need a GPU? I know I&#x27;ll still need tensorflow (the lib I&#x27;ll be using).\n\n   2. What is the typical protocol for setting up AI-powered apps like this? This is the first time I&#x27;m doing this\n\n   3. If I need a good GPU, who is the best afforable host?\n</code></pre>\nThanks in advance')
