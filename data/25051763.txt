What wide expertise do you have in shechita?<p>To explain further; in shechita, the animal needs to be restrained when it is cut. Some kosher slaughterhouses did this with a &quot;shackle and hoist&quot; method. This is not a classical shechita technique, but one added for &quot;production line&quot; purposes. It scares the animal, and should be discouraged. In fact, it is banned in Israel.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jpost.com&#x2F;israel-news&#x2F;israel-instructs-kosher-slaughterhouses-to-stop-shackle-hoist-practice-492021#:~:text=The%20shackle%2Dand%2Dhoist%20method,lifting%20the%20animal%20for%20slaughter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jpost.com&#x2F;israel-news&#x2F;israel-instructs-kosher-sl...</a>.<p>Here is the excerpt you misinterpreted.<p>&quot;For over twenty years I have been actively involved in improving animal welfare during kosher slaughter. When animal welfare is being evaluated, one must carefully separate the variable of how the animal is restrained from the variable of throat cutting without stunning. These are two separate issues. My work has focused on replacing the cruel shackling and hoisting procedure with a more comfortable method of holding the animals prior to shehita. When a stressful method of restraint is used, it is impossible to evaluate the animal&#x27;s reaction to the shehita cut because the animal is kicking and bellowing from the stress of the restraint methods.<p>After I had designed and operated a better restraining device to hold the cattle in a comfortable upright position, I was amazed to observe that the animal did not appear to feel the cut. My work has focused on improving the methods used to hold the animals. I have never attacked shehita. In fact many of my articles support shehita.<p>Over the years I have worked with many wonderful shochets and rabbis. I totally respect these very sincere people. Rabbi Abe Rine had been a great supporter of my work and when he died it was a great loss to animal welfare and religious slaughter. I have worked with many shochets who were grateful to have the new systems. Eliminating shackling and hoisting of conscious live cattle improves both animal welfare and personal safety for the rabbis and shochets.&quot;')
