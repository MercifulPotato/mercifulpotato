A black box with sharp edges has much more contrast than all the legit elements in the image and becomes visually dominant whereas typically you want to attract attention to something else on the page.<p>For a similar reason, designers use &quot;lorem ipsum&quot; placeholder text rather than all-white or all-black placeholders when mocking up a layout')
