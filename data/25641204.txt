But that was in 2013. Presume it&#x27;s being passed bat to bat every few days for 6 years, then at some point made the jump to another species, most likely in a wet market. It&#x27;s really not unreasonable to imagine a 4% drift in that time.<p>Second, we don&#x27;t identify every virus or every strain of every virus. Just because we found one that was 96% similar doesn&#x27;t mean that all the other bats carry an identical virus. It&#x27;s quite likely we found a distant cousin of the umpteenth-grand-parent of covid-19, and sequenced it.')
