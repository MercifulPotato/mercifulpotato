I&#x27;m in Sweden, maybe things are different.<p>I have never worked with a PM who hasn&#x27;t understood the concept of technical debt though. It sounds like a bad career move to work with such a person. Ignoring technical debt until development slows down to a crawl is a good idea? I don&#x27;t buy it. My advice would be to either try to fix the issue (both the PM and the technical debt) immediately or find a new job.')
