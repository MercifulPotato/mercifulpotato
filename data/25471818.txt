Normally RNA is quickly broken down by RNase, but apparently RNA viruses have a mechanism to defend against this, that it&#x27;s possible to imagine having an interaction with an RNA vaccine.<p>I don&#x27;t know anything about biochemistry, and I&#x27;m aware that the above is just remote speculation. It is meant as an example of food for thought. But I do wonder when a whole field of scientists state &quot;there is no possibility of unexpected long-term side effects&quot; to a therapeutic tool that has never been used at anything resembling this scale.<p>Would love to hear more experts discuss why this is considered sufficiently long-term safe to make the decision of vaccinating a billion people after nine months of testing. Am I missing something, or is it just a question of the precautionary principle in this case being considered too costly?')
