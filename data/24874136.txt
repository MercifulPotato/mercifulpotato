It&#x27;s called a conspiracy theory for a reason - there&#x27;s conspiring going on. The CEO of the Ritz knows that his hotels offer underage prostitutes. The personal concierge directs the CEO to club which is known to be &quot;good for rich people.&quot; The club owner knows that the company they outsource to for renting table dancers on the weekends also has dancers doing some prostituting on the side. The other rich attendees of the club (who are not purchasing) can see that that girl is clearly not 21. There&#x27;s more than just pedophilia going on here - a system of winks and nods whereby powerful people are offered the opportunity to engage in illegal behavior and make no moves against the powerful people who facilitate these opportunities.<p>The second thing is that you&#x27;re missing the point around alignment. These people DON&#x27;T align themselves with each other. They frequent the same forums as each other (e.g. 8chan) and <i>disagree with each other</i> on those forums. It&#x27;s only in the eyes of the media and in people influenced by the media that the various flavors of conspiracy people are actually aligned.<p>Edit: was thinking about this line.<p>&gt; If you had a genuine interest in an issue that you wanted to raise in public awareness or do something to combat it, the route of the conspiracy theorist is an awfully dumb way to do it.<p>What is the right way to address e.g. the widespread availability of illegal prostitution in hotels owned by American companies in foreign countries? I saw a few news articles in the press exploring the phenomenon a few years back, but nothing changed. Am I supposed to found a non-profit? A newspaper? Do the investigation myself and publish it to LiveLeak? Write a letter to my congresswoman? I&#x27;m honestly not sure how to work that problem, other than just talking to other people about it.')
