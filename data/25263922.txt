We just want a place where people can come and give us feedback on our product, potentially in private so other teams can&#x27;t see what they&#x27;re saying. People often expose things they&#x27;re working on or at the very least their way of working to us and that&#x27;s not something they necessarily want open to the public.<p>Slack is free which is really appealing. But it is a barrier for some people because they don&#x27;t want to open another slack workspace (slack fatigue).<p>We also integrate to Discord and like that a lot so that&#x27;s one option for us for sure.')
