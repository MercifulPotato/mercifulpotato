Then you could just build a small helper script that 1. greps for a tag 2. loops over the found commits 3. rewinds them or whatever and 4. squashes the resulting commits.<p>Dunno, there&#x27;s a bunch of other ways depending on how exactly you want it. But I agree that grouping commits would be pretty cool :D')
