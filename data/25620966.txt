Item(by='andreareina', descendants=None, kids=[25621181], score=None, time=1609670276, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25620703, text='I as a consumer am free to choose alternative devices, and I have. A <i>vendor</i> is constrained to go where the money is, and on mobile devices, Apple serves as the sole gatekeeper to a lot of money. And the vendors pay a usurious 30% cut to Apple <i>because there is no alternative</i>. And high prices like that are <i>absolutely</i> indicative of a monopoly. Do you think Hey would still be in the app store if Basecamp didn&#x27;t raise a huge stink and Apple didn&#x27;t have a pending antitrust hearing? For a monetization strategy that&#x27;s identical to Netflix? If alternative processors were allowed for in-app purchases is 30% really the natural commission they would all charge? If it were allowed to say, &quot;hey, if you subscribe through the website it&#x27;ll be 25% cheaper because we don&#x27;t have to pay the App Store commission&quot;, how many people do you think would take the cheaper option?<p>We can argue about technical definitions of what constitutes monopoly until the cows come home. But look at the behavior of vendors and the knock-on detrimental effects on consumers (high prices, lack of choice): these are the effects of monopoly, and the harms that that antitrust legislation is meant to prevent.<p>Stripe is successful without being a monopoly. Nokia phones had the market share to be called a monopoly, but they didn&#x27;t wield monopoly power. Shimano is absolutely dominant in bicycle drivetrains, but if they tried anything from the monopolist&#x27;s playbook bicycle vendors would laugh at them and SRAM would eat their lunch.')
