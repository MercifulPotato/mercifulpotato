Well, guess what, there are breaking changes and I can&#x27;t easily upgrade.<p>You expect wrong, I&#x27;m point out how hilarious your complaint is.<p>That hard to implement features are in beta (And pre-beta!) for a long time so that we can actually contribute to their development cycle with feedback and bugs, instead of Unity getting them almost done then throwing them over the fence...<p>It&#x27;s insane to me someone would try and spin this as a bad thing with a straight face, and in fact it makes me question if I&#x27;m talking with someone who just has never dealt with the stuff behind the scenes here (like actually having to implement features of this scope)<p>Every single feature you just mentioned was Unity reaching deep into the bowels of their engine and reimagining something. DOTS is literally a reimagining the core concept of how entities exist in Unity! Literally a core tenant of the engine.<p>You&#x27;re complaining features like that are developed in the open? You realize the gnashing of teeth that probably forces them to go through to allow it? Are you joking?<p>-<p>&gt;  If I strictly follow your advice I would have to virtually stick with features from 2015. Thanks, but no thanks.<p>No, you&#x27;ll get to use plenty of features, it&#x27;s just you won&#x27;t get to use the unfinished ones unless you&#x27;re ready to deal with the fact... they&#x27;re unfinished...<p>Unity doesn&#x27;t make that confusing to know either, they literally won&#x27;t even show you a preview package by default!<p>Hard stuff takes time, when development happens in the open you get to see that. Unity has plenty of features people are using to ship games that aren&#x27;t in preview lol, imagine acting like Unity&#x27;s preview system is a bad thing<p>-<p>&gt; So, you&#x27;re saying that there aren&#x27;t many breaking changes and updating is easy, but at the same time saying that people shouldn&#x27;t even think about updating an engine mid-project because it&#x27;s reckless?<p>Lol that&#x27;s a uh... creative straw man, I&#x27;ll give you that much<p>Literally the words you quoted spell it out, breaking changes happen <i>during major revisions</i> and that <i>major revisions are not a frequent event or easy to track</i>.<p>They used to happen twice a decade. But that also meant it was very awkward for them to ship big things.<p>Now they happen once a year <i>but to avoid forcing you to track breaking changes once a year</i> they switched to the LTS model<p>So now you have <i>3 whole years</i> to deal with breaking changes.<p>Can&#x27;t deal with that, it&#x27;s kind of on you.')
