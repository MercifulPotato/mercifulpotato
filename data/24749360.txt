But encoding&#x2F;decoding protocol headers (e.g., a VP8 header [1], which has a 19-bit “size” field) or interop with other systems where you’d like some checking a la serde, bitfield! seems more verbose than “fine, I’ll do it myself right here against the u8”.<p>That is, even if that nginx example had a two-bit field in there, I’d take everything at the end and round up to a u8. Then read&#x2F;write some of these “by hand”, rather than pollute the struct with lots and lots of macro “noise”.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc6386#section-9.1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc6386#section-9.1</a>')
