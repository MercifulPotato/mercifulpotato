Cost me $574.39 delivered and gives reliable and excellent quality output for about $41&#x2F;year so far in capex. 3rd party toner cartridges run around $110 for all 4 (they&#x27;re about half the fill of the genuine HP article for about 1&#x2F;8th the price).<p>In home use, I&#x27;ve replaced the cartridges twice, so I&#x27;m around $800 plus paper for 14 years of convenient printing at home.')
