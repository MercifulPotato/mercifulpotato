You can write imperative code in those languages easily enough.<p>I would like to know more about this. I&#x27;ve written several games in Elm, a js counterpart to Haskell, and I guess foolishly assumed that meant I was writing them in the functional style. Now I&#x27;m curious if I&#x27;m actually writing in an iterative style and if so what would the functional style look like? I would welcome general responses to this as well as any comments on the code style specifically in examples like [0].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tristanpendergrass&#x2F;legendary-barnacle&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;Main.elm#L241-L279" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tristanpendergrass&#x2F;legendary-barnacle&#x2F;blo...</a>')
