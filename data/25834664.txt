So I understand if you don&#x27;t want to take your chances to bet against crypto.<p>Yet, shorting Bitcoin is not the only way to put &quot;skin in the game&quot;, and you should know that.<p>- There are a dozen different projects popping up every week that are genuinely focused on solving the issues that armchair specialists love to criticize, you could work on them.<p>- There are many crypto projects that have a more hybrid approach to have consensus and are more inclined to work <i>with</i> and not <i>against</i> the status quo (e.g, Stellar) - instead of just spewing the tired &quot;crypto is for suckers&quot; speech, how about finding a project that you think is deemed more worthy of respect.<p>- There are <i>lots</i> of people that need some way to store and transfer value without relying on local governments or financial systems.
