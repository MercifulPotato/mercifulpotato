This didn&#x27;t seem a secret, but many of my colleague students explicitly waved off such concerns. They &quot;didn&#x27;t care about money&quot;. So I chose computer science and many of them went with anthropology and whatnot. The results were predictable and it was indeed their own fault to not care. Now that there&#x27;s talk of cancelling student debt, it infuriates me that they might get off paying the justly earned debt doing fun things in college while I was coding memory management, and pulling my hair out, into the night.')
