I was on a product team. The work was depressingly unfulfilling. I&#x27;m pretty sure I wrote less than 1k lines of code while working there. There&#x27;s so much cruft - tests that break randomly, routine tasks not strictly related to software engineering, meetings, ticket investigations... If you find yourself in this kind of environment and seek excellence, I&#x27;d recommend switching.<p>Since then my preference definitely shifted towards smaller companies so I can get more experience working on greenfield projects.')
