Other than the black hair thing.<p>Here&#x27;s a list of bizarre things that my school in Belgium was intolerant about back when I was in school. These are just the ones that come to mind right now, there were many others.<p>1. No short hair for girls. No bald boys. No dyed hair.<p>2. No piercings for boys, and only pierced ears for girls<p>3. No hats. No shorts.<p>4. No long skirts for girls. No short skirts for girls. Only between knee and calf length or some such bizarre nonsense.<p>5. No skirts for boys (I tried a kilt once, was not appreciated).<p>6. No rings for boys. Not &quot;too many&quot; rings for girls.<p>7. No sitting in boys&#x27; laps. Except when you&#x27;re a girl sitting in another girl&#x27;s lap, that was apparently fine.<p>8. No tops with straps thinner than a finger (for girls, I guess).<p>The problematic gendering aside, all of those rules always seemed bizarre and stupidly specific to me. Did a pierced bald boy with a ring once torch a school? Do teachers have some kind of phobia for specific hairdos? I get that it&#x27;s a conformity thing, but conformity never struck me as being useful.')
