Rather than be overtly oppressive, the UK has long used a very subtle form of government which coerces people into behaving &#x27;correctly&#x27; either financially [fines &#x2F; penalties &#x2F; increased taxes on &#x27;not approved things&#x27;] or prohibitively [licenses, permits, etc for all manner of trivial things].<p>They would never dream of making Covid testing or vaccination compulsory, as they know that would lead to mass disobediences. So, instead, I predict it will be done in the traditional underhand manner; <i></i>&quot;Vaccination and testing are completely optional&quot;<i></i> but, it&#x27;ll become increasingly difficult to access a lot of services and live a normal life, without first flashing your &quot;I&#x27;m clean&quot; pass.<p>I can see it becoming a requirement before using public transport, booking travel tickets, entering certain public buildings, going to sports events, concerts, gigs etc. etc. [There was already a story a week or two ago [since denied] that Ticketmaster --a major event ticket seller-- would be asking people to show they&#x27;d had a negative Covid test, before allowing them to buy tickets.[0]<p>Vaccination and testing may well be &#x27;completely voluntary&#x27;. But don&#x27;t expect to have much of a life, if you refuse to comply.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;americas&#x2F;ticketmaster-covid-test-events-vaccine-b1721397.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.independent.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;americas&#x2F;ticketmast...</a>')
