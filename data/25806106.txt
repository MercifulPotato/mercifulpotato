Item(by='mschuster91', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610836015, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25805035, text='&gt; The EU has been trying to fix it by imposing common signaling standards, opening access etc.<p>That&#x27;s not much of a problem any more with the advent of multi-system locomotives - you can go from the Netherlands (=Rotterdam port, central entry for Chinese-origin container ships) to Italy with a single Siemens ES64F4 VE locomotive, for example. All that&#x27;s needed is regular exchange of the operating staff.<p>The real problem rather is that European railways are built with &quot;passenger first&quot; in mind, which means that during the day freight trains get set aside and during the night capacities are limited because of (very valid, fwiw) noise complaints.<p>The US prioritizes freight trains first, and there are not many complaints of noise because the trains are in rural areas with no human (or protected animal) closer than a dozen kilometers.')
