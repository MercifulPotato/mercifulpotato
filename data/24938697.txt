I finally figured out it was probably a wildvine related issue (and if you don&#x27;t know what wildvine is, omg what a rabbit hole), and Netflix just doesn&#x27;t care to fix it because fuck linux users I guess. Fuck netflix, I guess. HBO did the same thing... Showtime still works, and I finally gave into Amazon, on which I can watch my HBO shows. I think Amazon is going to come out much better in the streaming wars than many anticipate.')
