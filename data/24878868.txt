This is the equivalent of running a marathon for me on the mental field(I have done real marathons too).<p>My lower limit is learning 40-50 new words per day. It takes 1 hour,more than a minute per word and no significant effort, I do this as daily routine with now consequences for my work.<p>Over time, learning new languages become easier and easier.<p>The world opens a lot when you can go to places like China or Japan and at least you understand what the symbols on the street or the people say. You get a much deeper knowledge about things.<p>Anki is one of the most amazing things ever invented.')
