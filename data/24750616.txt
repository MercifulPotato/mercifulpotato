I remember years ago looking on Google Maps at South Georgia and dreaming about going there one day.<p>Well I decided to make &quot;one day&quot; happen and visited there as part of a two month sailing voyage on a tall ship. We also visited Antarctica and a number of Antarctic islands. Deception Island was a highlight.   \nWe approached Tristan da Cunha but couldn&#x27;t land due to the swell, which was disappointing.<p>I still dream about visiting these remote places, but the voyage did a great job of satisfying the urge (for now).<p>The voyage was via barkeuropa.com and it was one of the best experiences of my life.')
