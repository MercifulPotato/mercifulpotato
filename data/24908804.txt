Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603815023, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24907546, text='From my skimming of that article, Axler&#x27;s main complaint with determinants is that it pedagogically leaves students with the impression that eigenvalues are somehow a property of the determinant rather than being a fundamental property of a linear transformation.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever met anyone who has that view; in my experience, more people leave linear algebra with a laundry list of matrix properties whose utility isn&#x27;t obvious, with determinants and eigenvalues both on that list. This in general is a pedagogical issue with teaching linear algebra as plug-and-chug techniques without explaining why we&#x27;re doing them.<p>Truthfully, I&#x27;m not convinced that introducing the determinant as &quot;just&quot; the product of eigenvalues is itself useful. One of the more useful properties of the determinant is that it is built up via row-reduction, and consequently, it can be computed using Gaussian elimination. I&#x27;ve seen some texts actually define the determinant via its row-reduction properties, and then build up to demonstrating the other formulas for it.<p>I&#x27;ll also point out that there are two more uses that Axler doesn&#x27;t acknowledge: the determinant tells you the volume of a parallelpiped, and it&#x27;s a convenient way to remember the formula for a cross product.')
