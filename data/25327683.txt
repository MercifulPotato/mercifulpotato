Being able to prove an algorithm works can extend into automated program checking &#x2F; auditing, etc.<p>It&#x27;s not just &quot;taste&quot; -- there&#x27;s a lot of practical theory to be applied.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mathematical_induction" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mathematical_induction</a>')
