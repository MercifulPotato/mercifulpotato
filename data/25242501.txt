These will be the same references they provide when fundraising, so it will doubly help your company succeed.<p>• Leaving 100% of the legal and 100% of press interviews to your co-founder is a very bad idea. This makes it very easy for them to throw you under the bus.<p>• If your co-founder makes seemingly illogical decisions, ensure you understand why.<p>• Don&#x27;t let your co-founder continually delay important things at your expense, even if they provide excuses. For example, not putting things in writing, not giving you equity they promised, etc.')
