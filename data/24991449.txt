If Microsoft takes the route many have argued for here (namely, reject the DMCA request as it’s invalid) and the DMCA request ends up being found valid in the courts, Microsoft loses their DMCA safe harbor protections and open themselves up to multi-million dollar lawsuits. Sure, if they’re right, then they’re in the clear, but when their business is at risk of being killed if they’re wrong, they’re going to err on the side of caution.<p>It’s easy to stand at a distance and mock those who do something we disagree with, but when you’re actually in that situation, your tune is going to change very quickly. A bad example, but if you’re getting mugged, sure, you could fight back, but your life is on the line.')
