If I were in that position I&#x27;d analyze my full history of dream analysis. What has paying lots of attention to my dreams gotten me? How has the experience changed over the years? Am I different now as a result? In what ways am I better, in what ways worse?<p>The solution to many addiction problems (which you suggest this might be) can be to simply be more context-aware. In the heat of a game, of course you want to keep playing the game. But the more you think about your entire life&#x27;s context, who you are vs. who you want to be, what you need to get done vs. what you&#x27;re getting done -- the less focus the object of addiction is able to retain.<p>(Fun related fact -- more than half of drug addictions in the US are simply &quot;outgrown&quot;, with no intervention to blame.)')
