In the US for example they tend to favor soft language more. They would call it &quot;beta&quot;, &quot;early access&quot; or &quot;personal project&quot;.<p>As an European I tend to see it more as... well, &quot;shitty&quot;.<p>And that is fine. It is in fact refreshing not to have to filter out the marketing buzzwords like &quot;innovative&quot; or &quot;minimalistic&quot;. The title immediately put me in a good disposition towards the author. It feels honest.')
