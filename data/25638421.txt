Here in Germany, there already are a few regions where some hospitals are close to capacity, and modelling suggests that without continued restictions, the health care system might get overwhelmed by March.<p><i>Ignoring this ridiculous strawman attack (if I disagree, I&#x27;m insane)</i><p>I realize this might come close to violating (or even cross the line of) HN guidelines, but that&#x27;s how I see it.')
