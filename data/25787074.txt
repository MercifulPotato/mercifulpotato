Reminds me of an attempt, I think in Windows 95? Era, of a desktop to mimic the computer at three original Jurassic Park movie. A 3D view of Windows, which you could turn and zoom to any layer, and layers were folders with files, which you could zoom into to activate. At the same time by rotating and zooming out, you could see the relationship of each folder to another, and the trees formed by these folders.\nUnfortunately, I think our computers were too slow for it work very well. \nI look forward to trying this out.\n(But can we adapt it to Windows&#x2F;Linux&#x2F;Mac to make it usable?)')
