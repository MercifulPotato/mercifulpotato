Although you&#x27;d run into this same problem with a regular style app too.<p>I&#x27;m so glad I don&#x27;t have to do serverless development full time. Just so happens I&#x27;m doing a small service for contract work but yeah, it&#x27;s like taking 100 steps backwards for development friendliness IMO.')
