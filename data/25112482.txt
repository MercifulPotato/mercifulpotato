The wikipedia article makes some of the jargon clearer, but it still doesn&#x27;t explain what is actually meant by intrusion detection, or even an example of a rule that&#x27;s more than what a firewall would enforce. It talks about statistics and machine learning being used to apply rules. I am asking what kinds of rules? Keywords in the payload? Peculiar GET requests? Connections from Kazakhstan between midnight and 4am? Wouldn&#x27;t rules like that have lots of false positives and piss off legit users?<p>In particular, I am curious about encrypted traffic (eg TLS&#x2F;https&#x2F;ssh). Wikipedia says IDS&#x27;s can&#x27;t work on encrypted traffic. &quot;...Encrypted packets are not processed by most intrusion detection devices...&quot;<p>But most traffic IS encrypted. So where do you ever have a situation where you have 100Gbps on a line, unencrypted? What&#x27;s the use-case?')
