Why do I say that? AI is not a self replicator, but we are. AI can&#x27;t bootstrap itself from cheap ordinary stuff laying around (yet), and when it will be able to self replicate it will owe that ability to us, maybe even borrow from us.<p>And secondly, you make the same mistake with those who say after automation people will have nothing to do. Incorrect, people will have discovered a million new things to do and get busy at them. Like, 90% of people used to be in agriculture and now just 2%, but we&#x27;re ok.<p>When AI becomes better than us at what we call art now, we&#x27;ll have already switched to post-AI-art, and it will be so great we won&#x27;t weep for the old days. Maybe the focus will switch from creating to finding art, from performing to appreciating and developing a taste, from consuming to participating in art. We&#x27;ll still do art.')
