I assume you tried to go cold turkey on coffee, and didn&#x27;t like it. I&#x27;d suggest the gradual method, which might work better for you.<p>Over the span of a week, normalize your coffee intake. Have just two cups of coffee a day at a regular time with known quantity of coffee.<p>Next week, reduce the amount of coffee in one cup by 1&#x2F;2. So, if you grind 30g of coffee, grind 15g.<p>The week after that, reduce the amount of coffee in the other cup to the same amount.<p>The week after that, reduce the amount of coffee in one cup by 1&#x2F;4 (or, eliminate entirely). One week after that, do the same to the other cup. Before you know it, going cold turkey gives you no symptoms.<p>You can see how this goes on. Adjust the time period and&#x2F;or the coffee reduction to whatever works for you. For me, a week and coffee reduction by 1&#x2F;4th (of the original amount) worked just fine for me.')
