There&#x27;s also a large contingent of drivers willing to become drivers under the current model. All of them seem to disagree with you on your opinion that things were fine, actually, just the way they were before Lyft&#x2F;Uber arrived.<p>I agree with the argument I think you&#x27;re implying: there&#x27;s a minimum level of protection that everyone should be afforded. Though your assumption that your employer must be the source of those protections seems unwarranted. If people deserve healthcare then surely unemployed people also deserve healthcare. If people deserve a minimum standard of living, some kind of minimum wage, then surely even the unemployed deserve that minimum standard. And once even the unemployed have these protections, what does it matter whether you&#x27;re an employee or a contractor?<p>Why not attack the problem from that direction?')
