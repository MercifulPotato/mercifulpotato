Playing instrument is something what I wanted to do for a looong time. Bought myself an electric guitar last year, and I do practice a bit, but have nothing to show for it now. It appears to be going a bit easier with a piano (I still do practice guitar). Not willing to stick to self-learning only I&#x27;ve already made an arrangement with a piano teacher, will have my lessons when the quarantine is lifted. For now SimplePiano and Flowkey will do.<p>Last year was when I got hooked on astrophotography, going very well so far (I have good skills at photography and image processing so it was way easier). Brought some satisfaction for not finishing my astrophysics PhD program.')
