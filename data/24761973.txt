Item(by='vladvasiliu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602559656, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24761230, text='I think it can be considered a one-time decision based on probability.<p>In my case, I know I don&#x27;t expect to call a ride every other day, at most once or twice a month (even less now when bars are closed – but that&#x27;s an edge situation). I know the approximate cost of a ride, typically €12, surge pricing may go up to twenty. So at the most, I expect calling a ride to cost me €20 a month.<p>That&#x27;s less than what resident parking would cost for a car for the same month (a few years ago it was €9 &#x2F; week). So the ride-sharing wins. I can think about this once and re-evaluate the situation every year. Yes, sometimes I may spend more on rides, sometimes less, but on average it&#x27;s a cheaper way of getting around. So even though every time I call the ride it&#x27;s technically a purchase decision in that I can decide not to do it and walk &#x2F; bike &#x2F; take the metro (assuming it&#x27;s still open), it could be argued that I had already decided that in this situation I would call a ride. So no decision fatigue.<p>Note that driving my own car isn&#x27;t exactly a &quot;decisionless&quot; process. I have to think where I&#x27;ll go, whether I&#x27;ll have easy surface parking (free) or whether I&#x27;ll have to <i>purchase</i> underground parking. Plus, bonus points for underground parking being paid by the hour, so now I have to make a decision every hour about whether I want to stay out (purchase more parking) or leave.<p>Also, with regard to the data plan, we don&#x27;t have those in France (that I know of). My plan has 40 GB and I&#x27;ve got it because it was cheaper than my older 15 GB plan. I know my usage never has me go above 3 to 4 GB. If an unlimited plan was available for a few more euros, that would be a net cost to me, for no practical gain in peace of mind or anything.<p>I suppose not everybody has a &quot;boring routine-based&quot; life so this approach may not work in each and every situation.')
