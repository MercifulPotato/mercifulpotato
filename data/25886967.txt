I don’t know how to design silicon or write in hardware languages. I don’t fully understand how to write drivers, even if I understand a lot of the concepts. I abhor web UI and server side business logic. I adore user interaction, optimization, and graphics programming on client devices of all kinds. My sweet spot is coding against relatively low level OS and graphics APIs in user space. I wrote C and C++ code for a decade, but these days I prefer the simplicity of C#. Hope that helps!')
