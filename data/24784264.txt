Safe to say the company was doing well.<p>Revenue is not an eng. responsibility, it&#x27;s mainly a business suite responsibility.<p>&gt; The video conferencing software sucked.<p>So he was responsible as a long-term engineer and executive for it sucking.<p>&gt; After he left, 40 of the 800 engineers he worked with immediately joined him at Zoom.<p>So he was an executive and did mass poaching from his former employer, Cisco.<p>But the real questions are:<p>1) how much of the Webex source code did he copy when he started Zoom?<p>2) the original development team was in China. To what extent is Zoom beholden to the CCP? (It&#x27;s a rhetorical question, since the CCP is a totalitarian government with communist cells in each company over 50 employees, their national security law applies globally, and the CCP coerces relatives left behind on the mainland.)')
