Do business analysts have good engineering skills? I don&#x27;t think either of them can fill the data scientist role.<p>The scientific training and mindset (scientific method, hypothesis, experiment setup, etc.) to even create an accurate model is an undervalued skill here no? Even if data cleaning is automated, these skills cannot be easily learned.<p>There is a reason why so many PhDs get into the field, because they were trained in the exploratory&#x2F;research mindset that no engineering or analytics skills can fill.
