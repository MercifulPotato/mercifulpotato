Beyond simple lists, Lisp uses a variety of list structure patterns for language constructs. It&#x27;s a bit like learning to ride a bike: initially it looks not possible to balance, steer and move forward at the same time.<p>One thing that&#x27;s not that usual is that authors can implement new language constructs themselves. Thus one may need to understand that meta-syntax level when reading and writing new constructs. A starter book like SICP thus does not use this prominent feature: it does mostly NOT define &amp; use macros.<p>Authors need to learn how to design new macro operators.')
