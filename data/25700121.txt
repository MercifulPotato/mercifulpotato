Item(by='Quekid5', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610198355, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25700047, text='Absolutely.<p>I think we in the IT community should really strive to be better at nuance when discussing these things.<p>I mean, as much as I&#x27;ve seen &quot;Haskell sucks&quot; posts, I&#x27;ve also seen quite a lot of &quot;Haskell solves all your problems!&quot; posts. That&#x27;s not how anything works in the Real World(TM) when solving concrete business problems -- whatever that business domain may be. Rather, it&#x27;s trade-offs all the way down. It does get tiresome to read these re-hashes of debates which should have been over already. (EDIT: For anyone wondering, the answer is: It depends.)<p>I think the &quot;tribes&quot; blog post mentioned in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25699983" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25699983</a> is very insightful for the meta-level of this discussion.<p>EDIT: Final edit while I can. We see this a <i>lot</i> with &quot;lol PHP&quot; style comments... and all those achieve is a sense of elitism and making people who actually get lots of important work done in PHP feel bad. I don&#x27;t want that world.')
