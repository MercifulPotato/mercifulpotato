I am at the point where I literally have to buy low-end phones just to still have a headphone jack.<p>Stuff gets lost, stuff breaks, I don&#x27;t want to pay hundreds of dollars every time a little bud goes OOPS. I don&#x27;t see any benefit of wireless headphones, I seem to have the superhuman ability to manage cables without effort.<p>My headsets never have dead batteries. Are cheap to replace, and have excellent audio quality. I guess I&#x27;m not the target audience but you&#x27;ll have to add my &quot;WTF&quot; to the chorus in regards to $500 headphones.')
