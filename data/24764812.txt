Item(by='jlgaddis', descendants=None, kids=[24764897], score=None, time=1602591256, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24764613, text='FWIW, I was quoting my grandfather.<p>I have heard the name Voltaire before but did not know who he was until I just looked it up -- and I&#x27;d wager my grandfather didn&#x27;t know who he was either.<p>Thus, there&#x27;s the issue of intent (or lack thereof). I suppose Voltaire can terminate my license if he wishes. However: a.) I have a feeling that (after being dead for 242 years) he doesn&#x27;t care and b.) I very much look forward to receiving a letter from his lawyer informing me of such.')
