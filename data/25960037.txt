I&#x27;ll admit, I don&#x27;t do a ton of criminal work, but, I&#x27;ve spent more than my fair share of time sitting through criminal dockets observing cops and criminals and I just don&#x27;t see it.  My good friend won the last significant police brutality case in my metro of 2M people and that was 5 years ago.<p>Here&#x27;s another tell.  Watch daytime TV for an hour and you&#x27;ll see attorneys advertising re: Insurance companies, J&amp;J Talc, Monsanto, Me Too, the Catholic Church, the Boy Scouts, Monsanto, Mesh manufacturers, Asbestos claims, Elmiron claims, ad infinitum.  But, you won&#x27;t see any police brutality commercials, and it&#x27;s not because us ambulance chasers are afraid of the police.  It&#x27;s because the cases are so few and far between that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to waste resources seeking them out.')
