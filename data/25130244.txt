For web search, this would encourage results that <i>look</i> right from the results page, even if they&#x27;re not actually a good result of  what the user is looking for.<p>An example of this would be when you&#x27;re trying to find an answer to a specific question like &quot;How do I do X when Y?&quot;. The best result I&#x27;d hope for is a page that answers the question (or a close enough question to be applicable), while the promising-looking-but-actually-bad result is a page where someone asks the exact same question but there are no answers.')
