It might not be ideal, but it&#x27;s not obvious to me why its any less legitimate than other arrangements.<p>Gig work is new, and doesn&#x27;t fit cleanly into the existing framework. Uber et al.&#x27;s patch for reconciling gig-work appears to many to be essentially a wholesale rejection of the spirit of the agreement, thus opening up new existential risks for those of small means.<p>While those arguments may land short of the complete truth, they do appear to hold some merit; Maybe it&#x27;s simply ignorance, but I&#x27;m not aware of Uber advocating for a comprehensive review of how California provides life-support benefits to residents in a way that ensures their service providers are not unduly at risk relative to the general population. Instead, proposition 22 appears to be as close to &#x27;I&#x27;ve transacted profitably; fuck your life, it&#x27;s not my problem.&#x27; as they could hope to achieve.')
