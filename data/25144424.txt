And it probably started with censorship of bad information that lead to the bubble in the first place.<p>&gt;work on preventative measures so people are never exposed<p>This is where the analogy breaks down, its not a virus, its an idea, anyone can come up with an idea, good or bad.  you want to protect people from themselves, you must immunize them from the bad ideas they could come up with.  We know it works, it was the only vehicle from the dark ages to the enlightenment.<p>We also have the problem that if you set up a perfect system of blocking bad ideas, the people who run it can have bad ideas of their own.  Hell the mechanism we have to even tell the difference between bad ideas and good ideas in society (open free discourse) will have been destroyed.<p>There are plenty of examples of people trying to do this around the world, tyrants and hell-holes created with the best of intentions.')
