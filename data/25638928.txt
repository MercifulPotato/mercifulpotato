Really, not a single dollar.  Most of my side projects were failed app&#x2F;business ideas.<p>So, my New Year&#x27;s resolution this year is to break the ice and make a quick $5 on the internet.  No constraints, can be anything (well, almost anything :).<p>Does anyone have any creative ways to make a few dollars online?')
