Doesn&#x27;t everything hinge on the premise that you can send information back in time? Essentially this seems to be a simplified presentation of Newcomb&#x27;s paradox [1], or perhaps some other temporal paradox.<p>The present story simply proposes a straight-forward way out of any such paradox, namely that there isn&#x27;t any free will at all, hence there&#x27;s no way to alter the future. However, since as far as we know there&#x27;s no way to send information back in time, this doesn&#x27;t actually say much about the real world or the actual existence of free will.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Newcomb%27s_paradox" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Newcomb%27s_paradox</a>')
