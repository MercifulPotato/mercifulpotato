Item(by='clolege', descendants=None, kids=[25346398], score=None, time=1607440203, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25345699, text='&gt; A $400 Sennheiser 650 will no doubt blow them away while still being $150 cheaper.<p>Of course they will. But it&#x27;s not fair to compare open backs with closed backs without a huge asterisk [0]<p>&gt; If you want the best sound quality for the buck, you usually need to go with open-backed (or simply “open”) headphones. The open (but uncomfortable) SR60 is probably the best value in the business, followed by the awesome DT-880, which is far better than everything in this review in both comfort and sound quality. But open headphones are like screen doors: they let all exterior noise in, and more importantly, they let all of your music out. This will annoy anyone around you, so it’s extremely inconsiderate to use open headphones in buses, trains, airplanes, shared offices, or anywhere else near other people, and it’s irresponsible to recommend them without this huge warning.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marco.org&#x2F;headphones-closed-portable" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marco.org&#x2F;headphones-closed-portable</a>')
