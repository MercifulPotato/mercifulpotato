The example is almost loaded to begin with, only claiming &quot;a fair coin&quot; but then going out of the way to show the opposite.<p>I would give the author the benefit of the doubt, but I would have thought a more accurate definition would be that the average outcome for many coin flips would be heads 50% of the time, given enough flips and assuming a fair coin.<p>So seeing 1,000,000 heads in a row, after 1,000,000 flips, would make me think the probability of heads the next flip is actually 100%, because this coin obviously is not fair.<p>Technically, if the coin is known to be fair, then sure...')
