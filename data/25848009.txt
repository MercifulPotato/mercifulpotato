We all know that the word &#x27;concentration camp&#x27; is used to conjure up images of Nazis killing jews en masse. But I&#x27;m arguing they&#x27;re not killing&#x2F;enslaving Uyghurs en masse. I base this on my own research and sources.<p>If you go by the more flexible definition of &#x27;large number of people in a small room&#x27; regardless of what actually happens to them: I can&#x27;t independently verify how large rooms are but I agree that people should be treated as humanely as possible.<p>But in all of this, you&#x27;ve completely neglected the fact that China has reeducation camps (<i>real</i> reeducation camps, not &quot;reeducation camps&quot;  in quotes) is because of terrorism influences from Afghanistan. If you watch the video I provided, there&#x27;s a testimony that says that the US were in Afghanistan in order to make use of Uyghur extremists to destabilize China. What is China supposed to do, do nothing and let people continue to walk around with bombs and machetes? China isn&#x27;t doing all this just for fun, terrorism is a real problem that has no good solution without collateral damage.')
