Item(by='xerox13ster', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608763418, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25518782, text='Hahahaha YouTube has 8 years of my Google Play Music listening history, as well as my entire music library I uploaded back in 2012 when Zune (later XBM&#x2F;Groove) got killed.<p>I started it on &quot;The Little Things Give You Away&quot; by Linkin Park, and let it play. For a while it was alright, it gave me chill downtempo kinda emo music selections with some like newer stuff from Linkin Park and like Green Day.<p>Normally I listen to slow&#x2F;soft shit from bands like 3 Days Grace, Breaking Ben, 3 Doors Down, My Chemical Romance, Good Charlotte and so on with my Linkin Park (especially the Minutes to Midnight album), so Green Day and Fall Out Boy aren&#x27;t bad per se even though I like my older stuff. And I do have lots of playlists with GD + LP + FOB + other random pop punk bands.<p>But then it started throwing in shit like NF, Machine Gun Kelley, Eminem, Logic, then D12, Run DMC, DMX. The Smart DJ on my decade old Zune HD does a better job at building a playlist and recommending music (with the same library).<p>Pandora, Last.fm, GPM (after 8 years it finally started to &quot;get&quot; me FUCK YOU GOOGLE), Spotify, YouTube Music, Apple Music, etc. They have all done this to me, they all inevitably end up playing some sort of rap, or move to super modern pop music. I do not understand it at all beyond &#x27;it makes them money&#x27;.<p>I do listen to rap music, and I do like listening to those groups and artists. I have quite a few playlists built with just that music, and aside from Eminem, they do not intersect with my emo&#x2F;punk&#x2F;rock playlists. If I start listening to Linkin Park, I am never going to want to go from there to early 2000s rap.<p>I. Don&#x27;t. Give. A. Rats. Ass. if every other person on the planet listens to Linkin Park with Eminem and DMX. I don&#x27;t and I tell them every time I play a song or build a playlist, or skip, or remove a recommendation what I like and don&#x27;t like.<p>Why can my deprecated Zune appreciate that and keep my genre interests separate and accurate and a billion dollar AI algo can&#x27;t?')
