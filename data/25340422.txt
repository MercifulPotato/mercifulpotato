It is similar to the Awair Element. However, as I don&#x27;t have a smart home I sometime wish I had an Awair Glow C instead (disclaimer, it does not have as many sensors). It&#x27;s a smart plug, so it can turn off the device you plug into it... I would plug my air purifier or maybe my air humidifier to it.<p>If you want to use one suche device on the go, at friends places, etc., I&#x27;d recommend the Atmotube Plus or Atmotube Pro by Atmotube (depending on your needs).<p>My purchase was a few years ago now. I&#x27;ve heard that the market is bigger now, so you may want to shop around. I also have the big Dyson purifier at home which comes with built-in sensors.')
