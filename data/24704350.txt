I realize it&#x27;s not perfect, and there are cheaper options, but I really think they gave us a cheap-enough deal, and you can always play sysadmin if it&#x27;s too much for you.<p>I&#x27;m not a big DO customer but I appreciate their pricing transparency: having worked professionally with 2&#x2F;3 of the major Cloud companies I would <i>never</i> put anything there that&#x27;s billed to my own account.')
