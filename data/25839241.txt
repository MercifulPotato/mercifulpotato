OTOH all those proprietary companies playing the &quot;commodify your complement&quot; game against each other would ensure that the quantity and quantity of OSS would continually be increasing as well, forcing those companies to continually innovate lest they lose their market to the free OSS alternatives. To repeat, hypothetically speaking, as we don&#x27;t have an alternate universe to run such experiments in.')
