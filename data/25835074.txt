Despite using A64 ISA and ARM’s cores, they are Amazon’s proprietary chips no one else has access to. Migrating elsewhere gonna be very expensive.<p>I wouldn’t be surprised if they sponsor their Graviton offering taking profits elsewhere. This might make it seem like a good deal for customers, but I don’t think it is, at least not in the long run.<p>This doesn’t mean Graviton is useless. For services running Amazon’s code as opposed to customer’s code (like these PAAS things billed per transaction) the lock-in is already in place, custom processors aren’t gonna make it any worse.')
