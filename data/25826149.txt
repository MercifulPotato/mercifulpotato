My wife and I have made a very strong effort to prevent her from eye-rubbing. She&#x27;s old enough now to understand why we were so adamant about it.<p>I&#x27;m seeing elsewhere in this thread that nocturnal eye rubbing can be a problem. I never thought about that and it&#x27;s a bit disturbing. I do remember waking-up with my eyes plastered shut with hardened mucus as a child.')
