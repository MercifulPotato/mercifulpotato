The truth is that a sliver of swing voters is switching between absolute fools and empty suits.<p>Biden is The System incarnate - he created the void that was begging for Trump and it&#x27;ll be interesting to see what happens next.<p>Instead of trying to understand how the Trump crowd is ailing and <i>respond to their requests for help and recognition no matter how distorted and seemingly vulgar&#x2F;uncivilized&#x2F;etc.</i>, we had 4 years of hysteric catastrophizing, outright conspiracy theories(like Russia-gate) and obstruction.<p>Let&#x27;s remind everyone that Hillary participated in the whole &quot;switch the electors&quot;, &quot;he&#x27;s an illegitimate president&quot; talk.')
