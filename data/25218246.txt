It&#x27;s quite incredible. You are born out of stardust, your life in its beginning is indeed free of any deeper meaning and true purpose. You are a brain fighting for survival, against the monstrous odds.</i><p>I see this argument used, but it always feels forced to me, trying to make lemonade from the lemons given. Or stardust, in this case.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessarily &quot;depressing&quot;, but neither it&#x27;s &quot;incredible&quot;. It is what it is.<p>&gt;<i>You may have certain privileges over others to help you on your way - richer family, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, etc. can all make certain doors open or shut for you - but your meaningless life, born with no purpose, is yours to shape as you see fit.</i><p>Well, in this version, you still age, decline, and die forever anyway, so one can argue there&#x27;s no much meaning into this &quot;shaping&quot;. Temporary struggle (and often hard struggle) for no great reward, just ultimate old age and death.')
