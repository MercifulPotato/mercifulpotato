Not suggesting that it would be trivial or anything, but you probably would not <i>replicate</i> the mentioned services, more likely you would use other&#x2F;different types of software packages (for example rabbitMQ for queues). It may not be the exact replica but it covers the use cases needed in your application (now no longer designed with &quot;infinitely&quot; scalable cloud).<p>While one of the benefits of things like AWS and GCP is the availability of all kinds of services, but at the same time we are to some extent loosing control. I have personally had several cases where I was thinking &quot;This thing would be so useful&quot; but AWS&#x2F;GCP&#x2F;Pick your cloud did not have it and it would have been a hassle to jam that one piece of supporting software together with the core services, so it never got taken into use.')
