In HyperCard you draw the interface as if you were using a paint program, you create simple databases &quot;living&quot; inside the stack just by placing input fields around and you create links by placing buttons that you can make links to the other cards just by visiting them. You can make presentations, e-books, simple databases like phone books, recipe books, etc without writing a single line of code. And if you want to write some code the language is very simple and &quot;readable&quot; with very simple approachable commands and a GUI that &#x27;knows&#x27; about it.')
