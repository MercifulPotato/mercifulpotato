Most copyright owners do not have Github accounts. Github is not a thing people use outside of programming.<p><i>Their thermonuclear bomb was to take down other people&#x27;s repos, ban accounts, and make random threats.</i><p>This is the proper response to the petulant behavior of techies flaunting the original takedown. The end result would simply have been the RIAA issuing <i>more</i> requests, possibly even <i>formal</i> requests, which Github would have led Github to doing the same thing it did proactively.<p>You know why did it? <i>To protect people</i> from the legal consequences of their stupidity. Lawsuits are expensive, especially when you&#x27;re in the wrong and the other side has a very large legal budget.<p><i>They can be the good guy, and fight the RIAA. They can be a neutral party, and do their duty under DMCA. But fighting the RIAAs battles for then, and then making comments like Nat&#x27;s? Sketchy and sleazy.</i><p>Being the good guy in this situation is not fighting the RIAA. It&#x27;s doing what the law requires to prevent disruption of services to their other customers, most of whom aren&#x27;t opening flaunting the law.<p>Outside of the tech world, to the extent that people care about this conflict, they&#x27;re wondering why techies are so intent on bullying non-techies just trying to protect their work. Outside of tech, people are <i>struggling</i> and many are unemployed. This is a PR battle that tech is <i>losing.</i>')
