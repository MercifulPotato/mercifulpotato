The whole game was an illusion of choice. The side quests and fights gave you some cool Deus Ex like freedom, but the main quest was an interactive movie with some meaningless options for you to engage in.<p>And given those cutscenes, and scripted parts are so plenty, I really dont see myself replaying this game with a different build.<p>Its 7&#x2F;10 for me, nothing like the Witcher.')
