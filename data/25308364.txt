It&#x27;s a common format that can be read by multiple pagers (including dedicated GUI browsers for those so inclined). They&#x27;re also available when the command might not be. There are definitely benefits over <i>command --help</i> other than the syntax of the invocation.<p>&gt; I find pagers annoying because it&#x27;s hard to switch back and forth between typing a command and the docs.<p>less -X<p>If people don&#x27;t know about <i>man</i>, why not teach them? A simple line in the summary -h gives that says: <i>For more information, read the man page: man foo</i>.<p>&gt; Plus, there&#x27;s still the cross-platform argument.<p>This just makes me sad. I don&#x27;t know exactly where we&#x27;d be if every computer system didn&#x27;t feel it needed to be garbage just because Windows is. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be quite as bad as where we are.')
