Would you use this tool, knowing the people building it would rather hide and bury their mistakes than be transparent about them?<p>Should a product be enticing on its own, or should it need to name drop companies where their team may have worked in the past (which even those companies&#x27; ethics are regularly headlines)?<p>How did you decide this was a tool that need to be made? Were you the ones operating the existing tools at your previous companies, or did you read one page of those tools&#x27; docs and decide they were too hard?<p>Who should be in control of a company&#x27;s secrets? The company, or a stranger who has done more to cause distrust in them than prove they can adapt to challenges and admit mistakes or poor decisions?')
