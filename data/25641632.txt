A few unique features: tagging collaborators in your experiences, status updates, and print optimized profiles.<p>I hope you don&#x27;t take this the wrong way, but I think your definition of legibility is maybe a bit off, the font is too small to be considered legible by any accessibility standard. I have 20&#x2F;20 vision but I struggle to read some of it. The color contrast is also failing in some cases, and since the font is so small and thin, the contrast needs to be increased above what color contrast would suggest.<p>Also, when I wanted to check the size of the font (which is set at 14px but that seems equivalent to 11-12px for the common fonts like Arial) I realized I can&#x27;t actually select any of the text, which I think might be important a website like this. You are creating some mask with a different div that might be blocking the clicks. You can create a mask like that with simpler html and css that won&#x27;t have a problem with clicks.<p>Otherwise it&#x27;s a nice project and it looks like you got a good traction already. I hope this helps.')
