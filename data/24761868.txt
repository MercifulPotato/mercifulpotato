What should I do now?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='It&#x27;s been over a month now since the emergence of a patent owned by a large, litigation-prone competitor came to light, causing us to shut down. I&#x27;m now trying to figure out what to do, but I have no proper software or corporate experience outside my own company, so I&#x27;m not actually sure what is a realistic next step.<p>Here&#x27;s my resume highlights:<p>- CEO of a 4-year bootstrapped wearable sensors company founded straight out of college.<p>- Shipped 3k+ units<p>- Built a machine learning pipeline to solve arbitrary inertial gesture classification problems, deployed working model to hardware prototype<p>- more info, cv, etc: matoles.com<p>- B.S. Materials Science&#x2F;Engineering<p>- Location: Seattle<p>- Age: 26<p>In the long run, I would like to start another ML company. Therefore my short term (2-4 year) objectives are:<p>- Work in the data science &#x2F; ML field<p>- Make a lot of money<p>- No regard for work&#x2F;life balance<p>Here are my questions for the hivemind:<p>- How feasible are the following routes, given my resume?<p>- If you had my resume and wanted to optimize for the above, \nwhat would you do?<p>- Are there any routes not on the list that I should consider? \nAre there important steps I&#x27;m missing?<p>- What gaps in my resume can I fill in the next 3 months?<p>1. Become a data scientist &#x2F; ML engineer at a large company<p>1a. Study a lot. For the purpose of this post, let&#x27;s assume my technical interview skills are in the top 25% of FAANG applicants.<p>1b. Publish 2-3 portfolio projects and maybe a paper on our startup&#x27;s IP<p>1c. Apply to every relevant job I can find<p>2. Apply for leadership&#x2F;non-IC positions at smaller companies<p>2a. Practice interviewing with colleagues in management<p>2b. Apply<p>I am concerned that my resume does not look like that of a typical management applicant. My experience shipping hardware might make up for this at a hardware&#x2F;ML startup?<p>3. Do software or hardware (without ML) because the economy right now is garbage<p>Thanks everyone.')
