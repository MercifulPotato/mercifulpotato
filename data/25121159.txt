All it takes is one chargeback and your entire account is banned, lost to the aether. Same for PS4 Xbox, etc.<p>Were you gifted a game, the payment method for which was a card whose charges were reversed? Adios account.<p>Said something another player didn&#x27;t like? You can be muted or banned altogether, at least from ps4 xbox idk about steam currently.<p>All this bullshit justification mental gymnastics about &#x27;why was he banned what is the full story&#x27; completely misses the forest for the trees.<p>Sadly the incentives are towards banning players, they now have no choice but to repurchase games. If we are only renting games the price should reflect that.')
