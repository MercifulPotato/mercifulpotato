It&#x27;s clearly never in the public&#x27;s interest to favor ANYTHING over the public&#x27;s interest.  There <i>are</i>, however, many cases when it is in the public&#x27;s <i>global</i> interest for a corporation&#x27;s <i>local</i> interests to outweigh individuals&#x27; <i>local</i> interests. Most arguments people make in support of corporation&#x27;s rights can be reduced to 1) identifying the anti-corporate interest as a local one, 2) identifying the public benefit created&#x2F;maintained by supporting a corporation&#x27;s rights, and 3) say 2)&gt;1).<p>An extreme example I expect you&#x27;d agree with to illustrate the structure:<p>* Individuals shouldn&#x27;t just be able to take corporations&#x27; property without compensation. Individuals&#x27; being able to obtain a TV just by taking it from Best Buy would undoubtedly be a benefit.  However, it would mean no sane retailer would stay in business. Having a functioning retail economy is more important to me than getting a free TV.<p>The equivalent argument here is:<p>* Developing cars is hard, expensive work that benefits the public (improved safety, reduced emissions, etc.).  If retail car prices were just a bit lower, many more people could afford them, allowing them to access jobs and escape poverty.  One way to lower retail car prices is to allow manufacturers to sell telemetry data from cars. They&#x27;ll still need to compete on price for customers, but since they&#x27;ll have this new data revenue stream, they&#x27;ll be able to lower consumer prices further while still covering their costs.  If you care more about poverty than you do about data privacy, you should support letting manufacturers sell usage data.<p>I happen not to buy that argument and voted Yes on this measure, but I hope it clarifies how conceptually, people can be for corporations on issues where giving corporations more or fewer rights is at issue.')
