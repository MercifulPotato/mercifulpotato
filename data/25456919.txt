Item(by='j_walter', descendants=None, kids=[25459919], score=None, time=1608221746, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25456526, text='Interesting read, but seeing how the article was written by the &quot;International Inequalities Institute&quot; it doesn&#x27;t give me a lot of good feelings that it is unbiased.  I think most people can agree that if you zero in on just a single country and look at the top versus the middle it seems unfair, but what if you compare that country against others?  Google, Amazon, Tesla and many other major innovators didn&#x27;t arise from a country with high taxes on the rich.  There has been nothing but suffering for the populations of places like Venezuela and Cuba (except for those in power who made themselves rich).  You also can&#x27;t take policies from a small country like the Netherlands or Switzerland and try to apply it to a large and more diverse country like the US or UK.<p>No one has it right, but to say it was a sham is unfair.')
