Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=[25194838, 25194642], score=None, time=1606184035, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25194273, text='I think people in the overall thread are getting confused about different kinds of bribes.<p>A bribe needed to get a lucrative contract for your company: not ok.<p>Paying off a local cop so he won&#x27;t throw you in jail for no reason: totally ok.<p>The US is concerned with preventing the former, not the latter.  I would be surprised if <i>any</i> US company is advocating people pay the first kind of bribe, at least publicly, as that&#x27;s quite illegal in the US (I&#x27;m sure it happens, but as quietly as possible).  But I would not be surprised if US companies tell employees to pay the second kind of bribe, as well they should.')
