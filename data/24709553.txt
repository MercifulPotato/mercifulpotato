The kafka client abstracts away the complexity of tracking offsets. You fetch batches of messages through the kafka client in a loop, process them one by one, and commit the batch’s offset if everything went well. If something goed wrong, after restarting the consumer the kafka client will make sure it gets offered the same batch again. So you’re in an at least once scenario where as long as you process messages in an idempotent way and skip the bad ones it is basically foolproof.')
