I was a tarsnap customer and I thought it was great.  If Colin is happy running it more like a utility than a rapacious VC-backed hyper-growth racket, I&#x27;m not sure why that is bad.<p>The only reason I stopped being a customer was because another rapacious racket of a business, Comcast, introduced miniscule but enforced data caps in my area, so online backups aren&#x27;t attractive anymore and I&#x27;ve gone back to external drives and offsite rotation.  When I cancelled, Colin sent me a personal e-mail to make sure it was alright to delete my backups.  It was probably the best exchange I&#x27;ve ever had with a service provider.')
