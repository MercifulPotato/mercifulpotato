All the services you&#x27;re describing will scale linearly.<p>And if some external bottleneck exists... that&#x27;s a separate issue and adding more servers isn&#x27;t going to solve any problems at all.<p>I guess I still just don&#x27;t see it... I know servers don&#x27;t scale &quot;exactly&quot; in the sense that one service will require another server before another service does, but that doesn&#x27;t make it nonlinear. It just gives it variance (fluctuating both upwards and downwards) around a line. It doesn&#x27;t turn it into a curve.')
