Item(by='josteink', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610387807, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25725107, text='&gt; This is the absolute CORE of the problem with open-source software. Someone becomes the &quot;maintainer&quot; of a project, often through no skill of their own<p>That’s a bit unnuanced, isn’t it?<p>Nobody randomly becomes the maintainer of a big&#x2F;popular project without having a history of contributing. They were the ones <i>willing</i> to pick up the task of doing free labour for everyone after the last guy didn’t want the job anymore.<p>As maintainer of a project, their job is to try to respond to bugs, maintain it, improve it and keep it working. All for free.<p>If somebody submits a low quality or low effort patch which goes against the projects conventions or general strategies or patterns which will over time increase the maintainer’s burden, he is under no obligation to accept that patch.<p>On the contrary, whoever submits the patch is the one who wants to benefit from all that time invested into the project so far, for his own good. I think it’s absolutely fair to expect&#x2F;demand that they are also willing to put up <i>some</i> effort when they send in patches and receive feedback.')
