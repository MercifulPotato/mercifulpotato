Bare metal is just watered down EC2 as far as we are concerned. You still get left holding the bag on a plethora of management duties, so you might as well just take ownership of the whole stack at that point. There <i>are</i> actual benefits to keeping your own hardware in a datacenter that you can physically access. There are also a shitload of downsides that need to be reviewed. Once you accept and adjust to this fate, things can move a lot more smoothly than the cloud salespeople would like to admit.<p>Ultimately, you are probably stuck in the cloud until you can hit that point of being able to dedicate 2+ full-time engineers to the task of managing your infrastructure. Multiple hats for developers works for cloud, but not so much for on-prem. Having to drive to the datacenter should be something that only a few people in your organization need to worry about. You could consider outsourcing this specific aspect for a &quot;pseudo-cloud&quot; experience, but that is more complicated and starts to defeat the original purpose.')
