But it&#x27;s not true.<p>Third, let incentives do the work. Banning H1B immediately would open hundreds of thousands high paying jobs in the US. No need to subsidize and add distortion to distortion, the jobs would be filled as demand would increase.<p>Fourth, very very few H1B are contributing to &quot;state of the art&quot; anything, the vast majority are taking the exact types of jobs that your entry level college graduate could take. And if they contributing to state of the art, then raising the H1B pay to be more fair is exactly the reform needed to pay them properly and ensure we aren&#x27;t replacing slightly higher paying and equally capable workers.')
