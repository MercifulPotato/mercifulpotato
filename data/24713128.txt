Item(by='jancsika', descendants=None, kids=[24714422], score=None, time=1602107196, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24702650, text='&gt; After a bizarre incident at Steinway’s in New York in 1959, when one of the senior technicians (whom Gould disliked because of disagreements over piano regulation) greeted him with a rather too hard clap on the shoulder, Gould claimed major physical injury, cancelled all his engagements for six months and (unsuccessfully) sued Steinway’s for $300,000.<p>Hm... Horowitz&#x27;s tuner Franz Mohr wrote a book where IIRC he claimed that Gould reacted negatively to his retouching of the action on Gould&#x27;s piano, complained that he could have been injured by it, and threatened to sue him. I wonder if this is a different version of that same story (Mohr would have been a senior tech at Steinway at that time) or yet another tuner who Gould harassed.')
