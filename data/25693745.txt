A lot of comments I feel are conflating the effects of banning an average person, or an average person trying to become more well-known (&quot;candidate Trump&quot;), with an established world leader.<p>People with power have real consequences on the life of each individual. I admit I don&#x27;t know how to treat those two groups but I don&#x27;t think the arguments used for the average person are the same arguments that should be applied to world leaders, and vice versa.')
