If you genuinely believe that, then high-risk swings at a big payday make more logical sense than a low-risk gradual growth strategy.<p>I&#x27;ve heard friends express this - if you don&#x27;t have $1 million +, you&#x27;re just varying degrees of poor - so there&#x27;s no point at gradual growth from 20k to 50k and etc when you&#x27;re just as miserable. Might as well risk it all to try to get to the big time, since they don&#x27;t see a reasonable path to growing gradually to anywhere worth living.')
