To a big extent, the public domain mandate doesn&#x27;t apply if workers outside of the government contribute. Thus manuscripts or code often aren&#x27;t public domain.<p>edit: Also publishers <i>constantly</i> &quot;accidentally&quot; claim copyright on public domain works (I&#x27;m looking at you, Elsevier).
