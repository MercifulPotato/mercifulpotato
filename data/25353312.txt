Aren&#x27;t there serious penalties for defrauding the government? Aren&#x27;t those prisoners who got unemployment going to be punished and extend their prison sentences? \nThe antifraud system is completely inexistent, they didn&#x27;t even verify social security numbers so even babies got unemployment.
