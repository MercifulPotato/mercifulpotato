Ignore the people screaming about Adderall being &quot;literal meth&quot; and how it will certainly kill you. Even with an addictive personality, it&#x27;s very easy to avoid over-doing it (hint: only take it as prescribed).<p>Low dose meth does work pretty similar to Adderall. Everyone who does meth does not become a meth addict. Most don&#x27;t. But the people who become meth addicts are the same people who end up using adderall like methheads.<p>Which is why I personally don&#x27;t have an Adderall prescription. Because if I have a bottle of Adderall I&#x27;m going to attempt a prescribed dose on day one and start snorting it by day three.')
