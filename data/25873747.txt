I&#x27;ve been using KDE now for years specifically because every part of it can be customized, but for the most part, i&#x27;ve used the same theme and configurations now for pretty much the entire time i&#x27;ve been using kde.<p>I still think it comes down to branding though, even with those totally customizable environments. The difference is, it&#x27;s not someone else&#x27;s brand. I get to turn my environment into my own &#x27;brand&#x27;.<p>That&#x27;s always kind of been the appeal of theming and customization to me, the ability to remove someone else&#x27;s brand from my computer and replace it with my own.')
