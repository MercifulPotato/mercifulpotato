As someone who worked at FB, there is nowhere CLOSE to the amount of funding that Oculus gets compared to other parts of the company. I would venture to say the same about MS - Hololens is nothing more than an experiment, that is not the funnel in which Microsoft is pouring its revenue from other parts of the business. I am not arguing that companies don’t innovate. I am, however, arguing that companies, once reached a certain size, are less and less incentivized to do so.')
