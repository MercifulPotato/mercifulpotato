You can get a private license in as little as 40-ish hours. But you need an absolute minimum of 250 total hours to even qualify for a commercial license (and there are a bunch of hour requirements in subcategories such that if you&#x27;re not explicitly working toward it, you&#x27;re unlikely to meet minimums), and there&#x27;s another written and practical exam.<p>And not for nothing but if you have a private pilot&#x27;s license already, you can get a commercial drone license with nothing more than a CFI endorsement and a quick online written test. Most PPL holders I know (myself included) added it as an after-thought.')
