I&#x27;m not sure if an Indian court has ever dealt with holocaust denial in particular, probably because there&#x27;s barely any Jews in India at this point, but Indian limitations on speech go far beyond the genocide-speech laws that exist in Europe. Same of course is also true for Singapore and most other Asian countries.')
