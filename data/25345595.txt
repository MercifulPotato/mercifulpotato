First of all, I&#x27;m not mining crypto. I&#x27;m just using multiple Windows VMs to run MetaTrader 4 (Forex trading application) for many users.<p>My project is down for 6 straight days and I&#x27;m still going back and forth with their support to reinstate my project.<p>Is AWS more flexible in terms of policy? Last thing I want is I build my entire business with GCP, scale to a million MRR they suspend my project again due to some violations which are not true.<p>Thanks')
