A Vega64 (a few years old now) has 4096 shaders (&quot;CudaThreads&quot;) at 1.6 GHz. It can search the entire 32-bit floating point (or integer) space in less than a second. 1.6 GHz x 4096 shaders == 2^42.5 bitspace per second.<p>* People exhaustively searching a space are relatively patient: and willing to wait months for the results. 60 seconds x 60 minutes x 24 hours x 30 days == 2^21.3<p>1.6 GHz x 4096 shaders x 60 seconds x 60 minutes x 24 hours x 30 days is roughly equal to 2^63.8. We&#x27;ve done it: a month of GPU effort is all you need to exhaustively search the 64-bit space<p>-------<p>We&#x27;ve entered a world (~3 years ago), where it is reasonable to brute force the 64-bit space, so long as you&#x27;re willing to wait about a month for the results.<p>If you&#x27;re not willing to wait a month, then use 2 GPUs, or 4 GPUs, or a cluster of GPUs like the DGX A100 (or multiple clusters).')
