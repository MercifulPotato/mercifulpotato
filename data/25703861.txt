Those are <i>fringe</i> elements of left wing politics who get little to no endorsement from anyone with any actual power, and who remain mostly irrelevant in Democratic party politics.  Whereas on Wednesday, you had the most powerful Republican tell a violent mob to go to the Capitol and &quot;convince&quot; the &quot;weak&quot; Republicans to change their minds.  His lawyer, who is one of the prominent faces in the Trump media ecosystem, told them this will be &quot;trial by combat.&quot;  A Republican Senator showed an affirmative gesture to that very crowd on his way into the Capitol.<p>Stop trying to &quot;both sides&quot; this, because this is not a &quot;both sides are just as bad&quot; situation.  We just saw the top level leadership of a major national party endorse and praise a terrorist mob that tried to overthrow the US government.  The president literally said he &quot;loved&quot; those people when he told them to go home.  That is problematic on a completely different level from anything that has happened on the left.')
