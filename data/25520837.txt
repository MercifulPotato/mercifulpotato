OP clearly states that there is a fundamental issue with any centralized solution (i.e, the moment that it becomes too big, it will succumb to the interests of its owners) and you respond by saying &quot;well, Signal is easier for the general audience&quot;?<p>It might be easier, <i>so what</i>? Apple&#x27;s products are supposedly more privacy-oriented than the Facebook&#x27;s&#x2F;Google&#x27;s. <i>So what</i>? The idea is that we should be rooting&#x2F;encouraging others to put decentralization and freedom as a top-priority choice, not to keep excusing ourselves into adopting solutions that are bound to become another dominant walled garden.<p>If you want to argue for Matrix vs XMPP, or XMPP vs SIP or any other <i>decentralized</i> protocol, by all means go ahead. Just please don&#x27;t come with &quot;I like Matrix, but <i>here is a completely lazy cop-out that I will use to justify to not fight the good fight</i>&quot;')
