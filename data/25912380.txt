I turn the key or press the button that says &quot;start&quot; and the car starts. Each button does what it should on a single press. Wipers, tail lights, headlights indicator lights, brake, pedal, accelerator, everything works as it should. It is an example of good ux that my phone, my desktop , laptop and my server should copy. But they can&#x27;t because they serve different functions. So just let it be.<p>&gt; software never gets updated<p>Thank God for it. I never have to wait for my car to start because it is waiting for updates to be installed like my laptop does. There is no last update that needs patching for the speedometer to show me the speed. There&#x27;s no bug that causes security concerns for me.<p>Seriously removing ICE hardware and replacing it with simpler electric hardware was a great move. Lets not screw it up with adding more software into it. Except self driving.')
