Good article overall, but you repeatedly state the Hunter Biden laptop story is false. Yet some of those in the email chain have verified authenticity of the emails. And how do you “fake” a whole Mac hard drive contents? I don’t believe it is possible.<p>Plus:\n* The hard drive wasn’t “stolen” - it was forfeited when the customer didn’t pick it up and pay the bill. That’s called a mechanic’s lien. Try taking your car into the shop and then never pick it up - same thing happens.\n* So at that point the laptop belongs to the shop.\n* How is it “stolen”, then?\n* If I had a laptop like that in my possession, I would be afraid too, and want to hand it off!<p>You’re being disingenuous :-&#x2F;')
