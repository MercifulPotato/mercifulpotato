Then start offering new installations with email compatibility off by default until the majority of the users are on the new protocol, then keep email support only on lts releases and finally remove email completely. This way you avoid having to carry the baggage of email forever and having to support an old protocol full of backwards compatibility hacks. This is all in theory, in practice I doubt this will ever get close to replacing email.')
