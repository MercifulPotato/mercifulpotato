It&#x27;s even more amusing when Cramer of all people was the voice of reason.<p>&gt; There is no evidence that any of the major funds involved in shorting have done anything illegal.<p>We will see through class action lawsuit against robinhood and SEC investigations.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s nothing illegal about a wash sale,<p>Used the wrong term, I meant the massive sell order (while people were not allowed to buy) trading halt, sell order again, trading halt, a few times to trigger stop losses then price magically goes back up where it was and the sell orders evaporated...<p>&gt; it doesn&#x27;t need to be more than that.<p>Disagree, some investigations are warranted as to how this was allowed to happen. (I&#x27;m assuming investors in hedge fund arent happy either at 3 billion loss that we know of) As well as general practices and the dirty tactics employed recently')
