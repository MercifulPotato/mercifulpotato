To make this feasible and still have the code readable, it needs to fit “wrapless” in those windows.<p>It&#x27;s not clear whether the terminals are horizontally next to each other, however one must consider that in his calculations, there is the presupposition of extra programs (other than the editor) horizonally stacked on the same screen. The sky is the limit, with such presupposition.<p>I still contend that 40 columns should be the maximum, as in addition to the editor, any sane, productive developer should keep one or two terminals, the team chat, and the music player stacked horizontally on the same screen. &#x2F;s')
