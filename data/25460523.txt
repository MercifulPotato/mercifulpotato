Amazon makes it very confusing to figure out that, e.g., web server mode is different than regular S3 mode. CF itself tries to get you to do the wrong thing. Plus you have to jump through hoops to make your bucket private but still give CF access to it. I was doing that wrong for years. How many multimillion dollar companies wouldn&#x27;t be relevant if Amazon just fixed their freaking docs?')
