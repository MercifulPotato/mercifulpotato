Both the good and the bad..<p>Consider for example going to the gym, although lifting weight is in itself a meaningless task yet the side effects are very desirable thus many are willing to visit the gym on daily basis. Can anything similar be said on hours of constant daily coding? Or does coding have mostly negative side effects (aside from money), does is hinder your social skills significantly? or does it have any desirable side effects? What is your personal experience and thoughts on this?')
