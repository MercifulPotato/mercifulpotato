Typically after 100k miles Teslas lose about 5-10% capacity. I suppose if you are bumping into that limit a lot, it might be a problem, but it would make far more sense to sell your current car and buy a new one at that point. You could get decent resale value out of it because lots of people would be perfectly happy with a Tesla with a 280 mile range versus 310 miles.<p>There are Teslas out there that have clocked over 300k miles and still have more than 70% of their rated range. Again, even if the current owner has an issue with ~200 miles range, selling a Tesla with a 200 mile range won&#x27;t be a big problem.')
