Arbitrators need a way to transfer USD denominated amounts between exchanges to operate.<p>On top of market making, you&#x27;ll have smallish (7-8 figure USD) trading shops running strategies across multiple cryptos that just don&#x27;t have fiat ramps, or they want to tap into volume across exchanges that don&#x27;t have fiat ramps. If you&#x27;re one of these customers, you can get in touch with Tether and make redemptions, but you probably don&#x27;t need to do that anyway because you&#x27;re working through a prime broker.<p>This activity doesn&#x27;t care if the market&#x27;s bull or bear, so it continues to grow over time in either trend.')
