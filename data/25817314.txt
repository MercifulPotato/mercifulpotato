That sounds awful.<p>You know, I think I actually <i>do</i> want Google to build this into Chrome, wire it up to your Google account for nefarious purposes and&#x2F;or have the whole thing turn into an example that K-anonymity doesn&#x27;t work well in practice, and try to ram it down everyone&#x27;s throats.
