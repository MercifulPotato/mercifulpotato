It&#x27;s not an after-thought or something whose business model is unclear or is against my privacy\n* for the same reason I am less worried that the company behind it will pull the plug because it&#x27;s not the main focus<p>I much happier to pay more for a service&#x2F;product with a clear focus made by a company that doesn&#x27;t a gazillion other things. (Btw for similar reasons I think that Evernote is damaging itself with their strategy of chasing new features at all costs).')
