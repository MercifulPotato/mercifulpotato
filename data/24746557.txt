I do agree with your general advice, however. Health and involvement in groups are foundational.<p>As an example, a friend from this age group, but crucially, without a child, powered through a coding camp at 14-16 hours a day for several months and has had, to her, well-paid and fulfilling  work since then. But, most would have difficulty carving out that kind of time, while also questioning a successful outcome (edit: in short, opportunity cost comes to be seen as very dear. This certainly does not excuse wasted time, but if you actually do not know where to invest time....).<p>The truly motivated are indeed a minority, but again, I perceive that as often a product of not seeing a path in the forest: sensing promise in no direction, they wander. Taking the metaphor further, and drawing on my meager SAR training, lost people wander until they needn&#x27;t or cannot--the tools they need are a map and compass rather than will.')
