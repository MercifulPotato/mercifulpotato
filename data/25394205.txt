It seemed like an almost unimaginably large amount of money to me back then (I was in my last year of high school), but I’m sure it was the smallest of his costs in polishing up the game to his standards!  In retrospect, I’d be startled if he didn’t decide the code was a complete write-off and needed to be rewritten from scratch;  I’d been an absolute neophyte at the time!  But he was kind enough not to tell me about it, if so!<p>Andrew and I still have never met face to face;  our conversations were entirely online.  And we lost touch shortly after I went off to university.  I’m a little embarrassed to have missed this talk, even though was actually in the building at the time.  I was exhibiting my own game over in the expo hall, and I had completely lost track of time.  Exhibiting your own game is definitely a bit overwhelming; a lot more than exhibiting somebody else’s one!<p>Andrew was definitely the one who got me seriously into game development and made me think about it as a viable career.  In a lot of ways, I’m in the industry today because of him.')
