But that&#x27;s not tautological.  It is a distributed price-setting process that everyone contributes to through their own economic choices.<p>When it comes to charity, people contribute time and money based on their perceived impact.  As a donor, I would value 100 new houses higher than 10 new houses, but that&#x27;s just me.  Other people are free to make different choices.')
