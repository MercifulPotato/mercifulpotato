Fully aware there is a vaccine and there&#x27;s nothing that can help them now, if only someone had thought of THEM, helping THEM. I know this doesn&#x27;t really help anything. It&#x27;s just super sad. I do feel it daily.<p>Unfortunately too part of the problem is so little actually helpful information is being distributed. What your average Joe hears is<p>1. death count - useful.<p>2. Vaccine - useful up to a point - they won&#x27;t be able to get it for a while.<p>3. Wear a mask - useful.<p>I think beyond this we need to make sure people know that:<p>1. Most cases are because of contact with asymptomatic people (AND Before that one HN person replies with that doesn&#x27;t exist - it absolutely does - antibody tests are also confirming this)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;20&#x2F;health&#x2F;cdc-coronavirus-spread-asymptomatic-website-wellness&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;20&#x2F;health&#x2F;cdc-coronavirus-spread...</a><p>2. Vitamin D is NOT your Trump conspiracy cure. It actually works and is backed up by 2 gold standard studies. We don&#x27;t have more research in this area because no one is funding it. There are many other studies (not randomized&#x2F;placebo) but ones looking at old people that were already previously taking vitamin D (because of their existing regimen before the pandemic) with massively better outcomes.
