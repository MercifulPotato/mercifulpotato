First, there&#x27;s no single network, so I don&#x27;t understand what “converging” means here. Each person has a different subset of all the scuttlebutt messages that exist.<p>If a client discovers conflicting messages claiming to be Alice&#x27;s message number 21, the client ignores both messages and all subsequent messages in that feed; the feed is “forked” — nothing converges.<p>The purpose of the append-only log is as the paper says later:<p>&gt; Messages cannot be faked, omitted, or re-ordered, due to the signed append-only log nature of the feed.<p>---<p>&gt; An ignore will simply not show that data to the user&#x27;s node, although their node will continue to pass their data through the network.<p>Which client implements ignores like this? I thought that for most clients, ignore means “I won&#x27;t replicate this feed, but I also won&#x27;t publish a message announcing that I&#x27;m no longer replicating this feed”. The same as blocking, but without announcing it.<p>---<p>&gt; For example, a client could store data from 2 hops away, but replicate data from 3 hops away<p>No, you can&#x27;t replicate data you haven&#x27;t stored! You could store and replicate data from 3 hops away but only <i>display</i> data from 2 hops away.<p>---<p>They&#x27;re a little confused, but they&#x27;ve got the spirit!')
