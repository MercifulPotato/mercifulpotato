Do you really honestly believe that a few hundred people marching onto the capitol have the ability to destabilize the country? Remember, we have layers upon layers of armed forces that would end any such attempt very very easily. I think this incident was more realistically just a bunch of amped up protesters who got caught up in the moment and crossed a physical barrier, but had no greater ambition of taking over the US government.<p>Not to mention, this is not the first time rioters have taken over capitol hill while Congress has gathered. It has happened over and over many times, even in the past few years. Which of the following events did you see broad front-page coverage of, along with censorship&#x2F;deplatforming on social media, and calls for resignation&#x2F;expulsion of politicians:<p>Was it the capitol riot that AOC directly <i>participated</i> in (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;13&#x2F;alexandria-ocasio-cortez-sunrise-activists-nancy-pelosi&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;13&#x2F;alexandria-ocasio-cortez...</a>)? Perhaps it was the repeated incidents after AOC and Rashida Tlaib both encouraged this group to continue illegal rioting (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sunrise_Movement" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sunrise_Movement</a>)? Or the several past Capitol Hill riots staged by Democracy Spring (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Democracy_Spring" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Democracy_Spring</a>)? Or perhaps the Obamacare riots (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;07&#x2F;10&#x2F;politics&#x2F;health-care-protests-capitol-hill&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;07&#x2F;10&#x2F;politics&#x2F;health-care-protests...</a>)? Or maybe when 600 people raided capitol hill to protest immigration law (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnews.go.com&#x2F;Politics&#x2F;womens-march-protesters-call-end-family-separation-capitol&#x2F;story?id=56240419" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnews.go.com&#x2F;Politics&#x2F;womens-march-protesters-call...</a>)?<p>The reality is none of them resulted in any consequences for the activists, affiliated politicians, or organizations that either organized&#x2F;led&#x2F;incited those riots. After all, AOC is still here on Twitter&#x2F;Instagram&#x2F;whatever. The same thing happened throughout 2020. Rose City Antifa (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rose_City_Antifa" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rose_City_Antifa</a>) organized numerous highly violent riots at federal buildings in Portland - guess what, their Twitter account (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;RoseCityAntifa" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;RoseCityAntifa</a>) still stands. BLM-affiliated events have caused billions in damage, and resulted in a far greater number of deaths - shouldn&#x27;t they be deplatformed as well?<p>The tech companies making these changes at the eleventh hour is simply them pandering to the incoming administration (their new masters) and them finally caving in to their own political biases and putting their immense, unchecked power to use by attacking and suppressing their political enemies. It&#x27;s a dark, dark day and like in all such catastrophes, it&#x27;ll be welcomed with open arms.')
