You have to worry about forwarding results from one pipeline to another bypassing the registers if you want to avoid having to deal with stalls waiting for results.  The transistor cost of the bypass network grows as the square of the number of pipelines so it can be pretty significant, potentially being larger than the cost of the execution pipelines themselves.<p>Many modern designs aren&#x27;t fully bypassed and involve clusters of pipelines to manage this.  IBM&#x27;s recent Power chips and Apple&#x27;s ARM cores are particularly known to do this.')
