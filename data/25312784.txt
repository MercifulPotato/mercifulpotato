For  example reviews have been pretty consistent that<p>1) Graphic Design software:\nWorks well out of box. Key Adobe apps not yet native and have some minor issues under Rosetta, but still work, are still fast and should be much faster when native.<p>2) Video Production:\nUnbelievably fast, on par with high end iMacs and Mac Pros and should get faster as all tools go native.<p>3) Software Developers:\nSuper fast builds and tools. Homebrew not native yet but can still use with Rosetta version of terminal. If you need Docker itâ€™s months away.<p>4) niche Users of esoteric apps ported from windows: this is the group Patrick reported in. Yea, some of these apps are months away from being usable but all have perfectly cromulent native replacements.')
