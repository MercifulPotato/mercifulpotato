I like parts of Milwaukee, and I&#x27;ve gotten out into the countryside. It&#x27;s really nice.<p>This is all subjective, of course, but what can I say? I&#x27;ve been in restaurant and bars at the top of tall hotels in Milwaukee, I enjoyed it and the view of the lake and city... and no, I don&#x27;t think it even remotely measures up to views of the bay from Pacific Heights or another dozen views in San Francisco. Nor does the surrounding countryside in Milwaukee - which I sincerely do like quite a bit - measure up to redwood forests, Pt. Reyes, the headlands, the coastline from SF to Santa Cruz. A little farther afield, Big Sur and the high Sierras, Sonoma and Napa valleys. I&#x27;m not really even sure how to debate it with people, it seems so self-evident to me. California and SF have some really bad qualities, but no, it&#x27;s not all six of one and a half dozen of the other around any randomly selected US city of 100K in the US. The nature around San Francisco is a differentiator and a selling point (though I would tend to agree that it is now officially overpriced).<p>Puget Sound is remarkable, though, and the forest around Portland is beautiful. As I&#x27;ve mentioned in another thread, though, the coast is far more accessible in San Francisco.')
