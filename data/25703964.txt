They designed this incredible vehicle, and landed it in this incredible way, but making the wheels just a tiny bit too thin (in a well-justified pursuit of optimization) wound up limiting the scope of the mission when met with unexpected terrain.  It shows just how small of a margin of error they have in making this all work.')
