It was super unreliable on iPhone. Simple things that should have worked perfectly, like uploading or downloading files, were very unreliable. There’s a certain class of software, usually written these days in a PHP, python, or JS, where there’s a big focus on making it “easy to use” or having a nice UI that usually accomplishes neither and you also have to contend with the underlying software being bad.<p>At this point, the only solution I’ve found to the kind of self-hosting stuff nextcloud provides are various utilities built on top of SSH — like rsync (which works perfectly) - or samba (which works OK). I haven’t found anything that really works well on iOS.')
