The Z80 CPU has a 16-bit address bus and can handle 64K of memory. It has an 8-bit I&#x2F;O bus, but it was common for Z80-based machines to use memory-mapped I&#x2F;O like the 6502.<p>Two very common machines from the era were the ZX spectrum and the TRS-80. But there were dozens - Kaypro, Osborne, MSX, the Nintendo Gameboy... the Z80 was used in lots of machines. Chips based on the Z80 are still used in embedded systems today.<p>I built a retro-computer this year using a Z180, which is a Z80 (minus undocumented behaviours) core with a handful of useful peripherals built in. They&#x27;re still actively manufactured and sold.')
