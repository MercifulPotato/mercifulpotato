I&#x27;d be happy to work for you anyday. I wouldn&#x27;t be too quick to judge the guy who asked for directions, unless he didn&#x27;t believe you could be an attendee or speaker. I&#x27;d never heard of you before, and I&#x27;m not afraid to ask random possibly-prestigious people for directions at conferences. I occasionally attend NANOGs, hosted by Edward McNair.')
