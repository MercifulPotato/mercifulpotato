I have watched several companies do rewrites of large codebases only to realize it was a massive mistake after taking years longer and spending millions more than intended. In every case it was a disproportionate focus on the problems they had, and a failure to understand what had been working well before tearing it down.<p>I’ve also watched Brooks’ Law in action, watched people thrown onto a project to try to get it out the door cause it to slow down. I do not believe what I said is an example of Brooks’ Law. Brooks’ Law is “adding manpower to a late software project makes it later&quot;, it was not an observation about all software development in all stages. Brooks’ Law assumes that the “ramp up” time is finite, and not particularly long.<p>I’m also not actually saying that people aren’t productive when joining existing projects, I’m saying that there’s a much deeper component of productivity that depends on involvement from the beginning. I’m sure you’ve already experienced being very “productive” after a short time when joining a large project, I definitely have. It’s the <i>kind</i> of productivity that depends on being there early, and Brooks wasn’t making any qualitative statement about productivity, only quantitative.<p>Fred Brooks was a lovely man to speak to, BTW. I met him and had a long interview when I was considering going to North Carolina for graduate school. The lasting impression I got wasn’t anything he said in particular, it was more of the positivity and optimism he carried about software and life that made me want to hang around and hear what he had to say.')
