They are only not weird if you&#x27;ve become accustomed to the weirdness.<p>I primarily develop on Windows, and when I come to Linux to work on things I am astonished to find that Linux developers think nothing of using upwards of half a dozen different languages to build one thing. CMake, autoconf, shell, and python all being used to build a single C++ program is <i>weird</i> and <i>unnecessary</i>. If you don&#x27;t think so I submit you&#x27;ve merely become accustomed to doing things in this incredibly weird way!<p>PS: Windows has its own developer tendencies that are weird and unnecessary, but I will at least readily admit that about them.')
