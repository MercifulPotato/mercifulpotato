Itâ€™s all there in the scsi log pages, more detailed than SMART on hard drives.<p>Mechanically and electrically, everything is rated to last several times longer than the head<p>In other words, you just need to buy two used drives (one as spare) and verify they can write a full tape and their head hours and other error counters are sane. There is no reasonable need to refurbish a tape drive other than a head replacement, which is easy to do at home but so expensive (for older generations) that you might as well buy a new drive. All the testing you could hope for is done in POST and by LTT&#x2F;equivalent (writing a tape and reading logs is good enough)')
