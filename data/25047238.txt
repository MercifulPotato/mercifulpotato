This suggests that Benford’s Law may\nbe applicable&quot;<p>The issue, as I understand it, is that the US districts that the &quot;law&quot; is being applied to are too small, uniform, and uniformly sized, and therefore the &quot;law&quot; doesn&#x27;t apply.<p>Additionally, many of the graphs being shared have obvious biases (change of scale between one candidate and the other) which suggests bad faith of those making the graphs (see the skeptics.stackexchange link a sibling shared).<p>&gt; Why are you so against discussing it?<p>I&#x27;m not especially against discussing it.
