I&#x27;ve also got a fair bit of creativity that&#x27;s usually expressed in my writing, but also in building electronics and other hobbies. The largest programs I&#x27;ve written were 250-300 line bash scripts.<p>This is going to sound very clich√© unfortunately, but I am serious and don&#x27;t expect that anything will come easy. I have a concept for a mobile app that will interface with fitness trackers (or the phones built in gyro) in order to see if the user is active or inactive, and then it&#x27;ll send them various messages about their activity.<p>My goal is to start by supporting Android and Fitbit and see how it goes from there. I am working toward creating my first Android app via Android Studio, but beyond that: Where do I go? What knowledge will I need to finish this and launch an app?<p>I appreciate any input. I know this isn&#x27;t a typical HN question but I can&#x27;t think of a better place to pose this question, since there are so many seasoned developers <i>and</i> founders here.')
