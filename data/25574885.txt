A lack of competitive chip manufacturing in the US is a threat.<p>&gt; My bet is they consider Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea well within their sphere of influence (and control), so no urgency there.<p>That&#x27;s pretty foolish and short-sighted, though, since all of those countries are within spitting distance of the US&#x27;s main geopolitical competitor, and that competitor even has a disputed territorial claim to one of them (and vows to retake it by force, if necessary).')
