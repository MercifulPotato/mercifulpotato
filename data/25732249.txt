This was a concentrated effort to brain wash American conservatives to completely distrust and disassemble the institutions of American democracy. I don’t know if you are from other countries and do not realize the context and severity of these actions, or if you’re troll accounts wishing to sow the same discord on HN.

Nobody got banned for supporting lower taxes, states rights, or being anti-abortion. You can promote and discuss those on Twitter Facebook and AWS on any day of the week. What you cannot do is organize thousands of individuals to commit violent acts, or call for and attempt the murder of rightfully elected public officials not just on January 6 - but again on Inauguration Day.
