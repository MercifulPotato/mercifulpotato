Semi was partially responsible for the A4 and maybe A5? What about A6, A7, A8, A9, A10, A11, A12, A13, A14? You casually state &quot;making it better and better&quot;, as if that&#x27;s a regular occurrence for CPU architects over the past two decades. It&#x27;s not, unfortunately.<p>Iterating a uarch is not a given. Ask Intel &amp; AMD.<p>20% to 40% IPC gain &#x2F; year is not a given. Ask Intel &amp; AMD.<p>Iterating 20% to 40% IPC gain &#x2F; year &#x2F; nearly identical TDP is absolutely not a given. Ask Intel &amp; AMD.<p>Likewise, P.A. Semi (in 2008) is a very recent addition in Apple&#x27;s Arm journey.<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; the history &#x2F;&#x2F;<p>In the 1980s, Apple&#x27;s ATG (Advanced Technology Group) pushed to move to on RISC and worked with Acorn in England to co-develop ARM III CPUs for Apple&#x27;s &quot;next-gen&quot; devices<p>In 1990, Arm Ltd. is founded with the two largest shareholders as Apple (43%) and Acorn (43%).<p>Apple was reportedly responsible for Arm&#x27;s current name: it&#x27;s &quot;Advanced&quot;, not &quot;Acorn&quot;, because Apple didn&#x27;t want to be associated with a former competitor.<p>Apple mainstreams Arm far earlier than the iPhone: in 2001, the first iPod launched with a 90 MHz ARM-derived CPU.<p>&#x2F;&#x2F; P.A. Semi &#x2F;&#x2F;<p>People always forget the history of the P.A. Semi acquisition, even as it&#x27;s linked there.<p>The short version: Intel was literally gifted a major high-perf Arm uarch and screwed it up; that same CPU architect refuses to join Intel, founds P.A. Semi some years later, and Apple acquires P.A. Semi and that CPU architect joins Apple.<p>That &quot;lot of low power chipmaking experience&quot; was literally <i>gifted</i> to Intel and they couldn&#x27;t do jack. Apple needed to acquire it after decades of trying to get Arm to work, far more effort than Intel.<p>Likewise, in the 2000s, Intel had significantly higher profits than Apple: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrotrends.net&#x2F;stocks&#x2F;stock-comparison?s=gross-profit&amp;axis=single&amp;comp=INTC:AAPL" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrotrends.net&#x2F;stocks&#x2F;stock-comparison?s=gross-...</a><p>In Q4 2005, Intel made $23b in profit. Apple made $4b in profit. Intel was a CPU IP &amp; foundry. How did they miss Arm or other RISC designs? That&#x27;s the kicker: Intel didn&#x27;t miss Arm. Intel has repeatedly failed &amp; floundered with &quot;side technologies&quot; that they thought inferior to x86: heterogenous dies, chiplets, Arm, XScale, etc. = Intel explicitly decried and denounced these &quot;cheap&quot; tactics by their competitors.<p>Intel in the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s genuinely exhibited &quot;not made here means it&#x27;s crap and automatically inferior to anything we can make&quot; philosophy.<p>1993: Daniel Dobberpuhl develops StrongARM, a high-performance ARM uarch.<p>1997: Intel is gifted StrongARM through a legal settlement and the &quot;keys to the kingdom&quot;. Dobberpuhl doesn&#x27;t agree to join Intel.<p>2003: Unrelenting on Arm&#x27;s future, Dobberpuhl starts P.A. Semi after working at Broadcom.<p>2007: Intel sells off StrongARM, saying they don&#x27;t know how to make money with ARM as AMD had applied unprecedented pressure with K8 &amp; Athlon64.<p>2008: Apple acquires P.A. Semi.<p>2009: Dobberpuhl retires from Apple.<p>It&#x27;s not like AMD, Intel, etc. were ignorant x86 had severe perf&#x2F;watt limitations. They knew and they know. They tried repeatedly to overcome them and then simply lost interest as they couldn&#x27;t make money.<p>Sources (a great read &#x2F; watch, if you&#x27;re bored):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregister.com&#x2F;2006&#x2F;06&#x2F;28&#x2F;intel_mobile_failure&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theregister.com&#x2F;2006&#x2F;06&#x2F;28&#x2F;intel_mobile_failure&#x2F;</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=AADZo73yrq4&amp;t=449s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=AADZo73yrq4&amp;t=449s</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Acorn_Computers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Acorn_Computers</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;StrongARM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;StrongARM</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IPod" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IPod</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.computerweekly.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2240049543&#x2F;Intels-StrongArm-makes-way-for-XScale" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.computerweekly.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2240049543&#x2F;Intels-Strong...</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Daniel_W._Dobberpuhl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Daniel_W._Dobberpuhl</a>')
