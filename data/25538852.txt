Everyone I know with an Apple laptop has had to have it replaced under warranty (in a few cases, multiple times), but my Latitudes from college and law school and my Lenovos from old jobs <i>still work</i>. I couldn&#x27;t even tell you whether Dell or Lenovo warranties are any good because I&#x27;ve never had to use them. I got my cousins an HP laptop from Best Buy about a decade ago, and it&#x27;s traveled all across India, in trains, on elephants, been dropped a few dozen times, and other than disgustingly sticky keys and a dented frame, it still works like new.<p>And with the superior hardware, you also get the freedom to install whatever software you want, to use whatever hardware you want, to not worry about whether software you purchased last year will still run on you computer, it&#x27;s truly liberating. Sure, it&#x27;s not as shiny or skeumorphic as Mac, but the trade-off is infinitely greater usability.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to sound like a Windows fanboy, but once you understand why Windows is so much better you&#x27;ll never want to use macOS again.')
