(<i>Strictly speaking</i> it doesn&#x27;t exactly dissolve, but it&#x27;s hard to understand the difference.)<p>Also, gold telluride looks enough like fool&#x27;s gold that it has been mistaken for it and used to make sidewalks and fill potholes -- that were later mined, after somebody noticed the fool&#x27;s gold there was twice as heavy as it should have been.
