From a management point of view premature optimizations are cost intensive, especially while we’re still figuring out what our product is and how it works. At the end there are a lot of changes all the time to functionality and implementation and optimizations early get wasted very quickly. We rather purchase new servers. A powerful server cost 100 USD&#x2F;month and wehe development team can focus on implementing features and functionality which moves our product forwar d, optimizations are opportunity losses at the beginning of a product. Of course, as soon as bad performance impacts user experience it’s a different story and also if you start to have hundreds or thousands of servers but then you’ll know what your product is doing and changes become smaller, focused and code optimizations    start to make sense.')
