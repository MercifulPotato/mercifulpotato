There are tests that measure the ability to distinguish color. Some people are only colorblind in one eye, and report perceptual differences that are predictable by phenotype. I would expect any meaningful difference in qualia would have some conceivable (if not performable) test. Otherwise we&#x27;re calling two equivalent things different for no reason at all.<p>I personally tend to believe that non-falsifiable statements are necessarily non-physical.')
