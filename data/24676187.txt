In a code editor that matches start and end blocks, having delimiters is a huge advantage. Heck, even in minified JSON, I can easily identify start&#x2F;end blocks simply by placing the cursor on the open or closed parenthesis. Also how would you “minify” a format like this where whitespace is significant? I think this is a nifty as purely an alternative for simple (shallow data) uses cases like configuration files, however using this for data exchange, serialization, portability, and deeply nested, complex data structures could be problematic, just as it always has been for YAML.')
