However, people who write newspaper articles, etc.. still need to get paid.  I think we all say &quot;I&#x27;d like to be able to pay just for the articles I want to read&quot;, but just like a la carte TV, I think  we&#x27;d find out that is much more expensive than we know.<p>My theory is that, collectively, our privacy and attention is worth far more to other people that to us.  Making up numbers, a company may pay $1 to show a targeted ad to you while you are reading an article.  But there is no way that you&#x27;d ever pay $1 to read that article.  And, furthermore, you probably see viewing that ad as a minor annoyance, not $1 worth of value.<p>I think if most folks had to replace ad money out of their own pocket in order to consume the content they like, they&#x27;d never do it.')
