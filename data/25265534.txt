To do so, the possibilities to change the company as well as the actual profession would have to be transparent and open.<p>In addition, most theories on the free market also assume rational actors. Which has been sufficiently refuted as a model of reality.<p>But even this would not be the problem if the basic assumptions above were fulfilled. But in most cases they are not. I do not know what the colleague next to me earns. I don&#x27;t know how much ROI my employer gets with my work performance and I certainly don&#x27;t have the chance to get analogous data to other companies in the market. In addition, as an employee I am also very much tied to the local area due to family situations and therefore cannot act like capital on the free market worldwide.<p>All in all, in this &quot;game&quot; of the employee is always the weaker market participant - which is why, for example, there are facilities and institutions in consumer markets that protect the consumer, because there is an imbalance in information.<p>For this reason there is (at least in Germany) state intervention in the employee market just as there are trade unions or works councils. There are analogous instruments in many markets worldwide - to create a counterweight to the imbalance of information and power.')
