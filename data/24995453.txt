If we can target those specific 9 or some subset thereof, like Aedes aegypti as Oxitec is doing, we at least reduce the misery index while preserving 99.9% of the prey items consumed by birds, dragonflies, and other predators.  Also, there&#x27;s at least one study that suggests total eradication of mosquitoes would not harm the ecosystem because of the availability of substitute food sources.')
