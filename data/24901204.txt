And Biden&#x27;s lawyer hasn&#x27;t denied he called and tried to get the files back.<p>None of the reports I&#x27;ve seen casting aspersions on the legitimacy of the files have offered any proof they are not legit.<p>I think it&#x27;s fair to say the messengers (Rudy and Bannon) are certainly motivated by personal and political gain but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re stupid enough to knowingly try to pass off forged documents to smear the Bidens.<p>So, with all that in mind I do find it queer that most all of the left leaning &quot;News&quot; organizations have focused on discrediting the legitimacy of the files without having any real evidence at all of them being forged or altered and for the most part I&#x27;ve not seen them reporting on what&#x27;s in the files or alleged to be in them.')
