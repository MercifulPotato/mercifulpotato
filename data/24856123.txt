The genius of our skilled working class machinist types is now wasted in coming up with new workman&#x27;s comp schemes rather than building things, because you shipped most of his jobs and his future prosperity overseas. This is pretty much all of it in a nutshell. In Germany those people are building things. In America, it&#x27;s difficult to make a living building things, so the brightest of them go into IT or whatever. Scumbag economists make up excuses for why improving some scam figure like the overall GDP is good for the 50 year old machinist whose job has been shipped to China, and who has to go to work as a Walmart greeter or janitor in a heroin clinic. It&#x27;s not good for him, his family and community, or the country.<p>And it&#x27;s not good for my blood pressure reading ding dongs like this talking about the South versus the North versus Karen. Talk about the human capital we&#x27;ve destroyed with our imbecile looter pyramid scheme economic theories.
