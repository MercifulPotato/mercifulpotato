We have such a wealth of data and the signal is very strong.<p>&gt;  That paper doesn&#x27;t consider reinfection risk or non-fatal outcomes.<p>That&#x27;s because reinfection is extremely rare and risk for non-fatal outcomes is typical of other influenza like illnesses. An interesting note is that many &#x2F; most people have some sort of cross-protection through T-cell immunity (likely from other coronaviruses).<p>&gt; We don&#x27;t even know if herd immunity is actually possible<p>Yes we do. Pretty much every disease tails off. The only debate right now is where this threshold is at for various jurisdictions. It is likely as low as 20%. The 60% number quoted early in the pandemic was assuming homogenous population with equal susceptibility and perfect mixing.<p>&gt; This paper is a similar (if slightly more mathematically detailed) approach, and is more recent: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;early&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;21&#x2F;2008087117" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;early&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;21&#x2F;2008087117</a>. It comes to the opposite conclusion. What they find is that while it&#x27;s technically possible to achieve herd immunity this way, it&#x27;s logistically unfeasible.<p>All models are wrong but some are useful. If this model cannot explain real data from cities and countries (eg: stockholm, UK locales) then it is relatively useless.')
