I&#x27;ll go first:<p>Let&#x27;s say I have a nebulous recollection that there is a wifi module with &quot;NRF&quot; in the model number. If I search for `nrf wifi` on both Google and DDG, which do you think provides better results?<p>Let&#x27;s look at the top URL hits from both (this is in an incognito window, with ublock origin on!):<p>Google:<p>1) nordicsemi.com (the manufacturer) homepage<p>2) &lt;manufacturer website&gt; press release<p>3) &lt;manufacturer website&gt; random Q &amp; A page<p>4) arduino.stackoverflow.com (question about how to use it)<p>5) Some blog (someone&#x27;s guide to using it)<p>6) nrf.com (National Retail Federation) conference category: wifi and bluetooth analytics (unrelated result, but I can imagine someone going to this conference might google the exact same thing, good thing Google knows to show it...<p>--- A random box showing questions relevant to the device ---<p>7) arduino.cc (question about how to use it)<p>8) &lt;electronics blog site A&gt; (someone&#x27;s guide to using it)<p>9) &lt;electronics blog site A&gt; (another page on using it)<p>10) &lt;electronic parts retail site A&gt; (sells it)<p>DDG:<p>1) &lt;electronics blog site A&gt; (someone&#x27;s guide to using it)<p>2) &lt;electronics blog site B&gt; (someone&#x27;s guide to using it)<p>3) &lt;electronic parts retail site C&gt; (someone&#x27;s guide to using it)<p>4) &lt;electronics blog site D&gt; (someone&#x27;s guide to using it)<p>5) &lt;electronics blog site E&gt; (someone&#x27;s guide to using it)<p>6) &lt;electronics blog site F&gt; (another guide to using it)<p>7) &lt;electronics blog site G&gt; (someone&#x27;s guide to using it)<p>8) arduino.cc (question about how to use it)<p>9) &lt;manufacturer website&gt; random Q &amp; A page<p>10) &lt;manufacturer website&gt; another random Q &amp; A page<p>As you can see, Google seems to prefer authoritative sources (the manufacturer, the conference that coincidentally has the same name and category), while DDG seems to prefer blogs and how-to guides. I won&#x27;t say which is better, that&#x27;s entirely subjective.')
