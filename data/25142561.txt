They had a net profit of $34B in 2019. That is 340,000 per employee. From a &quot;we could pay people more&quot; perspective, they are wildly underpaying their employees. That is precisely as much of a jerk move as anything else.<p>The <i>only</i> solution to this is collective action. I do hope that recognition of &quot;wow, we really do get screwed by the bosses&quot; among remote tech workers will allow the entire industry to see how capitalism seeks to minimize their pay.')
