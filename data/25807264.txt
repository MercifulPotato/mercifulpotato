I guess it&#x27;s maybe a bit too much of a leap? It replaces both Kubernetes and messaging queues, so once you&#x27;ve made software with it it&#x27;s kinda hard to back out to a vanilla programming model.<p>There&#x27;s of course the legit downside of needing to use one language and one framework for all actors, which is a problem Kubernetes and a message queues don&#x27;t have.')
