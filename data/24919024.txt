Talking with colleagues we compared what a different experience is to fly to Japan for them and me.<p>I just show up in Japan, show them my passport and job is done. For the Philippines, they have to apply for a visa, and if it is a group of people risk that arbitrarily one or several of  them would not be allowed. And they are good paid software engineers with stable jobs, I cannot imagine how it is for the rest of the population. The ones that can afford to pay for the trip and hotels.<p>My only experience with a Visa is with China, and I do not need to provide any  economic information but itinerary and flights of arrival and departure. USA, or India just require on-line notices of arrival previous to the flight. (Are they really Visas?)<p>&gt; Citizens of African countries have nearly 50 percent of all applications denied just in the UK, compared to just eight percent in the Middle East and 13 percent in South Asia.<p>I understand the economic reasons for such high percentage of rejection. But, such a high number does not help to improve the business situation in the African continent.<p>I grew up in a poor European country, 40 years later I feel privileged for that. And yet, I cannot know how one feels being born in Africa as I cannot know how one feels being born in a rich country. I hope that at least I can offer understanding, and vote for governments that want to reduce the breach between rich and poor continents, countries, and citizens.')
