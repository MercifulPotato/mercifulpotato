The Buchla synthesizer featured it in the 60&#x27;s.<p>&gt; But the critical feature of FM synthesis that made it usable as a musical element was linear FM. Early synthesizers (like, I presume Buchla&#x27;s) sported &quot;FM&quot; but it was exponential due to volt&#x2F;oct.<p>No; the first Buchla oscillator, the 158, did indeed have linear FM.<p>And that was intentional.  Early Buchla synths didn&#x27;t have much going on in the filter department, so instead he made the oscillators extra expressive.')
