If I walk in to a store, I don&#x27;t have to be presented with a book on the stores terms of service, they all have the standard rights dictated by law (examples: can record video, can inspect bags, may refuse refunds for change of mind). Once you know the standard rules, every store is the same.<p>Now when you want to buy something on an online store, every single store has its own terms.')
