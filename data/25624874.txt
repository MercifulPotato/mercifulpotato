Some people would say that Box::new is &quot;implicit&quot; because you don&#x27;t see the malloc. Some might even say that malloc is implicit because you don&#x27;t see the sbrk&#x2F;memmap!<p>&gt; But in the context of learning, it is not such a strict win,<p>Yeah so it&#x27;s tricky! The thing is, without some way to jumpstart knowledge, people may never even learn in the first place. Like, by this argument, everyone should start with physics, because well, C compiles to asm complies to machine code which is actually just code for a chipset. There is no &quot;I know what everything is doing&quot; starting point. In reality, people jump in, start somewhere, and then expand what they know from there. This is true on every topic in every field. We still teach kids Newtonian physics even though on some level it&#x27;s &quot;wrong,&quot; you know?')
