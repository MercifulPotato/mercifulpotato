Those languages have an option to embrace it, like F# or Kotlin have, or to struggle against it, like Scala has, but they don&#x27;t have the option to truly pull free of it. Not without shutting out effortless interop with the rest of the platform, and, in doing so, undermining the whole purpose of being on those platforms in the first place. And, since most the interesting developments in programming languages center on type systems, that implies that huddling together on the Big Two bytecode VMs stifles a lot of really interesting innovation.')
