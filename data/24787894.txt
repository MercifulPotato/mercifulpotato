It appears Twitter&#x2F;FB simply assumed it must be hacking so they could use trigger their anti-doxxing policies, as otherwise they&#x27;d have had no policies to block it, as it&#x27;s clearly journalism. But if the NY Post are telling the truth then it&#x27;s actually FB&#x2F;Twitter spreading misinformation.<p>Very, very bad move by Twitter and Facebook. The partisan rule-bending is clear.')
