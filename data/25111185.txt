If you&#x27;re learning Japanese you should start with hiragana and never use romaji in your learning.<p>Hepburn is for international use of Japanese names, for visitors (who might not learn Japanese if they&#x27;re just doing a 2 weeks trip) and Japanese people abroad.<p>If you were Japanese in US (or Germany, or Russia), would you rather be Mr. Fujiwara from Kyushu or Mr. Huziwara from Kyusyu?
