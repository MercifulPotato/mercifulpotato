They&#x27;re the exceptions which prove the rule.<p>If you want to be a professional musician who works with other people rather than just doing their own thing, you need to know sheet music, especially within certain sub-domains like orchestral settings.<p>(To be fair, as someone who is on the periphery of the music business, the above is a simplification. I&#x27;m not trying to imply that the &quot;rock stars&quot; get to skate by, often they&#x27;re working harder than everyone else to be&#x2F;remain successful. But they are still exceptional in many respects. Your average person trying to make a living as a musician absolutely needs to know sheet music or at least it&#x27;s simpler cousin, the lead sheet, to be taken seriously.)')
