A badly repaired car could cause a 12 car pile up and kill 17 people because the breaks or power steering failed at the wrong time.<p>Yeah you can say it if your goal is to create some political fear-mongering radio advert for some inspection program ballot initiative, doesn&#x27;t make it true though.<p>There have been many studies about the efficacy of vehicle inspection programs.  The TL;DR of them is that while throwing up a bunch of red tape can keep junk off the road and this can affect the accident rate but the effect is negligible or near the noise threshold.  People in well maintained cars making bad decisions is the source of the overwhelming majority of accidents.  The brakes going out on some shitbox are basically a rounding error.  Salvage cars breaking for reasons having to do with whatever accident they were in is even rarer than that.')
