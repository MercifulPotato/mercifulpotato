Lower middle class, middle class and higher tilt Trump.<p>If you look at 2020 exit polls, people making under $50k and $50k up to $100k lean Biden, people making $100k and up lean Trump.<p>“Class” is more complicated, because within a socioeconomic class, income varies considerably by age. And Biden won younger voters (depending on the categories mused, up through 30-44 or 40-49), while Trump won older voters.<p>If you look at education, (which also varies a bit by age, but is tied to class and less age variable than income), Biden won every education level <i>except</i> No college degree (and if you combine white&#x2F;non-white with education level, he won every combination except whites with no college degree.)')
