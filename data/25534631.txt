AMZN has had historically low razor thin net profit margins. I don’t think it has ever been more than 5%.<p>Everything that is reinvested from the gross margins goes back into the economy for growth and jobs.<p>But with automation, it will not go up in the beginning but will eventually grow only when automation gains outstrips hiring costs.<p>I suspect Amazon has the capability to bring in more automation and cut existing jobs for increasing margins. They are just keeping the jobs on for now. There is no need for them to keep hiring like they do. A lot..not all..can be amenable to automation.<p>That’s just one example. I am sure it’s true for Uber and Airbnb and the like.')
