FB belongs (mostly) to Mark, his top execs, and his early investors. How can you possibly think that someone who owns something will always handle their property the way you wish?<p>This FB is the best FB there will ever be. If it was in the hands of the government, it is hard to see how it could have been better. If it was in the hands of the people, you cannot be sure it would have been better (see blockchain projects).<p>What will end up happening to these platforms will be what is happening with TV today: CNN - FOX.<p>People need to start to think 10,20 years from now, and begin to build new platforms for communication. Or just use group email.')
