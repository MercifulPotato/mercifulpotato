I believe that this election has been at least suspicious, with trucks loaded with ballots disappearing, hundreds of thousands of votes suddenly going for Biden, chain of custody broken in so many places, suspicious donations for electronic voting machinery.<p>To have a reasonable doubt is as respectable as not having it.')
