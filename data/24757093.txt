Item(by='shadowgovt', descendants=None, kids=[24757749], score=None, time=1602524571, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24756978, text='&gt; I&#x27;m guessing you would argue that this is immoral and harmful behavior<p>I do not. I argue that the public putting pressure on individuals who spread bad ideas to stop doing that---up to and including looping their employer in, up to and including the employer terminating that employment relationship---is part of the healthy public immune system to bad ideas and antisocial behavior. &quot;We live in a society&quot; and all that. The government is constrained from doing it because the machinery of government can be co-opted by tyrants, so people need the right to call tyrants what they are. Not because it&#x27;s the obligation of every individual to feed those who seek their destruction.<p>In US history, unpopular politicians used to have their houses torn down brick by brick by an angry mob and tossed in a river. We&#x27;ve come quite a long way in expressing disagreement in a civilized way, but there&#x27;s no expectation that someone should keep paying you money (or, in the concrete case of Facebook and what content they host, giving you an open &quot;billboard along the highway&quot; of their community communication service) so you can spend it on denying their history or their right to exist (or the history and right to exist of their customers).')
