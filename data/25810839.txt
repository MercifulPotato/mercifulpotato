IO operations at queue depth 1 are a direct measurement of latency.  Queue depth 1 is not about throughput at all.<p>&gt; Suppose the workload is light, at only 500 IOPS, which are &quot;small&quot; enough to service quickly.<p>I will assume the workload is light in CPU too, since spending half the time waiting for the disk is apparently not an instant disqualification.<p>&gt; So disk A is in fact actually 1000x faster, if you&#x27;re waiting on its result. Which, for single-threaded operations, you often are. If you&#x27;re instead optimizing for throughput, you don&#x27;t care.<p>If you&#x27;re waiting on a bunch of results and disk A gets them to you significantly faster, it sounds like your initial premise of &quot;only 500 IOPS&quot; was wrong or misleading.<p>If you have a response time you want to meet, then you should measure IOPS with a sliding window of that many milliseconds.  If it&#x27;s still 500 at most, then disk B will still be fine for meeting your target.<p>If it turns out that &quot;500&quot; actually comes in bursts of 50 operations, and you want to be done in 10 milliseconds, then you should label your workload as &quot;5k IOPS&quot;.  Put in a drive that does at least 10k and you&#x27;ll see all calculations done in under a frame; basically perfect latency.  A drive a million times faster would have no practical difference.')
