What comes next? Clearly there&#x27;s going to be a capabilities gap for a while, but now that it&#x27;s 60 years after its original design, what kind of design is going to replace it? Do we even need giant monolith dishes anymore?<p>Hoping a radio astronomer can chime in here. For example, I know out in New Mexico they have a distributed array of  dishes (literally called the &quot;Very Large Array&quot;, oh scientific creativity [0]) where, my understanding is, a bunch of computers stitch together all the individual signals and effectively get a resolution better than any single dish can. Is a design like that now state of the art, or does a monolithic design like Arecibo still give capabilities unique to single large dishes?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Very_Large_Array" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Very_Large_Array</a>')
