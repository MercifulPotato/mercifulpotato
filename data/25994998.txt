It&#x27;s actually irrelevant for two reasons.  First, the example under discussion was SQUARE which is not a CL builtin, and second, even if it was, you could just do this:<p>Just make your own package and do:<p>(in-package :my-package)<p>(defmethod square ((n number)) (* n n))<p>Now you can extend SQUARE to work on things other than numbers.  Or, to pick a more realistic example:<p>(defmethod sqrt ((n number)) (cl:sqrt n))')
