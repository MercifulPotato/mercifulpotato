Then there&#x27;s not always any past trauma to be resilient against?<p>Well, there is evidence for exposure therapy being effective for many disorders, including several that you mention. From this link above <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apa.org&#x2F;ptsd-guideline&#x2F;patients-and-families&#x2F;exposure-therapy#:~:text=The%20exposure%20to%20the%20feared,Panic%20Disorder" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apa.org&#x2F;ptsd-guideline&#x2F;patients-and-families&#x2F;exp...</a><p><pre><code>    Exposure therapy has been scientifically demonstrated to be a helpful treatment or treatment component for a range of problems, including:\n\n    Phobias\n\n    Panic Disorder\n\n    Social Anxiety Disorder\n\n    Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\n\n    Posttraumatic Stress Disorder\n\n    Generalized Anxiety Disorder\n</code></pre>\n&gt;&gt;This data can in some cases get them fired from a job, or bullied, and more,<p>Yes that is true. However, there is presumably nothing illegal admitted in these therapy sessions, and I think termination of employment for what was said within one would be grounds for a wrongful termination suit. Being bullied, hated, etc is a different matter, but I think is something that someone is better able to withstand with the right mindset than losing a job.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting that the damage from this disclosure can be neutralized completely, by any stretch of the imagination. Just that it can perhaps be blunted with these kinds of reassurances that the victims can in fact survive this.')
