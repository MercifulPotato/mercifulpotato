The M1 is great if you do web development with NodeJS style tools or Apple App Store development but don&#x27;t need to run an x86 Windows VM to see exactly how Windows browsers render your site: Windows browsers which run on 90%+ of this planet&#x27;s desktops, important corporate customer desktops in particular.<p>The M1 is not so great if:<p>- You want to develop real-time raytracing. The M1 using the Metal API does 3.6 FPS (20.1 million rays per second) while the RTX 2070 does 135.5 FPS (757 megarays&#x2F;sec) on one benchmark:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.willusher.io&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;20&#x2F;rt-dive-m1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.willusher.io&#x2F;graphics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;20&#x2F;rt-dive-m1</a><p>- You need reliable ECC memory and&#x2F;or a corruption resistant filesystem like ZFS&#x2F;BTRFS&#x2F;ReFS. (You can get ECC on serious Thinkpads (X1&#x2F;P15&#x2F;P17), Dells, and HPs designed for science and engineering, and also RTX graphics, Cuda machine learning, etc., and run both Windows and Linux.)<p>- You need hi-performance x86 Linux VMs to compile and test your production back-end code locally on your device.<p>- You need a multidisk RAID drive configuration (available in laptops above mentioned) which allows you to keep working if one disk fails.<p>- You need to be able to quickly and inexpensively field-service&#x2F;replace a failed disk drive, bad memory stick, broken screen, or damaged keyboard.<p>- You need to be able to quickly swap an old battery for a fresh one. (I replaced the battery in my MacBook Pro when it swelled up and almost cracked the trackpad glass; I had to use acetone nail polish remover to release the adhesive Apple uses to glue the battery into the case. Apple uses glue for everything these days and opposes right-to-repair legislation.)<p>- You need to be able to use portable graphics APIs such as Vulkan.<p>- You need to run industry standard CAD&#x2F;CAM applications performantly and cost effectively.<p>- You want to develop VR applications.<p>- You want to run an 8K display. If you see a 280dpi Dell 8K next to a ~220dpi Apple 5K&#x2F;6K you see there is no comparison. The Apple &quot;retina&quot; renders font edges softer than print.<p>- You need a device your device vendor allows you to configure to not phone home to said device vendor&#x27;s servers. If you buy Windows Enterprise or Red Hat Enterprise or Ubuntu this level of privacy is officially supported. Apple aggressively markets itself as pro-privacy but does not offer this: your M1 will be sending quite a few packets to Apple-owned IP ranges.<p>- You need a device you can constructively criticize on internet forums when it doesn&#x27;t work well for doing anything other than desktop-and-mobile Webkit webdev and Apple App Store development. If you ever need to share your frustration with your M1 on Reddit or HN you risk instant downvoting.')
