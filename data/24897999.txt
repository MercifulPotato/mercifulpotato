If one actually works their way through the text, by the end they will have written a basic interpreter for the lambda calculus, and a small tactics oriented theorem prover, either one of which is highly illuminating to someone who hasn&#x27;t done this before. The text may not educate a reader on dependent type theory or similar developments but I&#x27;m struggling to understand how it is otherwise &quot;dated&quot;.  \nOther than that thank you for keeping SML in front of people, I for one appreciate it, its probably my favorite language these days')
