Normally the antibodies&#x2F;T-cells would  attack the myelin coating of nerves and the brain but with the protein being abundantly available anywhere the immune cells are &quot;kept occupied&quot; and leave nerves and brain alone.<p>If this treatment works as I understand, you would need continuous refreshers each time the mRNA injection is depleted.')
