And by far I think people that work on the so called Human Interface Guidelines need to get off whatever ideology&#x2F;belief they fed themselves for the desktop environment to finally, you know, grow for actual humans rather than their egos. At times it feels more like a cred, like when elementary OS was released I read so many comments on how Apple nailed the UI.<p>From the site: \n&gt;If you use GNOME and this is a revelation to you, it’s because you’re used to mediocrity. If you think your experience all this time was normal, you’re completely mistaken—and it’s not least because you’re using a specific desktop environment that’s available only on Free operating systems that account for only a fraction of a percent of desktop computer usage anyways.<p>I like the author just sarcastically points it out, because I remember reading years ago the same on both GNOME and elementary OS subreddits &quot;it&#x27;s because people are used to mediocrity&quot;. Or, you know, maybe people find it super helpful to being able to see the images without extra steps so they can choose whatever they want.<p>And then it all just spirals down into:<p>&quot;Have you tried X&#x2F;Y&#x2F;Z?&quot; no? Sucks for you buddy I guess you are stuck with mediocre people making design decisions. But as crud as I put it, I might not be wrong.<p>That said, I have completely given up on all the nonsense someone would have to follow to file a enhancement report and discuss it just to be stuck on discussion for 10 years. There&#x27;s just no time and energy for that, and at the end people would just ditch the desktop environment because it&#x27;s just too much of a hassle to use.')
