Since when does a Hyundai car, Windows computers or Seiko watches have ads? Those are not the categories of things where ads are tolerated.<p>That&#x27;s not what the previous commenter was talking about at all.<p>Some platforms and services have been selling &quot;no ads&quot; as a feature. Say Apple or YouTube Premium or 100s of 1000s of applications on Android. This does not mean they&#x27;ll never open up to ads in the future. Maybe a future &quot;premium value&quot; will just be &quot;fewer ads&quot;. And when they do, they&#x27;re more likely to generate sales because they&#x27;re customers who are already paying for premium services.')
