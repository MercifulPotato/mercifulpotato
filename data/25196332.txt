To use Dreher&#x27;s rhetorical standards, that&#x27;s just who he is, I suppose.<p>For the people who aren&#x27;t as quick to catch on to the substance of the topic: personally I&#x27;d strongly agree that there are moral issues with <i>any</i> execution, and the execution of children more so. But there&#x27;s also moral issues with monarchy, and what&#x27;s <i>your</i> plan for putting a decisive end to one with the cultural momentum of hundreds of years behind it? If you&#x27;re an American, the plan of those who birthed the present order sure involved violence and we&#x27;ve got a culture which doesn&#x27;t merely ruefully acknowledge its necessity but actively <i>celebrates</i> revolution with quotes about the tree of liberty being watered with blood echoing in discourse down to the present moment. If folks like Dreher are going to be horrified at Sunkara&#x27;s acceptance of violence, they should at least have the decency to be sobered by its acceptance at the foundations of their own culture.<p>But then again, that&#x27;d require the same higher level of thinking he failed to do in his coronavirus rantings earlier this year.<p>I don&#x27;t know why he&#x27;s some kind of big name in Christian thinking circles; as far as I can tell, there is nothing in any of the writing I&#x27;ve been exposed to that is remarkable for <i>either</i> its Christian or intellectual character, and his status on that front likely exists far more out of the desire for conservatives &amp; Christians to tell themselves the story of how they have their thinkers rather than any serious interest in the work of either discipleship or philosophy.<p>If he dislikes Sunkara, then Sunkara has my favor to lose on that basis <i>alone</i>.')
