Item(by='asicsp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602144639, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24716568, text='You can get invited via <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lobste.rs&#x2F;chat" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lobste.rs&#x2F;chat</a> which is what I did. Since most users on chat are US based, requesting for an invite during that timezone would be the best. I was asked for proof via GitHub&#x2F;twitter (there&#x27;s probably more options) and then I got a mail with the invite link.')
