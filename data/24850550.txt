Responsible people still make errors; they just take steps to minimize the risk of an error when there&#x27;s something important they need to do. When parents forget to pick their child up from school (and I have family in education who assure me this is a common problem), the kinds of errors described in the paper hardly excuse it. Certainly nobody would say the parents are <i>victims</i> because the school didn&#x27;t properly remind them!<p>I think we all agree that&#x27;s a separate question from what achieves the best outcomes as a matter of social policy.')
