It&#x27;s more about how clean the approach is if you have all your configs in a yaml file and you can change things very easily&#x2F;quickly and rerun an experiment. I&#x27;m working with data &amp; ML models everyday and it became overwhelming when my codebase is large and I want to change small things and re-run an experiment. Also It would be great to not lose much time writing that code in the first place (although it&#x27;s easy to do), if you want a quick and dirty draft. The thing is, it is much cleaner if you have your preprocessing methods and model definition in one file. However, there are other features that will be integrated soon, like a simple gui built in python')
