I think they&#x27;re all great.<p>For the sake of argument, I&#x27;ll try to keep this about Tokyo, but a key observation of mine is that _all_ of Japan is like this.<p>Objectively, Tokyo has the lowest pollution. Singapore is close, on average, but it can have awful week-long spikes. Tokyo has the lowest crime rate. Again, Singapore is basically the same, but it does have a high incarceration rate. Japan has the lowest income inequality gap (couldn&#x27;t find Tokyo-specific statistics). Japan has the highest life expectancy and the lowest infant mortality rate (tied with Singapore re infant mortality). Japan also has the highest rate of people who completed tertiary education.<p>Pollution and income inequality are, for me, major indicators. Income equality benefits everyone; and, as much as I love Singapore (I really do), it&#x27;s hard for me to consider it an ideal future city because of this (and the inequality has a racial aspect which, I think, is the source of its persistence).<p>The lockdown highlighted the worst in every country. Both China and Singapore had clear failings (and successes).<p>I guess we&#x27;re measuring &quot;future&quot; differently. Technology vs [e]quality of life.')
