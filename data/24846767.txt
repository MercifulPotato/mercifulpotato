So there&#x27;s a basic logic flaw.\nAlso, quite a large number of people have been put on ventilators due to covid-19, not &quot;almost nobody&quot;. That&#x27;s just an incorrect assertion.\nYou&#x27;d like to attribute the downvoting to politics, but given the quality issues, I think that&#x27;s a hard claim to support.')
