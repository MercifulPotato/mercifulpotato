Item(by='richardkmichael', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608225498, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25454207, text='Having an extensive background in *nix and network systems through the 90s and early 2000s, image maintenance is the main reason I have avoided docker until recently (just not having time to investigate).  One major reason to pay an OS vendor (e.g. RHEL) is to &quot;outsource&quot; security and systems-integration testing, so that ops people can simply &quot;update&quot; (the entire dep-tree of the distribution).  I don&#x27;t want to bring all that effort in-house, especially if I&#x27;m still paying for a vendor service contract.  That said, I agree security and deployment can be eased by any form of &quot;container&quot; (in numerous OSes) because ops people can black-box the software while managing resource allocation, etc.<p>How are people handling container maintenance?<p>For example, I could imagine modifying SRPM spec files to also build a container (possibly even statically linked binaries inside).  Then I can vendor update, and rebuild all the containers I need from SRPM; not much more complicated than `rpmbuild postgressql`, and re-deploy the emitted postgres container.')
