They went in the lab, built and simulated everything to find that the penalty of extra decoding has an upper bound of a few percent perf&#x2F;Watt max once you are out of the embedded space.<p>OTOH, apple is doing some interesting things optimizing their software stack to the store [without release] reordering that ARM does. These sorts of things are where long term advantage lies. Nobody is ever ahead in the CPU wars by some insurmountable margin in strict hardware terms.<p>System performance is what counts. Apple has weakish support for games, for example, so any hardware advantage they have in a vacuum is moot in that domain.<p>Integrated system performance and total cost of ownership are what matters.')
