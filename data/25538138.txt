My own way of working involves files in folders and old versions of anything are overwritten or deleted. If they still exist it indicate an unfinished job. I don&#x27;t keep draft versions of letters and emails either.<p>I would love to collaborate but when I start looking into git the amount of stuff I don&#x27;t fully understand keeps growing.
