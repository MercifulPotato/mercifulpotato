No sense of irony in claiming that a <i>counterargument</i> is the slippery slope fallacy?<p>And the point I&#x27;m making isn&#x27;t that you would eject all communists and capitalists in practice, it&#x27;s that you would have to do so in a consistent application of that principle. It&#x27;s a reductio ad absurdum. You can take anything and find a tenuous connection from there to something terrible, so arguing that we have to ban the anything because allowing it would enable an influx of people connected to the something terrible is ridiculous. Applied as a consistent principle it would require you to ban everything.')
