Even if we assume the entire $1.85b all in bitcoin though, the tripled price only takes you to ~6b. And they&#x27;ve apparently now put out 8x as many tether, which means they (if I understand correctly) claim to have 8x as much cash&#x2F;assets on hand. I don&#x27;t understand how Bitcoin holdings would cover that increase, and I even less understand how anything they could claim was cash could.<p>To be honest I just don&#x27;t get the model, which is why I&#x27;m not making any claims or trying to follow it to a logical conclusion. I just don&#x27;t get why they can&#x27;t prove they hold ~$20b in ~cash if the entire point of tether is that they do so.')
