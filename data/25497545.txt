I am always in Org mode which lets you do &quot;literate&quot; programming as well. I think NoteCalc is a little more streamlined, but I am very used to throwing a little Python or elisp into my notes when I need to do math. Great to see more options on this front. Org-babel is a nice package, though it does have some limitations.')
