Item(by='sebmellen', descendants=None, kids=[24668159], score=None, time=1601669308, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24665197, text='&gt; <i>the old Tibetan Buddhist story of a master who was able to fit a large animal (a yak maybe?) into his shoe, without the Yak getting smaller or his shoe getting bigger</i><p>This reminds me of something I once experienced on truffles (the kinds sold in Amsterdam smartshops), but I experienced only mentally. I had this vivid fractal &quot;dream&quot;, if you will, of all of reality condensing into a point not dissimilar to the Mandelbrot fractal. When I looked at it, I realized the edges were the limits of human knowledge (or something like that).<p>But I could go further down or further up, and I realized that I was actually holding this entire fractal in my head, so I could explore any part of it, which meant I had access to all knowledge already.<p>I realized afterwards that Plato must have experienced the same, promoting his quote that &quot;all learning is remembering&quot;.<p>I also had an experience on 5-MeO-MiPT, when I was tripping and went to get acupuncture. I went to the bathroom before the session started, and somehow I managed to fit into the bathroom despite being so large I could barely get in the door. Very similar to Alice in Wonderland.<p>I wonder how this size distortion happens, because when I experienced it, it felt so absolutely real.')
