I&#x27;m an Indian H1-B guy working on an MVP with a green card holder here in California.\nI&#x27;m working for an employer right now, but really willing to jump on my project full time if it shows promise. We&#x27;re not going to make any income from it until we raise money from VC&#x27;s so I assume it is safe to keep doing this?<p>Also, when the time comes, how do you suggest that I jump on it?<p>There are a few options I have:<p>- Found a company but be a salaried person on payroll, along with a risk of being &quot;fireable&quot;<p>- Go with &quot;Unshackled&quot;, who would take care of everything for me. Are there any drawbacks with this method that you foresee?<p>- I also have an option to move on to H4 EAD, but I&#x27;m worried because of the flaky nature of this status.<p>Can you provide some thoughts on these and weigh in on the different gotchas and pros&#x2F;cons involved?<p>Thanks a ton!')
