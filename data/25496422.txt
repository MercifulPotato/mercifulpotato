To learn it in a deep way you need to use it properly, on real problems.<p>Although, if you&#x27;re mainly interested in <i>getting something done</i> rather than using it as a learning experience, using an unfamiliar language is probably a bad idea. You&#x27;ll learn a lot about a new language, but you probably won&#x27;t build anything you could actually ship.')
