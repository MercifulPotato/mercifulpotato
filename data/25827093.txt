The main point of HTTPS-only is to make the attacks significantly harder and more costly to execute and easier to detect when they do happen. We cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Are <i>you</i> comfortable with ISPs injecting ads into your blog? [1][2]<p>&gt; FWIW, my phone is 10 years old.<p>I&#x27;m curious, which phone is this and what do you use it for?<p>The oldest phones I keep in somewhat regular use are a Moto X (8 years old) and a Moto E (6 years old) which I maintain service on using free service providers (which require I use their service at least once each month or my service will be discontinued). When I turn those phones on each month to place a call with them, they take at least an hour to download and install app updates before I can even start using them. On the Moto E I&#x27;ve had to uninstall most apps because the internal storage has been nearly exhausted just by installing the latest updates for the bundled apps. On both phones even just bringing up the keyboard after I select a text field takes multiple seconds and any kind of multitasking is out of the question. I could not imagine trying to use either of those phones on a daily basis.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;tech-policy&#x2F;2013&#x2F;04&#x2F;how-a-banner-ad-for-hs-ok&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;tech-policy&#x2F;2013&#x2F;04&#x2F;how-a-banner-ad-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;india&#x2F;comments&#x2F;8ry1k4&#x2F;does_your_isp_inject_malware_ads_in_the_websites&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;india&#x2F;comments&#x2F;8ry1k4&#x2F;does_your_isp...</a>')
