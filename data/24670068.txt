(And if a standalone Signal app were available for the Apple Watch with LTE, that might push me over the edge to switching.)<p>But for now, Apple lags far behind Garmin in terms of fitness tracking for outdoor activities. That&#x27;s more important to me, and it&#x27;s more important to people like marathon runners who are more serious athletes than me. But we&#x27;re also probably a minority of the market; I don&#x27;t doubt Apple knows what they&#x27;re doing here.<p>A modern smartphone can do anything that a 90s pocket organizer could do and more. But Apple Watch still hasn&#x27;t caught up to Garmin in many important respects.')
