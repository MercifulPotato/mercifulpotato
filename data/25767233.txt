There&#x27;s no reason your SD card has to consist of anything more than u-boot.<p>SD is fantastically simple, so that the boot rom can get at a bootloader without much effort (generally the bootrom just looks at a memory offset on the mmc device). Once you start speaking newer faster protocols, this simplicity is lost. You&#x27;re not likely going to find a bootrom that implements all the bits needed to get u-boot from a sata device.<p>In a perfect world, once these are no longer developer devices, the mmc would be replaced with some spi flash (or even an emmc) with just u-boot.<p>On 90% of embedded dev systems, you&#x27;re better off thinking of the sd card as a &quot;bios chip&quot; then a hard drive. The fact you can also use it as a block device to store a rw filesystem is almost incidental, and should probably be avoided.')
