So the words are from the 1840s. Frankly a bunch of the concepts are even older than that. And yet other concepts that are still pretty useful--geometry, say--are even older. We don&#x27;t need to re-invent language every decade, and thank God for that. No inherent virtue in novelty.<p>---<p>It&#x27;s easier to start a software company now. No one will dispute this. But there is more to the world economy than SaaS entrepreneurship. Covid has provided us with a great unwanted, illustrative example here: capitalist production still works basically the same way in 2021 as it did in 1848. Some of our supply chains are extremely fragile now though, in part due to their computerization and &quot;rationalization&quot; over the last decades.<p>Suddenly we need thousands of masks and ventilators and they&#x27;re nowhere to be found. What the hell happened!? Perhaps we just didn&#x27;t have enough PPE SaaSes yet?<p>Now we have a few different vaccines (which is great!) but we&#x27;re having trouble producing and distributing them fast enough in high enough quantities. There is a NYT article out today on this very problem that did well on HN.<p>How could our economy which is, on paper at least, vastly more productive than it was 50 or 100 years ago, fail us so badly? I mean look how many SaaS entrepreneurs we have! Look how low the barriers to entry are!<p>The point I&#x27;m trying to make here is that the basic relations of capitalist economy still hold despite all the changes between the 19th century and now, including any new developments in centralization of tech infrastructure (you can call cloud computing &quot;democratizing&quot; if you want, but it&#x27;s really centralization). It&#x27;s just easier and cheaper to become a small capitalist by renting some of the means of production (it&#x27;s still MoP, still has the same economic function, even though the centuries have changed) from big capitalists. So what. If you&#x27;re not a SaaS entrepreneur (and I keep saying this: not everyone can be) and you want a say in the workplace, you still need a union.<p>But again, the demand for SaaSes and SaaS entrepreneurs is, well, shockingly high, at least to me, as it turns out, but it&#x27;s not infinity. If everyone could just become a SaaS entrepreneur and we didn&#x27;t ever need any normal industries with normal employees anymore, you might have a point. But in the real world people still have jobs and still need unions to bargain with employers that would always rather pay them less and give them less say.<p>I agree with you that SaaS entrepreneurs are not the dispossessed masses. If I have seemed to make that argument at any point, I regret the error.')
