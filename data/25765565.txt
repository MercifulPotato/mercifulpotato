Item(by='troydavis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610560411, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25763717, text='&gt; I&#x27;m guessing they bank on a small % of &quot;whale&quot; consumers using all their allowance and everyone else being way under the limit<p>For a £7.99&#x2F;month plan, the cost of goods sold (COGS) on the actual storage and bandwidth is probably about 33% of that -- and that&#x27;s based on average usage.<p>Here&#x27;s a longer explanation with citations that I wrote in 2018: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16465883#16470633" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16465883#16470633</a>. I haven&#x27;t looked at their annual reports since then, but the COGS could have easily dropped by 50% in that time, so it might be way less than 33%.<p>Just based on that 2018 data, the other £5 or so is customer acquisition cost, software development, support, administration, and everything else.<p>The COGS is a small enough part of the price that, even if they could remove a lot of it (by reducing usage and&#x2F;or the cap), the absolute cost reduction might be 10% or 20% of the current price.<p>This is true for the smaller plans of almost all SaaS. The vendor&#x27;s variable COGS are not what you&#x27;re paying for. (Exception: cloud services with entirely usage-based pricing and no monthly minimum, like S3. Those are rare.)')
