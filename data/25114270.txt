If you are saying top 1% of people who actually play basketball regularly, I think you are wrong... he isn&#x27;t going to be better than any one who plays highschool level or better, and will be average at best on an adult rec-league team.<p>I would certainly not call someone who is only top 1% in of the general population great... 1% of the world&#x27;s population is 70 million people... there are an estimated 27 million or so software developers, so more than half of the top 1% of software developers in the world don&#x27;t even write software. I would hardly call them great.')
