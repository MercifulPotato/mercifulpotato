When I&#x27;m interviewing, potential is what I weight most in a candidate.<p>Amazon has the most well known example:<p>&gt;When Amazon launched the hiring plan for tech job candidates in 1999, it was called the ‘barkeeper programme’. But that name implied maintaining a hiring standard, when actually the programme is about raising the standard with each hire. Every person hired should be better than 50 percent of those currently in similar roles.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.aboutamazon.eu&#x2F;working-at-amazon&#x2F;what-is-a-bar-raiser-at-amazon" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.aboutamazon.eu&#x2F;working-at-amazon&#x2F;what-is-a-bar-...</a><p>But that&#x27;s pretty standard across the FANGs and trickles down into other tech companies.  They&#x27;re not interested in the 20% performer that might turn into a 50%+ one.  They expect you to go work somewhere else, develop into that 50%+ programmer, and try again.<p>&gt;Not to be an ass, but are you sure you are showing the potential you think you are?<p>Yes, I&#x27;m sure because I received positive feedback on a couple rounds before bombing out.  I (according to them) did well on 3&#x2F;4 coding challenges, terribly on the 4th, and bombed the system design.  They chose to give more weight to that 4th test and the system design than the 3 good performances.  And they&#x27;re sitting on 200 open engineering roles for a not that big company.')
