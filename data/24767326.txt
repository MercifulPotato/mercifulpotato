It&#x27;s more like learning Greek and hearing many of the same root words, sounds, etymology, etc. in English.<p>An Italian speaker can listen to Latin and grok maybe 25%. A Japanese speaker can listen to Chinese and get maybe 2%, max.<p>Words like &quot;library&quot; use the same Chinese letters, and have very similar pronunciations, but that&#x27;s about the extent.<p>I&#x27;d say the best way to learn would be Japanese, Korean, then Chinese (what I did).<p>Source: I speak Japanese, Korean, and Chinese.')
