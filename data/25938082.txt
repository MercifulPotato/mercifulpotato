Melvin Capital clearly messed up - their losses exceed any reasonable risk-managed short position and it&#x27;s clear there was some naked shorting in there because you cannot lost 30% of your fund in a week unless you&#x27;re being reckless.<p>The media - in classic post-Trumpian mentality - is just fabricating a reality about market insurrections, how male traders are incels, or how Trumpism has spread into the market.  The reality is we&#x27;re witnessing another classic short squeeze between fund managers - and sure - retail got in on this one too, but they are at best a spark, rather than the gun powder.')
