I made some content for y&#x27;all. But if a scraper comes through and builds a social profile of me, it should compensated or controllable in some form.<p>I wasn&#x27;t selling this data, but it&#x27;s not really anyone else&#x27;s data to sell either. Even if ycomb decides they are going to sell this information, I&#x27;d like to know that.<p>IDK what the solution is. It&#x27;s probably reclaiming ownership via private servers. It&#x27;s probably grand trust and code contracts. It&#x27;s probably even a mandated anonymity filter where PII is opt-in by default and only a certain degree of information can be traded.<p>I am just under the impression that there has been a massive overreach and that the majority of people online have lost control.')
