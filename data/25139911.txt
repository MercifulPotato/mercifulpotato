Item(by='GordonS', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605722004, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25139793, text='&gt; It is entirely possible, without any dissonance whatsoever, to respect the autonomy and wonder of human life and the rights of people with disabilities, while also understanding that having children with debilitating permanent disabilities can be a heartbreaking exercise that drains you emotionally, mentally, and physically. Nobody reasonable wishes for their child to suffer from such a disability<p>I have a daughter with Down&#x27;s, and I agree with what you&#x27;ve said here. I love my daughter and would lay down my life for her in an instant, but of course that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;d glad she has Down&#x27;s and all the related health issues that can go with it.<p>&gt; On the flip side, all of them required life-long assistance and care, never able to function completely independently, and lacking in almost all other meaningful quality of life factors.<p>This paragraph did surprise me though. Attitudes towards Down&#x27;s have changed a lot in the past couple of decades, and at least in most of Europe, it&#x27;s not uncommon for children with Down&#x27;s to get a mainstream education and in adulthood for many to live (<i>largely</i>) independently. The level of intellectual impairment and physical and mental illnesses does vary a lot however, and undoubtedly some people will need life-long care regardless of the opportunities available to them.')
