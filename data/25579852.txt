Iâ€™m not 100% sure, though.<p>There is a study[0] showing cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and other human tissues, thus predisposing the host to autoimmune diseases. This should apply even more so to any vaccine since vaccines produce a more robust immune response.<p>Phase 2&#x2F;3 of Pfizer-BioNTech did, however, include people with autoimmune diseases [1]. Other vaccine trials did not, as far as I am aware. This does not really shine a light on pre-disposition to an autoimmune disease 6-9-12 mo down the road.<p>Reading this comment again before I post made me realize it sounds very gloomy, so I feel obliged to say I&#x27;ll be getting whatever vaccine I can get my hands on at the soonest possible date.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7246018&#x2F;#__ffn_sectitle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7246018&#x2F;#__ffn_...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;media&#x2F;144245&#x2F;download" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;media&#x2F;144245&#x2F;download</a>')
