I think you can still have privacy and help businesses succeed. Imagine if FB were more privacy conscious (might reduce their annual turn over a little but i dont think detrimentally), worked with apple to product a product and tech that preserved privacy while allowing advertising to continue.<p>It can happen, FB just doesntt want to for either $$$ or for loss of control.')
