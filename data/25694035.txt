All developers agree to these terms and we have reminded Parler of this clear policy in recent months. We&#x27;re aware of continued posting in the Parler app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the U.S. We recognize that there can be reasonable debate about content policies and that it can be difficult for apps to immediately remove all violative content, but for us to distribute an app through Google Play we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content. In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app&#x27;s listings from the Play Store until it addresses these issues.&quot; Google Spokesperson<p>edit: axios attributes the statement** to José Castañeda<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;viaCristiano&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347705178699558912" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;viaCristiano&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347705178699558912</a><p>** <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.axios.com&#x2F;capitol-mob-parler-google-ban-826d808d-3e06-4468-a7c6-6157557818b3.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.axios.com&#x2F;capitol-mob-parler-google-ban-826d808d...</a>')
