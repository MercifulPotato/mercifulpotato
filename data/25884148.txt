On a personal level, I completely agree with you.  Facebook is a giant waste of time for the typical user and a big +1 for your life if you ditch it.  For many business, however, it&#x27;s critical.  My local Snap-on Tools dealer uses it to announce where his truck will be each day and what tools and equipment he&#x27;s running on special.  He hates Facebook but told me the other day that he conducted almost a million dollars in business using the platform in 2020.  Sure, he could kill it or switch to MeWe, but that would significantly hurt his exposure to his customers, who use it regularly.')
