I&#x27;m just going to use Vim. Hell, I even abandoned my 20 year old config just to go use SpaceVim because of how great the community is.<p>If I want an IDE that is designed for a specific language? I use IntelliJ for Java&#x2F;Kotlin projects, Visual Studio for C#, and nothing else really <i>needs</i> an IDE (as in, IntelliJ&#x27;s siblings based on the same core IDE? I don&#x27;t really benefit from them).<p>Where I see VSCode being used the most? Among non-programmers, programmers of beginner languages (Python, Javascript, et al), or among younger programmers that haven&#x27;t taken the time to learn more ergonomic editors.<p>I also see it being used among some C&#x2F;C++ and C# programmers... but I don&#x27;t get the point, VSCode doesn&#x27;t even really understand a lot of IDE concepts, for example: it doesn&#x27;t understand the difference between a workspace and a project, yet gives people the obvious footgun of multi-root projects in the form of a workspace-by-name-but-not-by-concept.<p>I tried VSCode for like three days, and seriously cannot understand the draw of it for its advertised purpose (Visual Studio Lite), when its really just a code-oriented text editor, and Vim will always be more ergonomic for that purpose (assuming, of course, you&#x27;re willing to learn <i>how</i> to be ergonomic).<p>Edit: Also, a lot of VSCode and Atom fans bring up LSPs: I can use those from Vim.')
