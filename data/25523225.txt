Some types of sophistication won’t make you enjoy the object more, they’ll make you enjoy it less. For example, wine snobs don’t enjoy wine twice as much as you, they’re more keenly aware of how most wine isn’t good enough. Avoid sophistication that diminishes your enjoyment.<p>I&#x27;m not a wine snob, but I might be a food snob, in the sense that I&#x27;m &quot;more keenly aware of how [most mass-market food] isn&#x27;t good enough&quot;. But in response I usually cook my own food most of the time and go to a decent restaurant once a week and a &quot;nice&quot; restaurant once a month. &quot;Sophistication&quot; increases my enjoyment of the &quot;nice&quot; restaurant -- it&#x27;s like cultivating a hobby at level n and then seeing somebody do it at level n+3, I appreciate it more and can even experience surprise, wonder, curiosity, etc. So I think in this case this kind of &quot;sophistication&quot; makes me happier.')
