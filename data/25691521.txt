They correctly prioritized evacuating the people.<p>This is all true but might be crediting the Capitol Police leadership with a little more coordination and planning than they truly exhibited. There were clearly some law enforcement officers who did not simply step aside and let the rioters have their way once lawmakers had been evacuated.<p>Based on some of the comments here I get the feeling it&#x27;s not common knowledge yet that at least one involved law enforcement officer has died [1] and a couple of dozen were injured. Possibly they could have done better for themselves if they&#x27;d all been as easygoing about things as the officers photographed in the rotunda.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;public-safety&#x2F;brian-sicknick-capitol-police-officer-dies&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;08&#x2F;5552e036-51bc-11eb-83e3-322644d82356_story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;public-safety&#x2F;brian-sic...</a>')
