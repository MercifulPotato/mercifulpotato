The power is in numbers.<p>That may be so, but laying off those 10 could be a strategy to kill the union in the crib by keeping the number from ever getting to the thousands.  Employees faced with future unionization votes may vote against the union <i>because they&#x27;re afraid management will find a way to lay them all off if they vote for it</i>, before they&#x27;re strong enough to resist.')
