We are the only example of &quot;human level or greater&quot; intelligent life we know of, so we assign &quot;human like&quot; needs and wants to these hypothesized aliens because it&#x27;s all we have. I think the key thing is just to remember that this <i>is</i> just a heuristic and not to be overly rigid about it. Your point, IMO, absolutely stands that there is no particular reason to assume that &quot;aliens&quot; <i>must</i> be similar to us in this regard.')
