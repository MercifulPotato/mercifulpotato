Our business depends on it and Google has proven to be reliable partner. We pay ~400&#x2F;month for a support package and have always been able to get someone on the phone.<p>The only time we&#x27;ve ever really needed it was when one of our customer&#x27;s (satellite) IPs was once flagged incorrectly as originating from Cuba and blocked because of sanctions. We reached an engineer via phone support and they were able to get the Google team responsible for their Geo IP database to correct the entry.<p>We&#x27;ve also had support engineers based locally call us to check in periodically, and I doubt we are in the top 10% of their customers by spend.<p>Definitely would recommend GCP without reservation.')
