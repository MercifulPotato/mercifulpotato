Item(by='vladvasiliu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611487780, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25890928, text='Here in France there is no such thing as &quot;race&quot; or &quot;color&quot; or &quot;ethnicity&quot; from the State&#x27;s point of view. The census doesn&#x27;t ask anything related to race &#x2F; color &#x2F; ethnicity. As far as the state is concerned, you&#x27;re either a French citizen or a foreigner.<p>However, during 2020, there were a few cases of alleged [0] police brutality towards &quot;minorities&quot;. This has opened a wider debate over the place of minorities in the French society which, of courses, started to talk about racism. There was a clear attempt by some parties to bring up arguments which seemed directly taken from US events, in particular related to the George Floyd case. Of course, those arguments were met with the &quot;France doesn&#x27;t see race, so there can&#x27;t be racism&quot; argument.<p>Now I haven&#x27;t followed those debates particularly closely, but from my (admittedly superficial) point of view, it&#x27;s pretty hard to say that something is happening to a particular class of people because of who they are without acknowledging that that is, indeed, a class. In practical terms, how can you acknowledge that &quot;black people are discriminated against if there are no black people&quot;?<p>My point is that it&#x27;s way more difficult to talk about things you can&#x27;t measure. This slides into &quot;I feel that&quot;, which doesn&#x27;t really allow to know whether progress is being made.<p>---<p>[0] I say &quot;alleged&quot; because I haven&#x27;t followed closely those cases so I don&#x27;t know what the investigations concluded.')
