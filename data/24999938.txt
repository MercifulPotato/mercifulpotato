But when it comes to absolute same experience on cross-platform is the only programming language so far.<p>The problem is that if we&#x27;re talking about UIs, then Java is only cross-platform for the platforms you care about.<p>From a UI perspective, JRandom app using Swing won&#x27;t work as expected on an Android phone. That&#x27;s not &quot;absolute same experience on cross-platform&quot;. That&#x27;s instead a portability problem that you must solve explicitly by adapting your codebase to support two different UI frameworks or planning ahead for every possible porting target.')
