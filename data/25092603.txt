And they&#x27;re not preloaded hours&#x2F;days in advance -- it&#x27;s a UX pattern to load them a <i>tap</i> before.<p>So that part of the suit looks like it will fall apart. As for sending telemetry, it&#x27;s $1&#x2F;month in data assuming you <i>never</i> use Wi-Fi. Doesn&#x27;t seem like a particularly unreasonable cost. Especially considering most people spend the majority of their time at work&#x2F;home with Wi-Fi which means the real number is more probably more like $0.25&#x2F;mo.<p>I think a reasonable person assumes any commercial OS is checking for push notifications, syncing info (like weather), communicating analytics, checking for updates, etc. in the background. The only question is whether it&#x27;s unreasonably excessive, which in this case appears not to be. (Really the only main thing is that a device shouldn&#x27;t download multi-gigabyte OS updates without asking first.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blog.google&#x2F;products&#x2F;admob&#x2F;preloading-interstitial-ads" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blog.google&#x2F;products&#x2F;admob&#x2F;preloading-interstiti...</a>')
