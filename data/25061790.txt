Item(by='resonantjacket5', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605122210, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25061582, text='McKinsey is a management consulting company <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mckinsey.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mckinsey.com&#x2F;</a> which is famous (or infamous) for promoting highly &#x27;streamlined&#x27; business practices. They&#x27;re known for turning around failing businesses into profitable ones but also for the enron and 2008 scandals with the housing bubble. Though I&#x27;m not too familiar with exactly what &#x27;McKinsey&#x27; would imply, it seems to just be a shorthand for whenever a business starts charging for something that was previously free. Aka luggage fees.')
