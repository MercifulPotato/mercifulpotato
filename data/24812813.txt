Apologies. It should be her.<p>To the content of the article. This is what the author describes as the scenario to be avoided:<p>&gt; Your choice becomes limited to employers who want a cog in the big machine while your career will fade into a 9-5 job.<p>As if this is per se a bad thing. As I said, if your career is your life then indeed, follow the authors advice. However if your career is just a tool to financially enable your real life, it’s great to be a cog in a 9-to-5 machine: you get to go home in time for dinner every day and you probably have mental energy to spare when you do.<p>Further down, this is written:<p>&gt; If you&#x27;re not paying attention, you lose precious years stagnating and being unhappy.<p>Below, signs of unhappiness are: lack of work accomplishments, lack of “resume worthy work”, lack of new skills for future employment, lack of overthinking work problems in the shower, lack of kinship with colleagues felt.<p>Again, for many people, work is not a goal in itself. I like my colleagues and I enjoy my job, but in the end the place I really want to be is not my office (but my home) and the people I really care about are not my colleagues (but my family and friends).<p>Final exemplary quote:<p>&gt; You have at best 120 quarters left to make something of yourself. A year wasted at a poor job or role is equivalent to you throwing away 3.3% of your career.<p>Again, apparently “making something of yourself” is equivalent to not wasting time at a job and having a good career?<p>I fully stand by my points:<p>* It’s fine to be very career and job minded.<p>* You need to read the linked article with a lot of flexibility and creativity to come away with any other impression than the author is very career and job minded.<p>* It shows a lack of perspective (or an abundance of personal insecurities) to write a preachy article like this without even considering that your goals (the authors goals) might not be the same as everyone else’s.')
