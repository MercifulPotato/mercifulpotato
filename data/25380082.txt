I don’t have much time to play, maybe once or twice a month, but it felt like every time I turned the damn thing on I needed to first do a system upgrade (which takes forever) and then update the game itself (which again takes forever). All to play 30 minutes of Rocket League.<p>Slightly off-topic since the PS4 couldn’t max out a gigabit connection anyways so not really a reason to upgrade. Maybe PS5 owners will feel the need.')
