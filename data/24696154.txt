The reason you shouldn&#x27;t just connect to the database from the browser is primarily security - you should build your API to be a gatekeeper, and expose only the data you need to expose.<p>How you consume that is up to you. You may find you have some issues with things like CORS, depending on how you set this up - but these issues can usually be worked around.<p>[edit: Note that depending on why you want a static site, e.g. if bandwidth costs are your big limit and you don&#x27;t want your API hit with every request, you might find that setting up an automated worker to scrape your data and deploy it makes life easier - assuming that all your visitors to a page will want access to exactly the same data. In fact, if you save it as JSON with a filename ending .js, prepend &quot;window.page_content = &quot; to your file as part of your worker, then you can load your database content at the top of your page in a simple script tag and use that data in the rest of your page.]')
