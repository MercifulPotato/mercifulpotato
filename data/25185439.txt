For that, they received $445m from the German government. So, as a tax-paying German citizen I can say, not only will I do that, but even better, I already did.<p>It also feels deeply wrong to pull the &quot;but all the research efforts that did not lead anywhere&quot; argument, when Pfizer did not do the research in the first place. They should get compensation for organizing the huge trial, of course; that expertise was why they were on-boarded in the first place. And nobody expects them to manufacture that stuff at loss or cost. But we should not accept public money buying them goose laying golden eggs either.')
