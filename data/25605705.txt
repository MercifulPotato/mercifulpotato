We, collectively, decide that people should not make less than X. That does not make each person&#x27;s labor worth X in a free market, and it does not make X the &#x27;true&#x27; cost of paying a person. If we, as a society, decide that people should make at least X, then we, as a society, should subsidize wages below X until it is X.<p>The gap between the free market value of someone&#x27;s labor and a &#x27;living wage&#x27; is not an externality. It is not a secret cost that businesses are shirking. It is a social obligation that we made up because we want our citizens to have a certain standard of living, and that&#x27;s fine, but we should all pay that together.<p>Companies should pay people what their labor is worth, and we should all make up the difference together, if that&#x27;s what we believe is right.')
