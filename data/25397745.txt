I could emulate most of pycharm (pros) features, but what made me end up going back to pycharm was the refactoring capabilities. Rope just didn&#x27;t come close, while pycharm makes it trivial and rarely misses anything. Well that and having to manage all of these plug-ins on different OS&#x2F; python versions can become a time sink too. E.g. started out with vundle, but it did not support some of the features I needed to get an older commit of a plugin that was barely maintained anymore, so ended up rewriting the.vimrc with a different plugin manager... Etc etc')
