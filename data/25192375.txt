So you wouldn&#x27;t normally talk about for example a quarter cm; rather you&#x27;d have 25mm. In the imperial system working in fractions is much more common, so you have quarter inches, eighth inches, etc. Halving is more intuitive using fractions since it amounts to multiplying the denominator, rather than dividing.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m not really arguing for the imperial system, just saying that aside from legacy use, that&#x27;s the one advantage I see for it vs metric. But a metric system based on base-eight... that would be beautiful.')
