Best ways I can think of combating this is to pick small setups with quicker payoffs as mentioned in another comment, or learn to enjoy the process.<p>Blogging about your journey is one way of doing that. Even if the setup is tedious, once you have it and document &amp; publish it, it can give a sense on completion and satisfaction.<p>Another thing I often do is prototype an idea using something more familiar or with much restricted scope at first. The key thing is to go from success to success however small the steps.
