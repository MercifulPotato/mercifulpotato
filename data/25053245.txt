Here&#x27;s the NYT&#x27;s own reporting on one such instance:<p>&quot;A print headline on Tuesday’s front page for an article about President Trump’s statement addressing last weekend’s mass shootings has added to a continuing debate over how news organizations cover his administration.<p>Times editors were concerned that the initial headline — “Trump Urges Unity vs. Racism” — did not contextualize Mr. Trump’s message on Monday and decided to change it for later editions to “Assailing Hate but Not Guns.”&quot;<p>This strikes me as an open acknowledgement that negative spin is a hard requirement when reporting on Donald Trump at the New York Times.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;06&#x2F;reader-center&#x2F;trump-mass-shootings-headline.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;06&#x2F;reader-center&#x2F;trump-mass-...</a>')
