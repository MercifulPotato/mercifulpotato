I go hiking a lot at the old mercury mine near San Jose.  On my way, I pass through the town of New Almaden.  Cute town.  25 mph speed limit signs every 20&#x27; reminding you to slow down.<p>The town has a single, two-lane road for access, and nearly every house sits in the shade of oak trees and dry vegetation.<p>I understand the aesthetics, but that sort of naivete is absolutely irresponsible.  CA is filled with towns like this.  Fortunately it looks like the state might start enforcing fire codes, but I suspect the blowback from people living in these towns will effectively kill the enforcement.')
