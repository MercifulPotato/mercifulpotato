Because there weren&#x27;t components, it was hard to keep a consistent styling. And because the non-technical people didn&#x27;t have a design sense, I ended up having to &quot;clean&quot; their work, then translate to CSS manually. I guess it was neat to try to explore example ideas, but a lot of those weren&#x27;t translatable into &quot;responsive&quot; web pages (do people still do that anymore?).')
