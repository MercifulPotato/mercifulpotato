And if you&#x27;re mostly doing linear work, if you&#x27;re doing a lot of math, if you have a lot of pretty flat data structures, if you mostly keep things on the stack, then you may not run up against the borrow-checker that often. I would assume (I don&#x27;t know for sure) that scientific computing tends to do more of this kind of stuff, and not as much heap-juggling&#x2F;heterogeneous data modeling as, say, a web server.')
