Using such an interpretation is very bad faith, assuming that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re getting at.<p>I mean not allowed to be visible, to play any part in the public sphere, not allowed to &quot;exist&quot; in the sense of mattering to the structures of power in a country. Being forced to be invisible, forgotten, erased from the written and spoken record. And with that far more rational interpretation you can hopefully see that your views definitely qualify.')
