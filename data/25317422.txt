So far development with it has been almost identical to coding a website, but maybe because I am yet to start on any OS dependant features.<p>What makes you say that it isn&#x27;t getting traction? AFAIK, some huge companies are using it to create their apps.<p>I think it gets a lot of underserved hate, just because it&#x27;s JS and because it isn&#x27;t &quot;truly native&quot;. People also love to chime in about its performance but 9&#x2F;10 times that&#x27;s down to a bad implementation, in my humble opinion.')
