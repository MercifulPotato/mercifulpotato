The tutorials are all over the place and somehow unorganized IMO. When trying to replicate stuff on my machine, all kinds of weird errors pop up.<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t even <i></i>get<i></i> what ROS is about? Like it seems it is an &quot;amalgamation&quot; of tools and scripts to create a general API with some ideas of robotics application in mind. Also the naming of its stack seems weird to me: tf2, MoveIt!, the over-loading of terms like joint controller, robot controller, etc...<p>If anyone can point me to a free, coherent and hands-on  study plan or guide with exercises that actually build and run fine that would be awesome.')
