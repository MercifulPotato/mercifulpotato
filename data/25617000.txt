Item(by='ogre_codes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609625170, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25616719, text='&gt; Does anybody actively use smartwatch?<p>Lots of Apple Watches and a decent number of Garmin watches. Don&#x27;t see a lot of anything else. I suspect the fact most of them are bulky and have shitty CPU options is a big part of it. Garmin users are willing to accept the bulk for the functionality. Apple Watches aren&#x27;t that bulky.<p>I use mine for workouts, taking calls so I don&#x27;t have to pull out my phone, sending text &amp; receiving text messages, and controlling music. For my light mobile phone use, it&#x27;s nearly suitable as a replacement for my phone.')
