It should be fit for its purpose, especially with a myriad of single and multi purpose tools available to all. This doesn&#x27;t feel like something I should justify too hard :-)<p>Twitter is not a necessity of life. I don&#x27;t have to use it. They want me to use it and if so they can&#x2F;should make it usable.<p>Its paradigm and user interface don&#x27;t work for me personally (and particularly when people try to fit an article into something explicitly designed for a single sentence - it feels like a misuse of a tool,like hammering a screw) so I don&#x27;t use it.  And that&#x27;s ok!<p>I don&#x27;t feel they are morally obligated to make it usable by me. It&#x27;s a private platform and they can do as they please.<p>But my wife is a store manager and taught me that &quot;feedback is a gift&quot; - if a customer will leave the store and never come back,she&#x27;d rather know why, rather then remain ignorant.<p>She may or may not choose to address it but being aware and informed is better than being ignorant of the reasons.<p>So at the end of it, rather than down vote, let me ask what is the actual crux of your argument? People shouldn&#x27;t be discriminate? They should use optional things they dislike? They shouldn&#x27;t share their preferences and feedback? Twitter is a great tool for long format essays? Or something we all may be missing?')
