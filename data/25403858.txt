Item(by='lazydon', descendants=None, kids=[25404009], score=None, time=1607827414, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25398429, text='It&#x27;s funny how a team develops their own common vocab not only for the stuff they work on (Ubiquitous Language as in DDD) but also to describe people.<p>When a few teammates and I interview folks, other than the usual official evaluations, the best we understand each other&#x27;s feedback is through this common language. A language that got unconsciously developed while interviewing and working together for years and our experiences with other folks in the organization.<p>We are no YC, but what PG is referring to as earnest would be in our language simply &quot;good energy&quot;. The opposite of it would be &quot;looks tired&quot; i.e. for someone showing completer lack of interest in what they do. Another ones would be &quot;fighter&quot; (one who doesn&#x27;t gives up on hard problems) and &quot;pacifier&quot; (one who stays calm and composed that&#x27;s good for handling production incidents and help team through with difficult people).<p>To further muddy the waters, I think if the job descriptions came up with more  details about the personality traits required for the job, that could help people have better job matches and satisfaction. I know it becomes too subjective if you overdo it but perhaps things like StrengthsFinder can help. On the other hand there&#x27;s a risk of going too further on altogether a wrong path as it happened with Myers-Briggs.')
