The world is awash in capital looking for a home, and it could be your project. I would propose the real issue is more of the berkshire hathaway problem, in that there are plenty of opportunities to make good returns, just few of them billion dollar sized (in terms of position size).<p>Consider something like putting solar on one&#x27;s home. It can have an ROI of 10-30% (quick google), but organizing a multi-million dollar investment on others&#x27; homes is administratively tough. So the &quot;little guy&quot; (home owner in this case) can have an opportunity to place ~$50k at a high ROI...<p>Now, if you&#x27;re talking about really poor (like hand to mouth) then their best investments are likely in education and skills training. A sort of intangible capital that (afaik) no market keeps track of.')
