Gatekeeping does not have to be intentional for it to be the case. Sometimes it can be out of good-will, even.<p>For an example of the last point, transgender care in the UK -- it takes 2 appointments to get treated (hormone therapy), it can take up to 4+ years to get the first appointment (those are the smaller waiting lists), and another year or longer to get the second before you are finally treated for it. This isn&#x27;t done out of bad-will, it is done out of intent to not mistreat people. However, the effect of this is that it gatekeeps people who can have access to trans care to those who are able to afford it.<p>Gatekeeping does not require intent, nor does it require malice. It can simply be the result of a cultural artifact creating what is <i>percieved</i> to be a hostile culture.')
