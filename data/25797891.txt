For instance the black cluster is elongated in the saturation dimension but quite tight in H and V. I wanted to capture these directions of variance and I think the GMM does this.<p>Put differently, I think the clusters are better approximated by ellipsoids than spheres.<p>But yep nearest neighbour probably would have worked fine too.')
