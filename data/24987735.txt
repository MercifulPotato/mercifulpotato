Get a Brother laser printer, and be done with it.<p>I&#x27;ve also been using a Lexmark printer for several years now, from the &quot;workgroup&quot; class. These are more expensive, but generally better built and if you print a lot, you can use larger toner cartridges which come out fairly cheap per page. But Lexmark software has weird quirks and you inevitably end up having to reset your printer, because it isn&#x27;t on WiFi for some reason (have you tried turning it off and on again?).<p>None of that with Brother. You plug it in, set it up, and you&#x27;re done, works with all of your devices (including iOS).')
