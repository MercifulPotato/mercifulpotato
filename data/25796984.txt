When I finish my workday I often find myself just sitting with her and watching Netflix but if I get up and go to the other room to do something I&#x27;m interested in she&#x27;ll get upset.<p>I think a lot of the issues come from the fact that I don&#x27;t feel I &quot;need&quot; anything from her. It makes it hard to relate to her when she &quot;needs&quot; something from me. I actually think not needing anything from other people is the root of the issue. I&#x27;m very independent and always trying to be self-sufficient (stock piling money, etc) so that I don&#x27;t need to rely on other people.<p>I think this independence is a fault as it keeps from from &quot;being vulnerable&quot; and opening up more which is what leads to deeper connections with other humans. I&#x27;m trying to work on it a bit and have found that when I genuinely open up to my wife it actually frees up more time for me. Rather than spending 3 hours watching netflix we can spend 30 minutes having a deep conversation and then her needs are met and I can go do my own thing. Trying to do this regularly is really difficult though.')
