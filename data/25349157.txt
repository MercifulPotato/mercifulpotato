Yeah, making wireless headphones with active noise cancellation is complicated, what else is new. Same as making a smartphone, or a laptop, or a car. &quot;Significantly better than the competition&quot;? Sure they are if you listen to (or are) Tim Cook or some Apple fanboy, but really buying an iPhone is mostly a matter of preference, not really being &quot;better than the competition&quot;. And &quot;preference&quot; is the best case scenario, because quite more often that&#x27;s a matter of being victim of aggressive marketing.<p>I mean, AirPods Max may be actually better than the competition (unlike regular AirPods, which are a bestseller anyway). But they were just announced, why the hell would you assume that they are any good at all?')
