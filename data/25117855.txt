It&#x27;s a self solving problem. We wouldn&#x27;t be discussing lock downs, because everyone would lock down without being told they should lock down.<p>No, it&#x27;s not a silly question.  You are making the ASSUMPTION that people will make the best decisions for everyone (including themselves).  I don&#x27;t think you have been paying attention this year.<p>And you didn&#x27;t even answer the question- would you be for forced lockdown if it was that lethal?  Saying &quot;it&#x27;s not even a question&quot; is skirting the issue.  Because what about 70% lethal, or 60%, or 50%.. maybe even down to 10%.  If your view is there is NO level that liberty can be sacrificed- then prove it by thinking about this simple situation and saying it.<p>I do agree with your general sentiment.  However you are acting as if there is NO situation in which limiting liberty is the right choice.  And I am arguing that is simply not true by giving you some extreme examples.<p>&gt;Mask mandates are a reasonable compromise<p>Yeah, and people can&#x27;t even follow THAT.  It&#x27;s arguments like yours that people are like &quot;A mask!? what about MY FREEDOM!&quot;.  Your freedom becomes less relevant when it DIRECTLY IMPOSES ON THE SAFETY OF OTHERS.<p>&gt;But, don&#x27;t mess with our natural rights. Do not trade liberty for safety<p>Buzz. Wrong. Your natural rights don&#x27;t give you the right to harm others.')
