And it <i>dramatically</i> isn&#x27;t the case.<p>This is a side effect of using the same category terms, but not talking about the underlying distributions.<p>Eg., in the UK, 80% of the country were industrial working class or poorer until 1980s; and middle class only <i>started</i> at top 5%.<p>Today, the &quot;industrial working class&quot; level of wealth, is the bottom 20% <i>at the very most</i>.<p>So if you hold the class terms fixed, &quot;middle class&quot; it seems the 80s top 5% has &quot;stagnated&quot;, only to fail to mention, it now 60% of the country.<p>If you hold the distributions constant, the wealth level acheived in the top 5% in 1980s is now a <i>majority</i> of the population.')
