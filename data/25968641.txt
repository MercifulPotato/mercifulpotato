Its better than most alternatives. Yet still lacking. Its hard to describe in words without putting screenshots next to each other, but there is a lack of crispness, odd spacing, other aspects probably related to the terminal emulation capabilities (odd background colors when I use ncurses apps in WSL, or via ssh, etc.).<p>Also its overall a bit half baked in terms of its UX, which really boils down to not getting in the way so much. It seems to support for example tons of ways of pasting from the clipboard, involving &quot;INS&quot;, or CTRL-V, etc. but lots of terminal applications actually depend on these shortcuts so Gnome-Terminal binds them to C-Shift-V or iterm&#x2F;Terminal.app to CMD+V, on windows, CTRL-V is caught by Terminal and that means I cannot rectangle-select in vim, etc.<p>I must admit I haven&#x27;t dived into the MS Terminal configuration very far other than looking at the color Schemes, nevertheless, there is a lot of room for improvement when coming from a Linux&#x2F;Mac platform')
