The droughts in SoCal are going to keep making these traditional fresh water sources you mention even more scarce. Less rain means lower lake water levels. Less snow in the winters means less snow pack in the mountains, so less water in the rivers and lakes below. All of this occurring while SoCal has an essentially endless supply of saltwater.<p>Texas is in a similar situation. The lack of natural lake resevoirs means their manmade lakes are also dependent on rainfall that is very prone to drought conditions as well. Texas also has easy access to saltwater. It&#x27;s places like Las Vegas, Phoenix, etc that will have a hard time getting saltwater.<p>The poplulation of all of these areas are only increasing putting that much more strain on these limited fresh water supplies.')
