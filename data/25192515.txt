I was 11 years old and hired by a country club to clean restrooms and the grounds around the swimming pool during the summer. I had to be in and out before the first guests arrived because I wasn&#x27;t a member. They decided to pay me $1.85 an hour when the minimum wage was $3.35 or so at the time, but I had no bargaining power because I was legally under age. Our timesheets were paper and the club had no surveillance, so I gave myself 1.5 hours of work every day because I was a quick worker (the person I alternated with took more time anyway) and they were assholes.')
