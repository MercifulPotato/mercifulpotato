When that song comes on, it makes my ears feel like they&#x27;re bleeding,&quot; Zolot said, explaining that the track itself has had a big negative impact on her. &quot;Like, it makes me feel like I&#x27;m gonna die. It gives me a panic attack hearing that song.&quot;<p>&gt; Part of it has been the pressure of trying to make another hit &quot;as big as &#x27;Gucci Gucci&#x27;&quot; in subsequent years. However, the bigger issue that&#x27;s continued to goad her is the fact that she receives no royalties and is still in debt to Sony for $800,000 for it â€” something she addressed in a string of tweets asking people to stop buying and streaming the track.<p>Maybe, just maybe, thinking of vocal artists as just instruments in an overall track is a mistake?<p>It&#x27;s cool and all that you &quot;found&quot; her but it doesn&#x27;t sound like she was very happy with how things turned out. Having someone else in the studio who didn&#x27;t think she was just an &quot;instrument&quot; might have been nice.<p>Just saying.')
