Item(by='mercer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606032959, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25173540, text='The problem in this discussion is that most of us are happy with Tailwind based on our <i>experience</i> using it, and our <i>experience</i> with previous approaches. And not just because it&#x27;s &quot;easier to get started&quot;.<p>And from what I can tell, most of us <i>do</i> care about portability and componentization.<p>If your experience is different, then that&#x27;s interesting, but not much of an argument in itself. Either 1) we&#x27;re just much worse at this than you are, 2) your use cases and projects are more unusual&#x2F;uncommon, or 3) what you think is &#x27;easy to do&#x27; perhaps is not, and perhaps you&#x27;d benefit from a more Tailwind-like approach too.<p>Obviously if what works for you, that&#x27;s fine. I don&#x27;t use Tailwind in all my projects, and in some cases wouldn&#x27;t even do so if I could. And it&#x27;s not like what came before is entirely unworkable.<p>But it feels a bit dismissive to argue that our experiences are just wrong, or that we&#x27;re just taking the lazy way out.')
