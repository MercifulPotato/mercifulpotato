The M1 is about 120 sq mm, substantially smaller than many Intel designs.  The current estimate for 5 nm wafers is about $17K (almost certainly high).  A single 300 mm wafer is about 70,700 sq mm.  If we get die from 75% of that area, that gives us about a $38 raw die cost.  Even with packaging and additional testing, I suspect they would be competitive.')
