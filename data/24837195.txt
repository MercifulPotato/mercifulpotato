But as far as I know, it&#x27;s always U3 used between administrations for comparisons but pundits will be pundits, switching their view depending on who is in office. It&#x27;s the same with &quot;plays too much golf&quot;, &quot;uses Air Force One for campaigning&quot; for every incumbent, and of course &quot;goes on too many vacations&quot;. Just something to keep in mind no matter who is in office at any given time.')
