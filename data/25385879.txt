But I can&#x27;t help but think that work in general is a hostage situation for most workers: &quot;sell your labour for less than it&#x27;s worth or die.  Also you will have to simply accept a host of petty tyrannies (in the best case) or abusive behaviour (in the worst).&quot;  You have to accept because most people don&#x27;t have enough capital to make it on their own, and are prevented from accumulating that capital because they are exploited in the first place.  Then the CEO&#x27;s&#x2F;founders&#x2F;funders will turn around and say &quot;Look at this amazing thing that I personally built.&quot;  The value extracted from workers (and the real suffering that entails) is ideologically erased in the narrative about why the company was successful.<p>I think this dynamic is generally less recognized by software developers because we&#x27;re frequently comparatively  well paid and well treated at work, and can occasionally accumulate enough capital to break out of this vicious cycle (though we&#x27;re still paid less than the value of our labour and still deal with much of the BS noted above).  However the same can&#x27;t be said for the people making our computers.')
