I can consume the content in any way I choose, but I can&#x27;t share it. DRM is usually breakable, and you can do whatever you wish with the content after you break it. With watermarks, however, you never know whether you&#x27;ve fully removed them or not, so you&#x27;re actually afraid of sharing your content, even if you&#x27;re technically able to do so.<p>The only problem with watermarking is that it doesn&#x27;t really work with the streaming model, as not giving you access when the subscription expires is the whole point.')
