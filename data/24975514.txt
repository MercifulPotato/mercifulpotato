When you have a lot of people working on a monolithic code base one of the places where you feel the most friction is at the build process. If CI takes 30 minutes for example and you have 80 developers working on the code base (roughly the stats from my previous job) then you can see how just coordinating the build&#x2F;merge&#x2F;rebase&#x2F;build&#x2F;merge cycle can be an issue without good tooling and practices. At some point service boundaries are inevitable and shipping the org chart is something we&#x27;ve always done.<p>But what is actually happening in some companies is just so far beyond this. There are developers I&#x27;ve talked to at companies where the micro-services outnumber the developers by 5:1 or more. That is insane, and I imagine it did start with the kind of empire building you are talking about.')
