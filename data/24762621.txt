I live in a small town in Washington in a long river valley. I&#x27;m about 2km from the nearest forest. I&#x27;ve lived here several years. I live about half a mile from a highway, and directly on a main road.<p>During the initial lockdown, traffic on the highway stopped. Traffic on the main road stopped. Things got very quiet. And then something else happened about 5 days in.<p>I smelled the forest. Not just a whiff, but a strong smell of &quot;hey dummy, you live next to a forest and just realized you&#x27;ve been missing the smell the whole time.&quot; I also noticed the sky was clearer.<p>So, am I surprised that birds noticed, too? Not at all. I&#x27;m surprised that more <i>humans</i> didn&#x27;t notice.')
