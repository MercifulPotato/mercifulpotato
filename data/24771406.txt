Item(by='qsort', descendants=None, kids=[24771790], score=None, time=1602630844, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24771025, text='I&#x27;m not actually claiming no such algorithm exists, as I have already stated, but simply that such a thing is not known to exist.<p>I&#x27;m not an expert in neurosciences so I can only give an informal description. Let&#x27;s also remove &quot;me&quot; from the equation, let&#x27;s talk about a randomly chosen human H. We know for a fact that there is nothing physically special about human brains, they are just ordinary organic matter. This matter forms a system subject to the laws of physics. With enough computational power and scientific knowledge (we have neither as of now, AFAIK), we could write a program for a quantum Turing machine that runs a 1:1 simulation of H&#x27;s brain in software. Any quantum program can be emulated by a Turing machine equipped with sufficient random numbers with at most an exponential slowdown, making this program computable in exactly the classical sense.<p>My questions are (1) is it possible, even in principle, to make a program of this kind? (2) Would such a program be sufficiently predictive (with any statistical notion of that concept you prefer) of H&#x27;s behavior?<p>If there exists a program that satisfies both (1) and (2), then I&#x27;m content with the notion that I am, myself, not significantly different from such a program.')
