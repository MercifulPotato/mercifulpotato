It simply depends on your use case.<p>Rebuilds certainly are a problem but beyond that I think it&#x27;s simply &quot;be ok with slow drives&quot;.  I&#x27;ve been operating a decently sized SMR pool for 3 years now with no major issues, including surviving two drive failures.<p>If you try to put random write workloads onto SMR you&#x27;re gonna have a bad time no matter what you do.  In my use case it&#x27;s great, since this is effectively WORM storage writing giant files to disk all at once so I have effectively 0% fragmentation and all subsequent reads of the file tend to be sequential.<p>That said, this is for my personal use and lab projects.  Not sure I&#x27;d go ZFS+SMR for a production workload.')
