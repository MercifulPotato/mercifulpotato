Markets are not configured or incentivized to address ills like this, nor are corporations. Asking a corporation to right large scale social wrongs is like asking the DMV to operate your military or walking into a restaurant and asking them to come fix your roof. It&#x27;s just the wrong socioeconomic tool for the job. If you try to really pressure or force them to do it, they&#x27;ll do something half-assed much as you describe.<p>Boycotts can work a little, but a boycott large enough to be effective and overcome other market forces is very hard to organize and sustain.<p>I&#x27;m not totally letting Apple off the hook, just pointing out that without the government doing something here any measures Apple or anyone else takes will be ineffective. Even if Apple starts pushing back on this, other manufacturers will fill the void and take advantage of that cheap labor instead. Apple might even find it tough to police this since Chinese companies may lie about where work is being performed or who is doing it. They&#x27;re likely to demand that Apple pay more for  different labor and then pocket the money and use forced labor instead.')
