Item(by='mindslight', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607705848, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25383665, text='Perhaps where we actually start to diverge is that I view stories like this as appeals for increased funding from Congress. If NWS were going to rearrange the budget internally, they would have already done so. Did you not mean your comment in the wider context of managing the entire federal budget?<p>You haven&#x27;t directly argued for cuts, but I still maintain that reflects the gist of your comment. &quot;You don&#x27;t have any money left&quot; is an assertion of limiting the budget. The immediate implication is that increasing funding to something means having to cut something else. The cliched response pertaining to such tradeoffs in the federal budget is &quot;well then, buy one less F-35&quot;.<p>The directly opposing argument is that would be worthwhile to increase the federal budget and taxes by 0.2% to fix similar problems across the board. I&#x27;m certainly not making that argument to increase taxes though - but we should be able to hold a critique of the government&#x27;s foolish penny wise pound behavior in our heads without collapsing it to one of the two.<p>My comments were downvoted because HN abhors sarcasm, the exchange has generated much more heat than light, and that got attributed to me because I went meta. Next time I&#x27;ll just copypasta the comment about the F-35.')
