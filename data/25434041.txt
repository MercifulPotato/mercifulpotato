Item(by='mumblemumble', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608060806, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25433139, text='&gt; Some people like more restrictive languages, because they donâ€™t trust others or themselves to reliably use good discretion in the use of powerful features<p>For me, it&#x27;s not even that. It&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve discovered that, even when used with discretion, the simple presence of powerful features still makes it harder to reason about how things work. Discretion around powerful features isn&#x27;t a one-and-done thing; it&#x27;s an ongoing process of double-checking and verifying for yourself whether that feature is being used properly every time you touch or interact with code that uses it.<p>A common thread in many seminal papers and essays in the history of programming languages (&quot;Can Programming be Liberated from the Von Neumann Style&quot;, &quot;GOTO Statement considered harmful&quot;, &quot;Lambda: The Ultimate GOTO&quot;, to name a few.) is that, ironically enough, when you take a bird&#x27;s eye look at things, reducing the power of the tools tends to increase the power of the programmer.<p>I should say, I&#x27;m not meaning that to be a statement in favor of static or dynamic typing; I try to stay out of that debate.[1] To me, the real problem with JSON is that, at least under typical usage, it tends to be <i>weakly</i> typed. (Which is a powerful feature; strong typing is a way of restricting what you can do.) JSON&#x27;s type system is less expressive than that of basically any well-known programming language, including JavaScript itself, and, out of necessity, people tend to deal with that by overloading its types in ways that may force consumers to use out-of-band knowledge to interpret a message properly. This has a tendency to happen even in the presence of OpenAPI specs or JSON schemata.<p>[1] Though I&#x27;ll take this chance to link <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdsmith.wordpress.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;01&#x2F;09&#x2F;an-old-article-i-wrote&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdsmith.wordpress.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;01&#x2F;09&#x2F;an-old-article-i-wr...</a>')
