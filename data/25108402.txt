(a) indicates the monkey procedure was ethical, while (b) is a little more iffy.<p>But you&#x27;re right, the argument (c) the woman&#x27;s autonomy rights trump the fetus&#x27;s rights but only when the fetus was unintended does indeed indicate the monkey operation was unethical. I&#x27;m not so sure that (c) is a very logical position though.')
