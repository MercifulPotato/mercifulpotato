Item(by='teraflop', descendants=None, kids=[24778478], score=None, time=1602690719, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24777712, text='&gt; However, blanket statements like &quot;Hardware requiring an online account to work must be outlawed.&quot; Would ban very legitimate products such as Amazon&#x27;s physical buttons for restocking supplies.<p>OK, rephrase it slightly and say that it must not require an online account from a <i>specific provider</i>. If I can come up with an API endpoint that I want to use instead of Amazon, and I want to reconfigure my Dash button to use it, I should be legally and technically allowed to do so.<p>The regulation doesn&#x27;t need to ban any categories of products, or mandate any features. It just needs to say that <i>if</i> your product depends on online connectivity for a significant part of its functionality, <i>then</i> it must not employ technical measures to prevent interoperability. Hardware that&#x27;s sold to consumers already needs to meet various compliance standards, such as RF emissions testing; this doesn&#x27;t seem like a heavy burden in comparison.<p>Of course, such a policy is very unlikely to be enacted in the US any time soon, but hey, I can dream.')
