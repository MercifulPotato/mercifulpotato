First time without stopping for reading references, then another pass for researching topics, references, etc. and then finally once more to read everything again with the newly acquired knowledge to find some things that I may have missed, things that I might have understood incorrectly and to improve retention.<p>- I always keep notebook close by to note anything that comes to my mind. Some things are triggered by reading the book and some things are completely unrelated. I write them down so that they don&#x27;t distract me from reading.<p>- I have special place in my office where I put a book so that it is visible to me whatever I do. It serves as a constant reminder to get it finished.<p>- When I was young I learned to speed read. When I grew up little more I unlearned. It impairs comprehension.')
