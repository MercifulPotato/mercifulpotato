I found the three blog posts about printing on this blog to be helpful: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kylescholz.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kylescholz.com&#x2F;</a><p>The author describes their work to make a very simple DIY inkjet printer for under $1000. While they are using a nozzle that they purchased, you can make a similar one yourself (check out the book &quot;Microdrop generation&quot; by Eric Lee).<p>All-in-all it&#x27;s fairly complicated just to start printing droplets, to say nothing of scaling beyond a single nozzle or precisely moving the printhead.')
