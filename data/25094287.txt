Now let&#x27;s see if Arathorn shows up to tell me how wrong I am. Wouldn&#x27;t be the first time. Nothing inspires confidence in the maturity of a product like a CEO that joins discussions to tell users who&#x27;ve had bad experiences that it was their fault for not understanding the documentation. That&#x27;s how Facebook got so big, don&#x27;t you know?<p>I&#x27;m absolutely obsessed with chat solutions like Matrix and Arathorn probably doesn&#x27;t remember me but I remember his attitude towards my feedback.')
