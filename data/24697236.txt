After we had turned in our first essays, she gave <i>everyone</i> a failing grade, and put on a show of being very disappointed with our work.<p>Instead of whatever was next on the syllabus, our next assignment was to rewrite, with paper and pen, three separate (3-5ish page) essays written on the same prompt, which she had saved over the years as exemplary.<p>I distinctly remember hating the idea of it, and putting off the task so I could hate it for longer. However, once I started (re-)writing, I was forced to capitulate (an experience that seems to be shared with other commenters here). While the essays were really good, they were just words on a page -- there&#x27;s nothing stopping <i>me</i> from writing like that, too. In fact, I <i>was</i> writing like that right now!<p>At the end, she shared the reasoning behind this exercise, and made us take a vow of silence to not tell the next year&#x27;s students what to expect. Everybody who traced the essays got an A in the gradebook, and the kids who didn&#x27;t trace usually dropped-out at that point (it was early in the year, this was the accelerated-track course).<p>I&#x27;ve never had another educational moment like that, since. It was immensely humbling, in that it told all of us, who were used to being good, that we still have plenty of room to improve. Once out of high school, our egos are perhaps too large to get the most out of that kind of activity.<p>This is a really cool idea. I&#x27;d love to see this applied to foreign languages. For example, if I&#x27;m learning German, it&#x27;d be great to do that by typing out Theodor Storm. Many of these classic books are in the public domain [1].<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.com&#x2F;books?id=VXgBAAAAYAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:Theodor+inauthor:Storm&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.com&#x2F;books?id=VXgBAAAAYAAJ&amp;newbks=1&amp;newb...</a>')
