EU was expected to give UK an even better deal, because &quot;EU needs the UK more than UK needs the EU&quot;.<p>• Tabloids somehow managed to make the word &quot;expert&quot; mean &quot;a clueless idiot&quot;, so all predictions were easily dismissed as &quot;project fear&quot;.<p>• Leave proponents enthusiastically agreed that EU sucks and UK is great. Remainers had mixed messaging like &quot;EU is not that bad&quot;, &quot;EU is bad, but we can fix it&quot;, &quot;UK is not as great as you think&quot;.<p>• Populism.
