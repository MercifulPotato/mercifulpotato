Item(by='altacc', descendants=None, kids=[24745204], score=None, time=1602231963, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24723640, text='&gt; Waymo has burned money for 10+ years<p>I don&#x27;t think you can disparage Waymo and cheerlead Tesla on the basis that you think Waymo a money fire whilst ignoring that Tesla is massively in debt and has yet to post a positive annual net income. Tesla has burnt money for 17 years and it&#x27;s recent profitable quarters are only the beginning of a turnaround that is not yet anywhere near sufficient to recoup it&#x27;s losses.<p>In the meantime legacy car manufacturers are catching up with Tesla&#x27;s offering and providing ever stronger competition. The coronavirus has disrupted production &amp; made sales numbers confusing, but Tesla has lost its top spot in markets it led until recently. Tesla has been great PR for EVs and an important early market innovator, but it is by no means guaranteed long term success in either self-driving or car production.')
