Right now you could mostly describe it as a consent management platform but we have much bigger plans and we think there&#x27;s a way to operate websites with modern tools and services without selling out your visitors &#x2F; users, and that&#x27;s the vision we want to fulfill with Klaro.<p>We already have thousands of open-source users and also launched a commercial service a few months ago, which is already growing nicely. We want to hire our first open-source developer soon, starting with a part-time engagement while we&#x27;re increasing our revenue.<p>Anyone interested should be knowledgeable in JS and React.js and know a good deal about browser internals (e.g. how cookies, localStorage etc. work and which security &amp; privacy features and restrictions apply).<p>The work would be fully remote and fully on open-source software (we also have physical offices in Berlin though that you could work from if you happen to live there). We&#x27;re quite early in the process of hiring someone and we don&#x27;t even have a job description, if you&#x27;re interested to chat please just drop me an e-mail to klaro@kiprotect.com. Thanks!')
