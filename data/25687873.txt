At no time did any Democrat claim she had actually won the election in a landslide, or that it was a stolen, fraudulent election.<p>Donald Trump still has not conceded. On Wednesday he was spouting lies about a fraudulent election, a stolen election, and to fight. As he has for two months. And this lie is repeated by more than 140 Republicans, 2&#x2F;3rds of the caucus, in the House of Representatives. Along with 7 Republican Senators. On the record.<p>These are not the same two things at all. You know that. And yet you choose to replicate a lie and make a ridiculous claim of hypocrisy. And I think it makes you a coward and a person of bad character, and I also think you know that too. The only question is whether it shames you.')
