There was absolutely zero need to escalate. They were trying to punish and intimidate the crowd instead of trying to disperse or control it. That should cost the commanding officer&#x27;s job.&quot;<p>The professional way is to identify the instigators&#x2F;leaders in the crowd and extract them one by one. Also to constantly move the crowd street by street - toward less narrow places.<p>&gt; You have to leave when told to do so.<p>And if you don&#x27;t they might arrest you. Standing there is no cause for smashing faces. They can simply grab the closest persons to the police line, bring them behind the line, arrest them. No need to lash out. This gets the message across. If the crowd starts to escalate, sure, water jets. But even that&#x27;s usually completely unnecessary. Just pick up the trouble makers one-by-one, usually that means less than a dozen people.<p>Because if there really is an organized fanatical crowd then the police would likely withdraw, like they did in Seattle &quot;zone&quot;.')
