Thanks for giving me the heads up.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m not sure quite how to deal with being put on ad lists.  Sure, people can upload any file to our host so it&#x27;s plausible that someone, at some point, has uploaded an advert.  Someone could also redirect to an advert domain and we&#x27;d have no way to really deal with that unless it was reported.  Ideas are welcome for solutions.')
