Facebook&#x27;s algorithm now shoves posts into user&#x27;s feed, which is optimized for engagement. We&#x27;re all seeing now where that has led, and it&#x27;s not going to get any better if nothing changes.<p>Facebook keeps hiding behind the claim that they are a neutral platform when their own man made algorithm optimizes user feeds for ad&#x2F;content delivery to maximize profit. Whether the developers meant to or not, that algorithm <i>has</i> actively spread and amplified misinformation, even polarizing entire nations.<p>If facebook cannot tame (identifying &quot;truth&quot;) what they have made (their algorithmic feed), they should kill it. It does not matter if this taming is possible or not, because they do have the ability to terminate the algorithm.')
