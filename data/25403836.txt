Altogether, special certificates were issued for 600,000 people recognising them as liquidators.&quot; Perhaps you may just now be getting the sense that nuclear disasters don&#x27;t just last 2 years? The clean up was long and dangerous, and you didn&#x27;t get the certificate unless you were somehow exposed.<p>&gt; ... No, that&#x27;s ridiculous. That&#x27;s at the level of an engineered disaster, where you take all the fuel and light it on fire and then let it continue to burn...<p>You have no clue what you are talking about.

Spent fuel rods remain radioactive and hot for years to decades, if they are not constantly and actively cooled, they shortly get hot enough to ignite their casings. Maybe you are just now learning that nuclear power is dangerous? Do you know how many thousands of spent fuel rods are sitting around in cooling pools onsite with reactors around the world? Better hope nobody has an OOPS.<p>I&#x27;m done.')
