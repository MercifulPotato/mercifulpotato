However, considering the fact how many people seriously consider Trump to be the next Hitler, there is no doubt in my mind that someone for sure did try to cheat is some way. Another question is whether there was enough of it to change the outcome and to that - I have no idea.<p>The most damning thing for me is preventing poll observers from challenging the ballots. This fact alone makes the election illegitimate, as far as I am considered. Poll observers should be there to ensure that there is no fraud in the first place, and without that it&#x27;s really hard to figure out what happened. If the poll observers were allowed to do their job, I don&#x27;t think I could complain about anything.<p>Regarding the judges throwing them out, this is my understanding of the situation: First, people are claiming that Trump lost 60 or however many lawsuits. That&#x27;s just not true, his team haven&#x27;t filed anywhere close that number.of lawsuits. Second, the evidence wasn&#x27;t yet presented, allegedly because the courts didn&#x27;t gave them the chance to do so yet. But I guess it&#x27;s possible that it&#x27;s just propaganda from the Trump side, so I have no idea on this one either.<p>And could you please look again at that Nahshon Garrett affidavit, exhibit 2? Doesn&#x27;t that mean that &quot;he&quot; in fact did voted in AZ?')
