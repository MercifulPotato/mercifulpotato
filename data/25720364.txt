Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned:<p>Follow the recipe, then don&#x27;t follow it. As a beginner, follow the damn recipe. Read the ingredients list, buy the ingredients, and follow the instructions to the word. I know too many beginners who get lazy, don&#x27;t follow the recipe and then the food doesn&#x27;t taste good. Then, once you&#x27;ve gotten it down, start to tweak and experiment. Try adding a new ingredient or substituting something you don&#x27;t have. Once you&#x27;re not a beginner, you can skip following the recipe.<p>Learn the basic science of searing, emulsions, salting and temperature (hot &amp; fast versus low &amp; slow). The Food Lab&#x2F;Serious Eats is a great resource for this. Salt Fat Acid Heat is also good.<p>Gain intuition. Learn to taste the food and see what&#x27;s missing. You probably need to add more salt. Maybe a little acid? Or you could slip in some butter.<p>You will need to use more fat and salt than you think. When beginners watch me cook, they&#x27;re shocked at how much salt and fat I add. It&#x27;s still a fraction of how much you eat at a restaurant. This is especially true if you&#x27;re blanching or boiling something, as the water needs to be really really really salty. Pasta water needs quite a few tablespoons of salt. Don&#x27;t worry about it.<p>I read a theory that the whole bacon wrapped whatever craze was due to bacon being essentially fat and salt. People became obsessed with adding bacon because they weren&#x27;t adding enough salt and fat.<p>American food tends to not have a lot of vegetables, but a crapton of carbs and meat. Try to learn Indian, Chinese, Korean or Mediterranean dishes. Beans are a great meat substitute.')
