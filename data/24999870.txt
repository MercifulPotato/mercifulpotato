I&#x27;m a fan!<p>For example, what does the following C# code print?<p><pre><code>    UInt32 x = 1;\n    UInt32 s = x &gt;&gt; 32;\n    Console.WriteLine(&quot;&quot; + s);\n</code></pre>\nHow about the following Go code?<p><pre><code>    var x uint32 = 1\n    var s uint32 = x &gt;&gt; 32\n    fmt.Println(s)\n</code></pre>\nI can easily answer the question for Go looking at the Go spec, but I cannot seem to find anywhere documented in the C# spec its (more surprising) behavior.')
