It’s not like Apple doesn’t have strong competitors. It’s not like the app developers are like, “Oh, 30%?! I didn’t know!”<p>People want the product that Apple is making. They buy it knowingly and willingly in droves.<p>Look at the M1, the culmination of decades of hard R&amp;D, beating Intel at their own game.<p>You want to tell this company — which is absolutely killing it and creating absolutely tremendous value for consumers the world over — you want to tell them how their own device should work?!<p>Explain to me why the free market has not spoken, and spoken <i>clearly</i> in favor of the products that Apple has brought to market for their customers. Why in the world should the US Government say that what this truly amazing company should do in their own code and product roadmap.<p>Honestly, it’s a travesty in the making.
