I wanted to create a small collection of pages as my website, intending to keep everything as small and simple as possible since it was (mostly) just to display some basic info and &quot;posts&quot;. Well as soon as I wanted that menu for pages it was a whole new can of worms.<p>Sure, I could just copy&#x2F;paste&#x2F;replace content as it changes. But I don&#x27;t want to  have to be doing that any time I decide I want to change or add something. And I&#x27;m known to be a source of human error.<p>I ended up going Node+Express+EJS for the includes and certain more dynamic content on pages. It works well enough, page sizes are still small. Also considered some static site generators but at the time they seemed like overkill for what I wanted. Maybe there&#x27;s a tool out there that will compile to plain old HTML files that I&#x27;m unaware of, I don&#x27;t keep up much on front-end things.')
