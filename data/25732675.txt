He observes that &quot;setting every drug offender free would cut our prison population by only about 16 percent...still more than 200,000 people -- and that&#x27;s a huge number by any measure.&quot;<p>Because many offenses&#x2F;crimes were dropped as part of plea bargaining, it&#x27;s also hard to indicate how many would actually be characterized as &quot;non-violent criminals jailed on minor drug offence&quot;. Pfaff tries to estimate this using Bureau of Justice Statistics surveying that asks inmates questions that go beyond their official convictions. According to this &quot;about 1 percent of all prisoners...met that description&quot;.<p>So yes, I think a lot of people would agree with the headline here, but it&#x27;s not a panacea for the incarceration rate of the US.')
