Additionally, x86-64 implicitly requires several features (most notably SSE2), and the glibc folks have been working on a proposed ABI for x86-64 that groups the feature sets into levels--roughly base (≤SSE2), ≤SSE4.2, ≤AVX2, current skylake-server (a clutch of AVX-512 features), with the BMI and FMA features scattered in there somewhere.<p>That said, the MMX instructions in particular are so problematic to use (and SSE ubiquitous and strictly better) that I suspect you could introduce a processor that lacks MMX support and break almost nobody, certainly far fewer people than removing x87. I don&#x27;t know if there is an implicit or explicit actual dependency on MMX anywhere.')
