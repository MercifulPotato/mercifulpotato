These are from agencies either directly asking for link placements, or offering payed posts, or, the other way round, offering ready made content (which may or may not contain an endorsement of some kind, most probably the latter). One thing these have in common is that those are the most stubborn cold call campaigns, I&#x27;ve ever seen. They do not give up, there&#x27;s a 7th and 8th followup on an answered mail, eventually turning towards the passive-aggressive side. (While, clearly, they couldn&#x27;t be bothered to have just a quick look at the site in question, just to recognise, how inappropriate and meaningless their advances are.) There seems to be quite a flourishing industry behind this.<p>(Not so serious theory regarding overconfident influencers: Maybe they are just copying the style of the agencies, they get their pay checks from.)')
