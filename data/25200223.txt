You can have the best educated drivers and the most draconian enforcement in the world but if everyone else acts like it&#x27;s a college campus you&#x27;re gonna get a lot of red road paint.  The cities without a lot of traffic fatalities tend to have traffic that behaves a lot like the industrial facilities where there aren&#x27;t a lot of traffic mishaps (and industry has been studying this a lot longer because they have an obvious stake in the issue).  Namely classes of traffic have to interact with each over only minimally, interactions only happen in defined places and all classes of traffic behave very conservatively.<p>Also, if people are getting so bent out of shape as to pass you and honk at you with any sort of regularity that&#x27;s a good heuristic for the speed limit and&#x2F;or your adherence to it being inappropriate for the construction and conditions of the road.')
