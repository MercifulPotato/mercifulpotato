I don&#x27;t know how familiar you are with Greenwald&#x27;s work over the years but the reason the tantrum and &#x27;says anyone who disagrees with him is conspiring against him&#x27; charge still sticks is that it represents a long pattern of behaviour on his part. There are, like, twitter parody accounts about this!<p>If you want to compare this with a similar recent situation with an actual high-profile journalist and real high-profile story - Ronan Farrow and his former employer NBC are still bickering over whether NBC unethically spiked his MeToo reporting. I don&#x27;t think at any point either side has emitted a Greenwald-style screed-de-coeur, despite the bitterness of the dispute.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;ronan-farrow-nbc-harvey-weinstein-investigation-timeline-2019-10" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;ronan-farrow-nbc-harvey-wein...</a>')
