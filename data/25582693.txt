Let the companies have a mix of terrible quality and great quality as they wish, and let the market itself decide which products and companies succeed or fail<p>Let a private company, say, Consumer Reports or Vegan International, give their imprimatures to quality.<p>A government, in this specific case of toy drones, is a bit heavy-handed, in my opinion. Would &quot;quality specs&quot; work? Would they be subject to political whims? Would a connected company be able to overwhelm the governmental department dedicated to the quality control of toy drones?<p>Edit: I promise, despite the proximity of &quot;socialist&quot; to &quot;libertarian&quot; in my preamble, this is not an ideological stance. If you have a better idea, I will change my mind! I&#x27;m fine with a downvote, but don&#x27;t just smash it because you disagree. Tell us why :)')
