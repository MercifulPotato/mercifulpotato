It would in effect crystalize massive losses. And, were I asked to advise the GME board, I would tell them it&#x27;s in the best interest long term of the company at this point (because it is). It would also have the benefit of effectively cashing out all the GME longs at once. Otherwise, there&#x27;ll be a frenzy on the way out the door, and the most connected&#x2F;sophisticated people will beat the retail traders.<p>Also, you can&#x27;t run a company into the ground by shorting it. A firm&#x27;s stock price has no inherent effect on its day to day operations. There are plenty of operating companies that are bankrupt. Equally so, GME doesn&#x27;t benefit from the run up in its stock price at all. The only time the market price actually effects a company is when its time to raise or return capital. So the only way GME will actually benefit from this episode is if it sells stock.')
