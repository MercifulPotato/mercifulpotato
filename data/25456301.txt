They said it wasn&#x27;t directly used in most SWE work. That&#x27;s entirely accurate. They did not comment on whether the <i>products</i> of computer science are involved in most software engineering (of course they are, but I don&#x27;t need to remember A* to use a graph database). They did not comment on (rare) roles in which that knowledge is required to make groundbreaking advancements.')
