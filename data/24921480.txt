That&#x27;s why it seems counterproductive to tell a company they should stop taking direct action and start promoting the Green New Deal. It&#x27;s too urgent of a problem to insist that only people with a particular political stance should help.<p>Maybe the specifics of the Green New Deal are getting lost in translation here? The package isn&#x27;t just about climate change; like its namesake, the Green New Deal includes provisions about labor rights, education, healthcare, etc. Not everyone who wants to address climate change will necessarily agree with the Green New Deal proponents on those other problems. (And that glosses over a lot of disagreement even on climate change - for example, the Green New Deal doesn&#x27;t include nuclear power which many people feel is essential.)')
