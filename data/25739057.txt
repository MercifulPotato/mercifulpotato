(I&#x27;m open to changing my mind given sufficient evidence, I&#x27;m just saying that I haven&#x27;t seen it yet.)<p>But this is the equivalent of Facebook saying &quot;hmm, looks like there&#x27;s a fire going on over there, better go and dump a barrel of oil on it to put it out&quot;. Of course people are going to notice that their posts are being deleted. And even if they didn&#x27;t notice, Facebook is loudly and publicly announcing that they are removing those posts. This will naturally result in those people saying, &quot;aha, this confirms that there is a liberal elite conspiracy against folks like me&quot;. It will only make them more certain that the election was stolen.<p>Honestly, I can&#x27;t say I blame them for suspecting a conspiracy, given we&#x27;ve had similar moves by other tech companies. As a generally left wing person, what am I supposed to say? &quot;Yeah, we know that all these social networks are acting all biased and stuff against people with your opinions, but it&#x27;s not actually a conspiracy, just a bunch of people without the ability to predict what others will make of their actions all being idiots at the same time due to simple memetic contagion.&quot; I think that&#x27;s actually what&#x27;s going on, but I can definitely see how from the other side it looks like a conspiracy.')
