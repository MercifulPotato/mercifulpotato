There is an IDE to program it that is not too different from what you use on a regular computer.<p>There are FPGA devices that can take the place of an Arduino or Raspberry Pi that cost from $50 to $500 that have custom programmable logic instead of a microprocessor.<p>In the 1970s, Steve Wozinak designed a Pong game programmed in about 40 logic gates that would change the color of the pixel as the beam scanned across the TV.<p>Today you could connect that $50 FPGA to an HDMI port and make a video game out of logic gates the way Woz did,  the tools are specialized compared to normal programming but better than what Woz had to work with.<p>With a more expensive FPGA you could make something like a Nintendo GameBoy Color by cutting and pasting an open source and&#x2F;or commercial microprocessor design into the FPGA together with your dream logic.<p>---<p>Me the hardware I get into is &quot;printing&quot; in that I make some kind of art print every day.<p>That could be sending shutterfly photos to family,  using a receipt printer to print anime art,  printing 4x6 cards with information graphics,  etc.<p>I fell into it by chance but understand now that it&#x27;s a bridge between the world of digital images that I work in and often play in and the world of physical objects, things I can touch and share with people.')
