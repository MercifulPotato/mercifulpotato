Every single trail, park, you are going to effectively be covered in people, runners panting on the sidewalk an inch from you. It&#x27;s definitely not signaling and I&#x27;d much rather everyone put them on in this case when crowding is the guarantee.<p>I&#x27;d have no issue walking around unmasked if you were out in the middle of the night and you were the only one around, though. But the days are so crowded it&#x27;s pretty much an indoor environment.')
