Theranos is a good example of <i>both</i>, weirdly enough.  Although it all ended rather badly, and in a spectacular way, it worked well (for certain interpretations of that word) for a <i>long</i> time before that.  If they were able to actually leverage the billions they got into materializing the technology claims they made, they would have survived, and the crooks at the helm would still be extremely famous and well off.<p>That&#x27;s probably worth considering when thinking about the people at the helm of a lot of these large companies, especially the ones that lose money quarter after quarter until they eventually don&#x27;t.  That&#x27;s not a position that seems like it rewards integrity.')
