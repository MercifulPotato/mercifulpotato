That doesn&#x27;t mean that society was made for or by the builders. Since academics tend to want to eat as well, you still need somebody to provide the food. If all you have is educated people for whom food production is beneath their qualifications, you&#x27;re going to end up with starving academics lamenting the cruelty of the universe not providing food to them.')
