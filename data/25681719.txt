Item(by='jonnycomputer', descendants=None, kids=[25682485], score=None, time=1610082599, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25681204, text='&gt;&gt; That&#x27;s of course ignoring the fact that Republicans actually gained seats in the house,...<p>&gt;How often do you think this happens? That a president will gain seats in Congress and still lose re-election?<p>Given the non-linearity of the Electoral College, Trump&#x27;s historically low approval numbers, the difference in geographic and institutional levels between Presidential and House elections, and over-the-top gerrymandering, I don&#x27;t think that its so unlikely to be suspicious.<p>In the last 100 years, only four or five incumbents lost re-election, so empirically there just isn&#x27;t enough data to establish a frequency (and even then, lots has changed, in the last 100 years, so who knows, right?). So what you really have is a mental model that says if a party wins in Congress they should win in the Presidential too. Well, in 1960, John Kennedy won, but the Democrats lost 21 House seats, and in 1992 Bill Clinton won the White House and the Dems lost 9 seats in the house, and in in 2000 George Bush won the White House and the Republican Party lost 2 seats in the House, in 2016 Donald Trump won, and the Republican Party lost six seats.<p>I might also mention all those Republican governors in blue states...<p>I know what you are going to say. That doesn&#x27;t match the exact scenario where an incumbent lost but their party gained seat. But you need to justify why that particular scenario is relevantly different than ones that have already been known to have occurred.')
