Now in a small start-up, what are the &quot;enterprise rules&quot;, is &quot;enterprise&quot; not merely a buzzword in this context? And how ABRs and EBRs differ is not well explained.<p>In MA this is much clearer: the Data Access Layer (DAL) contains DAOs (the persistence side of the model in MVC), Business Layer (BL) contains the business&#x2F;domain logic (the other side of the M in MVC and&#x2F;or the business logic that may end up in the C of MVC; aka services in Rails), the Application Layer (AL) contains what would be typical &quot;controller logic&quot; (authorization&#x2F;redirection&#x2F;data gathering for the presentation) in MVC and the Presentation Layer (PL) contains the V from MVC.<p>&gt; [...] I think it&#x27;s important to not overly do it.<p>Yups. So maybe one can do without a BL at first, and put the business logic in the DAL at first and dont mind to have a litttttle bit of it creaping into the AL (controller).')
