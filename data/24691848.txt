I nap in the parking lot.<p>and this is exactly my point. you think being tired is exceptional, something you just &quot;nap&quot; and solve. you have clearly never been exhausted for months on end. I have. I have nodded off on highways, and worked with people that fell asleep at stoplights. not everyone gets to have 9 hours of sleep and then work 8 hours in a chair.<p>&gt; None of that is an excuse to get behind a many thousand pound piece of equipment and not be able to control it.<p>i&#x27;m glad youre so concerned about public safety, but those people are probably more concerned about eating and paying rent (or their infant, or dying parent, etc).<p>&gt; I stand behind my assertion and hope you&#x27;ll come around.<p>this isnt about me or my opinion. there are literal millions of people that simply cannot do what you propose (and millions more that will not because they dont share your opinion in the grayer areas), despite your objection that &quot;None of that is an excuse&quot;. you seem to be confused about what options people have.')
