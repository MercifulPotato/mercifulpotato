They&#x27;re looking in all directions at once by having 2, and now three detectors on different parts of the planet.<p>So when one thinks it&#x27;s seen a GW, it has to correlate the observance with the others, and then they can say &quot;Okay, so given the timing, which way did it come from?&quot; and get a very rough direction. If it&#x27;s a potential neutron star merger, they can then have everyone swing their telescopes in that direction to hopefully see it happen.')
