Firstly, ranked choice voting is so much better than first-past-the-post and you should do it.<p>But since you asked, Australia has seen one problem in recent years.  But this is a problem specific to the conditions we have here.  Firstly, some background:<p>1. In the Australian Senate, the single pool of voters from the state are deciding on 12 senators (EDIT: oops, should be 6).  This is decided by running the ranked-choice algorithm until 12 remain (EDIT: 6).<p>2. In the Senate, there are now dozens of parties, so the ballot is hilariously wide.<p>3. Australia has compulsory preferencing.  You MUST rank all parties on the ballot.<p>4. Because you can&#x27;t expect the population to rank dozens of candidates at the polling booth, each party can decide for their voters what order to rank the other parties.  So how do the parties decide how to rank the other parties? Backroom deals.  Who knows what the terms of the deals are.  In any case, it&#x27;s not the voters who decide.<p>The result is that minor parties like the Sports Party and the Motoring Enthusiasts Party, who each get almost no direct votes, jostled their way up just high enough on the preference lists of enough major parties that they ended up snagging one of the seats.<p>More details here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fairvote.org&#x2F;reforming-the-australian-senate" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fairvote.org&#x2F;reforming-the-australian-senate</a><p>But as I said, this is made possible by the specific conditions of the electoral system here.  It wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if the election were for a single candidate, or if there were no party-defined preferences (necessitating non-mandatory ranking).')
