This was a time when WhatsApp was found using a plaintext protocol, and right after the Snowden revelations. They did move the needle a bit at the right time.<p>One of the most vocal critics was Moxie, who later founded Signal. It&#x27;s ironic that 7 years after Snowden and Telegram, Signal the supposed more secure and privacy focused messaging app still has yet to gain any sizable foothold in the market. I think that says a lot about both Telegram and Signal&#x27;s product strategies.')
