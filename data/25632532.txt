You are being put on a stick and held over a bon fire and all you do is scream “turn me quicker“!<p>What life is this to work your ass off for a company that demands crazy work hours, that can fire you for any reason with laughable notice period, gives you almost no vacation, no maternity leave and when you get sick, you lose your health insurance and end up on the streets.
