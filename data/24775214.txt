The hardware is fairly complex, vendors initially packaged their own OS along with the hardware with fairly rudimentary functionality and a terrible experience. It took the iPhone and Android to really redefine mobile and make sense of that complex platform.<p>Cloud feels the same. Its complex hardware now governed by the likes of AWS who have packaged their own horrible &quot;OS&quot; on top and unique snowflake APIs. GCP is slightly better but the reality is its all still fairly hard to get your head around. What I wonder is whether we&#x27;ll see an operating system for the Cloud. I don&#x27;t think kubernetes is that. Its a kernel but I don&#x27;t think it really has that user friendly experience we&#x27;re looking for or really even defines the category of Cloud.<p>What would something like this even look like? I&#x27;d say maybe CLI driven and a focus on creating APIs that are all uniform. I don&#x27;t know if a web experience would even really exist for it but if it did I know it would be a fairly standardised single view pane.<p>Thoughts?')
