Item(by='jerf', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606932734, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25278757, text='Many repliers are computing the probability of this exact draw, but probably a more relevant consideration of &quot;this&quot; is &quot;the odds of a &#x27;suspiciously regular&#x27; combination being drawn&quot;. The probability of one of those occurring is (the number of such sequences you name):42,375,200, or that number over 42,375,200.<p>There is some inherent fuzziness in what you consider a &quot;suspicious sequence&quot;, obviously. If you stick to entire sequences you don&#x27;t get very many; however, if you consider &quot;1 2 3 4 5&quot; in the original numbers to be suspicious regardless of the bonus ball draw, then the number of such sequences starts going up fairly quickly. (Include things like [1,3,5,7,9], [2,4,6,8,10], [3,6,9,12,15], etc.)<p>It&#x27;s pretty easy to get up to a couple thousand &quot;suspicious sequences&quot;. For the sake of roundness and being a bit conservative, let&#x27;s say there are 423 &quot;suspicious sequences&quot;, in which case the odds of hitting one are roughly 1 in 100,000. You may choose to add another order of magnitude of &quot;suspicious sequences&quot; pretty easily, in which case it goes to 1 in 10,000. Given the number of draws done for this sort of lottery (dozens or hundreds a day, I&#x27;d guess), it&#x27;s inevitable that sooner or later one would be hit on lotteries of this size.<p>Some of the challenge in weighting the number of sequences is they aren&#x27;t all equally &quot;suspicious&quot;. [1,2,3,4,5] is what most people would consider a &quot;dead giveaway&quot; (right or wrong), whereas [1,2,4,8,16,32] would probably bother fewer people. Some people might still find even [1,2,3,4,18,bonus 6] suspicious (&quot;look how &#x27;close&#x27; it was to 12345!&quot;). So there&#x27;s just some intrinsic fuzziness to the answer of how likely this is.')
