If they get to be stringent about how good we would &quot;fit&quot;, then so should job candidates.<p>And ironically given the thread we&#x27;re in about &#x27;over optimization&#x27;, it&#x27;s just not worth the time to me to wait until getting an offer to find out the engineering culture believes in &#x27;drinking from the firehose&#x27;. I want to know that early, so as to self-select out.')
