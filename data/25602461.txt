The difference between gold and other forms of alternative currency, is the ease at which it can be transferred.<p>This whole situation only works, in the case where it is simple and easy to transfer between the deflationary, and non deflationary currency.<p>Obviously, the ease at which it is possible to transfer currency to other people, is an important factor as to why someone would or would not use a currency.<p>&gt; if goods are priced in national currency, it&#x27;s handy to keep your working capital in that same currency.<p>Not necessarily.  If there are easy ways of instantly transforming your deflationary currency, automatically, without you having to do anything, into that other currency, then there is no need to hold that other currency.<p>&gt;  Why do people want USD instead of gold?<p>Obviously it is because it is pretty difficult to spend gold at your supermarket.<p>This isn&#x27;t a problem though, if you have a cryptocurrency credit card, for example, that immediately turns your deflationary crypto, into USD.')
