Have seen the customer antenna in pictures and it looks like a parabola, but there has also been a lot of talk about beamforming and antenna arrays so I&#x27;m curious to see the spec, pictures and get info about how it is supposed to work.<p>Also interested if someone could provide link budget input (output power, antenna gain) for Starlink operating at 12GHz (at 550 km altitude) and 39 GHz (at 350 km altitude) respectively.')
