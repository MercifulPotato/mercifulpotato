The simulation shows that traffic can be described in much simpler terms.<p>You&#x27;ll notice that traffic is actually a longitudinal wave that travels through the system. The cars are particles and traffic is crests in the wave.<p>The wave usually travels backwards against the direction of the cars. The worst type of traffic is when you get a standing wave where the crest of the wave just stays in the same place.<p>Take a look at the simulation with this knowledge in mind. Then you will actually see the wave.<p>An elegant solution to alleviating traffic would be to then take techniques that dampen waves in materials and translate them into techniques that work for traffic.')
