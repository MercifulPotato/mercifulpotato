May not work if your version of “outside” is either too far away from civilization for the shared AR part to work <i>or</i> too high-risk to be going out in a lot (I live in a medium-density area of city, which seems roughly ideal).<p>I was able to keep up some ad-hoc home bodyweight exercises with Habitica (gamified habits) + Forest (pomodoro-ish app) earlier in the year, but that fell apart a few months later when the depression got worse, and I haven&#x27;t managed to pick it up again yet.')
