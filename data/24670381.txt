It&#x27;s riddled with bugs, years old, yet they keep adding new, unnecessary features like video chat to justify their insanely priced &quot;unlimited&quot; subscription.<p>This year there have been a few months where your own profile data would not load, making you think you&#x27;d lost your profile data and having to create it all again. Yet all you needed to do was to restart the app ~10 times to get it to load.<p>Sometimes messages just... get lost in the ether.<p>The &quot;online now&quot; notification is flaky.<p>Grindr Online (web browser) is a whole new mess. I haven&#x27;t used it in a long while, but the first months it felt as &quot;professional&quot; as an interns side project. Also you need to keep Grindr open on the phone while using it, kind of beating the purpose.<p>The setting to use the metric system still resets to imperial regularly.<p>The app is full of fakers, yet they still have no identity validation feature.')
