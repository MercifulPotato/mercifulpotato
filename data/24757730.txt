We have a few helicopter parents that feel the need to monitor their kids constantly, but for the most part, the parks, buses, restaurants, convenience stores, etc are all full of kids&#x2F;teens.  They don&#x27;t even really cause trouble either.  You&#x27;d think a group of teenage boys would be assholes, but nope, they just kind of mind their own business.<p>Once you get to the cookie-cutter subdivisions in the far suburbs, that&#x27;s when the kids all disappear.  Part of it might be helicopter parenting, but I think it&#x27;s caused mostly by a lack of any outdoor activities.  Riding your bike means going to the next subdivision over.  Repeat that a half-dozen times and you get to a heavily trafficked road that can be followed for a few miles to a strip mall with a Target.  Even all of the nice parks in these places are only accessible via car -- surrounded on all sized by 4-6 lane traffic going 45+MPH.')
