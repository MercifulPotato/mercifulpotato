That&#x27;s the more troubling bit.<p>Docker containers are an amalgamation of features, tweaks, and functions which combine together into one experience. There is no kernel concept of a container. There are cgroups, namespaces, capabilities, chroots, CoW Overlay VFS, bind mounts, firewalls, virtual networking... And a whole lot of custom crap Docker provides. You have to have a lot of custom glue to make it all work. You need &quot;a Docker&quot;.<p>Every attempt to make a replacement for Docker falls short because of how many things it has to touch to make things easy to use. To replace it all (since it&#x27;s not an OS primitive) requires product development, which is expensive and complicated, and probably not vendor-compatible with Docker anyway. So you might as well just have people run Docker.<p>Containers fundamentally change the concepts used to maintain and operate applications in OSes. I think eventually they will become core features, but it&#x27;s going to take a while. Someone&#x27;s going to need to start sending in some pretty big patch sets one piece at a time, such as kernel drivers for all the various features. OCI also needs a lot more help before we can run a container everywhere, and it will undoubtedly involve some virtualization layers we don&#x27;t yet use as part of containers, which will add more complexity.')
