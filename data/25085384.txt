Item(by='dheera', descendants=None, kids=[25085901], score=None, time=1605290830, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25085305, text='&gt; Device requests are based on device identifiers such as Apple serial number, IMEI or MEID.<p>At least for the device part, if you use an open source OS like LineageOS, you can fake all of these things so that it&#x27;s not even a question. One of the biggest privacy disadvantages of iOS is that Apple maintains total control over the system and therefore they can be compelled by governments to serve these requests, whereas on my &quot;Google&quot; phone I can actually prevent Google from being able to serve them. Sure, the default OS Google supplies may track the hell out of you, but at least you have the <i>option</i> to load your own OS onto the device.<p>I find it extremely annoying that Apple continues to play the &quot;we&#x27;re the good guys&quot; card while there is absolutely no data on how Apple themselves track and use your personal data. I would much prefer the system itself were designed such that you have the ability to restrict data collection from even Apple themselves, and that there is clear proof of that fact.')
