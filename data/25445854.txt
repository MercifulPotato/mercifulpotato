Item(by='tzs', descendants=None, kids=[25446058], score=None, time=1608141575, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25444567, text='&gt; The tests that swab your nose or throat and take multiple days are called &quot;molecular&quot; tests and are considered highly accurate<p>...<p>&gt; Tests like this 15 min one are called &quot;antigen&quot; tests and are still accurate&#x2F;helpful, but are known to produce more false negatives and false positives compared to molecular.<p>You are correct on &quot;molecular&quot; vs. &quot;antigen&quot; tests in regard to false negatives&#x2F;positives, but you can&#x27;t rely on whether or not a test swabs your nose to tell them apart. This newly approved test is indeed an anitgen test, but you collect your sample via nose swab.<p>Here are the accuracy numbers for this new test, in comparison to a laboratory RT-PCR test.<p>This test has a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 100% for people with COVID symptoms, and 91% sensitivity and 96% specificity for asymptomatic people [1].<p><i>Sensitivity</i> is how well a test identifies patients <i>WITH</i> the disease.<p><i>Specificity</i> is how well a test identifies patients <i>WITHOUT</i> the disease.<p>For completeness, there is a third type of test, an &quot;antibody&quot; test. The molecular tests and the antigen tests try to answer the question &quot;Do I have COVID right now?&quot;. The antibody tests try to answer the question &quot;Have I had COVID in the past?&quot;.<p>Antibody tests typically involve taking a blood sample.<p>I&#x27;m hoping for a cheap, readily available antibody test. I&#x27;ve had enough COVID symptoms at various times over the last few months that it would not surprise me if I had had it, although I probably haven&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;m overweight and have high blood pressure and approaching retirement age, which on some vaccine distribution plans I&#x27;ve seen would get me fairly early access once the health care and elderly are taken care of. If I&#x27;ve already had COVID, though, I&#x27;m fine with waiting until it is generally available to all. An antibody test would help with that decision.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ellumehealth.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;10&#x2F;ellumes-covid-19-home-test-shows-96-accuracy-in-multi-site-us-clinical-study&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ellumehealth.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;10&#x2F;ellumes-covid-19-hom...</a>')
