These include Dempster-Shafer functions,\npossibility measures, and plausibility measures (see [Halpern, 2017] for an overview and comparison, which includes ranking theory). Possibility measures measure uncertainty on an arbitrary totally ordered scale, such as the integer scale from 0 to âˆž (making them equivalent to ranking functions) or real numbers from the interval [0, 1]. The latter is often chosen to model vagueness or fuzziness. Possibility theory has been used to equip logic programming and answer set programming with the ability to deal with uncertainty [Nicolas et al., 2006; Bauters et al., 2010; Alsinet and Godo, 2000]&quot;.')
