If the position is time sensitive - the fires being put out tend to have a &lt;1 day time limit, I want an older (45+) person in that position. Not for their experience, but for their ability to recall and store memories.<p>In my experience, older employees are able to recall information to solve a problem, but the recall may be incomplete, leading to a quicker, but less effective solution. Whereas, younger employees often need more time because they don&#x27;t specifically remember solutions, but they are able to find, categorize, and process information faster, often leading to a slower, but more complete and robust solution.<p>Not sure if it&#x27;s a product of education and upbringing in different worlds, or a product of experience, but it&#x27;s fascinating to me.')
