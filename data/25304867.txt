Though I&#x27;m a Doom user, spacemacs is much more approachable out of the box. You can just uncomment things and have it work well.\n* Use Emacs 27.1 or later because it has faster JSON parsing -&gt; crucial for good LSP performance<p>A few ways to get started are learning how to search for things within Emacs:<p>* C-h f: find documentation for any function by name\n* C-k k: find the documentation for any keystroke function\n* If you want to see what commands are going on: install command-log-mode. it will give you a buffer to see what commands you run with every keystroke\n* I don&#x27;t remember if spacemacs has it or not, but the following two packages are crucial when you want to learn more: which-key (to show the keys available when you press something like C-x) and helpful mode [0]. I&#x27;m pretty sure spacemacs has these by default, but if not they&#x27;re golden!')
