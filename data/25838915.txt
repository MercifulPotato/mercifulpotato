Whether thats through Serverless Framework or CDK (using SST <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;serverless-stack&#x2F;serverless-stack" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;serverless-stack&#x2F;serverless-stack</a>). So in the case of SAM it would be similar, deploying the CF stack on the users behalf. The deployments process roughly looks like: install dependencies &gt; package functions &gt; generate CF stack &gt; deploy it &gt; monitor progress. We do some optimizations along those steps but thats the gist of how it works.<p>Hope that helps. Feel free to get in touch if you want to know more jay@seed.run')
