It was a DMCA section 1201 notice. Section 1201, which criminalizes circumvention of access controls, has nothing to do with copyright.<p>John Deere uses it to go after sellers of unauthorized replacement parts for their tractors.<p>Non-compliance is a felony carrying a 5 year &#x2F; $500k punishment. Unlike takedown notices, there&#x27;s no counter-notice opportunity for the receiving party. So if the receiving party believed the notice isn&#x27;t valid, they&#x27;ll need to argue that as a criminal defendant in criminal court.')
