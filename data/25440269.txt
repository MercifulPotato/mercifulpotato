(I generally don&#x27;t complain much about ux&#x2F;ui, but this is a real mess).<p>- Are management aware that many of us badly wanted to support the Firefox &#x2F; Servo teams while we just as badly don&#x27;t want to support the people who fired lots of them, agreed to shady extension deals etc? (Personally I would accept a <i>heartfelt</i> apology and a change in direction.)')
