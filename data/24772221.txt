Remember, they can go to Phase2 cause their proposal-number is the largest ever seen when they are the first.<p>Proposer-A received Phase2 votes from nodes n_1,...n_f and Proposer-B received one vote from n_f+1 when power is off and other nodes n_f+2, n_f+3...n_2f+1 don&#x27;t know anything about the Phase2.<p>Now, consider the case when power is back and only the first F+1 nodes came back online. System is expected to continue with F+1 live nodes.<p>Proposer-C now does Phase-1 with the same proposal-number. He is expected to pick the already voted value associated with the max proposal-number from the Phase-1 responses, but there are two different values and he can&#x27;t determine what to pick.')
