These rules again tend to allow everything, and at least on earlier builds from like 2018 they would reset to allow everything on _every_ update.<p>This was such a pain to deal with.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;az767233.vo.msecnd.net&#x2F;images&#x2F;Security&#x2F;win8_winfirewall_allowapp_addanother.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;az767233.vo.msecnd.net&#x2F;images&#x2F;Security&#x2F;win8_winfirew...</a>')
