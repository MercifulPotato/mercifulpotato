I just either run `code .` (like I did on macOS) or select recent folder from within VS Code. It all just works fairly well, identical to ‘natively’ within Windows (except the occasional ts slowdown I mentioned before).<p>&gt; And these people rarely have an excuse for why they prefer windows<p>Not that anyone needs an ‘excuse’ for their personal preference, but I would actually prefer macOS. But I got a Windows PC to use software that only runs on Windows (games) and then the whole wfh thing happened and here we are. I’m not interested in rebooting between different operating systems when I switch tasks, especially when they overlap (developing for games).<p>Convince Bungie to port their game to macOS and I’ll buy a Mac Pro to be back home on a Mac full time :)')
