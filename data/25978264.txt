Getting the argmax of a multi-dimensional array, in terms of the array&#x27;s dimensions, is difficult for new users.<p>np.argmax(np.array([[1,2,3],[1,9,3],[1,2,3]])) is 4, rather than (1,1). I understand why, but it seems strange to me that argmax cannot return a value the user can use to index their array.<p>Having to then feed that `4` into unravel_index() with the array&#x27;s shape as a parameter seems less elegant than say passing a parameter of &quot;as_index=True&quot; to the argmax.')
