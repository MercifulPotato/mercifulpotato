It makes sense to value safety so highly if your code is safety-critical (operating systems, aerospace, automotive, etc.), but it&#x27;s much less valuable when safety isn&#x27;t as important (e.g. in games).<p>Just want to note that there is a large benefit to this kind of safety even if you&#x27;re not writing safety-critical code: lack of bugs! The biggest benefit I&#x27;ve seen from rust is that entire classes of bugs, some of which can be extremely difficult to root cause and fix, are removed by design. So you spend significantly less time on the later half of the project tracking down bugs, which is more than enough to offset the productivity loss at the beginning.')
