Additionally, having service reps find and cite the exact violated terms costs a lot of time <i>and it would not even matter</i> - FB is free to ban you if it wants, the specific reasoning would be more of a FYI.<p>And, of course, in cases like this, where the ban was presumably unjustified or unnecessary, this is rather cruel. I fully agree. But on the other hand, FB bans probably hit bots 99% of the time and, even if not, are usually justified [0]. Opening up such a large attack surface and spending large amounts of money for the few cases where it hits a innocent (?) person is just not viable, and, as bad as it is, I can understand Facebook here.<p>The moral of the story is, as mentioned in the article, that the actual error was to rely on Facebook.<p>[0] I have obviously no hard data on this, but if this would happen a lot, it would be quite bad press. So I&#x27;m very sure that FB would tackle this problem if users would actually become scared of a false ban.')
