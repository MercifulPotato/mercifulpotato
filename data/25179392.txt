Terminator 2 in 1992 was way more successful maybe because in 1984 it was the soviets who were supposed to drop the bomb but in 1991 there were no more soviets so it&#x27;s was more plausible to fear from the machines?<p>Robocop did question the technology but also the good guy was a half robot.<p>Blade Runner is a good example about a tech dystopia but the story is ultimately about the machines quest to be humans, not to destroy them.')
