Item(by='d33kay', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609132792, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25549841, text='1. Quitting a very stable tech job to start a company. I was 40, had a one year old and stay at home wife<p>2. Trying everything possible to make the company a success. Learning a lot in the process.<p>3. Realizing 2 years later, the business wasn&#x27;t going to work. Shutting it down while I had some money left in the bank and finding a full time job. Ironically, the new company valued the combination of professional and founder experience highly, and I ended up with a 40% bump from my pre-founder income<p>4. Then prioritizing paying off nearly $70k in credit card debt (business related) over the next couple of years. Again, learning a lot in the process.<p>5. Consciously communicating and making decisions with the wife throughout the journey. Now it seems like if we could survive that experience financially, we can survive anything.<p>I learnt more about risk, negotiation, personal finances, communication and above all my own biases &amp; limitations in these 4 years than in my 15 years of career prior to that. Wouldn&#x27;t trade for anything.')
