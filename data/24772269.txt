Of course, in that world anyone can do anything with it including things you may not like; a sacrifice you voluntarily choose to make. But that is (virtually) no different from what people could do today, in <i>this</i> world, by giving users (UN)license to do anything they want. From this perspective it seems clear to me why you choose to publish to the public domain, because the outcome is the same as it would be in the world you want. And with that, the fact that you are opposed to plagiarism seems almost immaterial; yes, plagiarism is bad but believing that something is bad doesn&#x27;t equate to believing that there should be a law to restrict it.')
