There&#x27;s some sort of temporary workspace, but I haven&#x27;t really found a use for those and they aren&#x27;t really documented. However, with the new fuzzy window finder, you can just minimize windows and than search to bring them up  quickly and with minimal key strokes.<p>Another thing: the readme hasn&#x27;t been updated since the last big changes, so you&#x27;ll find that you&#x27;re gonna have to install more dependencies then it says.')
