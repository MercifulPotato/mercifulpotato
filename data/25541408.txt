Environmentalists will never happy until the world&#x27;s population is so low that they feel like &#x27;nature&#x27; is unaffected by humans. In reality that means they want the world to themselves and anyone with any other interests to be plant fertilizer. There haven&#x27;t been a specific kind of fish there for _eighty_ years and it hasn&#x27;t impacted human life so why do we need to spend tax dollars to have them there now? It is complete lunacy based on a fetish for a &#x27;natural&#x27; state that isn&#x27;t real. News flash, humans are natural and I don&#x27;t loathe them like some environmentalists do. People are starving and dying of viruses (both &#x27;natural&#x27; states I&#x27;ll add) but we need to spend our time and money building a fucking ladder for a fish? I speak truth even though I will be downvoted into oblivion. Worth it.')
