Especially employment related. Whenever I&#x27;ve pushed back on an employment contract, NDA, or similar it&#x27;s always met with sudden confusion - as though this has never happened before. In fairness, it&#x27;s almost never met with negatively. But it shows that no one else has ever bothered to question it. And when I talk to colleagues I definitely get the sense that no one ever really reads these things or questions them.')
