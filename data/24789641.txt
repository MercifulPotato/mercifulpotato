I&#x27;m not convinced that WFH changes the net demand for these services. if these businesses move away from places people commute to and move into places where people actually live, I would consider that an improvement. I&#x27;d much rather spend my food budget on happy hour at a local pub than a rushed 30 minute lunch.')
