I don&#x27;t go outside much, but I started pokemon go during covid-19, and it gives me a reason to head outside on a brisk walk to put a pokemon in a gym, or do a raid everyday. They doubled the distance you can reach gyms, so I can stand safely on the other side of the street from the gym and still be able to raid.')
