The basic idea is to define f(x) = sum_n f_n x^n where f_n satisfies some recursion equation. Very often you can find f(x) as p(x) &#x2F; q(x) where p and q are polynomials in x. Now you can simply evaluate f(0.1) or more generally f(b^-l) where b is a base and l a positive integer, which gives you on the left-hand side your rational number as a fraction, and on the right-hand side the decimal expansion.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.math.upenn.edu&#x2F;~wilf&#x2F;gfologyLinked2.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.math.upenn.edu&#x2F;~wilf&#x2F;gfologyLinked2.pdf</a>')
