Even the example of making a faster application, it&#x27;s literally only useful in that it increases how quickly you generate user value.<p>At some point once you generate enough value for your end user, the utility will outweigh a given latency problem.<p>Even making your server costs cheaper with optimization really matters because you can transform the savings into user value that exceeds the cost of optimizing.<p>So it really doesn&#x27;t make sense to thumb your nose down at people who are &quot;just sticking stuff they don&#x27;t understand together&quot; in a vaccum like they tend to do.<p>You don&#x27;t know their runway.<p>You don&#x27;t know how concrete their business case is.<p>You don&#x27;t know their development budget.<p>The moment you&#x27;re making a dichotomy between yourself and &quot;those programmers who just put shiny legos they don&#x27;t understand together&quot;, you&#x27;re demonstrating a lack of understanding of the bigger picture that development fits in.<p>Because sometimes hiring someone who has little experience outside clicking those legos together <i>is all that allows an idea to exist.</i><p>tl;dr: A service that loads with 100 requests instead of 1 because the developer doesn&#x27;t know better still generates more value to the end user than one that doesn&#x27;t exist.')
