From a hardware standpoint they don&#x27;t have variable resistance. Our electronically controlled resistance adds up to 100+ lbs of force. Our high-intensity content, which differentiates us, requires this and the reason why we opted to build our own rower. When it comes to content, Ergatta has gamified workouts, whereas we have actual video games like Brick Breaker, races against Olympic athletes, guided strength programs that automatically adjust the resistance and let you use the rower for more than just rowing; like bicep curls and dips.')
