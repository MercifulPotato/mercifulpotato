In the EU EULAs (the dystopian construct that you&#x27;d expect to enforce that bit of lunacy) that purport to apply to content you have already accessed are not legally valid. Leaving the legal interpretation aside, me doing one thing doesn&#x27;t mean consent for something else. Believing otherwise is both unethical and amoral, stances I don&#x27;t hugely feel like interacting with.')
