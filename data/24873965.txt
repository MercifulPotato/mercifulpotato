Call the real __cxa_throw if there&#x27;s no dynamic handler.<p>To top it off, you can provide a &quot;restart&quot; class that this new __cxa_throw treats like ordinary C++ exceptions, and throw an instance of it to perform the &quot;exit&quot;.<p>I have no idea if this hack would comply with the standard, but it works with GCC.<p>You&#x27;d be missing COMPUTE-RESTARTS, however, so there&#x27;d be no asking the user where to jump.')
