At the moment I&#x27;ve got a particularly good contact with a local printers for the alu sheets and a full six vane version is costing me about $22 total.<p>The sheets are usually pretty easy to find, just ring around any printing companies in your area which do offset printing and you should find someone to sell them used to you for about $1-2 each.\nSometimes they just give them to me for free.<p>Any ~0.3mm alu sheet will work just as well, but will cost more if bought new.\nSteel will work structurally, but is a lot harder to bend and cut so won&#x27;t really work with the process documented in the tutorial.<p>The turbine (as in the general Lenz2 design, not my specific build) has been independently tested to about 25-35% mechanical efficiency, and does particularly well in turbulent and low clearance wind conditions compared to most horizontal axis turbines.<p>My website is indeed a bit bad. Sorry about that.<p>Anything else you&#x27;d like to know?')
