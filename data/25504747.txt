Also, I&#x27;m not comfortable supporting or empathizing with anybody so certain about their &quot;stellar, fantastic, greatest in history&quot; profile.<p>It would be interesting to hear what were the performance&#x2F;carrier paths of those 300 people she hired, to understand whether they really just needed a leg-up. That would validate her hunch about untapped potential. On the other hand I&#x27;m afraid that it&#x27;s likely that if they were not promoted it would be again blamed on racism, because if you have that one differentiator, it can be used in any situation.<p>(Yes, I&#x27;m aware that this comment is not going to be palatable to politically correct majority).')
