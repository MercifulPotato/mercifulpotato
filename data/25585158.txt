Then you also need those people to agree on what that system should look like (the models vary greatly). There are likely some complaints about the system that you say worked. Everyone has different experiences.<p>Right now, both &quot;sides&quot; agree that costs are out of control, but generally disagree on what reforms to make. This is the case for many other subjects in politics - the sides might agree with the problem but disagree on the cause or solution.<p>I think the system has stopped really listening to the people and to the concerns of the other side. It seems both parties try to win full control of the government to  ram through whatever their party wants rather than work together. Part of this could be that we have handled most of the common topics and now we are left with the urban vs rural topics&#x2F;solutions. If you look at the other developed countries you talk of, the urbanization ratios are higher than in the US, so basically one side has won out over the other (in general).<p>Lobbying itself is not a bad thing that should be outlawed. It shouldn&#x27;t involve money from corporations in my opinion. You do have groups that lobby on behalf of individual members. I don&#x27;t see a problem with that, if the money is not from corporations.')
