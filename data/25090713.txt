So any time anyone who raises an insanity defense is allowed to go free, society is taking a risk.<p>In the particular case discussed in this article, I&#x27;m not sure there was much of a risk, since the reason for the claimed insanity was a very particular situation and it was directed at particular individuals. There was no evidence that the defendant was likely to harm anyone else. But of course that&#x27;s not true in many cases involving an insanity defense.')
