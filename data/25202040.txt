We use electoral college. And the media is overplaying this to induce panic from people like you. He’s not going to stage a coup, and if he did, even the republicans would stand against him. Calm down.<p>This is nonsense. Trump is openly trying to overturn the popular vote in PA, GA, MI, etc. That is how electoral votes are decided. He has openly called for the legislature to overturn the popular vote in these states based on nothing.<p>This isn&#x27;t some outlier. He made similar accusations about fraud in 2016, and even in a race during the primaries against Ted Cruz.<p>He has already tried to stage a coup. We are past that point.<p>I do want the parties to work together, but I don&#x27;t know what to do about these 2 bubbles I see being created on the right and left of these very deep fantasy worlds.<p>It is like the world of LOTR, where you read about hobbits, and then there are all these stories about hobbits and this deep web of information about this world that doesn&#x27;t exist. Except now the right and left are creating these worlds and people can&#x27;t tell it isn&#x27;t real.<p>This has been a growing problem, and it is now at the point where it is threatening our democracy.')
