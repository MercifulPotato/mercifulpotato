For many people like me, amphetamines help them live a normal life. The app isn’t called “meth” or “methamphetamine” and it’s not referring to a street drug.<p>I’m saddened to see so many equating amphetamines to illicit drugs, when that’s simply not the full story. This perception is exactly what stops people from taking their medication when they should and balking at the idea of a medication being able to help them.')
