Since there&#x27;s none in California, the strategy to retain employees is to tie their income to equity in the company. That creates a moat around hiring engineers from a competitor (you&#x27;ll have to match the equity if you want to hire!). There&#x27;s also labor laws that makes it hard to fire someone; these incentivize the business owner to pay less so that a bad hire has less of an effect. There&#x27;s also, in a lot of EU countries, so much taxes that it&#x27;s helpful early one to hire specialized accountants just to claim all the possible subsidies for the business. It can be worth it for businesses with 5 employees. Adding that extra salary will leave less for the early employees.<p>There&#x27;s also the fact that some companies simply don&#x27;t see the value of software, at all. They have a software division but don&#x27;t treat it as the core of their business. In their mind, it&#x27;s simply a tool for the business (despite the whole business depending on it sometimes!). So they treat software as a cost center and that drives engineers to tech-focused companies that are clustered in the US. Prime example of that is banking, where no matter how much revenue is directly tied to software, it&#x27;s still considered a cost center.<p>Finally, in some market there&#x27;s simply a talent gap. Ontario, and Canada, strikes me as one since I&#x27;ve met a few Canadians who jumped the border to Silicon Valley but never actually met a Silicon Valley engineer moving up north.')
