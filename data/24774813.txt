Is Netflix story done? Do Disney and Amazon end up dominating the aisle in a couple years?<p>But this story feels slightly different than the tooth paste story. There is that scene in GoT where the knight stands protecting a big secret. Challengers arrive. The knight knows this is going to be a fight to the death, as the secret is that important. And he says, &quot;Now it begins&quot;.<p>And the challenger replies &quot;No now it ends&quot;.<p>What matters is neither the knight or the challenger but the secret.')
