There&#x27;s even a chance that an M5 will get better fuel consumption than a Prius due to the way the test was designed: making the Prius run at the absolute limit in circumstances that cannot be replicated in any reasonably legal setup on a public road, like racing. Even when &quot;cruising&quot; at top speed the Prius should be more efficient than the M5 at the same speed.<p>An M5 won&#x27;t have better fuel consumption than a &quot;normal&quot; small car in any situation that you could reasonably see on the road.')
