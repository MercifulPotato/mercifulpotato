Most of the above products (Redis, Elasticsearch, MongoDB, etc.) don&#x27;t have &quot;thousands of individual contributors&quot; and are developed primarily by employees of the backing companies.<p>Second, external contributors can use it in their work in any way that they want so long as it&#x27;s not in offering Elasticsearch-as-a-service. They can even use for offering Elasticsearch-as-a-service so long as it&#x27;s based on the current Apache2-licensed code rather than the SSPL-licensed code that will be in effect as of the next Elasticsearch release.<p>There are certainly valid criticisms of this decision, but a blanket statement that &quot;thousands of individual contributors&quot; are the losers here is an exaggeration.')
