Building something like that with the 5&quot; 800 x 480 IPS screen that STM has on the STM32F469i-Disco board would be heaven. It is on my long list of things which I will likely not get around to before I die :-).  You could swap the STM32F769 for the &#x27;F469 if you wanted more mips. I&#x27;d pay $300 for one of those, if you&#x27;re wondering.')
