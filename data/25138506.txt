Very different. And the primary reason is that unlike TV and books, this is an interactive device explicitly designed to manipulate our psychology into using it more, on a scale we&#x27;ve never seen before. Books never had thousands of engineers observing realtime metrics to make small tweaks to make you use something just a little bit longer. TV isn&#x27;t a bi-directional communication platform that has thrown teenagers into an arena where they&#x27;re communicating with thousands of people at a time when they&#x27;re still figuring out how to communicate in small groups.<p>Regarding (2), I think people are being far too critical. The author acknowledges many of their own missteps, and they&#x27;re also going through a time where, iPhone or not, their daughter is growing apart from them, and I imagine that&#x27;s very difficult emotionally. I also feel like they really humanized how budging a little bit on rules here and there can spiral out of control, and how that feels. I really appreciated that perspective.')
