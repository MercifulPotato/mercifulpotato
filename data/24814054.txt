The US is better off for not having censorship. Free speech is messy. But it beats the alternative.<p>It&#x27;s useful to read what the extremists have to say, if you read the extremists from both sides. You can still read Dabiq, ISIL&#x27;s magazine, online. (That may have backfired. Their position was, it&#x27;s a war to the death between our Islam and everybody else. The opposition agreed and crushed them.) It&#x27;s worth reading what the gun rights people have to say. (Do not carry with a round in the chamber is good advice.) What the &quot;defund the cops&quot; people have to say. What the cop-rights people have to say. What QAnon has to say. What the &quot;FEMA Death Train&quot; people have to say. (Those big windowless railroad cars are car carriers. One believer followed one and put a video on Youtube, and was dismayed when it reached an unloading point and new cars came out.) What the &quot;FEMA coffins&quot; people were excited about. (That was a private storage yard for grave liners. Turned out FEMA doesn&#x27;t stock coffins, just body bags, and not enough of them for the peak of the coronavirus epidemic.)<p>Within those extreme points you find the BLM people (who have had it with being shot and harassed), the white supremacists (who are mostly working-class guys who saw their way of life evaporate), the evangelicals (who right now are rudderless, having latched onto Trump, who represents their fears but not their values), and the Universal Basic Income people (that used to be called the &quot;dole&quot; in the UK).  All have legitimate grievances. Within that perimeter lies reality. Those people are exploitable by politicians who don&#x27;t have good solutions but can direct their anger.<p>That goes back a very long way. Read Shakespeare&#x27;s version of Caesar&#x27;s funeral oration.')
