So I think the market is responding as it should and am happy to see it.<p>&gt; This good outcome could have been so much better, had there been regulations on breaking up large companies so they can&#x27;t bully small ones<p>Well, I disagree with the (I think?) implication that Amazon is doing any bullying here, and I disagree that companies should be broken up purely for their size. But since we&#x27;re getting into anti-trust authority, perhaps I can convince you to throw the ring into Mordor:<p>While anti-trust could theoretically fight monopolies, those laws exist within a system in which special interests will co-opt those powers to essentially defend their own monopolies. So, big company X kicks over the right amount of lobbying dollars and magically the politicians want to bring an anti-trust suit against competitor Y, etc.<p>Now the blue-pilled response is to say, &quot;hey that&#x27;s just another failure of capitalism, and that&#x27;s why we need to get money out of politics!&quot;. In my unashamedly biased opinion, the red-pilled answer is to realize that these power structures will always be co-opted and the best solution is decentralization and therefore not having a state that can hand out bailouts, force small businesses to close up shop, discriminate against low-skilled workers with minimum wage regulations, exert arbitrary power through anti-trust legislation, etc.<p>Sorry, I kind of got down a philosophical rabbithole.')
