For context: I emigrated from Eastern Europe in the mid 90s.<p>I&#x27;ve worked restaurants and blue collar jobs much longer than white collar ones, and it was easily the most formative period of my life. The heart that those of lesser means have, sharing whatever they can, is truly enlightening. It&#x27;s an expression of care and comradery that seems to come out almost involuntarily and it&#x27;s incredible to witness. Can almost categorically say it&#x27;s not the case with upper middle and upper classes (in terms of my anecdotal experience, at least).<p>Obviously those with means can (AND DO) make a much greater impact in terms of charitable contributions and investments fighting poverty and homelessness, not dismissing that at all.')
