Too many choices for a Scala novice. Seems to be a pervasive pattern.<p>I think Scala was actually a better choice since my company mainly does AI&#x2F;ML (python) and Scala has some clout in data science.

Using typescript on front end, f# on back, vscode,  and GitHub for repo + CI&#x2F;CD. Feels nice using a single vendor (Microsoft) for dev, even though each tool is stand-alone.')
