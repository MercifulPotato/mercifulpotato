DNS doesn&#x27;t provide any consistency guarantees, if you ask &quot;A? foo.example&quot; and &quot;AAAA? foo.example&quot; you are not promised that your answers represent the same moment in time, one of them might be brand new while the other has been cached for six hours and is now obsolete.<p>For A vs AAAA that&#x27;s fine, you don&#x27;t need both to be consistent you just want either of them to work.<p>For ECH this could mean you get told key A (from yesterday), target name B (just changed now) and port number N (six hours old) and then when you try to connect to port N with key A and target name B that combination doesn&#x27;t work.<p>So by bundling everything you need into a single record means the only remaining problem is that a cached record might be out-of-date, an ordinary routine mistake by operators that happens for any DNS records.<p>The other reason is dirtier and practical: We want all this information to make (for example) a web browser work. So why have the web browser always make fifty queries when there could be one query that encapsulates everything needed?')
