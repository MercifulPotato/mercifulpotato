Item(by='oddity', descendants=None, kids=[25535016, 25534033], score=None, time=1608866630, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25533624, text='Just to be clear, I agree with you, but I&#x27;m half convinced the culture came first.  Charity, being on an individual basis, is quicker moving than governmental action. It fills the gaps, so to speak, and will (and should) always have a place, but the gaps of income inequality (among many other problems) are so deep and our society so incapable of moving to solve them, that we are left to rely on charity and helplessly pray to our Carnegie- or Apple- like demigods (I&#x27;m exaggerating a bit here). This problem seems to have a nasty feedback loop with the concentrating of wealth in that more wealth in fewer hands lessens the scope that those with wealth to give can see and increases the damage an actor can do (accidentally, intentionally, or through inaction).<p>I question I have for some people who might read this: I suspect some people slightly more libertarian than I would argue that our society should have a greater emphasis on charity vs taxes, but I have no idea how that would be workable when starting with a huge disparity. UBI with automatic triggers like the Sahm rule, maybe? I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m not well read here.')
