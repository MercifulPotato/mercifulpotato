Colchicine was my friend.<p>But at 49 I quit drinking, lost almost 50 lbs over a year period, and almost completely stopped having gout attacks.<p>Interestingly, I still get occasional attacks (once or twice a year at most), and they are all almost totally associated either with dehydration (to which I seem somewhat prone) or stress; particularly the stress of flying for 4+ hours on a business-related trip. I board the plane feeling fine, and step off with that little tinge in my left-big-toe joint.')
