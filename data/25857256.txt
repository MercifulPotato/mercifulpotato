There would probably be more terrorists than non-terrorists in the world then..<p>But anyway, I think we can agree on the &quot;violence is wrong&quot;-part, and the counterproductive part.<p>But saying that if any form of violence occured during a protest, then those protests should be considered equal, is, well, I don&#x27;t even know what to call it; Dishonest?<p>Now, what I really disagree about is the &quot;I&#x27;m pointing out media hypocrisy&quot;-part. I really don&#x27;t think you are doing that, I think that what you are doing is, complaining that &quot;the media&quot; seems to agree more with me than with you on this issue, and then phrasing it like your point of view is objectively correct.')
