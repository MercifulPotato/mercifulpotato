Emojis are great for chat when you want to express emotions. When it comes to reading text anywhere else:<p>- It distracts from years of training we have in recognizing characters of a particular language and word shapes<p>- It takes an extra second to process the symbol since we&#x27;re not used to it. For example, &quot;Notice a _bug_emoji_ ? Send us an email.&quot; [1]<p>- It draws eyes to the Emoji&#x27;s first because they&#x27;re foreign symbols and they&#x27;re painted in color.<p>- Notion is one of those products that encourages this.
