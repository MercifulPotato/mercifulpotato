The potential punishment way outweighs the potential gains.  But some people just can&#x27;t resist trying to &quot;beat the system&quot; or &quot;stick it to The Man&quot; or whatever.<p>I also wonder how things will go for people who take up the digital nomad lifestyle.  I think most digital nomads thus far have been freelancers, entrepreneurs, etc.  But big Microsoft-esque employers, much like the US tax system, are going to expect you to have a fixed address.  If I&#x27;m currently based in India but sell my home to hop from location to location every couple of months, am I permanently on India-level pay?  What if I did the same thing but had started in Silicon Valley?  Can I keep getting that Silicon Valley pay as long as I don&#x27;t stay in one place too long?  Or maybe nomads default to a baseline pay level?')
