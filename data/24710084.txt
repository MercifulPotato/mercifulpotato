I only have a BS in computer engineering from a mid-tier college, but I was able to get into two FAANGs based on passing the interviews and using skills I learned outside of college. And I know people in similar positions who have a worse formal education but were also able to get into positions that pay better than most doctors in the US because they were able to teach themselves the required skills and learn the rest on the job.<p>This doctor vs programmer comparison would also be more useful if there was an order of magnitude difference in effectiveness of doctors. Compare that with the order of magnitude difference in the utility of the systems that programmers can build. There are no real &quot;10x&quot; doctors except for those with medical + management training that can do things like set up a new hospital in an impoverished country and revamp their medical system. But it&#x27;s much more likely to have programmers that can build systems with many orders of magnitude difference in terms of QPS or a similar utility metric. That is, there is no version of Big-O notation for doctors that matters as much as the big O notation for programmers.')
