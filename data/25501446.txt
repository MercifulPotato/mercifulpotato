And the amount of data to sample from is plenty ample for unconscious bias to have a significant effect.<p>If I weren&#x27;t a YEC, I would focus more on issues with radiocarbon dating and the assumption and not the observation that carbon isotope ratios are constant over the history of the Earth and ignore cosmology entirely. In fact I&#x27;m not clear on what YEC has to do with cosmology at all, it strikes me as being outside the scope of the arguments I&#x27;ve seen on the subject.')
