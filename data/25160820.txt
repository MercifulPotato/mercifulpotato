This is because I&#x2F;O operations scale with the number of VDEVs rather than number of disks[1]. So there&#x27;s a tradeoff between space efficiency and IOPS. But AFAIK you absolutely could put 100 disks in a single RAID-Z VDEV.<p>On the mailing lists there&#x27;s frequently people posting with that or more disks in a single pool (split across multiple VDEVs).<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.delphix.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;delphix-engineering&#x2F;zfs-raidz-stripe-width-or-how-i-learned-stop-worrying-and-love-raidz" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.delphix.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;delphix-engineering&#x2F;zfs-raidz-s...</a>')
