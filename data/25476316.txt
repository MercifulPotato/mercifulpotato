If the streamer doesn&#x27;t pay and just uses non-copyrighted music no harm done to the streamer. It&#x27;s still great fun. But the users don&#x27;t get exposed to potentially interesting music content.<p>Why should the streamer pay for the privilege of being basically an advertisement platform for a commercial product? And they don&#x27;t, and thus there is less discovery. Hence what is meant by the music industry shooting itself in the foot.<p>I personally listen mostly to music I listened as a teenager and early 20&#x27;s. Sometimes I learn of something new and nice from my friends, but otherwise I find discovering new music quite hard.<p>A new game comes out: Tons of reviews and letsplays and whatnot. Looks interesting, I&#x27;ll buy. New music comes out: Its advertised maybe in Spotify but that&#x27;s it. Making a review or analysis is not possible (without paying extra), so I can&#x27;t encounter it. And thus I won&#x27;t listen it.')
