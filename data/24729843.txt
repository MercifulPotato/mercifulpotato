For example, many people don&#x27;t understand evolution, they think some magic force gradually turned fishes into humans. No wonder it is sometimes put on the same level as creationism. But to be honest, it doesn&#x27;t really matter. If you are not a scientist, faith is a shortcut that allows you to focus more on what matters more to you.<p>The difference is that you don&#x27;t <i>need</i> faith. With enough motivation, you can probably get to see the virus on an election microscope. It is difficult. Just operating an election microscope is an art, and getting the necessary security clearances to work with deadly pathogens can be tricky. Almost no one does it, but sometimes, a crazy enough guy spends way too much time challenging a well established theory. Most of the times, the results are the same as what mainstream science says, but there are a few exceptions. This random poking keeps science in check.<p>The current pandemic is good at exposing the &quot;non-faith&quot; aspects of science. Covid is not airborne, ah, maybe it is, hydroxychloroquine works, no it doesn&#x27;t, case fatality rate is 5%, no, 0.5%, no, 1%, it attacks the lungs, the nose, you keep immunity for a long time, no you don&#x27;t, yes you do, etc... It is constantly changing, and this is science at work. A priest will not change his mind, he will not receive a new revision of the Bible every week. That rarely shown aspect is a bit unsettling to those with a faith-based view of science, but totally normal for those who are practicing.<p>Modern academia has its problems. We often talk about the &quot;reproducibility crisis&quot;, but the simple fact it is widely recognized as a problem sets it apart from religion.<p>And BTW, while I am an atheist myself, I am not against religion. Religion offers stability and answers that science is unable to provide, and both can coexist.')
