That means the USA is the government with the most influence on Amazon to have taps placed or connection logs handed over.<p>They can do sealed sender stuff all they like, but when 10.0.1.1 sends a 17-byte message and the server then sends a 17-byte message to 10.0.2.1, and a minute later 10.0.2.1 submits something to the server of 48 bytes and then 48 bytes are forwarded to 10.0.1.1... traffic analysis based on a tap of a Signal server isn&#x27;t rocket science.<p>Still, it&#x27;s the best we&#x27;ve got for non-techies. Better than handing over <i>more</i> metadata to Facebook. Even if the jurisdiction is the same, the company (Signal Foundation) is better and is known to collect almost nothing historical by themselves. Other than, say, your real-life-identity-tied user ID of course. (In many countries, phone numbers are given out only after passport&#x2F;ID verification.)')
