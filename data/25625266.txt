Item(by='EricBurnett', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609708202, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25621533, text='Related tip: anywhere you&#x27;re looking to deploy compression in a backend, consider zstd (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;facebook.github.io&#x2F;zstd&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;facebook.github.io&#x2F;zstd&#x2F;</a>). I&#x27;ve found it suitable for streaming compression (Gbps+ flows without exorbitant CPU usage), storage compression (high compression ratios at higher levels; fast decompression), and found implementations available to every language I&#x27;ve needed. It comes out strictly better than gzip ~across the board in my experience, and should be the default compressor to choose or start evaluations from if you have no other constraints.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s yet deployed in browsers, so I&#x27;m restricting my recommendation to tools and backends. IIRC brotli is worth considering for browsers, but I haven&#x27;t deployed it myself.')
