It was a hot funding topic for the US DOE a few years ago, but sufficient energy density and operating pressures are super challenging targets to hit.<p>Efficiency depends on fuel cell type and operating conditions and such, but I think it’s generally pretty high for the useful life of the catalyst material. (The catalyst is another materials challenge itself, since I think most of the good materials are super expensive like Pt&#x2F;Pd alloys, and they’re vulnerable to carbon monoxide poisoning)<p>Edit: this DOE program page has some good detailed discussion of the current status, including on compressed liquid&#x2F;gas storage systems, which I’m not as familiar with: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energy.gov&#x2F;eere&#x2F;fuelcells&#x2F;hydrogen-storage-current-technology" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energy.gov&#x2F;eere&#x2F;fuelcells&#x2F;hydrogen-storage-curre...</a>')
