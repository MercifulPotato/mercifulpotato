I don&#x27;t trust it any more than I do with WhatsApp (therefore, Facebook), however it is well done and thought out, has a real desktop client with a real desktop UI toolkit and enough of my contacts are on it already, therefore it&#x27;s the best compromise to me. I greatly dislike Signal&#x27;s UI when I tried it out and I&#x27;ve read about some weird decisions lately (that &quot;using a PIN? uploading to cloud&quot; debacle some time ago). I also believe it shouldn&#x27;t require a phone number if its focus is privacy and security. Matrix would be my go to in concept, but its userbase is even smaller. At the same time, alas, I am forced to keep using WhatsApp because &quot;everyone&quot; is on it, and if you aren&#x27;t, you&#x27;re going to miss out, be it parents school chats, work groups, less tech-savvy friends, parents..')
