You pay for those breaks out of the devops budget. Moving breakage to earlier in the developer cycle typically reduces the cost of fixing it.<p>Regarding OpenSSL, there are a few reasons that isn&#x27;t going to be rewritten in Rust anytime soon. The developers probably don&#x27;t know Rust. OpenSSL runs in lots of places that don&#x27;t have a Rust toolchain. Even if you rewrite it in Rust you&#x27;re stuck with a bad API so why bother. In general there are more reasons against rewrite code in Rust than against writing new code in Rust ... and more reasons against writing new code in Rust that interfaces with old code than writing new greenfield code in Rust.')
