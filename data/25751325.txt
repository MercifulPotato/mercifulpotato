It can clearly be used for to traffic drugs, humans, blackmarket weapons, etc. It can be used to flee justice, evade police, abets vehicular manslaughter, etc. The list goes on and on. Is it even controversial to support the highway system as is? Do we loose sleep over it?<p>The people responsible for those highways spend a lot of money preventing them being used for drug trafficking, blackmarket weapons etc. Parler actively refused to moderate right wing hate speech.<p>&gt; Obviously all of the insidious planning and hatred that presumably occurred on Parler is abhorrent. I think I can hate all of those things without believing that the site should be censored.<p>I have to ask, where then do you want the line to be drawn? How detailed does the plan have to be before it&#x27;s nipped in the bud?')
