Using an unexpected intermediary in a transaction is a terrible experience. If I see a restaurant on GrubHub then I want to <i>know</i> that that restaurant wants orders coming through GrubHub. Otherwise, I&#x27;ll be much better off calling up the restaurant directly. As it stands, I currently have to use Google Maps as my restaurant portal, using the restaurant&#x27;s website or phone number to figure out how to place orders. Only if their website is or links out to a 3rd party like GrubHub do I then actually use GrubHub.<p>But if GrubHub only showed restaurants that were actually delegating their delivery to GrubHub, then I could use it as a portal. Right now it&#x27;s not trustworthy for that purpose.')
