I have been overall quite impressed with the communities in the FB Groups (of course some are better than others).<p>For example I&#x27;ve been a huge fan of the Streets of Rage series; SOR4 came out last year, 25 years after the previous release. The Streets of Rage 4 facebook group has been an absolute godsend. Very active community, tons of expert players posting videos, very easy to find people to play with, funny memes, the works. The SOR4 discord is hit and miss and reddit is too much of a message board and isn&#x27;t so active. FB Group is light years ahead of any other community for this game that I&#x27;ve found.<p>I&#x27;ve also joined groups for The Office, Futurama, etc (all of have dozens of different groups, each tailored slightly differently). I laugh at anyone who says all they see on their feed is people posting bullshit, vitriol, and misinformation. That is a YOU problem, not a FB problem. My feed is filled with relevant updates from friends, as well as a constant stream of The Office&#x2F;Futurama&#x2F;Streets of Rage 4. Exactly how I want it.')
