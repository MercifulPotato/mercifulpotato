Item(by='dxdm', descendants=None, kids=[25597731], score=None, time=1609444255, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25594981, text='&gt; It’s somewhat miraculous how many people in developed countries don’t live that way anymore.<p>Instead of invoking the supernatural, I&#x27;d prefer to call it quite fortunate that human ingenuity has allowed us to exploit vast energy sources in order to raise the general level of well-being among a portion of humanity, while also finding ways to share wealth and power in (unfortunately not exclusively) more peaceful ways.<p>The cop-out I was talking about is precisely this kind of hiding behind proclaimed laws of nature and miracles, when there&#x27;s clearly choice and agency involved. Comparing the situation of laborers, but also the stratification of western societies, in the Victorian era with today I think shows that we can not only increase the size of the pie, but also influence how to distribute it more fairly.<p>I think that seeing how much &quot;miracle&quot; there is to go around, it&#x27;s worthwhile considering how to enable more people to take part in it, by finding ways to spread the miracle whip around a tad more evenly.')
