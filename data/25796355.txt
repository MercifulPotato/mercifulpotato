Admittedly I would never have done it without WSL existing, but still. Anyway, a few years later I’m hankering to get back to Arch Linux and i3, or perhaps Sway now. The Surface Book has been good hardware, except that unit #1 was developing some problems at the age of 19 months, #2 was basically DOA, #3 had Battery 1 disappear after four months, and a couple of weeks ago #4 at the age of 2¼ had its Battery 1 die in a more unpleasant way: the computer will spontaneously lose power typically 1–4 times per day. But I have probably used it an average of over 10 hours a day, and regularly very heavily at that, except for its dGPU which is almost untouched.)')
