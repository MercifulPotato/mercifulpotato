If someone&#x27;s a junior employee working in a big company, it&#x27;s likely that they don&#x27;t have the necessary experience to figure out whether hard work matters in their position. That&#x27;s an important risk to be aware of. But the opposite advice, avoiding hard work, is also risky. (And not a good habit to cultivate in the long term of course.) If you&#x27;re not sure which position you&#x27;re in, and you don&#x27;t trust your more experienced coworkers to tell you honestly without punishing you for asking, then putting in some amount of hard work with the goal of finding out is a pretty good start.')
