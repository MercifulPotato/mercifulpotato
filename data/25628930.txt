We don&#x27;t talk here about the &quot;hard&quot; ones, the ones that aren&#x27;t only a web UI. Hardware, medical, societal, etc... Ones that <i>need</i> years of research before you even know if it&#x27;s feasible.<p>I use air quotes for easy and hard since obviously they are not the words I&#x27;m looking for, but I can&#x27;t find better ones. All(?) problems are difficult to solve in some way.<p>Anyways, this is almost off-topic, not really fitted for a pragmatic thread such as this one :)')
