There&#x27;s also no reason to own 10 of the same firearm - it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re setting your dinner table with handguns.<p>As for guns being &quot;mostly used to kill people&quot;, that&#x27;s just not true. My gun collection has only been used to kill paper targets and, occasionally, deer. Properly used they are no more risk to society than a kitchen knife, arguably less since there are more stabbings than shootings every year.<p>Banning Parler and banning guns both strike me as infantilizing and highly ineffective. Look at what all of the anti-gun rhetoric has done for gun sales in the US - the same thing will happen with alternative social media platforms.')
