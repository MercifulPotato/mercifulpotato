I&#x27;ve been going (polite) rounds with their customer support since March. Constantly losing connection, uploads <i>peak</i> at 1Mbps, horribly unreliable.<p>I paid for their 110Mbps plan and have worked remotely for many years. Video dropping all the time, router hanging. After upgrading all my equipment because they wouldn&#x27;t admit fault, I got a tech to come out who was completely candid because I showed him my modem SNR and power levels and he knew I wasn&#x27;t messing around.<p>Without fail, he pointed to the pole top node and said that&#x27;s the problem. It was Sunday and the realtime congestion was near 80%. He said it was scheduled for upgrade but everything is delayed because of supply chain issue in China.<p>That was all I needed to hear. Canceled that day, got AT&amp;T copper (no fiber here), and it&#x27;s been solid so far.')
