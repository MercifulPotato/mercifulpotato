I was, of course, borne out correct and now I’m forced to liquidate with an app that barely works. So they’re even locking the transfer door. I’m talking to a lawyer this morning about options. help@ is silent.<p>Canceling orders doesn’t work, market orders on non-memes are up to 20min to execute, my profile page has been a fastfail 500 for four days, but because I held some of these famous securities their “we want you be informed during these uncertain times” (please) notifications work just fine.<p>If you still use Robinhood it’s time to go. Get out while it’s partially working. As an SRE I’m not sure that’s going to last, and that’s even before dissecting the business model.')
