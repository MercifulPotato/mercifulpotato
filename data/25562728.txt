I live in the EU and indeed wages are lower, but of course prices are also lower.<p>When I was 16, I worked at a bakery too, as an apprentice. I made a pittance and lived in a squat because I couldn&#x27;t afford rent, but I enjoyed the work and I could eat of the produce to my heart&#x27;s content (I have a big heart). This was in Athens, Greece, btw.<p>On the other hand, neither I nor you had a family at the time we worked such low-pay jobs and I suspect that a minimum wage job would not be sufficient for two adults wanting to start a family.')
