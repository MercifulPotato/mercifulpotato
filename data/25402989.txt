The US alone graduates 2 million Computer Science students of various stripes every year. It&#x27;s been graduating (smaller numbers) of them for over 40-50 years now. There are now second and third generation comp sci. workers and graduates.<p>So let&#x27;s say 1% of 1 million&#x2F;year are up to this, I suspect it&#x27;s rather more, but I can&#x27;t be bothered to do the curve on past graduation rates, and figure out what the world wide figure is... you&#x27;ve easily got a couple of million people world wide.<p>When I think it&#x27;s going to get really interesting is in another 10 years or so when there start to be significant numbers of bored retired former developers. At any rate the market rate probably isn&#x27;t that bad.')
