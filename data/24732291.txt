Even if there&#x27;s not an actual answer it just happens to be that way and we&#x27;re a happy little accident of the universe for a lot of people that&#x27;s kind of unsatisfying. Even if they&#x27;re wrong to people want to ascribe meaning to their lives, it&#x27;s why philosophy and religion will probably never leave us.')
