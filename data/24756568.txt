Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602522067, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24756317, text='&gt; You are mistaking the ability to say whatever you want with the ability to escape the social consequences of your expression.<p>Am I though, in fact?  Is this idea expressly conveyed in the text above?  Not that I can see, and it certainly wasn&#x27;t intended, <i>because I do not hold that belief</i>.  So this raises an interesting question:  <i>where did that idea come from</i>?  This may look like a rhetorical question, but it isn&#x27;t - it is literal, and I ask it for a very specific and important reason.  Are you able to answer the question?  After all, <i>it&#x27;s your idea</i>, isn&#x27;t it?<p>&gt; Would you kick nazis out of your dinner party? Yes or No?  That’s the fundamental question that is being asked.<p>Fine - <i>then discuss it in those terms</i>, not in objectively false terms like removing them from the dinner party <i>does not diminish their freedom of speech</i>.  The actual actions (and subsequent changes in the state of reality), and the <i>justifications for those actions</i>, are two different things.  Acknowledge this distinction, <i>please</i>.<p>&gt; If you would not permit me to alter my behavior to stop my resources and forum to be utilized by nazis, meaning I must support and publish nazi material, your position is very extreme, severely limits my autonomy and in many ways forces me to “speak” on behalf of others.<p>It is not I who am forcibly restricting anything, so please refrain from making such accusations.  I am merely <i>discussing ideas</i>.<p>&gt; “Free speech” that does not allow for others to express the consequences of that speech is not, in fact a support of free speech.<p>Agreed. I am not doing that.  Others may, but I am not.<p>&gt; If you say “I hate nazis, but you must allow them to publish on your website” you are effectively prioritizing one type of speech over another. You are saying I must allow nazis at my dinner party. (Note: the government, with its force of law, is very, very different)<p>If I was saying that, you would have a fine point.  But I&#x27;m not saying that.  What I am saying, is what I have said above - supplementing what I have said with one&#x27;s own <i>interpretations and predictions</i>, and then accusing me of holding those interpreted beliefs, seems like a sub-optimal way to solve problems - if we were to do it in our day jobs, we&#x27;d write shitty software, and that&#x27;s why this type of behavior gets called out.  So why is it not just acceptable, <i>but enthusiastically preferred</i>, to behave in this manner in &quot;the real world&quot; (including here on HN, home of the intellectually gifted)?  Is this not a very odd state of affairs?  I mean, if one drops all priors and playfully observes (a certain subset of) the conversations we have here all day every day, is the whole thing not beautifully (but also tragically) absurd?  Why do we do this, and why do we <i>refuse to acknowledge it</i> (and why do we downvote people who dare to point these things out - don&#x27;t shoot the messenger, as they say)?<p>These seem like good questions to be asking in the 21st century - it&#x27;s odd not only that no one asks them, but also that there&#x27;s such <i>unanimous and passionate aversion</i> to the ideas contained within such questions.  This aversion can be observed, if one has the fortitude to look.')
