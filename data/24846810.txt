I&#x27;ve had to read through quite a few issues for node.js debugging issues because they&#x27;ve made changes to the feature.<p>Before I could just do `node --inspect index.js` and get the debugger to auto attach with my node version set using NVM. There&#x27;s a few different flags to try. I ended up wasting a few hours to just get debugging working again. Now I have to actually set a launch profile (I&#x27;ve got one which works) but wading through all the issues because they&#x27;ve changed, to me, a fundamental feature was just plan frustrating.')
