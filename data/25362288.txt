Item(by='shaftway', descendants=None, kids=[25367675], score=None, time=1607539295, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25359695, text='New York City has significant problems with traffic and parking; a growing proportion of that traffic is delivery vehicles. These deliveries can be hugely disruptive to both vehicle and pedestrian traffic.<p>Here&#x27;s an NYT article from last year: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;27&#x2F;nyregion&#x2F;nyc-amazon-delivery.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;27&#x2F;nyregion&#x2F;nyc-amazon-deliv...</a><p>It&#x27;s not uncommon to see delivery drivers disgorge their trucks&#x27; contents on the street to sort for last hundred feet delivery. It&#x27;s not even uncommon to see them swapping package between companies so that each deliverer don&#x27;t have to go into each building.<p>Of course the answer is &quot;make <i>that</i> illegal&quot; and of course it already is. But the police aren&#x27;t everywhere, the fines aren&#x27;t steep enough, and the police tend to look the other way because any particular infraction is a minor nuisance at worst, and the blockages won&#x27;t be gone any faster if you tell them to clean it up. Fining people for a behavior doesn&#x27;t work if the police refuse to levy the fines.<p>Taxing this is a way to put the burden of the costs onto the people that are causing (at least indirectly) the problem, the same way that (at least in theory) gas taxes funding roads puts the burden on the people who drive the most.<p>And it doesn&#x27;t matter if you tax the consumer or the delivery company. Either way you&#x27;re taxing the consumer, the former just makes that cost visible to the consumer, and may change their habits enough to reduce the congestion.')
