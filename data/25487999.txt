But you may have noticed that Xbox X has moved to having different speed memories with different memory controllers, even if logically contiguous and uniformly accessible. The CPU pool has a narrower bus and can&#x27;t be used for graphics objects -- you have to queue for copy to the graphics pool. The driver then schedules a deconflicted copy.<p>The PS5 architecture also has different speeds -- but the slow access is to SSD! It has manual management of streaming resources from SSD to RAM, but also allows direct SSD reads -- but that is a trick, because the SSD controller has a huge RAM cache too.<p>So I&#x27;d say we&#x27;re actually moving away from UMA in general. I think that memory aware scheduling is going to be the next win -- online learning to understand memory access patterns and scheduling compute and cache fill. Fancy cache algorithms used to take too much logic (and slow cache fill logic down), but for SSD-&gt;RAM you can do lots of prediction based on program state.')
