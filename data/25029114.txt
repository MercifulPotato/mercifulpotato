We already have other words to designate serious offenders, like &quot;felon&quot; or &quot;convict&quot;.  And we have offense-specific terms, like &quot;murderer&quot; or &quot;rapist&quot;.<p>The word &quot;criminal&quot; might connote a gravity that offends your sensibilities, but it&#x27;s accurate.  The disconnect arises because modern man sees himself as mostly above the law:  Some offenses aren&#x27;t offenses because (nearly) everyone commits them.  We all (hopefully) learn from a young age that this is preposterous:  &quot;If everyone jumped off a bridge, would you?&quot;<p>I think you&#x27;ll find that honoring the actual meaning of words makes communication easier, not harder.')
