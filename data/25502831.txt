It would also be useful to categorise such word packs by language (there&#x27;s no reason this can&#x27;t be used for Hindu, Chinese, Japanese, etc.).<p>EDIT: languages like Chinese and Japanese might be tricky because we don&#x27;t use spaces to denote word boundaries. The word boundaries are implicit. So the word selection&#x2F;highlighting might be a bit funky.')
