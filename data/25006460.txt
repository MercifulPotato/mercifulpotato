I find trying to learn grammar formally is counterproductive and will set you back. Instead, think of the noun suffixes as a preposition equivalent. Trying to think of them as cases will mess with your progress<p>Interesting point. This is what a lot of people learning the language tend to get overtly confused with. Perhaps your point isn&#x27;t as controversial as one would think...<p>&gt; j) It may appear superficially that all the vocabulary is weird and foreign but a whole lot of it is borrowed, just borrowed a long way back. Not so useful early on but you pick up some patterns eventually. A number of phrases are word for word translations from other languages - for example &quot;elintarvike&quot; (food products, groceries) is a word for word translation of German &quot;Lebensmittel&quot;. Learning German after Finnish I found a lot of familiar phrases. Going further back, you see a ton of germanic roots in everyday words like &quot;tuoli&quot; (chair). It&#x27;s not obvious at first until you look at the Estonian version &quot;tool&quot;, which is an earlier form of the same word. That is of course an abbreviated version of &quot;stool&quot;&#x2F;&quot;Stuhl&quot; which is clearly germanic. Again, this won&#x27;t help you learn new vocabulary but it may help with the feeling of &quot;what the fuck how do they come up with this shit&quot; that you get on first exposure to a new language group.<p>hehe, yeah that&#x27;s the second difficult part of the equation. Trouble is that we also borrow a lot from Swedish (which isn&#x27;t too far from German, but still) and also Russian.<p>But you&#x27;re right in that the word formations themselves are pretty logical (maybe this is a Germanic thing?) - for example, computer [tietokone] is literally &quot;information machine&quot;, airplane [lentokone] is &quot;flying machine&quot;, and my favourite example is the old word for television [näköradio] which is literally &quot;vision radio.&quot;')
