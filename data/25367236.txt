You had to use specific language, be nice and more forgiving and understanding to the right groups of people, and you were not supposed to disagree on specific subjects of discussion or you&#x27;d be a pariah.<p>The idea that this is &quot;live and let live&quot; is silly. It seems that way to you because your morals align very closely with the morals of people in a college setting. If they didn&#x27;t, you&#x27;d notice the similarities to an orthodox religious community immediately.')
