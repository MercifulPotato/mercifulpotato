Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still think Google Photos is the best in class. The point is, even the &quot;best&quot; is not enough due to the lack of options to fine tune it. And once it breaks, it jumps from &quot;holyshit&quot; to &quot;unusable&quot; straightly.<p>I wrote a very long article to detail it somewhere else \n before, here is the gist of it:<p>-------<p>* There is no way to tell Google to &quot;split&quot; a person&#x2F;face. All you can do is remove wrong results (person B) from person A (you can also say it&#x27;s &quot;wrong person&quot; on web, but not in app). You can&#x27;t manually re-tag them as B <i>in batch</i>.<p>* These removed results don&#x27;t seem to get re-recognized as <i>other people</i>; it&#x27;s either not get re-analyzed at all, or often times, they will be re-recognized back to the wrong person again!<p>* You can&#x27;t multi-select more than a few hundreds pictures and remove. It says &quot;can&#x27;t remove results&quot; on both app and web if you select, say, 1000 photos. This is extremely annoying since I have people that have 10k images and I have to do so in small batch.<p>* You can manually assign a face, but can only do so one by one. And that&#x27;s assuming Google actually detects the face, no matter how obvious it is.<p>* The people you added manually (by selecting a face from a photo, and manually add a name) are somehow treated as second-class citizens. When you visit <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;photos.google.com&#x2F;people" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;photos.google.com&#x2F;people</a>, their names appeared at the very end of the list of named people (no matter how many photos you have for him&#x2F;her), and they are almost never considered as face-recognition candidates when you upload new photos. I guess Google simply doesn&#x27;t use the manually assigned people&#x2F;face in their AI.<p>* And the final nail on the coffin is, even if you went to the trouble and fixed all these problems manually, which I did, nothing stops Google to recognize the newly uploaded photos wrong. That means you need to repeat the process again and again.<p>Also from an AI&#x2F;machine learning point of view (I&#x27;m guessing, I&#x27;m not in this field), the more tricky cases that the user allowed&#x2F;confirmed, the model for that person became more overfitted. So eventually it started to think other people are the same guy&#x2F;gal.<p>This is typical, but the problem is, you, as the supervisor, can&#x27;t tell the AI that he was wrong, and re-tag the training set as easily.<p>I think all this can be easily fixed if Google can add a way to &quot;split&quot; a person, and then force the AI to re-train the models based on the photos from now two different people. But I won&#x27;t hold my breath for a free service.')
