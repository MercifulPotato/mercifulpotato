Those are the worst interface I&#x27;ve ever seen. Slow and disfunctional, every click you get a spinner, I&#x27;m surprised it went to production, using that for more than a week is torture.<p>As if the spinners were not bad enough, now western web design created the animated grayed out text, which I particularly find an aberration.<p>Youtube interface is another example. You click on the &quot;videos&quot; tab and you get infinite scrolling without pagination. Killing pagination is a huge usability issue. Comments section with the &quot;Load more&quot; approach, another annoying feature, just load me all the comments in one go please.')
