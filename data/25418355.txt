Are you an working in the field? Or do you just believe that science happens to agree with your view?<p>There is actually no clear cut scientific story about Sars-Cov-2 yet. That is part of the scare.<p>I also don&#x27;t think your logic is sound - influenca used to spread rapidly through populations in all previous years, despite of previous immunological exposure as you describe. There is no reason to assume it would spread less rapidly this year because of &quot;previous immunological exposure&quot;.<p>The effectiveness of masks and social distancing also does not depend on previous immunological exposure.')
