Depends on your market.<p>At least here, the businesses that still ran xBase were the ones unwilling or unable to pay decently for maintenance and&#x2F;or migration, and that was the situation 10+ years ago.<p>Haven&#x27;t looked into Harbour featureset, but I feel xBase in general is simply too simple for new developments. Even mom-and-pop stores need features way beyond the Clipper&#x2F;MS-DOS capabilities.<p>The language is outdated, too; even Delphi&#x2F;Lazarus sounds too 1990ish to me, I have fond memories of Delphi and Object Pascal but it is impossible to justify using them in a world with so many good new languages.')
