I studied philosophy (Ph.D. program, but finished with an M.A.), and the M.A. is often just a degree given after the first few years of the Ph.D. There are a handful of required first year courses (logic, basic metaphysics, philosophy of science and ethics), but otherwise students take whatever courses are relevant to their interests. It helps that philosophy typically has fewer classes with explicit prerequisites. If you take an advanced course, you might be lost, but it doesn&#x27;t feel the same as not being knowing a formula or how to derive something.<p>Some courses are more basic, and some are more like collaborative research seminars. Advanced students gravitate towards the latter (and typically take fewer courses and&#x2F;or audit more of them), but a first year with the right background can still take them. Conversely, an advanced student might take an introductory course in an area they lack background in to broaden their knowledge.<p>There also are terminal M.A. programs, but they&#x27;re less common, and the majority of students who do Ph.Ds at prestigious institutions don&#x27;t do one.')
