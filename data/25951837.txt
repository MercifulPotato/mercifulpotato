WSB removes posts and comments that don&#x27;t toe the line that everyone needs to buy and hold GME. Meanwhile, the only way to profit from this trade is to sell at exactly the right time, <i>before</i> everyone else does.<p>There will also be a lot of frustration and disappointment when various hedge funds announce how they made record profits on the Gamestop frenzy. Some will suffer, of course, but others will make billions.<p>Finally, living in a world where frenzied crowds conspire to take out services based on shared misunderstandings will not make for great outcomes.')
