In much the same way as book libraries:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brunswicktoollibrary.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brunswicktoollibrary.org</a><p>It&#x27;s pretty cheap (AUS$85&#x2F;yr), and AFAIK they have about 400 members.  Though Melbourne is currently in a coronavirus lockdown so everything is closed. :(<p>Regarding broken&#x2F;incomplete tools, (prior to the lockdown) they had a day every week or two set aside to go through and fix broken&#x2F;worn tools (etc).<p>Seems like a good solution to the tool sharing problem, and it seems to work well for everyone.')
