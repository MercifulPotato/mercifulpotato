Open the app to see your story&#x27;s unique coverage over time and across sources.<p>WHAT IT ISN&#x27;T. There are big-name news apps out there; most predict what you&#x27;ll like, which is weird because it&#x27;s news, not Old Navy. Commit News is not about predicting. Instead, it&#x27;s personalizing. You don&#x27;t need to set up &quot;channels, boards, books&quot; or &quot;collections.&quot; You don&#x27;t have to choose between &quot;politics, lifestyle, local&quot; or &quot;environment.&quot; And we don&#x27;t assume what &quot;you might also like…&quot;<p>WHY NOW? The idea for Commit News started in my head years ago -- I was tired of being forced to forget news stories that were important to me. I&#x27;m a Black, Mexican, female, child of an immigrant who geeks out on the environment. The news industry would probably call my entire existence &quot;special interest,&quot; needless to say, the stories I want to follow fall off the front pages pretty quickly.<p>A couple of months back, while testing, America&#x27;s shit hit the fan. We&#x27;re witnessing many stories that feel consequential and unresolved, but the news cycle slows for no man, murder, or pandemic. I sped up development and decided that it needs to be present more than it needs to be perfect.<p>All feedback is appreciated - listening@commitnews.com')
