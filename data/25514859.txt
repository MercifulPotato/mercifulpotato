Bell Canada. They require you to speak to the &quot;loyalty&quot; team before you can have a service cancelled.  That team is only available by phone. That team has a 1 hour wait time during the hours that they are open. That team likes to hang up on you.  That team calls you back from numbers that cannot accept calls.  That team is not available by chat or email and every other department has no access in the tools to effectively cancel a service.<p>I escalated to the crtc and opened a case. I got a call back from someone who was very good at apologising for this policy but was at the same time very clear that this was within their legal rights as a service provider.<p>Super convenient that I can sign up to any service with one click though.')
