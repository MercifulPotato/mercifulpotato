And sometimes that&#x27;s good, and sometimes that&#x27;s bad.<p>About when it&#x27;s bad: Sometimes the word &quot;empathy&quot; gets used to assert moral superiority (often in a coded&#x2F;gendered way) without engaging in any perspective-taking at all. In that case, it&#x27;s used in conjunction with black&#x2F;white absolutism and a demonization of the enemy that actually renders them incomprehensible. To my mind none of this is truly empathetic or humane. It&#x27;s more the Clausewitzian first step of politics&#x2F;war.<p>&gt; When I read appeals to empathy, I see appeals to a secular morality that originates in the material idea of progress<p>One thing people don&#x27;t understand is that giving people a better material standard of living brings them less happiness than you might expect. Spending time in less-wealthy countries teaches you this quickly. People are not miserable.<p>On the other hand, if people are young, then they (mostly) don&#x27;t have health problems yet, so they don&#x27;t need a lot of medical technology. They will start to require more &quot;material progress&quot; in medicine as they get older. And it really is &quot;progress&quot;: Even the rich of the late 1800s, over a certain age, were plagued by bad teeth and chronic diseases that did impact their happiness.<p>So maybe the punchline is that material progress in certain basics like medicine and sanitation do help, but as soon as you have eliminated actual physical distress you&#x27;ve accomplished most of what you need to, materially.<p>...<p>&gt; Can you empathize with genius beyond your comrehension, or is this just a downward relationship, and does doing so make you a peer?<p>You can just not-hate (or in the best case respect) the aspects of genius that you don&#x27;t understand, and empathize with the aspects of humanity that you do understand. It isn&#x27;t an all-or-nothing proposition.<p>&gt; Can you empathize with objective evils like sadism or cruelty without becoming a party to it?<p>We&#x27;re assuming here that it&#x27;s other people who are sadistic and cruel. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s also useful to recognize sadism and cruelty in ourselves. They are there.')
