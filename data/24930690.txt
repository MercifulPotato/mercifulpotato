For example, I was recently given my mother&#x27;s collection of 7&quot;s. Yes, they&#x27;re completely impractical by today&#x27;s standards and I can find almost all of those songs on Spotify, but the collection included her handwritten index and notes scribbled in the columns about memories connected to the various songs in it.<p>I don&#x27;t have a specific example in mind, but I&#x27;m sure the same applies to books people have inherited from friends and family. People write all sorts of interesting notes in books, tuck photos in between the pages, etc. These items offer a connection that a library book or its digital equivalent (often) cannot.')
