Military satellites generally have manoeuvre capability so keeping track of them can be quite challenging.<p>Also launching an anti-sat missile is a comparable problem to launching a satellite into the target orbit. A bit cheaper, but within an order of magnitude. That makes high orbit satellites, particularly in GEO very expensive and time consuming to target.<p>Put it this way, the US and Russia have had decades to put up all their satellites. You&#x27;re not going to do enough launches to take all of that out in a few weeks, or even months.')
