If it&#x27;s the case that the path to the dependencies location is the same as the path to the script&#x27;s location, that&#x27;s fine. We&#x27;re asking distinct questions (where is my data, where are my deps, where is my script) here, the unnecessary coupling is precisely <i>the assumption</i> they have the same answer. If they happen to have the same answer, that&#x27;s not weird, that sort of thing happens all the time.')
