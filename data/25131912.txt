If you were satisfied with the job&#x2F;conditions&#x2F;policies, then you might choose to continue to try to stay employed there.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s not strong evidence because nobody knows how much choice you had in the matter. If you quit when you have a 75% chance of being fired, that means something different than quitting when you have 100% chance of being fired in the next 30 seconds, and the outside world doesn&#x27;t know which is the case.')
