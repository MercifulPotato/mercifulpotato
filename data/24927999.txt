Sorry, I disagree: people can decide they don&#x27;t want to associate with you or me for reasons we don&#x27;t find justifiable. I can throw a party and not invite you simply for writing this comment; I can start a project and not allow you to contribute. You can relate to the rest of the world that I did that, and let them decide what that means to them.<p>We&#x27;ve gone out of our way to encode into law the exceptions to that rule. We can talk all we want about &quot;anglo-derived common law&quot; in those cases.')
