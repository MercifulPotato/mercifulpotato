Many of them do not provide &quot;complete&quot; protein. As in, they&#x27;re missing some building blocks the human body can&#x27;t fabricate.<p>It&#x27;s possible to have a healthy vegan diet but it&#x27;s a lot of work because you have to look at what amino acids and various nutrients are missing. It&#x27;s much easier to just add meat to your diet. And anecdotally, a lot of vegans buy the &quot;healthy&quot; marketing and don&#x27;t even pay attention to things like amino acid profiles. Which is unhealthy and frankly dangerous')
