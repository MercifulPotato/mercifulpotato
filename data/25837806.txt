Elasticsearch accepts patches from the public, albiet accompanied by a signature on the CLA that grants Elastic unfettered rights to do anything they want with the code.<p>&gt;However, that Elastic as upstream of the project suddenly disappears for the community, I find is something, that unfortunately, many open source projects have to go through sooner or later.<p>Maybe, but it still doesn&#x27;t make it right. This wasn&#x27;t an accident, or the consequence of a company gradually succumbing to attrition. It was deliberately done for the profit motive in an already profitable company, and excused away with gaslighting and misinformation. This is why I chose to criticize them on my blog.')
