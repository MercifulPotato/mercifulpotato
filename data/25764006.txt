Item(by='Balgair', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610554581, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25760665, text='Even in the &#x27;best&#x27; of times, YT&#x27;s banning and strikes system is pretty awful. It&#x27;ll ban channels for playing random static noise in the background while letting children see some very adult content. And that&#x27;s considered &#x27;normal&#x27; for YT. HN is filled with such stories and data. Honestly, at the scale YT operates, I&#x27;d imagine it should be worse that it already is.<p>Obviously, YT&#x27;s ban on Donny is not random or capricious, it&#x27;s very intentional.<p>But the larger issue remains that YT is a <i>bad host</i> to begin with and has been for nearly a decade. Maybe the larger YT community, including advertisers, needs a better choice than what it currently uses. Or a better legal framework in which to operate as YT.')
