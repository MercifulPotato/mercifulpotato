Elastic&#x27;s move here, attacking the issue through licensing, is one way that this sort of business model is becoming more robust over time and would be instructive for other founders looking to create revenue generating software that is also open source.<p>As a developer, the main reason I _love_ open source is that I help patch issues or inspect the code to get a better understanding.  Which is great because the changes Elastic are making to their license are orthogonal to the value prop for your average developer.')
