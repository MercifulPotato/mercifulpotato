But this side of the mirror, we can&#x27;t physically do that, so it&#x27;s not in our brain&#x27;s list of expected possibilities.  We can, however, rotate ourselves 180 degrees.  And because we&#x27;re bilaterally symmetrical, our brain finds it easy to interpret the front-to-back flip as a 180 degree rotation.  But that leaves left-to-right weird, because what happened wasn&#x27;t actually a 180 degree rotation.')
