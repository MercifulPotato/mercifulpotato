AWS lets me create a new instance which is entirely closed to incoming connections except for port 22, which is closed except for whitelisting my IP address. This gives me good assurances even if my instance is running a vulnerable SSH server. It&#x27;s also trivial to block outgoing connections, where that&#x27;s appropriate.<p>It also means my instance is spared from constant probing, which keeps the logs clear.')
