And this <i>separate</i> computer could use the latest bleeding-edge CPU, and be encased in a radiation-hardened shell. It would use its radio to talk to the slower main computer, and do math really fast <i>locally</i>, and if need be, beam the results to Earth, or to a nearby orbiting satellite.')
