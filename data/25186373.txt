Please do not assume that NCERT textbook writers are careless tyros - they include some of the best educators in India who have spent time in improving presentation of material - of course, there may be errors and gaps, and there is always scope for improvement. (For example, Fields Medallists like Manjul Bharghava are at least peripherally interested (1))<p>If you are earnest, you can contact people in the math and science community in India. This will mean substantially thorough vetting, because the corrections will themselves have to be checked across multiple sources for consistency. (The worst examples are in Chemistry. As you keep digging, you  will start finding that B.Sc. material contradicts High School material, and M.Sc. material confirms the High School material. None of these are &quot;incorrect&quot;, it is a matter of how deep one wants to go.)<p>A good place to start will be to look at the list of editors listed inside the textbook, look up their webpages and try them one after the other.<p>(1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ncert.nic.in&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;shikshak-parv&#x2F;TwoDaysConclaveDetails_11.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ncert.nic.in&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;shikshak-parv&#x2F;TwoDaysConclaveDetail...</a>')
