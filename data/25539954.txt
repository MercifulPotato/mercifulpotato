If the government ordered the channel tunnel to stop, it would stop. It&#x27;s not like France, where there are innumerable border crossing points.<p>Of course a total closure would be a last resort, because that would cut off imports of things like fresh fruit, but it&#x27;s been possible to get 20-minute pinprick blood tests since April (admittedly with lower accuracy than PCR tests) - the government simply decided measures like testing everyone at the border and enforcing mandatory self-isolation were not priorities.')
