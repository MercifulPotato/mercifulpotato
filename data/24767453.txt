Otherwise screw those little people.<p>I had a domain through blogger that I registered ages ago on the blogger site.   Google started emailing me that it was expiring and directed me to Gsuite.... but I don&#x27;t have a Gsuite account and google didn&#x27;t make one for me...<p>The domain didn&#x27;t appear in my Google domains account.<p>Google had just pointed blogger domain users to Gsuite and called it a day.<p>Google was no help, I never got a response from the handful of ways (none of them good) trying to reach out to them.<p>Finally I found the old registrar google used behind the scenes and they let me renew the domain.<p>I never heard back from google other than all the spam about my domain expiring and asking me to login to Gsuite... repeatedly.. sent to an email without a Gusite account.. someone just flipped a switch and screw everyone I guess.')
