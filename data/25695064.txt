If the Democrats hadn&#x27;t spend 3 years pushing the idea that the electoral system was compromised then maybe there&#x27;d be a more credible argument that this protest was new or problematic. Certainly if the world wasn&#x27;t just fresh out of the BLM protests. But honestly, standards were set and there isn&#x27;t anything unusual happening here, except it is right-wingers instead of leftists. American politics has a certain symmetry to it. Which is why this escalation is troubling.')
