Why did he create a company that would make something he always wanted to create unusable? He even put this on his wikipedia page in 2007: &quot;He has an interest in privacy technology, electronic cash (of the payer and payee anonymous type)...&quot; and yet he is completely absent from bitcoin from 2009-2013 and sets up a company the completely defies everything that he wanted to create for years? It&#x27;s completely illogical.<p>I know most of these arguments are from the video but come on. He is the perfect candidate. And i think you will not get much better evidence when someone doesn&#x27;t want to be publicly known to be satoshi. But sure there is no 100% conclusive proof so believe whatever you want.')
