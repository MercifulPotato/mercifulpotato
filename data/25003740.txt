Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=[25004795], score=None, time=1604623582, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25002778, text='<i>&gt; from the left&#x27;s perspective all the agreed upon societal ills--e.g. loss of blue collar jobs to free trade, lack of income growth combined with increasing income disparity, corporate oligopolies, etc--are a consequence of conservative, Republican, policies</i><p>But even if this is accepted for the sake of argument (I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s entirely true, but let&#x27;s assume it is), the left has not done what a sane political party should do when these things happen: penalize their own party leaders who let it happen. If Clinton allowed NAFTA to pass despite his own party&#x27;s fierce opposition, why didn&#x27;t the party fire him? Why didn&#x27;t some other candidate beat him in the 1996 primaries? Why did the Democrats continue to protect him despite the fact that he&#x27;s a womanizer and a liar? And why does the party machine of which he and his wife are poster child beneficiaries continue to run the party despite the fact that it obviously doesn&#x27;t represent the will of the people? If it did, Bernie Sanders would have been the Democratic candidate for President in 2016, and again in 2020 (and he might have won in 2016).<p>In other words, I think Gurri is correct that the left talks a lot about reforms it says it wants, but doesn&#x27;t back up its talk with action.')
