Those people consider control of language and expression very important to achieve their goals of a racialist and gender-biased society. But they&#x27;re building AIs which require training on huge language corpuses, and thus inherently learn the way people writing language actually think.<p>Meanwhile the techniques to do &quot;mind control&quot; of AI aren&#x27;t that good, at least not yet, so this leads to a lot of tensions when AI learns something true but unacceptable to the woke mindset.')
