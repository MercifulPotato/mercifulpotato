The people making the predictions simply had a huge blind spot. Brexit is another similar situation. The fact that Hillary almost won or Brexit almost didn&#x27;t happen isn&#x27;t really the point, because both things were never expected to be even remotely that close. Had the predictions been &quot;Pennsylvania will be close&quot;, it would be relevant, but those weren&#x27;t the predictions.')
