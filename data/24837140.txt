Because, it&#x27;s true, I might choose Rust over C. I&#x27;m even tentatively planning to, for one project that&#x27;s still in the idea phase, and that I would normally have wanted to do in C. Though that&#x27;s not really because I see Rust as being more C-like. It&#x27;s more that I see choosing Rust as being perhaps more likely to be worth the extra effort than I&#x27;ve found to be the case for C++.')
