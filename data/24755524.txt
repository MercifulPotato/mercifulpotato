It&#x27;s not a fragmentation grenade (which you&#x27;re referring to); or an incendiary grenade; or any number of other &#x27;less than lethal&#x27; (which can be lethal) grenade types.<p>A &#x27;hand&#x27; grenade is one thrown by hand as opposed to projected from a grenade launcher. So, yes, a flashbang is a hand grenade.<p>And it&#x27;s a good thing those policemen used a concussive grenade to pacify that dangerous child. I&#x27;m sure that child was a threat that needed to be neutralized.&#x2F;s')
