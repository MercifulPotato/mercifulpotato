My thinking is use the API to let the end customer setup a treasury account on my site, they can wire&#x2F;ACH funds to this account of theirs to pay invoices, and I can use the API to &quot;debit&quot; funds from their treasury account to mine as needed to cover their service bills.<p>Handling invoicing and payments for a class of enterprise customers who can&#x27;t use a credit card for payments as a matter of policy can be painful.<p>*edit: I think this is actually possible with stripe connect today.')
