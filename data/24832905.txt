In some ways, something which is objective but very difficult to know with certainty is difficult to practically distinguish from the subjective.<p>If I am running an open source project, I would like to welcome contributions from people who have widely differing ideas of what the &quot;good&quot; is. Participation in the project should not require a general agreement on what is good, or even a general agreement on what the good is (in philosophical terms), simply an agreement on the bare minimum of shared ethics necessary for the project to successfully function.')
