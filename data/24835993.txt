It&#x27;s often been said before, but Rust is mainly a C++ replacement, while Zig is mainly a C replacement. I have switched from C++ as my default-language to C a few years ago, and having dabbled a bit in both, I feel a lot more attracted to Zig than Rust for future projects (and mostly for the same reasons why I switched from C++ to C).<p>If Zig can settle in the niche that C is used for today (including &quot;nearby&quot; areas where C programmers consider switching to a higher-level language), then it is already a great success. I think (rather: hope) what we will see in the future is that no single language will dominate certain fields anymore like it was the case in the 90&#x27;s and early 00&#x27;s.<p>Rust doesn&#x27;t need to fit into every niche, and it would be harmful to bend Rust in a way that it fits everywhere. It would end up as a &quot;kitchen-sink language&quot; with tons of competing concepts and ideas. This is exactly what&#x27;s currently killing C++.')
