They hire candidates based on degree alone. Interviews are a formality. If they are really desperate they offer to pay the training of unqualified but interested people. The idea that they would reject multiple candidates with degrees and years of experience based on interview performance is absurd. No one is rejecting math teachers with years of experience because they failed to score 100% on a pop quiz about math, covering everything from set theory, to calculus and geometry. Sitting on the hiring side of the table at a big company, I saw us reject so many qualified candidates. The most absurd rejection was when someone with 8 years of experience at a FAANG was rejected for a Senior Frontend Role because they couldn&#x27;t answer one of the interviewers pet questions about differences between MYSQL and Postgres. A situation like that would not happen if there was actually a talent shortage.<p>Also, the idea that there are all of these unfilled jobs strikes me as fairly suspect as well. I know someone who runs a startup and noticed that they had the same job posting on their site for a year. I asked them if they were having trouble finding someone and if I could help them by reaching out to people who might be interested. He admitted that they had no intention of hiring anyone, it was simply advertising. It makes them looks successful, like they were &quot;growing&quot;. Having been at bigger companies where we rejected qualified candidate after qualified candidate, I suspect this practice is widespread. Better to project growth than to admit you are actually in a hiring freeze.<p>The last point I will make is that if there was a talent shortage, the bar would stay the same or decrease. From multiple discussions with people at FAANG, they have said the bar has increased markedly in the past 3 years. Again this is not something that would happen if there was actually a talent shortage, but would happen if there was a talent surplus.<p>There isn&#x27;t a talent shortage because the candidates you interview don&#x27;t talk about their projects up to your arbitrary bar.')
