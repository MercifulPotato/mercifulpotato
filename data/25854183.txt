Not everyone is entitled to live in a good neighborhood (or any neighborhood) in a high opportunity city. Even if we knocked down every single low occupancy structure and stood up high density apartments everywhere, growth would continue until those units were maxed out too and we would be back to square one but now with everyone unhappy.<p>While I agree that existing home owners have too much power in cities and we need more flexible zoning to encourage higher density as a temporary solution, the ultimate solution to the problem is to build up other cities to shift demand away from SF, Boston, NYC, Austin, Seattle et al. Not only does this provide more opportunity in general, but it spreads power and wealth over more of the country.')
