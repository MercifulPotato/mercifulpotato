They are not the judiciary. They are not lawyers and they are not juries. They do not require criminal conviction before taking action. Your question is irellevant.<p>But to give you a partial answer anyway: Many criminals are never convicted. Many _known_ criminals are never convicted, due to lack of undeniable proof. Some criminals are convicted on lesser crimes, just to get them off the streets. There&#x27;s plenty of evidence to support the position that Trump is a criminal. He may never be convicted but not because he&#x27;s innocent.')
