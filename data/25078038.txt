Numbers such as 8-quintillion could have ~90-~100 divisors in total.<p>If I decided to use a pseudo-polynomial solution, I would quickly run out of time if I had to create a truth-table with a length of 8-quintillion.<p>So, I decided to do something trivial by ignoring non-divisors.<p>This variant of subset-product does not allow repeated use of divisors.<p>And, I use random sampling instead of a truth-table.<p>So far its been some use to me, and I would like some input.<p>What would be a better way to write the code I have given in the link?<p>How large would my input have to be before seeing exponential blowup?')
