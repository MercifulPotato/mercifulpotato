Item(by='sdoering', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603221926, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24840273, text='I am at MB Pro #3 in as many years. We replace around 2 percent of or colleagues&#x27; machines per week. Some because of the keyboard (they go into repair and are rotated back) some because they stop working from one moment to the next (also into repair, but only once, after that if it happens again they&#x27;re scrapped). All three of my MB Pro devices were in repair once because they stopped working costing me one additional day of setup of a temp device. And also one day for setting them up again after they came back. When they died for good another day for a temp replacement until the newly ordered one arrived and it was another day of setup. So I am currently quite well versed in setting up a MB Pro and have it scripted as far as I can thanks to homebrew and the like.<p>But replacing 2.5k every year with additional repairs in the 700 Euro range isn&#x27;t viable.<p>Sadly we are primarily a Mac shop and I have to say that Keynote is by far the best piece of presentation software I know of. But none the less. The hardware is currently unacceptable imho.')
