Each language has their pros and cons. It just happens so that Rust is my current sweet spot for the kind of applications I currently need to write.<p>My main point in this particular discussion is that Rust has way fewer gotchas than most other languages used in the industry, including Python and JavaScript. Whether these gotchas are problems for your use cases, only you know. I know that such sleepless nights tracking such gotchas have killed my will to write and maintain large codebases in Python or JavaScript (or C++), at least for a few years.')
