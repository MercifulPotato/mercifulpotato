The mortality rate just goes from 5.6% to 7%. Using this logic, moving from 0.1% mortality rate to 0.3% would mean &quot;you are 3 times more likely to die&quot;.<p>But that is indeed precisely what it means. The 737 MAX might have increased the accident rate from 1 in a million to 3 in a million, and that would have been a tripling. That is not sensationalistic.<p>&gt; 3) Where are the confidence intervals?<p>In the paper: &quot;(7.2% v 5.6%; adjusted difference 1.6%, 95% confidence interval 0.4% to 2.8%; P=0.01)&quot;')
