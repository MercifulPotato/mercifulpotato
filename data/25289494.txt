Item(by='bagacrap', descendants=None, kids=[25297237, 25297275], score=None, time=1607008010, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25284450, text='I have no horse in this race, but it seems to me the solar panels on single family dwellings do benefit everyone. Presumably there are times when the house in question is producing more than it uses, at which point electricity is being pumped back into the grid (I dunno about aus but in the US they&#x27;re compensated far below market rates for this generation). So it sounds to me as if home owners are selling off space that they own (at great expense!) to contribute to the grid. Apartment dwellers (or condo owners) as you have noted don&#x27;t usually have the same kind of space to sell off.<p>And of course apartment dwellers benefit from the reduction in externalities.')
