As noted in the article you cite, the reason the state epidemilogist wanted the data removed was to stop journalists from asking about covid confirmation dates, which were earlier than the state was claiming. Rebekah pushed back with her supervisor, who agreed that the request was censorship. The state (not her supervisor), acting at the behest of the governor, then removed Rebekah the following morning, alleging a &quot;pattern&quot; of insubordination though they could only ever document the 1 instance. (The governor&#x27;s involvement was confirmed by the governor&#x27;s press office giving the press release informing the public of her termination.)')
