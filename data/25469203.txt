Item(by='disown', descendants=None, kids=[25470871], score=None, time=1608311329, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25465882, text='&gt; When it comes to China, everyone is impotent taking actions, because they rely on China too much<p>Because they are a major world power. What has anyone done to stop our invasions of iraq, afghanistan, etc? What has anyone done about Britain&#x2F;France and their invasion of libya? What has anyone done about Russian annexation of crimea or the EU&#x27;s &quot;annexation&quot; of ukraine? Has nothing to do with trade. Even if we stopped trading with china, we aren&#x27;t going to attack china.<p>&gt; Thank you UN for not being able to do your job!<p>The UN was created by the US, Britain, France, Russia&#x2F;Soviet Union and China primarily to prevent wars between US, Britain, France, Russia&#x2F;Soviet Union and China. They are the 5 permanent security council members with veto powers for a reason. So the UN has actually done its job well if you understand why the UN exists.<p>&gt; UPD: it makes me sad so many Uighur people detained in camps<p>What people? You mean the terrorists&#x2F;separatists? By &quot;camps&quot;, you mean prisons&#x2F;detention centers? Why aren&#x27;t you crying over the libyans, syrians, kurds, etc?<p>&gt; People seem to forgive anything if they can get things little cheaper<p>And everyone is getting a bit tired of the &quot;uighur&quot; propaganda. The top comments here are literally propaganda. What happened to your lies of genocide? Funny how you people talked about &quot;genocide&quot; and now are beaten down to &quot;camps&quot;. What happened to genocide? Can&#x27;t really pull of that lie anymore when the uighur population has increased 10X?<p>The chinese had detention centers for uighur terrorists&#x2F;separatists for nearly 20 years now. Why are you all off a sudden &quot;upset&quot;? And stop hijacking threads that have nothing to do with china or uighurs to peddle your disinformation.')
