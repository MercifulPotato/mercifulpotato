Single core is nowhere near as good.<p>&#x27;Architecture is basically irrelevant&#x27; not the biggest factor but not irrelevant - x64 still has to support all those legacy modes and has more complex front end.<p>You&#x27;re working very hard to try to deny that Apple has passed AMD and Intel in this bit of the market. We&#x27;ll have to see what happens at higher TDPs but they clearly have the architecture and process access to do very well.<p>No idea what Qualcomm has to do with this.')
