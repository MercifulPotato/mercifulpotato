Data suggests that Hitachis are better than Seagates but I reject this kind of Ford vs. Chevy preference in hard drives - the &quot;good drives&quot; can flip immediately - with new model or even new revision of existing model.  I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to try to pursue a particular manufacturer.<p>FWIW, we have bought a <i>ton</i> of seagates over the last four years and they have been fine.')
