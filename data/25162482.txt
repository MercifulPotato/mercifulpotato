I pick up bits and pieces here and there across the web. I went through Chassel&#x27;s Emacs lisp book a while back, but can&#x27;t remember most of it as I felt it&#x27;s more aimed at developing Emacs itself.<p>A lot of Emacs is self-documenting and I use that. Look at the docs for the current mode (C-h m), learn keybindings (C-h b), change settings (M-x customize-group), read the info pages (C-h i m emacs).<p>Funnily enough, studying Common Lisp has helped me more easily read elisp.')
