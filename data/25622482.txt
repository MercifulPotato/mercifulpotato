LaunchBar (1996) predates Quicksilver (2003), and it was one of Quicksilver&#x27;s influences, likely the most important one. Spotlight&#x27;s UX more closely resembles LaunchBar&#x27;s than Quicksilver&#x27;s.<p>Here&#x27;s a bit I wrote previously on LaunchBar:<p>&gt; LaunchBar popularized many features we take for granted in search user interfaces today, such as seeing search results live as you type, fuzzy string matching, and combining search results of various types, such as apps, bookmarks, contacts, events, and files all into one unified interface.<p>(I’d argue most search interfaces today are indebted to LaunchBar, and that it has one of the worst influence-to-fame ratios of any app.)<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obdev.at&#x2F;products&#x2F;launchbar&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obdev.at&#x2F;products&#x2F;launchbar&#x2F;index.html</a>')
