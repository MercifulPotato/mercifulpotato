NAZI!” contributes nothing meaningful to a debate that is sorely missing from society.<p>Edit: why is this controversial and the post I&#x27;m replying to not? We both advocate the exact same thing: to abolish a founding principle of western civilization because sometimes people die. Hell, there&#x27;s even a quite large disparity between the number of deaths caused by those two principles - my argument has way more merit.<p>I&#x27;d really love to see why these two cases are totally different and incomparable. Three paragraphs of mental gymnastics or less though, please!')
