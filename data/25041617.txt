I&#x27;d be curious to know what the &quot;median&quot; upgrade cadence looks like.<p>Anecdotally, I have a XS, my last phone was a 5S. My parents and SO&#x27;s parents have 6&#x27;s, and they&#x27;re starting to think about upgrading.<p>I&#x27;m personally happy for the revival of the SE model (cheaper, touch id, upgraded processors, battery, etc). That&#x27;d probably be my next one, once the XS falls apart.')
