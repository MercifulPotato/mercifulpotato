The idea is to create &#x27;instruments&#x27; in the editor (2nd screenshot) by connecting basic modules to create and transform audio based on user X&#x2F;Y touch coordinates. Then, stack a bunch of instruments on screen and use your fingers to create and loop sequences of notes live on stage. The demo video ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Qk85IrgXRj0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Qk85IrgXRj0</a> ) shows how that part works.<p>Once COVID hit, I was sent home to do nothing with full pay, so I had free time and decided to power through and create a functional MVP and website. My plan was to get some beta users, polish it up, add missing features, and then start charging. I showed it around on some music production forums and to friends who dabble in it, and got terrible feedback: 1. Too hard to use; 2. not compatible with existing plugin systems; 3. terrible demo video (I&#x27;m not a musician nor an expert on creating cool synth sounds); 4. &quot;touch screens are <i></i><i></i><i></i>*&quot;; 5. nobody wants to do live production; 6. it sounds terrible<p>Of those responses, #2 was the killer. Without compatibility with existing synth plugin frameworks, like VST, it was pretty much dead in the water. No producer was going to use a synth app that didn&#x27;t support their favorite plugins, and no plugin developers were going to switch to an application with no users (I built my own custom plugin framework for it). I looked into adding support, but VST uses such a completely different architecture from the synth engine that I created that they couldn&#x27;t really work together in any sensible way. One suggestion I got was to remove my synth engine entirely and just make the app a MIDI front-end for other synths, which is something I might do in the future, though the limitations of the MIDI protocol would mean removing a lot of functionality. (I have a new WFH job now, so no more unlimited time.) I&#x27;m also thinking of open-sourcing the project entirely, but I need to clean up some things in the codebase first.<p>I did decide to split out the UI manager that I created for the app into a separate open-source Windows UI framework, which I still work on and use for other small utility apps that I create: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyurl.com&#x2F;upbeatui" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyurl.com&#x2F;upbeatui</a><p>If I were to do it again, I&#x27;d have started with support for existing VST plugins or MIDI and worked from there. I also wouldn&#x27;t have wasted so much time figuring out auth stuff. The only costs were the domain and VPS hosting.')
