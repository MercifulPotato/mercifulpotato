Here&#x27;s the thing, Google is a big company. When a big company offers a service or product you expect a long shelf life so you can justify the time&#x2F;money investment to use it. If you stumble across an open source or just some other random project by a single dev, you have an instinctive expectation that the project could die at any time. Thus, you invest your effort accordingly unless you&#x27;re a hobbyist that enjoys the exploration (which is not most people).<p>Google has the focus of a 12 year adhd kid who just ate a whole birthday cake, unless when it comes to data collection. Google doesn&#x27;t produce quality products anymore. They found their niche and pretend to do other things to try continuing that &quot;do no evil&quot; lie of a mission statement they used to have.<p>Here&#x27;s the lesson, you can&#x27;t trust google with anything. You base your personal or business infrastructure on Google you can expect one of two things:complete privacy invasion or they&#x27;re going to destroy whatever you&#x27;re using because they never took it seriously in the first place.')
