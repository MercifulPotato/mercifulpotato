At least here in Norway we had about double the confirmed infection rate on 12th November (771) that we had in the early peak on 26th March (423), 7 day averages.  We are now down to 110 per 100 k people (14 day average).<p>But on the 9th March 17% of tests were positive, on the 18th of November it was 3.5%, now it is only 2.2%.  But we test a lot more people now; 6k tests per day in the early peak in the spring, 31k in November, now about 90k per week, roughly 1600 per 100k people.<p>Here the second wave was regarded as rather serious but the threshold for regarding things as bad is rather lower than is usual in Europe; in comparison with most of our peers and neighbours we have it pretty good.<p>Sources: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vg.no&#x2F;spesial&#x2F;2020&#x2F;corona&#x2F;#norge" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vg.no&#x2F;spesial&#x2F;2020&#x2F;corona&#x2F;#norge</a>, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vg.no&#x2F;spesial&#x2F;2020&#x2F;corona&#x2F;norden&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vg.no&#x2F;spesial&#x2F;2020&#x2F;corona&#x2F;norden&#x2F;</a>')
