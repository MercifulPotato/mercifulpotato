I know of the ANSI layout, which is present on this laptop, and the ISO layout, which is used in much of Europe, has a differently shaped Enter key and other differences. There might be other physical layouts I&#x27;m not aware of. I can touch type on an ISO keyboard, I can&#x27;t on an ANSI keyboard. And frankly I&#x27;m not willing to adjust to a different layout just for my laptop.')
