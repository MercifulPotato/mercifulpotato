It&#x27;s fast, I have one project that runs ~1400 asserts and on each save it shows the results less than 2 seconds later.<p>THen I write the code in my IDE source editor and use a keyboard shortcut to send it to the REPL as I&#x27;m working. I wouldn&#x27;t ever write code directly in the REPL. By the time I&#x27;ve got it working in the REPL I normally then see that all my tests are passing.')
