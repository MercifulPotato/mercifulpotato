The reasoning there shows the real numbers, despite having cardinality of the continuum, are inadequate for measuring even the following <i>countable</i> set of Big-O complexity classes: O(2^n) together with O(n),O(n^2),...,O(n^i),...<p>Is there something special about intelligence that implies we only need to consider RL-environments with real-valued rewards, and not, say, big-O-complexity-class rewards? Maybe there is. But if there is, the proof will have to be nontrivial---at a bare minimum, it should make some reference to what the reals <i>are</i> (e.g., the unique complete ordered field). This would be quite world-shattering, to real analysts if to no-one else. But none of the RL literature seems to make any reference to what the reals actually <i>are</i>, instead just taking it for granted that the reals are a magical number system as flexible as anybody could ever want. (Other authors essentially pointed this out before I did; see footnote 10 in my paper.)')
