It&#x27;s basically a CRM -- businesses will subscribe to our service and they will enter and manage their customers&#x27; info and do typical &quot;CRM stuff&quot;.<p>We don&#x27;t plan selling data to the Russians or other naughty things like that.<p>I need appropriate Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and EULA documents. What are my options? The three I see are:<p>1) Get a lawyer and pay $20000.<p>2) Take a similar company&#x27;s Terms and modify it. What we plan to do is conceptually very similar to other CRM companies.<p>3) Use some sort of template or generator.')
