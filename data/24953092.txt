Driven by conspiracy theories about satanic pedophiles and new world order death camps. We&#x27;ve descended from Lincoln-Douglas to the juvenile circus between Biden and Trump.<p>And the main reason for this, in my opinion, is having &quot;change&quot; be embodied in a single demagogue figure elected to <i>force</i> their party&#x27;s agenda through at any cost, rather than having &quot;change&#x27; understood to be an effect of long-term and widespread engagement with the system at multiple levels.<p>Change shouldn&#x27;t be the president&#x27;s job anyway, that&#x27;s what the legislature is for, and people wanting change should engage more with local and state politics. The executive keeps the system running, which implicitly means keeping the status quo.')
