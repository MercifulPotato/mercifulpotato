Some partners issue credentials with patterns that make them very hard to distinguish from innocuous strings. For example, a Datadog token looks identical to a commit SHA. We would never block developers from pushing commits to GitHub just because they had 40 character hexadecimal strings in them!<p>GitHub&#x27;s partnership approach works around the false positive problem by having the token issuer check whether a token is real and take action only if it is. However, this is a one-way communication from GitHub - the token issuer doesn&#x27;t need to tell us whether the candidate secret we sent them was real or not, and in most cases we never know.<p>As a result, we can&#x27;t replicate the zero false positive experience in a pre-receive hook (i.e., before the commit is pushed to GitHub). There would also be performance considerations from making 30+ http requests as part of a pre-receive hook.<p>In future, we are looking at creating a pre-receive hook solution that focuses on patterns that have a very low false positive rate. There are already some open source solutions that do this (links below) - in fact the OP linked to one from his Twitter thread. If&#x2F;when GitHub offer is, it will definitely be opt-in, rather than opt-out!<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;thoughtworks&#x2F;talisman&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;thoughtworks&#x2F;talisman&#x2F;</a><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;awslabs&#x2F;git-secrets" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;awslabs&#x2F;git-secrets</a>')
