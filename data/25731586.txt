Isn&#x27;t Microsoft working on something similar for Windows as a host? Clearly it would be the biggest violation of the  &quot;no language interpreters in iOS!&quot; rule ever, but given the incredible decline of non-phablet Android the i12 mini is just so very attractive... and I&#x27;d rather bet on a userspace API container on top of the vendor OS than replicate the customary experienced of Android custom ROMs on devices with even less hardware support&#x2F;documentation than usual.')
