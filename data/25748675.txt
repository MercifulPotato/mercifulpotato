The cost of vaccination is a little arm soreness for a day or two (hardly anything).<p>The added benefit is that you&#x27;ve decreased your odds of being put out of commission for 7-&gt;9 days (if you are being responsible).  Current flu vaccines are around 40-&gt;70% effective.  Not great, but better than nothing.<p>The reason I&#x27;m so excited about the moderna vaccines is that it can drive those efficacy rates much higher.  That&#x27;s because they can delay manufacturing to be far nearer to the outbreak.  The key to a highly effective flu vaccine is matching the strains.  mRNA vaccination presents a way to do that a lot better because you don&#x27;t need 7-&gt;10 months of lead time to make sure there is enough supply.')
