Discussing social class therefore became a taboo, as it breaches the polite fiction that America is a classless society. I call it a polite fiction because if you pay attention there are tons of ways that Americans find a way to separate social class from economic class (e.g. “money can’t buy taste” as a way to dismiss someone as being low class and rich).<p>Of course, like any way to divide up people there is ample opportunity for harmful and mean stereotypes. But I don’t think that alone is why discussing class is so explosive in America.')
