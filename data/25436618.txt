They brought PC fragmentation to the consoles by making different versions of the same console over the decade.<p>To make it worse, they will not let a publisher publish just to PS4 Pro or Xbox One X. Your game has to work on all versions of the console.<p>It&#x27;s beyond idiotic and I&#x27;m surprised it took so long for the consequences to be visible.<p>I&#x27;m glad Sony at least seems to have backed away from fragmenting their own platform in this generation.<p>CDPR should have done their due diligence, obviously, but the platform owners have done them no favors by adding another dimension to the testing matrix.')
