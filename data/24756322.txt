Not saying don&#x27;t put money in ETFs but the returns aren&#x27;t as fast and you have to earn a good salary to do so.<p>However adding some money into the market leaders would be a wise idea IMO. I.e. TSLA and AAPL. Since you are in the ETF ($SPY) for now then you are already invested in AAPL as it&#x27;s the largest portion of it so adding TSLA which is going to be $5,000 in a decade would be wise.')
