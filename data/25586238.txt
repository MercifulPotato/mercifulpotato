I started with Apple BASIC in 1979, then simply due to curiosity learned many other languages (many have fallen by the wayside, 6502, FORTH, Pascal, COBOL) and it bootstrapped my career as a software developer which I still do to this day (like many others of my generation).<p>All your other comments about having to &quot;unlearn&quot; stuff was perhaps your problem; apropos directory representations, by 1987 due to work and college I worked with multiple different OS directory mechanisms including ADFS, RDOS, AOS, VMS, CP&#x2F;M, MSDOS and UNIX.
