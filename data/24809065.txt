That&#x27;s true that apt-get was hit and miss in Debian around 2003&#x2F;2004, and in Ubuntu maybe around 2008&#x2F;9. But if nowadays you have &quot;breaks every few weeks&quot; than either your hardware is broken, or you installed custom versions of core libraries by hand, or you&#x27;re running Debian Experimental (even &quot;unstable&quot; have been very solid for at least the past 5 years). Let&#x27;s get serious, would you?<p>I mean you can like Windows all you want. But don&#x27;t spurt utter nonsense, please. If what you say was true, the internet would be broken half of the time.')
