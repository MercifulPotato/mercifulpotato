Other?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;ve been working on my small project for about half a year now. It&#x27;s slowly coming together but the progress has slowed down considerably.\nNot so much due to technical debt or pesky problems, but rather something more annoying: I don&#x27;t know what feature to work on or what direction to take the project.<p>Of course I&#x27;m eating my own dog food, but my own use-case gets me only so far. How did you get a product that interests people?\nIdeally I&#x27;d like to charge money for this, but I think I&#x27;m still far from that point in time &#x2F; functionality.<p>My project is about tracking your net-worth so you can map out your own road to FI &#x2F; FIRE. So far I have portfolio managing &#x2F; stock tracking &#x2F; FI goal setting.\nI have a rough roadmap that talks about tracking your cash &#x2F; bank accounts ideally via PDS2, but other than that I&#x27;m kinda drawing blanks.\nThe main issue that I have right now is that I don&#x27;t want to start at adding bank accounts because of all the manual work for the user, at least until I get automated syncing set up but for that I need to register a company etc with each bank. That is a step too far right now because I have only one user: myself.<p>If you want to check it out and give some constructive feedback, I would hugely appreciate it. Feedback about anything at all: Design, functionality, ease of use, language mistakes, etc.\nYou can find it at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.roadto.fi&#x2F;#&#x2F;')
