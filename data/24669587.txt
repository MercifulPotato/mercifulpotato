Monopoly isn&#x27;t necessarily the right word, but it is rather frustrating that all these smartwatches by default beam all of your biometrics into a non-hippa-compliant datastore, and that these datastores don&#x27;t interoperate.<p>It&#x27;s really tricky because right now Garmin, Fitbit, Apple, and the others are all basically financing their data portals through device sales. Which makes sense because I wouldn&#x27;t have paid a subscription for it before I bought the watch, but now that I have the watch (Garmin) it is an invaluable service. But it seems wrong that the watch manufacturer owns the data - I would like a data storage company with strong privacy guarantees and strong analytics. But I&#x27;m not sure I trust any of these companies, it seems like they&#x27;re all trying to figure out how to monetize my data by selling analytics to third-parties. (Even Apple.)')
