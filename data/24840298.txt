Sometimes, the simpler, boring, perhaps &quot;soulless&quot; technology is the most appropriate technology for the task.<p>Remember Microsoft Bob? Or 3D filebrowsers for Unix? Turns out, those weren&#x27;t improvements over the more traditional filesystem browsers that persist to this day. More recently, the tile concept that MS tried in Windows 8 didn&#x27;t catch on either.<p>When I took a course on information visualization, one of the takeaways was that, even as we&#x27;re learning about several different techniques for displaying data, sometimes (more often than you&#x27;d think!) the most effective technique is a simple table. A well-formatted table, to be sure, but a table can be more powerful than even an interactive graph.<p>More to the point: I&#x27;m talking to you with pure text, even less interactive content than a microfiche machine reading a newspaper. But what interactivity would enhance my content or clarify my point instead of providing a distraction?')
