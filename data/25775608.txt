Item(by='vaduz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610627604, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25775561, text='XWayland is essentially a translation layer consisting of Xserver and Wayland client [0]. Therefore it has all the same problems a normal Xserver has, which they do acknowledge:<p>&gt; A Wayland compositor usually spawns only one Xwayland instance. This is because many X11 applications assume they can communicate with other X11 applications through the X server, and this requires a shared X server instance. This also means that Xwayland does not protect nor isolate X11 clients from each other, unless the Wayland compositor specifically chooses to break the X11 client intercommunications by spawning application specific Xwayland instances. X11 clients are naturally isolated from Wayland clients.<p>I use QubesOS, but it comes with its own set of problems as well.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wayland.freedesktop.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;html&#x2F;ch05.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wayland.freedesktop.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;html&#x2F;ch05.html</a>')
