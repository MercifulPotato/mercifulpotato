No one would complain if a school said they would swap out To Kill A Mockingbird for some other book so long as that other book was better. While I&#x27;m not sure exactly what book that would be, I&#x27;m sure one has been produced in the past 60 years. However, people aren&#x27;t complaining about To Kill A Mockingbird being replaced, they are complaining about To Kill A Mockingbird being explicitly barred from even potentially being used in a curriculum with no argument as to the merits of any alternative. There are countless books that could be but aren&#x27;t in the curriculum because some better option took their spot, and they don&#x27;t need to be specifically banned. To Kill A Mockingbird is at worst sub-optimal, but it is by no means inappropriate. Only someone completely incapable of critical thinking would lump To Kill A Mockingbird into the same category as Mein Kampf.')
