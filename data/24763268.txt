It basically ran the compiler on every keystroke and if your code is temporarily invalid then it will open a dialog telling you your code is invalid (with no indication what is invalid or where). You know, my code might not be valid in this second but it will be in a minute. However, since every construct had to be valid until I reach my &quot;destination&quot; the editor forced me to think outside of it. People write out their thoughts as code so they don&#x27;t have to keep them in their head. Sometimes those thoughts are not valid code but they are thoughts nevertheless.<p>Then there is the obvious data transmission problem. We have 10 fingers so we can easily transmit 10 bits of information per second. Try doing that with your tongue or your toes. We can have blind or deaf programmers but if you lose both your hands your career is over.<p>Programming is text because anything else would be stupid. Show me your semantic muscles and I&#x27;ll change my mind.')
