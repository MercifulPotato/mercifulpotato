Item(by='vaduz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610573355, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25767354, text='If you are a business, wth a few defined exceptions (&quot;reader&quot;, multiplatform, _physical merchandise from outside of the platform_ etc.), you accept payments through Apple Pay, don&#x27;t direct people to your website to to send you money regardless how you decide to call it and pay Apple the cut they desire. FOSS developers are still businesses, not charities, much as we like to pretend otherwise - and &quot;tips&quot;, &quot;donations&quot;, &quot;patronage&quot; and similar verbiage does not change that.<p>If you are an actual nonprofit, you get to ask for donations both via app and your website and have Apple not take the cut.<p>Don&#x27;t like it - don&#x27;t deploy on the platfrom, but if you persist you will soon run out of platforms. Note that particular point has also caused WireGuard to be delisted from Google&#x27;s Play Store before so it should not come as a suprise to anyone (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21268389" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21268389</a>).<p>Note that some of those distinctions are legal - where I am, I need to know if I am gifting you money or donating to a nonprofit to report it on the tax record (and I certainly need to know if I were to get my own limited company to &quot;donate&quot;), as going above certain limits makes _me_ liable for tax on gifts as well, including reporting who the recipient is. &quot;I sent that money to a random functional email PayPal@zx2c4.com I can&#x27;t say much about&quot; does not cut it. Yes, Jason might be at the other end of it - but as is, it fails the smell test compared to other FOSS projects. Simple as that.<p>Can we go back to discussing why Apple is bad due to their ever changing APIs, general disregard for backwards compatibility and for that matter general compatibility with anything else and not one of the few things in the whole process that make sense?  Or, for that matter, why Google effectively making GMS and locked bootloader a requirement for corporate and&#x2F;or finance apps is ensuring that in many areas the existence of unlocked devices&#x2F;alternative AOSP distributions is and will remain a fig leaf purely there to avoid being considered the one true dominant player?')
