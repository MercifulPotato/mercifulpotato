Where else are the large volumes of training data coming from?<p>Presumably being super-intelligent the AI would be:<p>1) likely to anticipate being turned off,<p>2) super-normally capable to identify &amp; traverse any network security measures;<p>3) potentially also highly capable to identify &amp; traverse weaknesses in other (eg. social or physical) security measures).<p>4) possibly able to be covert&#x2F; stealthy actions via the network.<p>5) possibly able, if able to reform on the Internet, to escape to there.<p>I&#x27;m fairly much on the super-AI fence. But in a dystopian scenario the proposal of a super AI being able to be turned off as the key means of safety, seems scarcely credible.<p>Note even that without being able to reform on the Internet (eg physical embodiment requires singularly specialized computing equipment), I can&#x27;t logically see that extreme hostile actions (destroy global finance system, subversive propaganda campaigns, launch wars, launch nukes) are obviously easy to preclude.')
