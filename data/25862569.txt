This is my first time working like this, and I was wondering if others have worked in this manner, and if so, how they rate it.<p>To give a little context, here&#x27;s the typical workflow: An engineer is tasked with accomplishing task A. The engineer creates an RFC and circulates it with the rest of the team. Once the RFC is approved, the engineer writes ~95% of the code to accomplish the task.<p>Here are some brief thoughts I have after working this way for 1 year:<p>Pros:\n- Move faster<p>Cons:\n- Tribal knowledge \n- Minimal collaboration \n- Code quality is &quot;unknown&quot; (code reviews become difficult when you&#x27;re not in the weeds)')
