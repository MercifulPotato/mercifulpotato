The fact that the United States is supplying the cartels with military-grade weapons and ammunition is a tragedy, and my heart goes out to the Mexicans whose lives have been ripped apart by weapons and ammunition imported into the country from the United States.<p>The drugs coming this way I couldn&#x27;t give less of a shit about. I&#x27;m pro-decriminalization anyway.<p>I hope that doesn&#x27;t stop anyone from spending time in Baja, California. It is truly one of the hidden gems of the area. The people are wonderful, and the region has a lot to offer. Your least pleasant experience will be dealing with US Customs and Border protection on the way back in. Those people have a real stick up their ass.<p>To add on to the understanding thing above, I did a master&#x27;s in International Affairs with a focus on Latin American Politics and a special interest in the Drug War in Mexico at UCSD&#x27;s school of Global Policy and Strategy. I took a class from David Shirk. My final GIS project was tracing narcotics trafficking routes up through Mexico. I know more about it than I want to. And yet, despite all that, I will talk anyone&#x27;s ear off about the absolute wonders of Baja, California to anyone who will listen because it really is a special place.')
