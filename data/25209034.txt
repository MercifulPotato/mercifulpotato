From my standpoint, I could pass algebra for sure. (I actually did really well in my college-level statistics course!) But what I can&#x27;t do is take a real-world problem, and turn it into an algebra equation. I understand the math fine, but I can&#x27;t &quot;visualize&quot; how it aligns to things in the real world.<p>In this way, a word problem on a test because a matching game: because they phrase the problem in a certain way, and I know we covered X problem recently, I know the following equation must fit into the words. Without the guardrails of the test, this whole process falls apart completely.')
