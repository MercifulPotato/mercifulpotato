So they should just be happy with 1&#x2F;6 of the wealth US Residents get and stop now?<p>What Crime is happening in their supply chain? Prison Labour is not illegal in the US or China. US constitution specifically allows it... How do we force Apple to take responsibility for this?\nThere is solid proof of Labour camps, Prison Camps, Reeducation Camps, and persecution of the Uighurs, even the Chinese &quot;tyrannical dictatorship&quot; don&#x27;t dispute it. It is fairly common knowledge among Chinese citizens as well. What will probably surprise you, is it has much wider support from the Chinese people than you&#x27;d expect. Now this could be that the context of &quot;why&quot; they are persecuted is not well known outside of china. It could also be that Chinese citizens are not comfortable objecting to it from fear of speaking out against their government. But it&#x27;s not as clear cut of &quot;wrongdoing&quot; that this article nor this discussion makes out.')
