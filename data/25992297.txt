It&#x27;s deployed to GCP Cloud Run with a Cloud SQL database, and integrated with Auth0 and Stripe. I use tiangolo&#x27;s uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi base image.<p>It&#x27;s been really nice for me. As easy as flask, plenty of docs for real world applications, and the performance is great. The emphasis on type systems in the docs was ideal for me.<p>I was deciding between this and DRF after wanting something more opinionated than just Flask, and I&#x27;m really happy with my decision so far.')
