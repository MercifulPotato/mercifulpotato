Item(by='Q_is_4_Quantum', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607775829, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25394455, text='There is a fun generalization of the game. Assume the penny has (unknown) bias p. You want to output a new flip with bias some function f(p). So f(p)=1&#x2F;2 is what you described, ie how to get a fair flip. For some functions it can be even easier, e.g. f(p)=p^2 - definitely only requires two flips.<p>How about:<p>f(p)=p^2&#x2F;(p^2+(1-p)^2)<p>f(p)=2p<i>(1-p)<p>f(p)=3p</i>(1-p)<p>f(p)=sqrt(p)<p>The last two are tricky, I took them from a paper &quot;functions arising from coin flipping&quot; by Wastlund. (The quantum generalization is even more fun, but this text box is too small to contain it.)')
