I do not believe they should be.  The foundation of the American style of governance is &quot;For the people by the people&quot;.<p>The government is the common organization of individual natural rights.  Any legitimate force the government has comes from the common organization of the natural and individual right of self defense. We the people ordain and establish governments to protect our individual rights.  As such the common force is to only do what the individuals have the natural and lawful right to do, to protect our rights.<p>So if it would be unlawful or unethical for me to enter your property, mow your yard and take our car as compensation it should also be unlawful &#x2F; unethical for the government to do the same<p>Granting government special powers is how government abuse occurs.  Just look at all the police abuse,  this occurs because we have given the police immunities, protections and powers not afforded to the general public.  This power will, is, and always will be abused by those that hold it<p>This was the fundamental problem with the Monarch system we revolted from over 250 years ago, and as we granted the government ever increasing levels of power far above what a normal citizen could ever dream of the resulting problems are clear, evident and predictable.  Including the resulting Wealth inequality which I can and have made a case is cause by government regulations not by capitalism or lack  of regulations')
