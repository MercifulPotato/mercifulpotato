Item(by='bleepblorp', descendants=None, kids=[24706556], score=None, time=1602059242, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24705760, text='There is no element of truth whatsoever to the Republican view that Democrats engage in <i>voter fraud.</i> This has been a baseless Republican shibboleth for decades and it has been repeatedly investigated. Even those investigations tied closely enough to Republican politics to be vulnerable to motivated reasoning have found no evidence of systematic voter fraud[0].<p>And yet, the voter fraud narrative continues, in very large part because it justifies very well documented Republican <i>electoral fraud</i> schemes designed to restrict the democratic rights of demographics that do not vote Republican. Indeed, the GOP was under legal supervision for 35 years, until 2018, for systemic, organized, voter suppression strategies intended to tilt elections in its favor.[1] Freed of any supervision by the Supreme Court, the GOP is happily working to manipulate the vote in its favor in 2020[2][3][4][5]. Also: &quot;Russia, if you&#x27;re listening,&quot;[6][7] is a clear case of violating democratic rules for partisan advantage. There is no equivalent history among modern Democrats after the post-civil rights realignment of the parties.<p>As far as the legitimacy of the electoral college (and, for that matter, the Senate and the Supreme Court) is concerned, the United States was founded on the principles of no taxation without representation and that all men (in the language of the time) are created equal[8]. While it is within the GOP&#x27;s constitutional right to fill the supreme court with conservative extremists, the practice disenfranchises the majority and subjects them to the rule (=taxation, among other things) of a minority that is hostile to both their interests, and, indeed, to their way of life. It is naive to expect that the creeping disenfranchisement of the majority of the population--in a country founded by launching a rebellion to end its own disenfranchisement--will pass quietly.<p>This is not a both-sides bad issue. This is a contest between two mutually incompatible views of the United States: between a broad coalition that wants democratically-representative government and a narrow, but highly motivated, bloc that sees no value in democracy and is actively working to undermine it.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;24&#x2F;fbi-has-not-seen-evidence-of-widespread-voter-fraud-director-wray-tells-senators.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;24&#x2F;fbi-has-not-seen-evidence-of...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2018&#x2F;01&#x2F;the-gop-just-received-another-tool-for-suppressing-votes&#x2F;550052&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2018&#x2F;01&#x2F;the-gop...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aclu.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;civil-liberties&#x2F;block-the-vote-voter-suppression-in-2020&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aclu.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;civil-liberties&#x2F;block-the-vote-vot...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rollingstone.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;politics-features&#x2F;trump-campaign-2020-voter-suppression-consent-decree-1028988&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rollingstone.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;politics-features&#x2F;trum...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.houstonchronicle.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;columnists&#x2F;grieder&#x2F;article&#x2F;Grieder-Gov-Abbott-s-latest-ham-fisted-voter-15614946.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.houstonchronicle.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;columnists&#x2F;grieder&#x2F;art...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;01&#x2F;politics&#x2F;jacob-wohl-jack-burkman-voter-suppression-operation&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;01&#x2F;politics&#x2F;jacob-wohl-jack-burk...</a><p>[6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;storage&#x2F;report.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;storage&#x2F;report.pdf</a><p>[7] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mueller_report" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mueller_report</a><p>[8] Is civics education so bad that I really need to cite this?')
