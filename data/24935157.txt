I also assume every reporter from every publication is investigating it too.<p>&gt; Are the media reporting on how they chased down leads to confirm or deny the report?<p>The media never reports on the process of chasing leads and inconclusive stories (which is exactly what NYP did). They only post once they have the actual facts.<p>&gt; by the media sources who suppressed the story<p>First off, it&#x27;s the social media site that suppressed the story, not other publications. Secondly, not reporting something until you have it confirmed is not &quot;suppressing&quot; a story, it&#x27;s actual journalism.<p>&gt; as is the publicly stated methodology taken by the Washington Post.<p>Source?')
