It is one of those terms where it is easy to cause disagreement—as is evident in this thread—because you failed to define what you really mean by your use of the term.<p>API is a term of art—it means different things to different practitioners. What the term means to you will depend on where you work on the stack.<p>For a web-based application served over the Internet:<p><pre><code>  - an end user will need to work visual APIs (web GUIs) rendered using HTML&#x2F;CSS&#x2F;JS;\n\n  - a frontend engineer will need to work with text-based APIs (web services) exposed by web servers on the Internet;\n\n  - a backend engineer will need to work with system APIs exposed by web &amp; DB servers over the internal network;\n\n  - a DBMS engineer will need to work with low-level APIs exposed by the OS to internal processes.\n</code></pre>\nAt the top of the stack the final user is an <i>end user</i> while at the 2nd-4th levels, the final user is <i>a programmer</i>. The same term is used at different levels of the stack but the context makes it absolutely clear who the final <i>consumer</i> of each API really is.')
