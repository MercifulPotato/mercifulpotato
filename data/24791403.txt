I sure hope so', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I wanted to share this post with the world to vent a little bit. I have tried my hand in various things, and all my startups have failed.<p>What do I consider failure, failed to gain any interest, failure to provide monetary compensation, failure to work on something I enjoy doing, failure in creating my own preferred lifestyle.<p>But why? Why do some gain massive followers and others hardly get anything? Is it truly the efforts put into the product. For this post lets define product as SaaS, e-commerce, productized product.<p>Does success hinge on research prior too committing to a product, niche, or service? Is that the way to success?\nDoes it hinge on selling something that the end user truly needs and desires? Is that the secret formula?<p>My experiences:\nAmazon FBA - Failed after using tools &#x27;jungle scout&#x27;. Investing into PPC and lost money. \nLesson learned, you need to be unique in what you sell, have a better spin on it, and be sure to target high margins. Result -$$$<p>E-com &#x2F; Drop shipping  * 3 - Search google trends, keywords, confirmed good search results, setup the landing page ran ads inside various platforms. Result -$<p>SaaS apps - failed - Shipped w&#x2F;o speaking to potential customers along the way. Result -$$<p>Newsletter failed - not much attraction = not many subs.<p>All this failure is suppose to teach me something. It&#x27;s suppose to propel me into the next phase but it has not.<p>It did cement failure sucks, it&#x27;s hard to make things that people actually want and i&#x27;m not even talking about paid products. As the example, newsletter a free thing was also a dried up pond.<p>My question is now what? I am tired of failing but I am not tired of trying. I will make this work one way or another. The question is HOW? \nHow would you approach things if you were in my shoes?<p>I hope this honest submission of my thoughts can create meaningful discussion. Share your experiences, thoughts, emotions. How did you fail, Did you overcome it?')
