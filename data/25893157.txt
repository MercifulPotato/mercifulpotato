That might give it a performance boost on a raspberry pi (it basically avoids all the overhead from reading and byte-compiling all the PHP files on every request)<p>There are things that you can do to speed up nextcloud though:<p>- look into php byte-code caching (opcache and stuff like that)<p>- make sure your database indexes are set up correctly: I can&#x27;t remember where in the admin ui (I&#x27;m on the phone rn) but there&#x27;s some sort of self-test&#x2F;diagnostics page that will tell you about database indexes to create (and the SQL commands to run too, iirc)<p>- you can tell nextcloud to use a redis for caching too, that could give an additional performance boost<p>But yeah, again, the raspberry pi isn&#x27;t really that good for this kind of things. For pretty much the same (total!) Price of a RPI and related accessories I&#x27;d get something like a Lenovo m93p tiny off eBay and slap an SSD into that. You&#x27;d get proper performance albeit with a higher tdp.<p>I hope this helps :)')
