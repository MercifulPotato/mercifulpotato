I (and many economists) argue that it is one of our worst tools. A negative income tax is much better. It won&#x27;t distort labor markets or risk driving up unemployment. And it&#x27;s fairer in that the burden is shared collectively rather than just by some industries. Goldman Sachs doesn&#x27;t get hurt by a minimum wage, but small business owners, such as those running a convenience store, do.')
