The only reason they are valuable is because you can sell them later to the next loser.<p>Take Walmart for example, it would take 70 years for you to get back your money from the stock from its dividends which are extremely stable. Do you think that is worth it? No, you pay for the stock since you know someone else will also pay for the stock when you sell, not because you want to get those sweet dividends.')
