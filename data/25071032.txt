It can&#x27;t hold lane position on a straight and level freeway, which is compulsory. There&#x27;s a specific place on the freeway near my home where the car slams on the brakes every time, if I leave the ACC engaged. In the city (of Berkeley) it freaks out constantly about oncoming cars in their own lanes on curves or parked cars to the right of narrow driving lanes. Sometimes it just slams on the brakes if I&#x27;m pulling up behind a car at a walking pace at a red signal.<p>If Honda delivers L3 driving six months from now, it would be a huge leap over what they are selling today.')
