The limits were designed to be large enough to be never encountered in practice. Not just large enough to be never encountered by the people working on it, but large enough that it is not possible to fit a filesystem that needs more on earth, no matter how good your technology is.<p>The only limits that can be reached is that the maximum size of a single file is 2^64 bytes, or 16 exabytes, and the maximum amount of files in a single directory is 2^48, or 281 trillion. The other limits are large enough that to reach them would generally require more energy than it would take to literally boil the oceans.')
