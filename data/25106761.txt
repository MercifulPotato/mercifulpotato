Item(by='derekp7', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605488637, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25106683, text='I run Fedora, and update to the latest release about a month or two after it is released.  Mostly because my job is with RHEL &#x2F; CentOS, and Fedora keeps me up to date with what will be in the next RHEL major version.  However I should correct my previous statement, that I have weird stuff happen with Wayland, and I give it a shot periodically but switch back to X11.  (In my case, &quot;weird stuff&quot; is things like desktop screen sharing not working with MS Teams, or having HiDPI scaling interacting badly with older style X apps such as OpenSCAD -- in that case with Wayland the cursor has a hard time grabbing window edges).')
