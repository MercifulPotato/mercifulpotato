That isn&#x27;t to say that other fields aren&#x27;t deep, don&#x27;t get me wrong. But the more tightly coupled with the high-level physical world a field is (think for example medicine or biology), the more it is prone to having technologoical advances from the outside make new sub-fields crop up and old ones die. Think of for example the multitude of research areas made possible by gene editing, or high-resolution NMR imaging.<p>Of course this happens to some extent in math too, but a lot of subfields aren&#x27;t killed or born due to outside technological changes. Number theory remains number theory, and still builds directly on centuries of work, even if computer verification has helped in some cases (disclaimer: I&#x27;m not a number theorist).<p>For most subfields of mathematics, you have a lot of depth to cover before you get to the forefront of research. That isn&#x27;t to say that it&#x27;s by any means easy to get to the forefront of more high-level physical sciences, but there are certainly subfields in biology or medicine that didn&#x27;t exist a mere 40 years ago (also true in math, but in <i>general</i> far more rare there).')
