Mind you, when I say &quot;general problem solving&quot;, I don&#x27;t mean brain teasers like &quot;how many piano tuners there are in Manhattan&quot; (I don&#x27;t like that kind of problems at all).<p>I don&#x27;t remember the details, but one problem was about estimating the most optimal move in a poker game given a specific situation at the table. The rules were explained in a very relevant and simple way to those not familiar with poker, which I wasn&#x27;t at the time, and I didn&#x27;t find that my lack of poker knowledge affected my ability to solve that problem at all (which is already an impressive feat, major credit to those who wrote that specific problem that way).<p>Zero memory of the rest of the problems, but most of them were relying on just basic stats and reasoning skills&#x2F;critical thinking, no bs, and they were written&#x2F;designed in such a way that it was interesting. The kind of a problem you would randomly see online in the middle of some discussion and won&#x27;t be able to resist the temptation to stay glued to your computer screen until you solve it.')
