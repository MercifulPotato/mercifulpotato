It continues to send packets with low TTL, noting the response time of the intervening routers. This allows mtr to print the response percentage and response times of the internet route to HOSTNAME. A sudden increase in packet loss or response time is often an indication of a bad (or simply overloaded) link.\n    \n    The results are usually reported as round-trip-response times in milliseconds and the percentage of packetloss.\n</code></pre>\nThis actually makes me wonder about whether there&#x27;s a command that&#x27;ll let me see short summaries of what every file under &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin is, in the form of a list. Definitely wasn&#x27;t aware of mtr as an average web developer up until now.')
