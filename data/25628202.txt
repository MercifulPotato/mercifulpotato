Emacs is a very good programming editor, but it&#x27;s not in that arena that it shines and the alternatives may be as good if not better.<p>My point is that while I know many, many folks who use Linux only for SW development (at work), it would be silly to view Linux primarily as a SW development environment when it can be used for so much more. And so it is with Emacs. It&#x27;s like saying &quot;I dropped Linux for Visual Studio.&quot; The comparison makes little sense, unless you&#x27;re talking to the folks who only use Linux for a small thing.<p>As for telemetry, I can again invoke the Linux analogy. While it would certainly be nice to get an accurate poll of what people use Linux for, I don&#x27;t think many kernel developers will want to drop multimedia features from it because less than 10% of Linux users use those features (10% is really optimistic!). Emacs is an elisp development environment, and a text environment. Anything that works with these two is within its scope. It&#x27;s a valid discussion on what should come bundled with Emacs vs off loaded to external packages, but that&#x27;s not the discussion over here.<p>(Yes, yes I&#x27;m aware that Linus and the kernel folks <i>do</i> often drop features because they believe it&#x27;s not used often, but those usually are way, way down the tail of the distribution).')
