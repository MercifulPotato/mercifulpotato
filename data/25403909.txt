They&#x27;ve been saying for years that it is &quot;now&quot; called LinkedIn Learning, but to date, it is still Lynda.com and so are pretty much all references to it.<p>It looks like LinkedIn bought it and then forgot about the branding migration. Even my library still just calls it Lynda.<p>I just logged in now to make sure that what I said about library cards was still true. It is.<p>BTW: Since it is a curated list, you could probably forgo the quality rating. The idea of curation is that all of your links should be high quality. Nobody intentionally promotes crappy curated items (unless of course that&#x27;s the intent).')
