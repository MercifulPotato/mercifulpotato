If your daughter wants to become a professional -- if she wants to get into one of the elite schools that train the future professionals -- she&#x27;ll require private lessons and conservatories. (And don&#x27;t forget the physical therapy, because it&#x27;s brutal on your body.)<p>The pro troupes themselves are funded by fairly costly tickets and massive fundraising efforts. They have large staffs full time devoted to raising money, both regular donors and large gifts from wealthy individuals and corporations. (And COVID is positively killing them, as you can imagine, along with theaters.)<p>I hope your daughter enjoys ballet. It&#x27;s a wonderful craft, producing both joy and strong bodies. If she wants to turn pro... well, I dunno what to hope for, since that&#x27;s a very difficult path, but a very select few do achieve extraordinary things on it. Good luck.')
