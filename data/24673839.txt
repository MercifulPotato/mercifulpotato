Item(by='cxr', descendants=None, kids=[24674099, 24675165], score=None, time=1601750243, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24673148, text='&gt; Donâ€™t grovel, but also acknowledge that the only compensation the reader of the report is likely to get is in the form of these extremely rare moments of gratitude.<p>As I write elsewhere, this is a fundamentally flawed mindset.  A high quality bug report <i>is</i> the reader&#x27;s compensation.  It&#x27;s a goddamned gift.  The presumption that the reporter is a leech and the recipient is the one being leeched is exactly what&#x27;s wrong in the culture.<p>Consider this: You post your project.  I&#x27;m not in the target demographic.  But because I come from the culture epitomized in Shirky&#x27;s <i>Here Comes Everybody</i>, and not the fucked up culture of the GitHub generation, where 999 times out of 10 you only reach out to someone because you&#x27;re trying to get something from them, I decide take the time and give it a look anyway.  Going into this, I already have nothing to gain.  So I do look at it, and I spot a bug.  I file a bug report with steps to reproduce.  This is a contribution to the project, its maintainer, and whoever uses it.  Do something with it, or don&#x27;t.  But no matter how you respond, <i>I will get nothing out of it</i>.  To flip things around in a Costanza-like attempt to grab the upper hand is... anti-social.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that leeches don&#x27;t exist.  But muggers also exist.  And yet, the fact that muggers exist is not a good reason to go around socking people in the mouth when they approach you and start speaking.')
