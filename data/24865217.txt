This is what it looks like in practice in Chicago [0].<p>Indoor Plexiglass partitions provide isolation too but the level of isolation is more limited. Plus the air in a smaller indoor location is recirculated between partitions, whereas outdoors it is ostensibly exchanged at much higher rates.<p>Which makes me wonder, can&#x27;t we build indoor booths?<p>The catch would be one would also need a HVAC that can exchange air outside the booths at high throughputs like aircraft cabins.<p>ACPH = air changes per hour = 60 * Q &#x2F; L where Q = volumetric flow (ft3&#x2F;min), L = ft3.<p>Aircraft cabin ACPH are around 20-30 (and through a HEPA filter) [1], while a restaurant dining area is 8-12 [2] (many assumptions here, like airtightness, etc), and  no HEPA.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.timeout.com&#x2F;chicago&#x2F;news&#x2F;dine-and-drink-in-a-private-greenhouse-at-this-west-loop-restaurant-071420" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.timeout.com&#x2F;chicago&#x2F;news&#x2F;dine-and-drink-in-a-pri...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iata.org&#x2F;contentassets&#x2F;f1163430bba94512a583eb6d6b24aa56&#x2F;cabin-air-quality.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iata.org&#x2F;contentassets&#x2F;f1163430bba94512a583eb6d6...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engineeringtoolbox.com&#x2F;air-change-rate-room-d_867.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engineeringtoolbox.com&#x2F;air-change-rate-room-d_86...</a>')
