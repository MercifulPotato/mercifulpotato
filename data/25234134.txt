Primarily we&#x27;re working with venues to coordinate presentations &#x2F; livestreams across multiple screens (think main pres on one screen, event agenda on another, speaker timer on another, etc.), then broadcasting that out for a remote or hybrid event. It&#x27;s all browser based and runs on websockets - if that sounds interesting feel free to reach out and you can try it out!')
