Same question for Elon Musk.</i><p>Only part of Bill Gates&#x27; wealth is attributable to the value he created. At least some of that wealth was due to establishing and protecting monopolies on desktop operating systems and office suites.<p>Yes, quite a bit of harm was done as a side effect of protecting those monopolies, not to mention from extending them into other markets. The simplest and most direct harm was an extra $50 tacked onto the price of every desktop PC purchased even if you didn&#x27;t want (or already had) a copy of Windows.<p>As for Musk, it&#x27;s early days yet, and his companies are still in &quot;Blue Ocean Strategy&quot; mode. We&#x27;ll have to wait and see what happens once SpaceX and Tesla are defending an entrenched position.')
