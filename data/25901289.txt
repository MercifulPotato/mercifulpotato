What does he mean by &quot;cost&quot;? Because if it&#x27;s financial cost, making a viral TokTok costs nothing, whereas taking an instagram photo with your partner on a hill in Athens at least costs two tickets to Athens. It&#x27;s not technical skill either, most TikTok stars have not studied for years.')
