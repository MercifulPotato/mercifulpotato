I see my friends sharing less and less content on FB these days.<p>How much of this is that we’re getting older? I find that outside thoughtfluencing and reputation building, I’ve simply become tired of sharing. Just kinda don’t  care anymore.<p>Part of it is that there’s less and less novelty. What was new and exciting 5 years ago is mundane and boring now. Done it a million times. What felt like a huge insight, became a normal part of my worldview. Etc<p>To top it off I realized I simply don’t care as much about keeping in touch with people who aren’t actually part of my life.<p>Ultimately my time is limited and I can publish to build leads&#x2F;branding or to drive vanity metrics like a monkey acting out in a cage. One of those is a good use of time.')
