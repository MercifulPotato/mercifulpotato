It can write a spreadsheet from CSV (unformatted) or JSON (formatted) data. It can read a spreadsheet and output in CSV or JSON. If your application requires parsing data from a spreadsheet or generate spreadsheets (for invoices, itemized lists, etc.) in an automated way, please give it a try. \n[https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.gridbox.in&#x2F;]<p>A bit about me: I have been a journalist by training and had to quit after working for 7 years because of a severe health issue around 3 years ago. I have recovered after a long haul treatment and during this period tried to learn a new skill -- programming. Around a year and a half, ago started a small company Palanquin [https:&#x2F;&#x2F;palanqu.in&#x2F;], and started picking up short-term commissioned projects.<p>I have seen many organizations have options for their user base to download tabular information in the form of CSVs or TXTs which doesn&#x27;t allow much formatting options. Out of curiosity I asked a few of my friends and found that although there are libraries for different tech stacks, most of them are not full-blown and are not maintained over a longer period of time. Apache POI is a bright exception but it&#x27;s Java-specific and a big library many hesitate to include as a dependency. I thought there might be a use-case of a technology-agnostic spreadsheet app. It took me nearly a year to build it.<p>Please have a look if you have got some time and let me know what you think. If you feel this may help your application please subscribe. You don&#x27;t need to shell out any credit card info to start. Also, please feel free to send across your suggestions. Would love to go through.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gridbox.in&#x2F;\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.gridbox.in&#x2F;<p>Thanks')
