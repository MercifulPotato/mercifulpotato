Have the site just accept both formats, the old wiki format and the new [not yet decided] format. Then each page will just have to have a format option. Then, slowly, pages can be converted, even if manually - perhaps just auto-converting and then fixing the manual stuff. And I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a number of articles that are just simple links and they can be converted right away.<p>You can put bounties or some kind of incentive for people to take on the conversion, but I think if the new format is better, a number of people will feel strongly enough about it to want to convert each article when it&#x27;s updated. And even if 12 years from now some articles aren&#x27;t converted, so what?')
