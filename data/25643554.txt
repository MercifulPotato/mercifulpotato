What you are worrying about is the capacity factor. The capacity factor is a percentage of the average load on the turbine. Wind turbines generally have around a 50% capacity factor so if you install a 12MW turbine it will generate 6MW per hour averaged over the entire year. The capacity factor entirely depends on location so you cannot make a general statement about the capacity factor just based on looking at the turbine itself.<p>&gt; they don&#x27;t say how these homes are powered when the wind is down<p>You can run gas plants, which you have to do anyway because they produce less CO2 than coal plants. The nice property of gas power plants is that the fuel is quite expensive, meaning you only run them when you have to. So naturally they will yield to renewables if there is wind available.<p>&gt;It gives the impression that electricity works like fuel : you just extract it, then use it when you want.<p>If you run wind power to avoid CO2 emissions then that&#x27;s exactly the way it works. It doesn&#x27;t matter when you stop burning gas. What really matters is that you are burning less gas.<p>CO2 levels in the atmosphere were 280ppm before the industrial revolution. It took much less than 200 years to add another 45% CO2 on top of that. We are at 409.8ppm now. This means 120ppm or around 30% of the CO2 in the atmosphere is man made and that percentage is going to increase in the future. You have to consider that not all of the CO2 ends up in the atmosphere. A lot of it is also absorbed by the ocean. It took a lot of human effort to get this far and now we have to stop it from getting worse.')
