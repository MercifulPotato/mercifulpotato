IBM did work for the Nazis. Popular Japanese car companies made fighter planes used at Pearl Harbor. American auto companies sympathized with Nazis. Household brands that make the food we eat or the medicines we take have produced poisons that have killed many, produced drugs that have ravaged communities, and much more.

If you&#x27;ve ever had food at a stadium or a cup of coffee at an office then you&#x27;ve probably consumed a product made by Aramark which is known to engage in modern day slavery in U.S. prisons.
