Item(by='danShumway', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612193726, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25989351, text='- better client displays (allowing a user client to switch out fonts based on the language, for example)<p>- better support for users who are not multi-lingual (a client could try to auto-translate sections that are not in the user&#x27;s native language)<p>- better search capabilities (find me all documents that contain a French passage)<p>- better voice-assistant support (if a document is being read out loud for any reason, it would be nice to be able to handle multiple languages well. This also combines with the auto-translate capabilities above.)<p>Basically, all of the reasons why Gemini includes a &quot;lang&quot; attribute in the first place, except recognizing that parsers and clients want to be able to make use of that on a section-by-section basis rather than purely at the document level.<p>Sometimes documents are big and expand across multiple languages. It&#x27;s just a bad abstraction in general to assume that each document would only have one language type[0]. Documents&#x2F;books in the real world don&#x27;t work that way, and a document format that can&#x27;t accurately represent a giant portion of classic literature isn&#x27;t a very good general-purpose format.<p>[0]: yes, technically Gemini allows you to specify multiple top-level languages, but that&#x27;s not useful for anything. If I&#x27;m parsing a document, I don&#x27;t want it to tell me &quot;hey, there&#x27;s some French in here somewhere, good luck!&quot; Tell me where it is.')
