Heads of state who have suggested alternatives found themselves confronted with a sweeping range of responses, starting with bribes, then coercion, sanctions, and if those fail, hiding in a hole from US forces.<p>There&#x27;s nothing magic, nor mysterious about it.  We&#x27;re the only ones (right now) with the system in place to hold the rest of the world hostage.  When those in charge press their luck too far, or if by accident they let an idiot run the place for 4 years, that grip on things could loosen, and eventually our position could collapse.<p>When that happens, we&#x27;ll be forced to use money from someone else&#x27;s &quot;magic money tree&quot;. Having to export hard currency instead of magic money, would cause prices on all things imported to double or worse in a few years or less.<p>The only real question is how many % of the value of the dollar when spent as an export is real, and how much is the &quot;global reserve currency&quot; status.  I suspect it used to be %20 real, and lately it&#x27;s more like 50% as our leaders fumble the ball too much for the rest of the world&#x27;s liking.')
