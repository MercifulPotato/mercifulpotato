Item(by='julianmarq', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608421777, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25481540, text='&gt; I would say the author provided all the evidence for you to draw such a conclusion, <i>but never insinuated as such</i><p>I respectfully and strongly disagree.<p>The conclusions about Martin as a person I gather from the historical evidence in the article are &quot;Martin clearly knows little about history and obviously wanted to engage a little bit in the &#x27;Fremen mirage&#x27; [as the author, Devereaux, himself would put it], but he&#x27;s also a blowhard overstating his own knowledge and authority.&quot;<p>That Martin is &quot;irresponsible&quot;, and his story &quot;harmful&quot;, etcetera. That&#x27;s all entirely what the author puts forward on the last few paragraphs... And something he <i>didn&#x27;t</i> do in the first article in the series, and in the few other essays by him I&#x27;ve read. He keeps it fairly neutral, and focused on the history.<p>You see, the charitable interpretation in this case would be &quot;don&#x27;t attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence&quot;. In most of Devereaux&#x27;s essays that have become popular here, he sticks to that one with reasonable consistency, but he clearly made an exception this time.')
