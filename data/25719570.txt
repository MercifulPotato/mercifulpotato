Just because Microsoft open sourced VS Code doesn&#x27;t mean they have to open source anything that touches it. Microsoft are allowed to have closed source language servers and extensions!<p>And their reasoning seems pretty straight forward:<p>* Microsoft sells developer tools (as well as giving away loads for free!).<p>* Microsoft has invested money into giving their products (both the free and commercial products) great python support.<p>* The level of Python support Pylance gives is a competitive advantage of the Microsoft product suite.<p>* Open sourcing means giving their competitors this functionality, and the competitive advantage will no longer exist.<p>Microsoft is running a business, not a charity. They don&#x27;t have to open source everything so their (often closed source!) competitors can use it.')
