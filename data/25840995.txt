While I was waiting for my car, there were <i>two</i> Priuses that came in with stolen&#x2F;hacked off catalytic converters. A Prius with a really loud &quot;straight pipe&quot; exhaust is awful weird. In any case, auto theft isn&#x27;t about stealing the whole car, sometimes it&#x27;s just hacking off the valuable bits without even breaking in. It&#x27;s not a new problem. Before catalytic converters, it was taking hood ornaments or wheels. Car alarms, at least the ones that alarm when the car is jolted or moved, are just about the only thing I can think of that can help deter this type of theft.')
