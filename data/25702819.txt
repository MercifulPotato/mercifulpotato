Item(by='fasouto', descendants=None, kids=[25708803], score=None, time=1610215902, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25700135, text='<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wheelcarnival.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wheelcarnival.com&#x2F;</a> has been on my TODO list for almost a year.<p>I created it to learn Vue, initially I used Gridsome but then I decide to use Nuxt. I also moved it from Netlify to Firebase to add storing+auth, so people can create custom wheels.<p>It&#x27;s getting a decent amount of visits so it will be wise to finish it, but it&#x27;s not fun anymore and my day job takes a lot of energy.')
