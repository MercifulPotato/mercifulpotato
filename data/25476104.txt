I see people going on a murder rampage in cyberpunk and then complain that the police chase that spawns isn&#x27;t sufficiently realistic. Like......I don&#x27;t feel like that&#x27;s how this game should be played, just like it wasn&#x27;t how Witcher was meant to be played. It&#x27;s an RPG where the cyberpunk city is a background to an amazing story, it&#x27;s not an open sandbox like GTA is.<p>And no replayability? The depth of character development is huge, that alone is worth another playthrough, would love to build a character that&#x27;s built differently than my current one. And most missions support a huge variety of outcomes depending on decisions you made earlier and how you behave. If that&#x27;s not replayability....then what it?')
