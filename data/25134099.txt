That is important enough for you to prefer windows for this reason. Fair enough.<p>Something to think about:\nWhat do you think causes this situation that on day one windows has a stable driver and Linux doesn&#x27;t? Could it have anything to do with the cooperation of the hardware vendor?<p>Assuming you actually wanted to run linux, would there be any way you as an end user could work around this problem? Is there anything people could do to improve the overall situation? Maybe something more helpful than puplicly complaining about experimental drivers being experimental?<p>It&#x27;s ok if you don&#x27;t care about this. But characterizing the story above as &quot;linux has driver problems&quot; strikes me as something between superficial and disengenious.<p>But yeah, you can&#x27;t always blindly throw the newest Linux at the newest hardware and expect it to work.
