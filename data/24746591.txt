No mocking anywhere.<p>Tests take an hour to run, are extremely fragile and flakey. Getting your local dev machine set up to run even a subset of the tests is a half day ordeal, and it can change periodically.<p>If you have external dependencies that don&#x27;t version their APIs well it may be inevitable that you need to run tests against them. But for developer productivity you should have a fast&#x2F;non-flakey path to run local unit tests with no network dependencies. It&#x27;s also great for working on a plane.')
