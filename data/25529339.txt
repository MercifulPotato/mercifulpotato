Which is fair enough.<p>If you want to scale up to really start making money, of course you&#x27;ll need to have your refining and construction capabilities in space too.<p>This is obviously a big bootstrap problem!<p>I do think that Falcon heavy and&#x2F;or Starship are starting to make a small initial bootstrap viable, for someone willing to take the risk.')
