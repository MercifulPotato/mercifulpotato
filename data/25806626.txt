On performance and write endurance, flash-based SSD are &quot;good enough&quot;, while also much better on cost-per-GB vs Optane. This reduces available market for Optane to gaming enthusiasts and similar customers - a very small slice of the total PC market.<p>Now, for enterprise markets, best-in-class performance is always in demand, and the product can be (over)priced much higher than on the PC market.<p>Therefore, it makes total sense to make this move.')
