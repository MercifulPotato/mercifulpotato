Item(by='watwut', descendants=None, kids=[25766142], score=None, time=1610560735, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25764478, text='&gt; &quot;flipped classroom model&quot; by having kids watch (or read!) lectures on material on their own<p>Pretty much all classes before college I had were mixture of in-class exercises and teacher explaining things. It is not like teachers in high school would talk for an hour straight and then sent us home with homework. Plus, people asked questions or teacher prompted people to answer teachers questions. That does not really works the same way with video. In college, there were lectures and labs. In lectures they talked, in labs you solved exercises. Plus, there were office hours where you could ask.<p>So the whole flipped classroom model sounds like downgrade to me. Or more like someone again needed buzzword.<p>Anyway, afaik, my best guess is that majority of my peers would half-ass the videos watching at home. Even assigned readings had pretty bad compliance and people skimmed them at best. Unless the flipped classroom starts with graded test, there is no proof that you have done it, no consequences if you did not and then it is too tempting to skip that.')
