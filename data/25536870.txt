Rust encourages version pinning.<p>Rust makes version pinning <i>feasible</i>, e.g. by allowing multiple versions of the same package in a build (not all module systems have this feature!) but doesn&#x27;t encourage it.  You&#x27;ve identified a problem with using 0.x.y-versioned packages as dependencies (which means de-facto opting out of semver), but that&#x27;s not a problem with Rust specifically; it could occur in any language.')
