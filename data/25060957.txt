It <i>can</i> be read as me dismissing people that use Macs as &quot;not real developers&quot;, where my intent was to counteract the opposite: people dismissing others that might be using Windows as &quot;not real developers&quot; because otherwise they would be using Macs, which is circular logic that I have heard expressed in the past. And I say that as someone who has used Macs at work for the past decade.')
