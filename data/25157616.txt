Item(by='jholman', descendants=None, kids=[25157793], score=None, time=1605850796, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25157435, text='I mean, I&#x27;m not necessarily taking a side on GP&#x27;s claim, but don&#x27;t be disingenuous.<p>Should firearms for kids be illegal?  Should driving for kids be illegal?  Should gambling for kids be illegal?  Should starring in porn for kids be illegal?  Should data-mining the behaviour of children be illegal?  Should paying children to work in mines be illegal?<p>Obviously the principle would be something along the lines of &quot;games with microtransactions are potentially hazardous to the buyer in a way, or to a degree, such that while we should allow adults to make their own choices, we should protect children from the consequences of being partially-formed minds, and so we should avoid targeting children with that business model&quot;.  Same as gambling, or selling your PII to get free services, or starring in porn.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a slam-dunk argument, I&#x27;m saying the structure of the argument is obvious and straightforward.  And I expect every adult to be at least partially sympathetic to it, even the ones who end the paragraph with &quot;but, on the balance, freedom is more important, so it should not be illegal&quot;.<p>Well.  I admit.  I mostly agree with GP&#x27;s claim.  But not with high confidence.')
