Vapor server takes care of the authorization&#x2F;authentication, and it routes the requests to an internal auth-less API endpoint not exposed to the outside world.<p>Basically you can build a CRUD app without authentication at all (only accessible by your own API clients). And then allow only Vapor to write to the API internally.<p>This would be the most basic approach. I think it will become more clear once I release the implementation, just wanted to get the protocol out there first.')
