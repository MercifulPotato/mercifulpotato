Whether they admit it or not.<p>How many defense contractors are there? These people do have a vested interest to vote for candidates that increase govt contracts with the private sector. This is a massive industry.<p>Now that govt is getting more involved in health care, we&#x27;re seeing that too.<p>These are trillions of dollars we&#x27;re talking about.<p>This is also valid for small businesses too. How taxes are done in a given community. Etc.<p>I can&#x27;t emphasize enough the vested interest a business has to  be selfish. I&#x27;m indifferent on if this is a drawback.<p>I just wish there was more competition&#x2F;choices for everyone and like you, I wish people would be more upfront (or self aware) of what they&#x27;re doing.<p>P.S. When it comes to Coinbase. What stops them from backing a racist KKK member whom backs Bitcoin&#x2F;crypto? What stops them from backing an anarchist whom backs Bitcoin&#x2F;crypto? Etc...etc...
