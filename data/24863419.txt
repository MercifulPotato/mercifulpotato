William Whewell, English polymath, by analogy with artist, in the same paragraph in which he coined physicist&quot;<p>Edit: I&#x27;m going to pretend you&#x27;re being sincere dang ( even though you rate limited me ).<p>No. Scientist was not coined for somerville.<p>First 3 minutes, professor laura snyder explains where the word scientist came from.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=jc_-Y9rDN2g" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=jc_-Y9rDN2g</a><p>Second, your comment about &quot;attribution&quot; was rather misleading ( intentional or not ).<p>Thirdly, the only sources so far of whewell using the word scientist in a review of her book : &quot;An English man of science who called himself a philosopher now did so rather self-consciously...&quot;<p>He&#x27;s complaining about &quot;english man&quot; of science having to be careful about how he refers to himself because philosophers don&#x27;t like people like him claiming to be philosophers. Last I checked, somerville wasn&#x27;t an &quot;english man&quot;. But regardless, the review of her book comes after he coined the term scientist.<p>Edit2: Nobody is questioning the attribution of scientist to whewell dang. Most everyone agrees. The question is whether whewell coined the term after somerville. I&#x27;ve provided sources that he didn&#x27;t. And nowhere in your pg 59 is there a mention of somerville.<p>I&#x27;m trying to give you the benefit of the doubt here but your comment seems very misleading for some reason.')
