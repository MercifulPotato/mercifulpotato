As a society in the US, for example, we&#x27;re burdened with 3 giant telcos controlling the most productive public airwaves. Plenty has been written about the negative affects of these types of arrangements with respect to 19th century railroads.<p>Auctions happen at a point in time and leave alot of value on the table. Spectrum purchased in 1999 is worth much more today. If the government retained title to spectrum and allowed for smaller chunks, smaller players could participate and compete in the market -- look at how dial up ISPs in the 90s drove prices for internet from $40&#x2F;mo in the early 90s to &lt;$10 in 1999 or so.<p>The mobile market is very different -- we pay more for a commodity that gets cheaper to deliver over time; AT&amp;T wireless margins are &gt;50% for a commodity service as a result of the limited competition.')
