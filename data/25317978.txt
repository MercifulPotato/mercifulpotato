We&#x27;ll resort to TLS inspection and force you to trust our CA on your device if you want to continue accessing our corporate network. And now we get to see (almost) everything again, like in the &quot;good old days,&quot; not just your DNS queries.<p>Clear text DNS is the ultimate compromise, a gentleman&#x27;s agreement if you want, that benefits everyone. We can see <i>just enough</i> to filter what we are required to by law on a best-effort basis, but we never see what you are <i>actually</i> doing thanks to the prevalence of TLS. DoH just broke that agreement.<p>It&#x27;s a sad example of how a privacy solution like DoH will eventually result in less privacy, at least in some environments. And I&#x27;m not even considering how DoH will be the excuse for totalitarian regimes to up their surveillance antics.')
