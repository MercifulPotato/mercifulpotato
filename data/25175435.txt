But under oxidative stress conditions, excessive ROS can damage cellular proteins, lipids and DNA, leading to fatal lesions in the cell that contribute to carcinogenesis.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reactive_oxygen_species#Damaging_effects" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Reactive_oxygen_species#Damagi...</a><p><i>&quot;The effectâ€™s duration is yet to be determined in the long-term, Efrati said.&quot;</i><p>I would keep an eye on the potential emergence of new cancers in these folks.')
