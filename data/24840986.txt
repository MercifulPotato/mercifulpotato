At first DDG&#x27;s results seemed bad to me, but after a while I think I&#x27;ve changed how I write my searches. It&#x27;s hard to explain, but I guess I&#x27;m putting more thought into understanding what it is that I hope to find.<p>Now, Google&#x27;s results seem to just be a listing of whoever did the best SEO targeting on the subject, and ultimately that means worse results for me. It&#x27;s less about what I&#x27;m looking for and more about what Google has to show me... and Google always has something relevant to show me. When DDG doesn&#x27;t, I&#x27;m forced to re-consider my query and try again, ultimately reaching a better destination.<p>However, &quot;change the way you search&quot; is niche at best. Google is satisfying because it&#x27;s so easy to use, that you almost don&#x27;t even have to write a query. It&#x27;s like an automatic &quot;I&#x27;m feeling lucky&quot; based on it&#x27;s knowledge of you and your location and time of day, etc...')
