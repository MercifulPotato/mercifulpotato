I don&#x27;t care about carbon fuel, in the sense I have no particular attachment to it.<p>In every case where I&#x27;ve replaced carbon with something else, it&#x27;s turned out to be preferable. Cleaner, quieter, lighter, longer lasting.<p>To me, there are lots of other reasons for cutting carbon than the environment. The environment is just a big plus. If we cut all carbon fuel and ended up with longer lasting, more efficient products, but global warming increased, why would I think cutting carbon had been a waste?<p>Personally, I&#x27;d like to see some state where there was a hypercompetitive market of many different energy sources, rather than being dominated by carbon. I&#x27;m not sure what that would eventually look like — maybe carbon would be a part, maybe not — but it would be better.')
