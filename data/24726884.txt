I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because the field is growing up, so it attracts fewer disrupt-the-world types, shifting generational values, shifting cultural values, more influence from SF and the tech scene moved north, the pendulum swinging back as people see the consequences of tech, or something else.<p>That said, as long as it&#x27;s a competitive job market in tech, I agree that seeing a union isn&#x27;t likely because there isn&#x27;t a clear benefit.')
