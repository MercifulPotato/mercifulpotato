The only problem with the platforms is that they still somewhat cling to the idea that they wonâ€™t censor speech, which is frankly ridiculous. Of course they will censor, they should just admit it and clamp down any speech they find abhorrent. Allow the marketplace (and marketplace of ideas) to work.')
