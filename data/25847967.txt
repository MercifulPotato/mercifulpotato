The monitor was 1080p, and I had trouble with desktop UIs that assumed a minimum width of 1280 (so I&#x27;d occasionally get things like the OK button truncated).  Also a lot of websites (including HN) kick into mobile mode when they notice a tall aspect ratio, which was also annoying.<p>[1] I got a 16:9 monitor at work (I&#x27;d ordered a 16:10, but IT did a substitution in their rube-goldberg purchasing process.<p>&gt; All 16:9 is good for is videos, and I have a second screen for whenever I watch those.<p>Couldn&#x27;t agree more.')
