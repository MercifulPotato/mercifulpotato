Item(by='throwaway92938', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607626777, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25376497, text='&gt; I suppose the argument would be that only developers with a modicum of interest in their craft will gravitate towards niche languages such as Clojure.<p>There is an opportunity cost and there are plenty of motivated developers that instead of learning yet another niche language decide to work on algorithms, applications and generally more difficult problems. Few languages offer enough advantages to overcome the fact that the latter is almost always a far better use of your time. As someone that knows Clojure relatively well, I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s certainly not one of those few languages. Also, the trade off continuously gets worse as the popular languages adopt the good ideas from the niche languages and as problems continue to get more difficult and rely on teams of developers with library support in a wide variety of domains.')
