If it could start instantly I&#x27;d walk into the conference room on-time, but instead I&#x27;m several minutes late. Now that I&#x27;m working from home it needs to get the chat client started instead, but the the end result is the same, if I&#x27;m not running early I&#x27;ll be late to important early morning meetings. (my early morning meetings are with India, so they will quickly assume I&#x27;m not joining at all and head to their supper - timezones are such that the best time for everyone is my breakfast and their supper)<p>Outlook also has been chasing the flat look fad which is against usability.  Most of the others are too so it is hard to fault them, but I still wish they would have the guts to say this fad is wrong...<p>Once they are all running and you are used to the ui quirks they all work well enough.')
