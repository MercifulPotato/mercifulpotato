I&#x27;m just pointing out that, to someone outside of the US, it&#x27;s pretty obvious this is the second election in a row that has been declared rigged and needing to be challenged by a large number of the losing side.<p>Edit: Just to clarify, as this is a sensitive topic. Neither claim has merit. Trump won 2016 and there&#x27;s no evidence Russia swung it for him. Biden won definitively in 2020 and, whatever Trump activists are saying, the president of the US should not be pushing this narrative. Anyone going beyond conspiracy&#x2F;sore loser level &quot;election was rigged&quot; talk in to &quot;we should overthrow the government&#x2F;hang politicians&quot; should definitely be removed from social media â€“ and it&#x27;s a failure of social media that they have seemingly turned a blind eye to this subject for years now.')
