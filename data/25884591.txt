I&#x27;ve been doing the same job for 9 years, every day is different so it keeps me interested. Minimal off hours support, 40 hours a week is sometimes too much time. I made $120,000 this year to top it off. It&#x27;s been a dream job for me, never thought I&#x27;d be here ever and I&#x27;m only 33... However I do stress often that I may be missing out on more money or that I may be falling behind on technology. I wish I could look far ahead to ensure I have what I need to keep job security.')
