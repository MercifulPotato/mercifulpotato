Early Christian art was intentionally unrealistic in style specifically because the intent was often symbolism and representation rather than realism (this still holds true today for most Orthodox Christian art[0]). In fact, making it realistic would even border on idolatry (see Iconoclastic Controversy[1]).<p>That said, up until the European middle ages, nearly all art was that which was commissioned by the church. The style of the time permeated the art that wasn&#x27;t commissioned by the church. As more non-religious art was commissioned, there was little need to remain working in that style and realism was embraced. I could be wrong, and probably am, but I think Catholicism is the only large Christian denomination that adopted realistic art.<p>I think depth was already understood by this point, though (see sculptures[2]). Again, I&#x27;m not OP, and I&#x27;m sure OP will have a more thorough explanation.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;orthodoxartsjournal.org&#x2F;topics&#x2F;iconography&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;orthodoxartsjournal.org&#x2F;topics&#x2F;iconography&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britannica.com&#x2F;event&#x2F;Iconoclastic-Controversy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.britannica.com&#x2F;event&#x2F;Iconoclastic-Controversy</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Victorious_Youth" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Victorious_Youth</a>')
