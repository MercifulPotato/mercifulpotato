And then you Accenture, McKinsey, Oracle and everyone else advocating for this kind of design. All the different departments poking holes everywhere because they actually can&#x27;t work. They can&#x27;t access compute, they can&#x27;t access storage. It takes 3 months to upload basic data somewhere.<p>The whole thing is a cluster fuck. I keep getting hired as a person to help retain talent, but enterprises like to put all their cards on Solarwinds. When they can blame Solarwinds, their managers are still safe. There is no compartmentalization of access.  You don&#x27;t need to have all departments globally be in the same LAN to begin with.')
