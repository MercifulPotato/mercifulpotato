Then I got to this line:<p><pre><code>  &quot;I started a new job working on a large typescript React project. Vim couldnâ€™t handle opening a TSX file larger than 50 lines without crashing.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nAnd I was like LOL WUT?  The author&#x27;s case in this regard woudl be stronger if they helped us understand what was actually going wrong.  Bad plugins?  Conflicting macros?  I&#x27;m pretty sure that simply opening a 50 line TSX file does not normally crash vim.')
