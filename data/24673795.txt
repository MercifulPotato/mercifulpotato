It&#x27;s <i>my</i> behavior.  These four walls are sacrosanct.<p>Imagine you are working from home or your kids are schooling from home, and you use the TV for meetings.  Are they recording your presentation?  Are pictures of your kids&#x27; classmates being fingerprinted and archived somewhere for correlation with all the other classmates?<p>There are levels of outrageousness here:<p>- Spying on TV through a purpose-built device: mildly annoying that every show and ad now has a tracking watermark that can be used surreptitiously, but voluntary Nielsen participation is just fine.<p>- Spying on an app you own: YouTube collecting aggregated watch times for videos is useful to creators to avoid reaching people who don&#x27;t want to watch them.  Netflix collecting in-house analytics is only mildly annoying because I don&#x27;t know how individualized the data is, but aggregate stats are fine. Behavioral analysis of individuals is still creepy.<p>-Spying on all apps running on your software: Roku or a smart TV reporting what you watch in all apps is starting to approach unacceptable.  Presumably appmakers know about this when they are making the apps, but a third party doesn&#x27;t have the same checks and balances to make sure they aren&#x27;t alienating users with creepy behavior.  There is not a functioning market here because appmakers don&#x27;t get a choice of how to reach users, because platform rentiers are claiming all of the users.<p>- Spying on arbitrary video files you watch through DLNA: not okay.  My work-in-progress video productions and self-ripped discs are simply none of the TV makers&#x27; business.<p>-Spying on HDMI inputs: <i>serious WTF</i>.  Like I can&#x27;t even...  WTF???  Who do they think they are?')
