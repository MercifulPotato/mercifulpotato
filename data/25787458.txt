Thanks for sharing.<p>Now, since it&#x27;s on topic, and not listed in the &quot;list of lists&quot; on the site, I&#x27;d like to share my surprising source for book recommendations...<p>I don&#x27;t think that the actual discussion forums are worth spending brainpower or attention on, but I&#x27;ve actually gotten a lot of mileage out of the wikis that the 4chan communities of &#x2F;lit&#x2F; and &#x2F;sci&#x2F; curate. The former (&#x2F;lit&#x2F;, [1]) does a yearly vote to generate a top 100, but caveat lector: 2020&#x27;s vote was raided by another board. You can see the past yearly top 100s on one page of the wiki ([2]), and I&#x27;ve not yet had a bad experience picking a book from previous lists (2020&#x27;s still has worth if you ignore obvious troll entries). Sadly, the lists are usually in the form of an image and not raw text, so it&#x27;s not very accessibility-friendly. Also to note: if you want to pick a book from a specific region or genre or want to know what order to approach a new author, there are plenty of other pages on the site beyond the top 100, which have also been great resources<p>Lastly, &#x2F;sci&#x2F;&#x27;s wiki ([3]) is primarily for reference texts, which is HN&#x27;s speed. The math books and the Haskell books are a solid list from what I&#x27;ve worked through or skimmed so far (the math suggestions are more numerous than the acclaimed &quot;Chicago undergraduate mathematics bibliography&quot;), but can&#x27;t vouch for any other subject.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;4chanlit.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;&#x2F;lit&#x2F;_Wiki" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;4chanlit.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;&#x2F;lit&#x2F;_Wiki</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;4chanlit.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;&#x2F;lit&#x2F;_Top_100_Lists" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;4chanlit.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;&#x2F;lit&#x2F;_Top_100_Lists</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;4chan-science.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;&#x2F;sci&#x2F;_Wiki" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;4chan-science.fandom.com&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;&#x2F;sci&#x2F;_Wiki</a>')
