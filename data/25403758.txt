Not many textile workers were getting their limbs torn off before being made to work in factories designed, owned and operated by people who had little to no regard for worker safety.  All of the safety regulations we have today were written in blood; <i>their blood</i>.  And not infrequently, the workers being maimed were children.  It&#x27;s easy to sneer at the Luddites today, couldn&#x27;t they see that their lives would be improved by cheaper clothing?  But people who sneer at Luddites should try putting themselves in the shoes of a worker who&#x27;s seen children killed in that textile factory.  Whose children have to work in that factory because the pay is so shit.')
