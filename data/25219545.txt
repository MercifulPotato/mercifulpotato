Mean NHS costs ranged from £2588 to £2989 across injury mechanisms for children admitted for ≥ 2 days, from £719 to £1011 for those admitted for 0–1 days and from £97 to £178 for those attending an ED but not admitted.<p>All this boy&#x27;s treatments were on the same day, and he only fell off his bike -- these British figures include accidents like scalding -- so in the UK, he would have been at the lower end, i.e. under £1000.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;books&#x2F;NBK447063&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;books&#x2F;NBK447063&#x2F;</a>')
