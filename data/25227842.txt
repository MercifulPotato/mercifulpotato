It&#x27;s about dying of thirst in the desert and turning down somebody offering you water because you insist on getting Gatorade instead.<p>At that point it&#x27;s not about &quot;deserving&quot; anymore but it&#x27;s very much entitlement. It also means whoever is dying of thirst there either doesn&#x27;t have their priorities right or they ain&#x27;t actually dying of thirst if they can still be so picky to demand Gatorade over water.<p>Or to apply it to your example of food being handed out at temples: Imagine if somebody turned down all that food on offer, while insisting that they get exactly the dish they want like in an à la carte restaurant.<p>Don&#x27;t you think that would come across as tone-deaf and entitled?')
