Could you please review them? <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>. HN titles should be accurate and neutral. If it&#x27;s necessary to rewrite a title to make it so, that&#x27;s fine (the guideline explicitly allows for that). But you should definitely not rewrite a title to put spin on it.<p>It&#x27;s particularly bad to use quotation marks to make it look like you&#x27;re quoting something when you aren&#x27;t.')
