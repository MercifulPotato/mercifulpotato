The paper seems to conclude that BMI is the big part.<p>&gt; Elevated BMI was associated with reduced total testosterone levels (P &lt; .0001), with the mean BMI increasing from 25.83 in 1999-2000, to 27.96 in 2015-2016 (P = 0.0006).<p>They do say:\n&gt; Lokeshwar noted that even men with a normal BMI (18.5-24.9) had declining total testosterone levels (P &lt; .05) during the same time frames.<p>However the range of 18.5-24.9 is wider than the mean increase that they think is the most noteworthy independent variable. It&#x27;s fully possible that within the BMI band of 18.5-24.9, average BMI nonetheless increased and is the primary driver. Note that the effect size over time is muuuuch more significant when not controlling for binned BMI.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean whatever environmental shit you&#x27;re not fond of is safe of course. Heck, in some roundabout way it may even be contributing to obesity, possibly even through other hormonal changes. Wouldn&#x27;t be my first guess though.')
