Lots of these points matched up with my experience a lot, but the following hit me hard<p>&quot;You have emotional difficulty with personal intimacy but demonstrate significant professional success.&quot;<p>As a personal anecdote, I have been finding much more fulfillment ignoring any plans I have of a perfect project and just focus on the &quot;first actionable step&quot; I can take in front of me<p>Want to work on a side project? Just open my notebook first. Have the book open? See what I have to do on a list, and tackle the one I can do right away. Challenge myself to not think ahead<p>Want to get more physically fit? Rather than focusing on the long term goal, focus on what I do TODAY. Don&#x27;t focus on how I missed a workout or ate a huge burger yesterday. Focus on what I can do today to keep up with that goal<p>Want to build more social peers? I have to meet people to do that. Find something where I can do where I will meet new clusters of people. Worry about the details later<p>The quote from Theodore Roosevelt really kickstarted me to think this way. &quot;Keep your eyes on the stars but your feet on the ground&quot;')
