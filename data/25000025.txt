So CLIs that don&#x27;t conform to standard patterns, or whose subcommands&#x2F;options don&#x27;t make intuitive sense would be &quot;non-discoverable&quot;.<p>But also, well-written manuals and usage&#x2F;help screens are becoming increasingly rare these days. Technical writing is time consuming and people choose not to do it.')
