At least, that&#x27;s how the rhetoric is shaped.<p>And yet, despite startups&#x27; attempts to introduce concepts such as transparency, &quot;radical candor&quot;, &quot;employee wellness&quot;, even radical experiments like holacracy, etc., at the end of the day the core of these businesses are the same old corporate structures.<p>And amidst the high-paced, high-stakes froth of move fast and fueled by the promise of dumb money, many firms end up having mgmt. that shall we say, are more susceptible to mistakes, and persist in them despite discontent from the rank and file. And despite performative attempts to promote open discourse and welcome questions, they often don&#x27;t listen to that discontent. So those truly unhappy just jump ship. Which is fine to some extent, but it just feels like it&#x27;s contributing to an unsustainable throwaway culture.<p>&gt; After that, you&#x27;ve exhausted your options at that company and aren&#x27;t owed anything further.<p>&gt; I may be more cavalier with my &quot;if you don&#x27;t like it, then leave&quot; attitude.<p>But what about the end user? The customers who will be failed if the company does? And what about the product itself? If someone who works on it feels like company leadership isn&#x27;t making the right choices, and if their concerns are echoed by a good amount of the workforce, shouldn&#x27;t they at least be given the chance to appeal to the board?<p>It just feels highly hypocritical that an industry that sees itself as so forward-looking and enlightened, so flexible and boundaries breaking, just ends up conforming to the same corporate fiat structure at the end. It really belies the messaging of being able to &quot;make a difference.&quot;')
