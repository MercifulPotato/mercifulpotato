Black hole evaporation breaks unitary evolution, at least in the semi-classical approximation of Hawking. If you prepare a pure quantum state it will come out as mangled thermal radiation. You cannot return to the pure quantum state from the thermal radiation (i.e. we have lost information about it).<p>This transition is impossible in Quantum Mechanics and it would suppose a killing blow to Quantum Mechanics if true. So a better way to rephrase our worries is that if Black Holes do not respect unitary evolution then our most precise physical theory is fundamentally wrong.')
