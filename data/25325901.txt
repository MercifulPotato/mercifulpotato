It started with the premise that the world’s supply of crude was finite. Eventually no matter how hard drillers tried, they wouldn’t be able to pull more oil out of the ground<p>This is false. The hypothesis was not that there was a hard limit on rate of extraction, but that the economics of extraction would result int a production peak due to what was economically profitably extractable. Demand was always a part of the consideration, though the original papers and predictions didn&#x27;t so much consider decreasing demand due to new alternatives.')
