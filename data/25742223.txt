It&#x27;s like putting a child in timeout: it gives the child a moment to cool off before resuming normal activity. Clearly people&#x27;s passions are inflamed at the moment and they were feeding off each other&#x27;s anger. Some time off may allow cooler heads to prevail, even if it&#x27;s just the time it takes parler to set up an alternative infrastructure.<p>Of course, I may be completely wrong about this, but it&#x27;s not clear to me that this is a worse option than doing nothing.')
