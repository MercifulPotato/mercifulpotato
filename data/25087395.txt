Furthermore, once you have the schema you can generate client APIs in e.g Typescript for your APIs instead of wasting engineering effort on writing them manually.<p>In terms of static types generally, outside of APIs, the equation can be different. However, if you are creating a library that many developers will use, given the state of IDEs, your just hurting your users (developers) by not providing static types. I use Typescript in every single project not because of supposed benefit of &quot;type grantees&quot;, but because I don&#x27;t need to spend all day flipping between some developers poorly written, incomplete docs to understand how to use an API. My code editor will tell me the whole format and I can explore the APIs with goto definition, demonstrably reducing development time.')
