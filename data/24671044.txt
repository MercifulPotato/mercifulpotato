I know because they also have a big automated ban problem. In trying to fight their bot issue, they&#x27;ve started auto-banning accounts that trigger their filter in some way or another. I&#x27;ve been banned 4 times without cause. Each time you have to contact support, who seemingly are either unable or not allowed to answer with anything other than canned responses. Three times the support person realized the ban was erroneous and lifted it without further ado. One time the person affirmed it, all while refusing to break from the canned responses or provide any justification. Most frustrating experience I&#x27;ve ever had with a digital service.')
