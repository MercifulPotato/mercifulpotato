(Which in itself would be useful to know)<p>Otherwise I would expect them to be (i) interested in ensuring the underlying tech was maintainable in future, which if nothing else might result in more reasonable earnout possibilities for you and (ii) concerned that one of the founders apparently wishes to cut others out of the business to turn it into his personal cash cow, particularly if the other founder is the one with monetisation ideas.<p>It&#x27;s not guaranteed that the investor is your friend (another possibility is that replacing you and taking the business in a different direction is something they quietly encouraged) but I wouldn&#x27;t expect them to be &#x27;neutral&#x27; on whether the business has a chance of generating them a return or not.')
