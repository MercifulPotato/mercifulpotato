The EU supply&#x2F;demand situation is also different from the US, so your FAANG mileage may vary.<p>Here are a few (at a level of detail that I&#x27;m comfortable sharing):<p>- Outstanding (in either direction) performance in certain subjects in school is a very strong predictor.<p>- Cover letters are mostly noise, but incoherent, overbearing or careless ones don&#x27;t go very far. Lack of curiosity and interest is also a negative predictor (but these are of course easily feigned).<p>- Relevant extracurricular engagement and&#x2F;or industrial experience begets more well-rounded engineers.<p>Let me be clear though that we consider applications on more than these factors. These are just predictors, and sometimes they are wrong. I have interviewed actuaries that couldn&#x27;t calculate dice roll probabilities, C++ programmers that were confused by the class keyword and C# programmers that hadn&#x27;t heard of virtual.')
