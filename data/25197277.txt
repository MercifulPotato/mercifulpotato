Since the government, despite what people seem to think these days, still represents something between 30% (only government directly) and 60% (government + contractors + fully dependent on government + ...) of the economy in the US, it can easily explain a 3% trade deficit.<p>But again, the <i>actual</i> spending is NOT the problem. Nor is the trade deficit. Using sovereignty (ie. government spending inflation) to take away normal people&#x27;s ability to negotiate with accurate information (and voting) what their fair share of the economic pie is. THAT is the problem.<p>We could double government expenditures without causing a real problem. But if we double them and only 1% of people go to their boss &quot;I need a raise&quot; because they just don&#x27;t know, then it&#x27;ll be really bad: they&#x27;ll have to compete for goods and services with the other side having double as much money as it does now.')
