We&#x27;re commited to continue building an inclusive place for you to grow professionally with us. We&#x27;re a small, friendly group of multicultural (CH, DE, RU, ES, US) startup veterans.<p>--- ABOUT THE JOB<p>Our SaaS is used by VCs (Venture Capital firms) and their portfolio companies. They love our products because they help find talent for the companies in which the VCs invest.<p>Our SaaS architecture is written in strongly typed, modern PHP 7.4, using the Symfony framework. In our CI&#x2F;CD pipeline, we use, and we contribute to PHPStan and Psalm because they help us write reliable, solid code.<p>We have another product written in Clojure, because we believe that learning other programming paradigms helps us to grow as developers, independent of the language used.<p>We love working with PostgreSQL and expose public and private APIs directly through PostgREST because we strongly believe that a server request should be handled within 100-200ms max. Help us optimize queries and learn about EXPLAIN ANALYZE execution plans with us.<p>We are strong believers in Server Side Rendering, with AJAX requests done by little helpers like Intercooler (now htmx.org) or Turbolinks, added for an interactive Look&amp;Feel.<p>We help VCs aggregate the jobs postings of their portfolio companies. To make this work, we constalntly have to expand our knowledge about CSS and XPath selectors, web crawling techniques, and headless browser instrumentalization via WebDriver and tools like Selenium.<p>Our CI&#x2F;CD pipeline runs on GitLab and deploys our SaaS products after running tests and making sure that no regressions will happen. We run Trunk Based Development in a truly agile fashion: We take the &quot;Kaizen&quot; principle seriously. No heavy-weight processes our hour-long meetings. Promise.<p>We run rented Linux servers and are experimenting with *BSD because while we run parts of our infrastructure on the AWS and Google Cloud, we understand the tradeoffs of cloud offerings and learned how to operate our own Nginx servers, caches, load balancers, and monitoring tools. Doing all that helps us assess much better when to &quot;roll your own&quot;, and when to buy a ready solution. After all, we are engineers and like to tinker, but at the same time we&#x27;re enterpreneurs, and know when to prioritize.<p>--- ABOUT YOU<p>If you feel at home with PHP or Clojure, PostgreSQL and Linux, and maybe even some more of the above technologies, let&#x27;s talk.<p>I&#x27;d love to get to know you, apply here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;airtable.com&#x2F;shrtecukkCL3YMCrC" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;airtable.com&#x2F;shrtecukkCL3YMCrC</a>')
