Item(by='quietbritishjim', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607425600, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25335109, text='This <i>is</i> a tutorial. It almost fits the definition of &quot;tutorial&quot; at the link you posted, but not quite, but that&#x27;s because the definition at the link you posted is a bit flawed. It definitely is not a how-to guide, and the links you posted strongly support that.<p>&gt; How-to guides take the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem.<p>That is from the linked article on how-to guide. By &quot;real-world problem&quot; it means something specific you might want to do to a real code base, like &quot;switch to a different database engine&quot; or &quot;add user authenticaion&quot;. That&#x27;s why it includes the qualification &quot;real-world&quot;. The original article definitely does not fall into that category.<p>&gt; * A tutorial is what you decide a beginner needs to know.<p>&gt; * A how-to guide is an answer to a question that only a user with some experience could even formulate.<p>That was some extra clarification from the linked article on the difference between tutorial and how-to guide. That makes it even more clear that the article is more like a tutorial than a how-to guide.<p>&gt; Tutorials are lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project of some kind.<p>That&#x27;s from the page about tutorials. The article introduces a reader to a substantial new topic from scratch and guides them through it, but it doesn&#x27;t do so by making them complete a specific project, so it doesn&#x27;t fit this definition.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t stop it from being a &quot;tutorial&quot;. The requirement that tutorials have to involve completing a sample project is invented by the author of that page and not part of the usual definition of that word.<p>This final point is pure conjecture, but I suspect the author of that page was just trying to strongly encourage people to base tutorials around sample projects. It&#x27;s fair to encourage that, because often tutorials are improved by basing them around a single unifying project (but not always). But putting it in their definition of the word was a mistake, because that&#x27;s not what that word means, and it&#x27;s only created confusion.')
