Because I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a very realistic number.</i><p>For note taking, word processing, basic image editing, web browsing, video playing, etc, you can easily get a capable enough laptop for that price.<p>This is not comparing like-for-like in terms of what the machines <i>can</i> do, of course. Apple&#x27;s range doesn&#x27;t even remotely try to cover that part of the market so a direct comparison is unfair if you are considering absolute price&#x2F;capability of the devices irrespective of the user&#x27;s requirements, but for work that doesn&#x27;t involve significant computation that bargain-basement unit may adequately do everything many people <i>need</i> it to do (assuming they don&#x27;t plan to also use it for modern gaming in non-working hours).<p><i>&gt; If you try to sell anything Apple related that isn&#x27;t more than 5 years old you won&#x27;t have that problem at all.</i><p>Most people don&#x27;t consider the resale value of a machine when they buy it. For that to be a fair comparison you have to factor in the chance of it being in good condition after a couple of year&#x27;s use (this will vary a lot from person to person) and the cost of any upgrades &amp; repairs needed in that time (again more expensive for Apple products by my understanding).<p>And if you buy a $500 laptop and hand it down or bin it, then you are still better off (assuming you don&#x27;t need \na powerful machine) than if you dropped $3,000 for an iDevice and later sold it for $2,000.<p><i>&gt; what the market value </i>should* be.*<p>&quot;Market value&quot; is decided by what the market will bare, not what we want to be able to sell things for, and new &amp; second hand are often very different markets.')
