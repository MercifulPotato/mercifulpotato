I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;ve seen the CA ballots, but casting an informed vote is <i>quite arduous</i> for the average person, partly due to the nuances involved in the topics (experts who&#x27;ve spent their lives studying these topics can easily disagree on some of them), and partly due to the sheer number of things people need to vote on. You easily need to forego days&#x27; worth of income (hope you have disposable income to spare!) to do anything resembling a reasonable amount of research to cast something that can be called an informed vote.<p>Even ignoring the fact that many people don&#x27;t have the time, energy, or means of sufficiently informing themselves to decide nuanced public policy issues, what they do <i>cannot be overridden by the legislature</i> (except for the few issues that specify otherwise). Which is fine for the fraction of people who <i>want</i> that, but for everybody else who doesn&#x27;t think their opinion is the last word on an issue and understands unexpected problems might come up later, there&#x27;s no way for them to vote &quot;I&#x27;m in favor of this policy but <i>only if the legislature can override it (say) after N years</i>&quot;. Or to vote &quot;I think the legislature should decide this and <i>not</i> my fellow citizens, because I honestly have no clue and I think the issue is just too complicated to let random people decide.&quot; Just imagine if the FDA approved drugs by popular vote...<p>Really, it defeats how the system is supposed to work. The entire point of electing officials you trust is so they can find experts they can trust and rely on their opinions for making informed decisions. So you don&#x27;t have to spend your time deciding random things, both to save your time (don&#x27;t forget it&#x27;s literally <i>your representative&#x27;s job</i> to legislate, and not yours), and because you (and me, and most people) probably don&#x27;t know nearly enough about many issues. It&#x27;s especially counterproductive to have to vote with people you <i>agree</i> and <i>trust</i> but to be forced to do that in a way that prevents them from being able to improve it down the road. The last thing you should want to do to someone you <i>like</i> and <i>trust</i> is to <i>bypass</i> them in the decision-making progress!<p>Ultimately, there is certainly wisdom in letting people override their government, but CA&#x27;s implementation of this idea has left a <i>lot</i> to be desired by its own population.')
