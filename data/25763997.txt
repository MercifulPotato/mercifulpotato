In combination with mobile&#x2F;desktop sync problems, it means that I have lots of personal memories on one device, with no way to get them off and protect them.<p>There was no warning when I first installed Signal that the usual phone backup mechanism (via iTunes, in my case) would not backup this data, or that mobile&#x2F;desktop syncing problems might mean that hundreds of messages just don&#x27;t get synced to my other devices, and that this is expected behavior.<p>So I&#x27;m angry, and I can&#x27;t recommend Signal to others for this reason. And the devs just don&#x27;t seem to care.<p>I appreciate that it&#x27;s an open-source project, and the developers have no obligation to develop new features. But this isn&#x27;t really a feature request; certain sharp edges in a product are actively destructive if you don&#x27;t warn the user about them. It&#x27;s like someone handing out free food which turns out to be poisonous, and then saying, &quot;What are you all complaining about? The food is free!&quot;<p>If any Signal developer sees this, I would personally be happy to have a discussion about compensating you for your time to fix this problem for the community.
