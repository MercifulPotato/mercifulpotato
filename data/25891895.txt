Item(by='throwanem', descendants=None, kids=[25892222], score=None, time=1611495308, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25891598, text='I&#x27;d love to try the Nikon 85mm tilt-shift macro, but it is extremely pricey and I don&#x27;t know if it would suit me, not least because the sense I get is that tilt-shift takes a lot of setup for which I doubt I&#x27;d have time. Of the shots I linked, only the yellowjacket held (relatively!) still in one place for long enough that I might have had a chance; the others were far more typical in that they hardly ever stopped moving and I had to take what shots I could get. These were all done with a Nikon 105mm f&#x2F;2.8 VR II, courtesy of my local camera store&#x27;s used gear counter; for macro use, the VR and AF capabilities are totally superfluous, but the optics are excellent, it has a good working distance even at 1:1, and the extra features are handy for using it as a long prime and portrait lens.<p>The DoF just comes from stopping down a lot. The P. metricus shots are at f&#x2F;32; the V. maculifrons I shot at f&#x2F;25, and the spider wasps at f&#x2F;22. The tradeoff with increasing ratios is diffraction vs. a more forgiving DoF; as I&#x27;ve gotten better at nailing focus by eye (and usually <i>on</i> eyes, which makes it easier due to their structure), I&#x27;ve found myself able to work with a wider aperture and a narrower DoF - that list is a progression in time, as well as in aperture width; the P. metricus shots are from mid-2019, the A. a. metallicus ones from late 2020. (The P. metricus and V. maculifrons were also shot on a crop-sensor body and the others on full-frame, which also makes a difference, including in DoF.)<p>You do need to add light at such narrow apertures, of course. I use three SB-R200s on a ring mount, with a controller on the hot shoe - a pretty pricey setup admittedly, but also one well suited to my particular use cases, including quick setup and teardown since everything has to fit in a backpack - I don&#x27;t leave my cameras behind at home, they&#x27;re no use to me there. For a rig that doesn&#x27;t need to be put together and taken apart on a daily basis, you can do as well and much cheaper with a Lepp bracket and a couple of Ebay flashes plus an RF controller.<p>I don&#x27;t know what to make of macro rings, if I&#x27;m honest. Even with a decent set that shouldn&#x27;t have light leaks, I always end up with soft, hazy, weirdly defocused shots that just don&#x27;t clean up well. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not my technique, but I&#x27;ve seen enough good shots made with rings that I have to assume I&#x27;m doing something wrong and just haven&#x27;t yet been able to work out what it is. It hasn&#x27;t been a huge issue, but I&#x27;d like to figure it out someday, not least because a teleconverter is a really expensive way of adding magnification.')
