Recessions destroy lives as well, everything is a trade-off, a balance.<p>And people were <i>clearly</i> happy to make this trade-off every single day pre-corona. We don&#x27;t lower the speed limit to 30mph, even though that would almost eliminate every single traffic accident. We don&#x27;t ban certain pesticides that are really bad for the environment, because they work really well and increase the yield. We allow dangerous jobs where people can be maimed or killed, because someone needs to do it. We allow people to go parachuting, we allow smoking, unhealthy food, we allow people to own and use guns, even though all of these things let people injure and kill themselves <i>and others</i>.<p>Humans are notoriously bad at risk assessment, we undervalue known risks and overvalue unknown risks, and that&#x27;s clearly what&#x27;s going on with the lockdown hysteria, because the response is so clearly disproportional compared to how we&#x27;re handling similar threats with similar risk profiles.')
