Half of my friends and family are american and the rest foreign. There&#x27;s a huge cultural difference between both sides&#x27; approach to wealth.<p>My american f&amp;f (outside of silicon valley) think of wealth in terms of &quot;saving for retirement.&quot; 401ks, tax strategies, etfs, stocks etc. It&#x27;s very passive, probably &quot;correct&quot;, and very unambitious.<p>The foreign side is totally different. They have very little interest in saving for retirement--they think in terms of investing in businesses. They don&#x27;t buy etfs or stocks. They buy (small, then larger) businesses. It&#x27;s very active and after age 40 or so takes up most of their time. The goal is to never retire, but rather to build a series of cash producing entities for ever.<p>Part of this is certainly cultural. In lots of the world, being a <i>boss</i> is higher status that being an *employee&quot;, regardless of the actual income each activity generates. The owner of a business with 200k in revenue is higher status than a McKinsey employee with a 500k salary.<p>This cultural difference is reflected in a desire to escape &quot;wages&quot; as soon as possible, not necessarily &quot;save for retirement&quot;.')
