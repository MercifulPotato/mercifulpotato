For instance, new devices and a new platform, using the Fitbit talent and technology, but marketed as a new thing, could probably be used for advertising. Then they just need to get everyone over to their new health platform.<p>I also think a ten year commitment is a very poor concession for the EU to have extracted: It just means they&#x27;re punting off society being harmed a while. For a company that will likely be around in 100 years or more, IBM-style, that&#x27;s not a good concession.')
