In your `package.json` you must include a `main` `module` and `exports` object and provide two compiled outputs, one commonjs and one es modules.<p>Then you need to worry about mutating import paths to include the file extension, which can cause trouble when you keep the commonjs and esmodule files in the same folder.<p>Also the esmodule loader in node doesn&#x27;t have access to things like `__dirname`, so certain things can break.<p>not to mention node_modules...<p>It&#x27;s like IE support but on the back end.<p>Then you step into the front end and it&#x27;s another whole layer of chaos.<p>Give me opinionated compilers with minimal configuration and let me write code.')
