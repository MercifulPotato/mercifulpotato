I agree that &quot;curl | sh&quot; is no worse than &quot;git clone &amp;&amp; make&quot;; I think both are terrible. I will say that I can&#x27;t recall every seeing anyone recommend &quot;git clone &amp;&amp; make&quot;.<p>It sounds like we agree that blindly downloading code and building&#x2F;executing it is a bad idea. That&#x27;s all I was trying to assert.<p>There&#x27;s a spectrum of safe&#x2F;acceptable between &quot;download a random binary&quot; and &quot;build yourself, from trusted source&quot;. I think &quot;curl | sh&quot; and &quot;git clone &amp;&amp; make&quot; are just one step above &quot;download a random binary&quot; on that spectrum. We can and should do better than that.')
