Tell the truth such that it sounds like a lie.  Tell the truth so it sounds as if it were the full truth instead of merely half the story.  I&#x27;d consider doing these things intentionally to be dishonest.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d go so far as to call the website dishonest - I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessairly trying to present itself as telling a full, balanced, unbiased story - but it&#x27;s absolutely possible to be dishonest by telling the truth.')
