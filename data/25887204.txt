I thought you were treating them as synonyms.<p>When I search for &quot;error of omission&quot; specifically, I only get two things.  One is an accounting term, completely irrelevant.  The other is a dictionary definition of &quot;not including something such as an amount or fact that should be included&quot; which is basically the same as a lie of omission and doesn&#x27;t fit this situation.  They didn&#x27;t just leave out a fact, they made a statement that was factually wrong.<p>Edit: You changed your post slightly, is the difference just the word &#x27;intentionally&#x27;?  Because I wasn&#x27;t just talking about doing it intentionally.')
