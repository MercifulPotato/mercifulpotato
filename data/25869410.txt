If not, you can ignore the rest of the comment (except the last paragraph, pertinent question for you)<p>The SSPL is not an open source license [0], and that&#x27;s all there is to it.<p>There must be a better version of it out there somewhere. Something to the tune of &quot;use our software as you wish, however you may not offer it as a hosted solution without a license from us. This license entitles you to direct support and other goodies to justify such a stance&quot;.<p>I can&#x27;t think of those &quot;other&quot; goodies but that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not a business type :D<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m making a crazy statement here, am I? Maybe I&#x27;m just being young and naive. Can you shed some light on your experience with trying to work with Amazon to address the problems? I imagine they didn&#x27;t listen (they&#x27;re just too big to care it seems), but I&#x27;d like some first-hand experience to gauge with.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.org&#x2F;node&#x2F;1099" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.org&#x2F;node&#x2F;1099</a>')
