In general LXD is more secure than docker in its general configuration as containers in LXD are mapped to userid and use shiftfs [1], nothing like this in Docker yet including kubernetes. Usually docker always had more security vulnerabilities than LXD.<p>So LXD is much better than docker except docker in spite of being an inferior solution became popular with marketing money spend on it due to hype. LXD stayed with people who believe in pragmatic simplicity. Docker is plagued by privilege escalation for a very long time. Check the details in general Docker has more vulnerabilities than LXD.
