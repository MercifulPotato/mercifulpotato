When I was in grad school my lab was in a subbasement in a 100 year old building.  We had huge cockroaches...<p>One of my colleagues caught some  and put them in one of our lab freezers and forgot about them.  Months later we remembered the jar... took it out of the freezer.  Cockroaches thawed out and seemed to be fine... very active, almost like nothing happened.<p>Other <i>experiments</i>  were performed as well... anyhow, cockroaches are hard to kill.')
