Sadly in their war they are weaponizing the shared infrastructure, harming themselves and the people not interested in their war. (e.g. triggering the new wave of internet regulation in other countries, delaying a flight because there is someone with red hat etc.)<p>The economy and civility that allow billions of different people to cooperate is a fragile thing. So we need to explain the warring sides that they need to go throw their stones in another place, e.g. try to use courts and legislation if they want to ban each other, or have different laws in different states.<p>The situation is remarkably similar to the situation with religion in 1600s England, when people were trying to blend it with state, and only after long wars did they understand that not allowing someone into shop based on religion is not acceptable.')
