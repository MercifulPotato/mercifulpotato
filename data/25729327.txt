Item(by='bitwize', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610375889, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25725809, text='There are a few assumptions in play here that have become so ingrained in how we think politically that they may as well be laws of thermodynamics:<p>1. The left is generally good; the right is generally evil.<p>2. The goal of leftists is equality and harmony for all. The goal of rightists is to eliminate Jews&#x2F;blacks&#x2F;LGBTQ&#x2F;etc.<p>3. Leftist rhetoric must be taken at face value, or at least as innocuously as possible; rightist rhetoric must be treated as a secret coded dogwhistle message that actually calls for war, genocide, or other unspeakable horrors. When a rightists uses conflict-related metaphors they are certainly to be taken at face value, whereas a leftist going on about &quot;slicey bois&quot; is certainly not a threat.<p>4. Accordingly, leftist violence must be considered either the relatively harmless or completely justified actions of a single individual or relatively small group of individuals with no coordination larger than a single cell taking place (&quot;antifa is not a group, it&#x27;s an idea&quot;). Rightist violence must be considered to be highly coordinated, with individual attacks receiving secret coded dogwhistle instructions, directly or indirectly, from the top thought leaders on the right including the POTUS if he be Republican. (&quot;stochastic terrorism&quot;).<p>5. Therefore, leftist violence is to be grimly tolerated at worst -- hopefully actively supported and encouraged as an essential step toward a more just society. Rightist violence is to be met with swift punishment not just for the offender, but their family, pets, and anyone caught displaying any sympathy for them. Anyone questioning the narrative that these are terrorist operatives taking orders from the top are to be shunned and shut out of decent society by decent people, and certainly not allowed to communicate.<p>I make no statements as to the truth or falsity of the above.I think it&#x27;s a bit more nuanced than the extremes of either side will care to admit. But these are the rhetorical rules you have to deal with because if you don&#x27;t, louder voices will drown you out and eventually shun you.')
