There&#x27;s always more to build to deliver features -- &#x27;Sorry, but the app UI doesn&#x27;t work on certain newer iPhone models yet, you don&#x27;t get your raise&#x2F;equity&#x2F;whatever was promised until that&#x27;s fixed...&#x27;, and then something else after (&#x27;Sorry, we&#x27;ve had other people join the team and contribute to those milestones, we need to rework your equity model&#x27;). Not saying all these are legally possible but I&#x27;ve seen stuff like this done. Time based vesting avoids this.<p>Problem 2: You have 0 diversification. That&#x27;s fine if you have the cofounder potential upside but doesn&#x27;t sound like you do. Why not start your own startup? You are investing all your time into an illiquid, high risk company, why aren&#x27;t you a cofounder?')
