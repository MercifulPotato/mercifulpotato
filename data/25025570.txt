Those packages won&#x27;t show up in other users&#x27; $PATH, so other users will not be affected by them, but they could see what&#x27;s in &#x2F;nix&#x2F;store if they wanted to. This matters when you&#x27;re thinking of putting private data (such as an encryption key) in a package: it&#x27;s vital that you don&#x27;t do that on a multi-user system.')
