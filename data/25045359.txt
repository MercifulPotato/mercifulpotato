Item(by='taneliv', descendants=None, kids=[25046214], score=None, time=1605012441, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25045048, text='I have had nothing but problems with HP LaserJet CP1025nw color on Ubuntu in the last five years or so (and on Arch I could not make it print anything). Bought it based on similar comments, so buyer beware.<p>The only thing that has worked (at all) has been the instructions and software from <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;foo2zjs.rkkda.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;foo2zjs.rkkda.com&#x2F;</a>, even if the site looks way too sketchy to my liking. Recently, though, even those drivers have started misbehaving and do not print the last centimeter or two on the page---the solution is to select upside down printing in the print settings.')
