It’s hard to get your boss to pay for software; it’s extra hard when you get no additional value.<p>That’s the big issue IMO. It’s easy for one developer to say &quot;if you make money you can pay me a tip&quot;. When you have hundreds of dependencies, tracking developers wanting donations is almost a full time job…<p>If I were npm CEO, I would :<p>1. Propose the users (the ones using npm install&#x2F;ci without publishing packages) to create accounts<p>2. You can put any amount of money on your account ; it will be monthly used to finance the packages you have downloaded that month<p>3. Developers (the one publishing packages) can flag their packages to be downloadable either publicly, only by registered users or only by paying users<p>4. Take a small fee<p>5. Profit<p>Then do the same with composer, apt, yum, and you have a pretty good coverage of the FLOSS ecosystem and potential monetary contributors just have to monthly fund 4 accounts.<p>I don’t understand how it hasn’t happened yet.')
