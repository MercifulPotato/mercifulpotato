At the end of February the U.S. had 60 active reported COVID cases.  Assume a 10:1 underreporting and that&#x27;s about 600 total cases, then assume about 100 million cold + flu cases at any given time in the winter and there&#x27;s about 200,000:1 odds that a given respiratory illness was actually COVID.<p>Now there are 4.1 million active COVID cases in the U.S.  Assume a 5:1 underreporting (we&#x27;re better at testing, but still seeing close to 50% test positivity rates in the Midwest, worse than NYC at the peak) and that&#x27;s 20 million active cases.  Meanwhile flu cases have dropped by ~90% [1], so if we assume that holds true for colds as well, estimate about 10 million active cases of cold &amp; flu in the U.S.  A random respiratory illness with no further differentials then has a 2:1 chance of being COVID.<p>Obviously things like location, differential diagnosis, etc. will change those odds.  A random respiratory illness in the Bay Area (where COVID numbers are low and we just had a bunch of wildfires) is most likely to be allergies or smoke inhalation, while if you had a random respiratory illness in NYC in April there was a decent chance it was COVID.  Given the OP&#x27;s differential diagnosis though (rash and shortness of breath are way more common in COVID than bronchitis or flu), it&#x27;s not unreasonable to conclude he has COVID.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;mmwr&#x2F;volumes&#x2F;69&#x2F;wr&#x2F;mm6937a6.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;mmwr&#x2F;volumes&#x2F;69&#x2F;wr&#x2F;mm6937a6.htm</a>')
