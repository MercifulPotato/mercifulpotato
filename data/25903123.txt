It&#x27;s caused by deep structural problems. You can&#x27;t solve it with money. You can probably make it worse by pretending that you are doing something though.<p>There needs to be a cultural shift away from sprawl and single family housing to modest 3 story apartments. Once you have enough vacant housing you can consider giving it away.<p>You should also have low nuisance commercial business like supermarkets mixed into your residential neighborhoods. Reducing car dependence would help people who cannot afford a car or maintain a used one.<p>Drug addicts need safe places where they get clean drugs and where the dosage is controlled by a trained doctor. The idea is that the doctor slowly tapers off the dosage. Recovery is possible if you give them the minimum necessary dosage to fend off withdrawal effects but not enough to cause a high. It also keeps needles off the street.<p>A lot of crimes are committed by desperate addicts who cannot fund their addiction. Some of them do prostitution, others steal. If you give them what they really want they don&#x27;t have to engage in destructive behavior.')
