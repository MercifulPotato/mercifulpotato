I&#x27;m pretty sure that, at least as a consumer (if not as a volunteer) you could communicate with such a local group through email. Last time I&#x27;ve been asked to join a facebook group, I&#x27;ve said I didn&#x27;t have an account and everyone switched to a mailing list administered via google in no time. (Though I was not the only one.) Pretty sure a bunch of other alternatives would have been possible if google didn&#x27;t work nicely. Over the last half-year of online academic events, I&#x27;ve seen at least half a dozen different online services used (Zoom, Zulip, Gather.town, google hangouts, Cisco Webex and probably a bunch I don&#x27;t remember). Most of us users don&#x27;t particularly like to, but can (without serious tears) learn a new tool when it comes up and turns out to be more suited.<p>As it comes to reach, don&#x27;t forget that email has probably the greatest reach of any service around.')
