This is to maximize compatibility with other open source licenses. And thanks for the heads-up, I will fix this too.<p>&gt; Do you plan to add a CONTRIBUTING.md to instruct those who want to help to understand how to start?<p>Since there&#x27;s some interest in this, I&#x27;m definitely going to add it!')
