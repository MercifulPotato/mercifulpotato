Let&#x27;s say it must be an animal with four legs and a tail. Currently it&#x27;s unknown whether all animals are q-conscious[1]. Let&#x27;s say it is discovered that all animals are q-conscious. Therefore the invisible dragon is q-conscious.<p>Currently we don&#x27;t really understand qualia, but one mainstream theory is that qualia are a different kind of thing to anything else we know about (i.e. are non-physical).<p>Let&#x27;s say this theory is true, and, further, that a method for detecting this different kind of thing is detected. That the dragon is invisible, floats, is heatless, is incorporeal, doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>The theory that there is a dragon in the garage is falsifiable by the observation that a scan for qualia results negative.<p>You could say &quot;ah, but this dragon is the dragon of any-test-you-can-come-up-with-doesn&#x27;t-work, therefore you can&#x27;t come up with any test which would work&quot;. But that would be begging the question.<p>[1]That is, all animals have qualia.')
