The law didn&#x27;t change, but who&#x27;s on the SC did.<p><i>&quot;They should do their job irregardless of who is in power.&quot;</i><p>They have a lot leeway as to how to do their job, and many of them will use their power to pursue vendettas against people they don&#x27;t like, as we saw with Abu Ghraib, Gitmo, Bagram, black sites around the world, and all the torture and murder that the police engage in.<p>Prison guards and employees of ICE and Homeland Security are also probably mostly Republicans, and it&#x27;s hard to argue that their politics and world view doesn&#x27;t affect the way they do their job or why they are in those jobs in the first place.')
