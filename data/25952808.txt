Because you&#x27;ve just granted the government the right to use its monopoly on force to remove fundamental rights like freedom of speech and association from the people running any website which meets some arbitrary &quot;population reach&quot; threshold.<p>To me, that&#x27;s a lot scarier than platforms fact-checking statements or banning racists and people calling for violence or spreading misinformation.<p>&gt;(that is, subject to due process&#x2F;law, not up to the whims of the company).<p>Companies aren&#x27;t anarchist collectives, they are subject to due process and the law. You just disagree with companies having the right to choose with whom they do business, and with Twitter and other big social media platforms being able to moderate content and ban people. But they&#x27;re still doing so within the framework of a state and its laws.')
