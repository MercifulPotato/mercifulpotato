When I worked there engineers (not my team thankfully) designed their own alternative to protobuf to try and save more bytes over the wire, which in my opinion was a really poor decision. Rather than get on with actually adding value, they ended up pushing back multiple other teams deadlines while adding almost no value. It was a classic &quot;not built here&quot; mentality and doing engineering work for the sake of the work, rather than actually ask &quot;what problem are we trying to solve here?&quot;<p>If protobuf works for Google then it essentially works for 99.999% of every other company on the globe.')
