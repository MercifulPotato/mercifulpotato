It is not a fair battle test of drivers. It is an epic struggle between drivers, teams, manufacturers, and even the F1 organization itself.<p>It would be nice if the racing were closer. Because closer racing means more of a struggle. But taking away the difference between teams would take away more of the narrative.<p>Is Verstappen staying with Red-bull now that Honda is gone?<p>Is replacing Perez with Vettel a good idea. Should it maybe have been Stroll that got replaced?<p>Does Sainz regret his move to Ferrari next year?<p>Will Albon get demoted again, will Gasly get promoted again?<p>Will Williams be stripped for parts and sold now that it is taken over by private equity?<p>Who would win between Hamilton and Verstappen in a fair fight?<p>How good is Russel actually?<p>In a &#x27;fairer&#x27; system few to none of the above questions would be as compelling. The last two would even get clear answers, which I think takes much of the fun out of it.')
