My grandparents told me that what is now referred to as &quot;the 10&quot; used to be &quot;the Santa Monica freeway&quot;. &quot;The 405&quot; used to be &quot;the San Diego Freeway&quot;.<p>When all these freeways were given numeric designations, my theory postulates, people would still start referring to them by their old names, starting with the &quot;the&quot;, but then saying the number.')
