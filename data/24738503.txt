Were this about any other subject, then restricting the amount of content to Chinese standards would make people scream &#x27;censorship&#x27;.<p>Shouldn&#x27;t Tiktok follow the local laws of the user&#x27;s country? And if so, doesn&#x27;t that mean that, if we reject censorship on ideological grounds, that Tiktok should allow all content permitted by local laws, rather than a subset of it?')
