On the other hand, there is no local correction that enables you to hover a winged plane (it always has to move at a minimum speed in the air to generate lift), so you can only drive them automatically if the computer can globally control your trip, which is much more inconvenient for a human driver.<p>The aerodynamic stability is an interesting topic, but useless here. If you assume your computer is dead, you won&#x27;t control neither a remote quadcopter nor a remote winged plane.')
