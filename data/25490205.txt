If you need hardware acceleration you will have to link against Mesa&#x2F;OpenGL for direct rendering anyway, which is a giant C library, so yeah the dependency on external C is somewhat unavoidable there under any windowing system.<p>If you consider linking against libGL and libEGL to be okay but not libwayland then there actually is a workaround: forget the EGL wayland platform and have your custom wayland implementation use the EGL GBM platform. There&#x27;s some extra code you have to write here but unless something changed that I missed, the same problem exists with Xlib if you try to use the EGL X11 platform, or if you want to use direct rendering in GLX. (Mesa&#x27;s libEGL&#x2F;libGLX links against libX11 and expects to get a structure with the C ABI. Keep in mind if you are using GLX calls in that CLX library, you are probably not getting direct rendering, you would have to do a similar thing and reimplement the DRI2&#x2F;DRI3 path from Mesa in your toolkit or application)')
