Doing an actual good job, above and beyond, is not going to be worth much when you&#x27;re looking for your next job.<p>Thus we&#x27;re now seeing the rise of Professional Interviewers or Professional Leetcoders. I am ashamed to admit that I too, am one, and probably will continue to be one until I make it into such an &quot;endgame&quot; company.')
