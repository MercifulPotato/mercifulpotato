Google is known for relentlessly pruning whole products that people were happily using but they&#x27;re also pretty aggressive about removing features from existing products.<p>One big example of that is the removal of community captioning for YouTube videos. Call me hidebound but I am not happy at all with this, even though I don&#x27;t use it very much. Captions are critical for making videos accessible to the deaf and hard of hearing communities. The removal of this feature is an ugly snub to a vulnerable group. Now they will be wholly reliant on the video creators to do the captioning themselves or otherwise be stuck with the lousy automatic captioning.')
