Bullying is mostly done by groups and you can&#x27;t effectively fight more than 2 opponents even with proper training. Also, bullies always escalate, so for every punch you throw you&#x27;ll receive it back with a bonus kick. Going guerilla will lead to assymmetrical retaliation.<p>Not even mentioning potential problems with school authorities or the law (if you&#x27;re effective).<p>There&#x27;s a persistent image of &#x27;bad neighbourhoods&#x27; in the US. Will you suggest fighting back there too? Schools are like that but you can&#x27;t move away.')
