It, coupled with your name, would log you into everything on the computers. To this day I don&#x27;t know why I wanted this info other than to have it. I never once used it for any purpose, I think I tested 1 or 2 but never touched any files. I had a HyperStudio stack (saved to my network drive) that had hidden buttons and a certain sequence you had to press them to get to the &quot;database&quot; (just text entry field that I saved 1 name and 1 ID number per line). It was painfully easy to collect the numbers as most kids had their class schedule on the outside or inside of their binder they carried around. The ID number was only 6 or 8 digits so it was easy to memorize, write down, and store in HyperStudio later.<p>But alas, stupid younger me thought it would be a good comeback to rattle off someone&#x27;s ID number when they were picking on me one time which led to a 3 day in-school suspension and loss of computer privileges till the end of the year. They made me show the IT guy where I had stored the numbers (how to navigate my HyperStudio project) and phrases like &quot;hacking&quot; and &quot;hacker&quot; were thrown around even though this was literally equivalent to writing the numbers in a notebook but since I had used a computer to store the data it became a way bigger thing in their minds. Even &quot;funnier&quot; (not to me at the time) I had a friend that helped me collect the numbers (again, this was stupid easy, felt like a fun game to figure out how to get it, and who could collect more the fastest) who got a lighter punishment and didn&#x27;t lose computer access.<p>Fast forward to high school and I ended up writing 2 different PHP-based apps for the school. A library attendance program that teachers used to mark that they were sending kids to the library that the library could see (so they didn&#x27;t just skip school I guess? Or goof off in the halls) and to keep track of who was in the library and how long they had been there. I also wrote an online voting platform for the school that they could re-use for things like Homecoming court&#x2F;Prom court&#x2F;Senior superlatives&#x2F;etc. The reason I bring up both of these? The high school gave me a massive CSV of all the students in the school.... and their ID number to be used for login to the platforms. I still get a good chuckle out of that.')
