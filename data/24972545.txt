Less consumption of industrial deliveries of toilet paper to companies, much higher home consumption from super markets.<p>So again, not a panic, but a legitimate, overnight, shift in toilet paper consumption habits that resulted in a long lasting shortage of toilet paper in the supermarket JIT supply system. They were not prepared for a jump of 50-100% more home toilet paper consumption.<p>No panic, but a simple explanation of the shift in consumption from industrial, bulk deliveries of toilet paper to your company office, to buying more of your own at the supermarket.<p>Yes, there were some opportunists and crazies with a shopping cart full, but they don&#x27;t explain why it took months for shelves to finally get fully stocked.')
