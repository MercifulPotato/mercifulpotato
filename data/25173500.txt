So many pictures of other people&#x27;s dinner, and the constant bragging need for attention from just about everyone. For the very few things that were worthwhile (and could have been done simply in an email), the sheer amount of time required to get through the crap was mentally frazzling.<p>One night I mentioned it at dinner and discovered I wasn&#x27;t alone. So we all quit it over the period of a few days, letting all our connections know what we were up to.<p>After we cut the cord, the silence was deafening. But we found more productive things to fill the space. We only lost a small number of friends, but ironically they were the main brunt of people boring us to death with the constant &quot;look at me!&quot; type posts, so none of us felt like we were missing out for very long. We literally burnt out of watching everyone pretend they were celebrities, and grew appreciative of our ability to disconnect from it.<p>I eventually cut off Reddit because I was sick of absolutely every thread ending in cynicism and goofy memes, no matter how interesting the thread was at the start. Again the &quot;silence&quot; was only short term.<p>After being away from the things that drove you away in the first place, when you see it again you get a new &quot;eye rolling&quot; response, and realize there is no will to return to it.')
