That would be an excellent outcome, but it&#x27;s difficult to do in the status quo, and is a separate problem to address separately.<p>The proposal _does_ require pages that wish to request resources across a network boundary to be delivered securely, which therefore requires resources that wish to be accessible across network boundaries to be served securely (as they&#x27;d otherwise be blocked as mixed content). This places the burden upon those resources which wish to be included externally, which seems like the right place for it to land.')
