Considering a single Starlink satellite will have 4 laser links plus has a total radio bandwidth of about 20Gbit&#x2F;s, this is sufficient. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Starlink&#x2F;comments&#x2F;en7dtx&#x2F;comment&#x2F;fdx379d?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Starlink&#x2F;comments&#x2F;en7dtx&#x2F;comment&#x2F;fd...</a><p>...however, this is nowhere near any fundamental limit on optical transmission. SpaceX is operating around 20-40GHz radios, and letâ€™s just say a bandwidth 1% of the frequency with a SNR of 1, giving them a bit rate per channel of 200-400Megabits&#x2F;s. The same calculation with near IR optical (which is optimistic obviously) gives 3 Petahertz frequency, 30THz bandwidth, and 30terabits&#x2F;s&#x2F;channel. So optical is nowhere near any kind of fundamental limit, unlike radio which needs many channels (ie phased array, MIMO, spatial multiplexing generally, etc) to saturate the bandwidth of the satellite bus.<p>(Also, note that broadband users have a capacity factor of like 1-2%, so on average 20Gbps can give service to like 10,000 subscribers per viewable satellite using 100Mbps peak service.)')
