They&#x27;re annoying, pointless questions that I have to answer every single time I create or consume a REST API. Those pointless questions also create very real bugs that I have dealt with for <i>years</i>, because humans make mistakes.<p>It&#x27;s a complete waste of time and energy for everyone involved. Every one of these questions creates additional mental overhead and an opportunity for incorrect implementation. I would rather deal with meaningful decisions as often as possible, like questions of state management, instead of constantly deciding what color to paint the bike shed based on each person&#x27;s interpretation of what &quot;the most RESTy&quot; API should look like.<p>You didn&#x27;t seem to disagree with me in any way... I see nowhere in your comment where you say that REST APIs are better than gRPC, or why you would pick to make a REST API over gRPC or vice versa. Your rant just has nothing to do with my comment, as far as I can tell?<p>I never claimed that `gRPC` would solve state management. I never even mentioned state management.<p>So... cool? gRPC is not a magic bullet, I completely agree. It&#x27;s a tool, and it seems to have advantages over REST APIs. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re discussing here, since the OP asked why someone would use gRPC.<p>Your comment seems to imply that it&#x27;s pointless to improve one problematic situation (RPC) without completely fixing all other problems in existence.')
