Is your point that government is overstepping the bounds, or that this type of right does not deserve protection? Or is it just about the semantics and definition of the word &quot;right&quot;?<p>&gt; Rights are no longer something innate to all humans, they are something that the government gives to you when it wants.<p>I always thought that the humanity creates communities, countries and their governments to protect those rights, among other things.')
