A security of what?\nAnd yes they do that that right IF there is a security of some sort being sold OR IF there is a contract that implies some sort of security like benefits OF IF there is fraudulent promises being made like promised RoI or voting rights or something.<p>If you just sell something physically created or digitally created that you legally own and the other party agreed on the price and possible other agreements then this is not in the scope of the SEC.<p>We dont know the agreements ripple made but there has defensively been a price both sides agreed on and sell restrictions that prevented the buyers from crashing the market. \nNon of that promises returns, special right or ownership of something else than the XRPs. There is also no allegation of fraud or fraudulent behavior so no sign of misleading statements or promises that where made.\n The whole think boils down to that the SEC says the XRP sold with a contract where securities because of the contract alone. Something like that never happens.\nIts not even possible that some XRPs are securities while other are not.<p>With ETH its a bit different it was retroactively declared as a security at the ICO which never held up in court because it was never challenged by anyone.\nIts quite obvious they did this to stop the ICO scams but did not sue anyone so this statement would not be challenged.<p>Yet if XRP was once a security they would consequently call out the free giveaways and the XRP sold without contracts and even the XRPs that where gifted to ripple.\nAfter all gifted securities would still have to be registered. Non of that is the case because they cant make up any real reason why 100Bn worthless digital nothings gifted to a companies could ever become a security of something or even of that companies.\nIt just makes no sense at all. So instead they attacked the contracts alone.')
