What you notice, over and over, is the people talking the loudest about most things have very little real idea about whatever they&#x27;re talking about.  The truth is almost always more boring than the most attention-grabbing theory, this bias found all over for the non-expert with the big opinion needs to stop.<p>People with the stock industry conspiracy theories are doing the <i>exact same</i> thing as voter fraud people.  That is, people with almost no information are forming theories about a secret cabal of the powerful keeping them down.<p>The reality which is becoming obvious is that trades were at several brokerages were halted because of capital requirements for brokerage firms.  The capital requirements for some of these meme stocks changed, the stocks were very broadly held at these brokerages, and they simply didn&#x27;t have the capital on hand where it needed to be to cover the requirements. That&#x27;s (1) a lot more boring, and (2) a lot more complicated than a conspiracy about market fixing, so it doesn&#x27;t get attention outside of people who actually know.')
