Not that I really tried to solve them.<p>But lichess training was really engaging for me. I played it for a few hours, and I found the format of the problems and the ui nice in a way that let me solve things pretty quickly. I like that all of them are formatted as &quot;do the best moves&quot;, and yet some of them end in checkmate, while others end with just getting a really favorable trade.<p>It felt like 90% of the plays involved making a check, and then using the forced response to gain an advantage. Is that representative of actual play though? I get that you can&#x27;t make a deterministic puzzle unless there&#x27;s a fairly deterministic right answer and path to get there. But what fraction of good chess thinking resembles solving these kinds of puzzles?')
