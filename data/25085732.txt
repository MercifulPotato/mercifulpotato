When you have the largest music streaming service (probably YouTube) why would you want to run another one.<p>I love the idea that anyone can easily publish songs that I can listen to (no need for music labels) and that I can share playlists that friends can add arbitrary YouTube songs to without a subscription.<p>The major issue is that they did a terrible job at it. To list a couple of issues:<p>- Your uploaded music and the YouTube collection are completely separate (unlike GPM)\n- It buffers almost nothing ahead, even in bad network conditions so it fails on road trips.\n- The song suggestions are awful. (way worse than GPM)\n- Even if you dislike a song it will still suggest it for you (often frequently)\n- A lot of features missing (sure, they wouldn&#x27;t get them all, but so many are gone).<p>The list goes on. I was a GPM subscriber for a long time. I used to work at Google so I decided I would help beta-test YouTube Music. However it quickly became clear that it wasn&#x27;t going to be a good replacement for GPM. I ended up switching away from YouTube Premium and YouTube Music.')
