I waste time on mobile and my duty has made mobile necessary. I am student and online classes have made me stay on phone.I also don&#x27;t pay much attention to online classes because i skipped attention for first few classes, they have moved forward in syllabus and i don&#x27;t understand much. Also i don&#x27;t study much because i procrastinate. I do have interest in my field though.<p>At the end of each day,i feel like looser.')
