We&#x27;ve always taken the &quot;grand-fathering&quot; approach, but it can get a bit more complicated as your product and offerings grow. If someone was paying $XX &#x2F;mo for your initial offering, and a few years later, you&#x27;re able to provide a number of new features within that product, I don&#x27;t think you necessarily need to continue providing those extra features simply because someone signed up earlier.<p>To your point, you may face a backlash. But it also costs a lot of time and $$ to support new development and features. Therefore, having some backlash may still be the right decision in the medium&#x2F;long term. Can be hard to weather that storm initially, though.')
