I have reasons I hate them too. But can we please not post baseless claims like you seem to be doing? I personally feel folks doing that are contributing to the huge backwards slide of content quality on the internet. If you want to say you prefer non-Apple laptops, that’s entirely fine, just don’t try to justify your decision with arbitrary ratios without actually running the numbers and seeing if Apple really is “far behind the competition” on those arbitrary criteria.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;psref.lenovo.com&#x2F;syspool&#x2F;Sys&#x2F;PDF&#x2F;datasheet&#x2F;ThinkPad_T480_datasheet_EN.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;psref.lenovo.com&#x2F;syspool&#x2F;Sys&#x2F;PDF&#x2F;datasheet&#x2F;ThinkPad_...</a>')
