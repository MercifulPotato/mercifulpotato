I wake up with a big smile when I have new software to build.<p>I have been developing software for 15+ years. Usually my biggest contributions to projects are:<p>1) looking at the &quot;big picture&quot; and deciding the best path to solve the business problem at hand; most of the times it means combining great, stable and proven open-source software to serve as the basis of the project, customizing them here and there. Also, simplicity is the ultimate sophistication;<p>3) coming up with challenges and creative ways to motivate the team, in exchange for $$$ bonus or a day off. I&#x27;ve managed internal and external dev teams and budgets of more than +$10M;<p>2) coding the bits no one on the team wants to, those that requires more thinking and research than coding. I&#x27;m best in backend coding. I love figuring out and coding great UX, but I suck at making things look pretty and sexy. Nowadays I tend to use JavaScript or Python, but I still use PHP, .Net (VB, C#, ASP), C++ and Java - whatever is the best for the task at hand.<p>Sometimes I find fun projects on Upwork, you can check some of my client&#x27;s feedback here, as well as the (very) different types of projects I&#x27;ve worked on: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.upwork.com&#x2F;o&#x2F;profiles&#x2F;users&#x2F;~01ef5120bd178f9fcc&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.upwork.com&#x2F;o&#x2F;profiles&#x2F;users&#x2F;~01ef5120bd178f9fcc&#x2F;</a><p>I&#x27;m super responsive.
