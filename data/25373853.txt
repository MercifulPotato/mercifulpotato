That&#x27;s why the vast majority of nations have laws protecting intellectual property.<p>A different position held by a minuscule minority does not make it less of a consensus.<p>&gt; In any case, this isn&#x27;t an intellectual property issue, but a privacy issue.<p>Articles states:<p>&gt; U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech said on Wednesday that documents related to development of their COVID-19 vaccine had been “unlawfully accessed” in a cyberattack on Europe’s medicines regulator.<p>And if it is related to the development of their vaccine -- and something for the European Medicines Agency to review, no less --, I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s nearly impossible that it isn&#x27;t intellectual property of Pfizer&#x2F;BioNTech.')
