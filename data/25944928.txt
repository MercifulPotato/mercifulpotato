If it can happen to one fund it can happen to any random fund on Wall Street and that kind of risk and uncertainty can’t be allowed.<p>Same mentality when companies that try to fight unions forming, even those forming at their competitors. A few Amazon employees want to form a union? The entire retail industry will suddenly show their support for Amazon. Can’t set the president of allowing the little guy <i>anywhere</i> to get used to being able to band together and take collective action.')
