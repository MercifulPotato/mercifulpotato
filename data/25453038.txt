When I&#x27;m reading fantasy, I&#x27;ll have to pause after a cool fight scene while my imagination reverts to a 6 year old thinking of all the scenarios where the protagonist is winning or saying a line and being smooth. When I&#x27;m reading&#x2F;listening to non-fiction and trying to understand the writers intent or what the words means to me.<p>Not saying that your way is wrong or any less of an experience since the way you enjoy it the most is what matters. For me, reading was painfully slow and I thought listening to audiobooks would be a more efficient way of going through books. I listened to audiobooks at higher than 1x speed, thinking I would get the same experience and remove the wasteful rabbit holes that I would go down when narrators spoke too slowly, but audiobooks\nweren&#x27;t doing it for me like reading was. When I went back to books, I realized the mental rabbit holes were what made books enjoyable.<p>I&#x27;m back at using audiobooks as my primary method, but now I&#x27;m aggressive with the pause button as soon as I feel myself drifting.<p>Again, not saying that my way is superior. I just think it&#x27;s funny how people can see the same situation play out, and have very different takes on it.')
