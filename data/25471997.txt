In 1918, people were shot when police started a confrontation over their refusal to wear masks. In your example, a man who refused to wear a mask also started assaulting people at a store (because he was angry that they wouldn&#x27;t service him without a mask), and the police were called only once the assaults started. Then he was shot â€” because he was assaulting people, not because he refused to wear a mask.')
