The challenge is not the &quot;approach&quot;, but rather a system that constrains the ability to even begin that approach.<p>I find #7 especially hollow:<p>&gt; We need talented people working in government who have experience creating modern digital services.<p>Sure, no one would argue against that, but the solution to this can&#x27;t come from the team implementing or providing the digital service. Rather the whole of USG&#x27;s incredibly obtuse, opaque, and inflexible centralized hiring system needs to be addressed. This is no better than telling a USA Special Forces team commander that in order for his operators to be more effective he needs the Army to recruit better soldiers.')
