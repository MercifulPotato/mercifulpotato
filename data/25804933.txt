Item(by='sixstringtheory', descendants=None, kids=[25805213], score=None, time=1610826881, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25803742, text='&gt; If you implement an algorithm in a high level language like Python you may get much worse runtime than you thought because some inner loop does arithmetic with bignum-style performance instead of hardware integer performance<p>If a language&#x2F;library can change the dominant asymptotic term of an algorithm like that, instead of just the constant factor, that is a problem. Does that really happen with python or is this exaggeration? I’m inclined to accept another reason to dislike these super high level interpreted langs but I’ve never seen something that e.g. appears written to be logarithmic to become quadratic because of library implementation details.')
