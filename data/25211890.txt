The trophic level of animals in the food chain necessitates that they will eat more calories of plant matter than would provide calories of food upon being eaten.<p>To put this into more laymen&#x27;s terms, meat cultivation dramatically increases the total amount of plants that we need to grow.<p>As mentioned in my other comment:<p>&gt; 70-75% of soybeans grown globally are for livestock, only 6% are used for human food products (meat eaters often try to claim that soy production is terrible for the environment; surprise, surprise, meat consumption is the main driver)<p>So, it&#x27;s a bit counterintuitive, but globally switching to a plant-based diet would actually dramatically reduce the total amount of plants that we are raising, and therefore would dramatically reduce overall suffering of plants (if they suffer)')
