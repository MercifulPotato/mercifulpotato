HR people would explain to you that whilst yes, those floating point units did demonstrably produce the wrong answers, Intel as an organisation doesn&#x27;t accept that it did anything wrong, customer expectations were simply misplaced.<p>Geopolitically Intel is probably going to need to get bailed out, but it&#x27;s a toxic company that could do with disappearing. I won&#x27;t be mourning their Sales &amp; Marketing teams.')
