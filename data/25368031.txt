Drivers often get lost. I put <i>very</i> specific directions, yet only about 50% of the drivers would actually make it to my door.<p>The other 50% would go to a different building, a different unit in my building, or not even bother and call me from some nearby location.  One guy was like &quot;your food&#x27;s here.&quot; I go outside and he&#x27;s in the parking lot across the street. He didn&#x27;t even get out of his car.<p>These days I don&#x27;t bother. I order the food and pick it up myself.')
