If agreeing to such a thing means it becomes your fault when it inevitably fails, it&#x27;s necessary to refuse and reschedule.<p>Or not, but I can imagine many exceptions besides ego that would be reasonable. If it&#x27;s just a Rockstar tantrum, then you&#x27;re better off firing that dev asap and I can&#x27;t even imagine such a person getting away with it, though I&#x27;ve never worked in SV.')
