There&#x27;s such rapid change that you either keep your hand in a bit when you&#x27;re off or you&#x27;re going to spend a month of time getting back up to speed after every break.<p>I would spend more time off if I had it but I really can&#x27;t complain too much as I have pretty good vacation by US standards and I normally also travel a lot on business to interesting places which is almost like having extra vacation.<p>The one person I know who did work part time in this manner was a contract lawyer with a company and I think they could pretty much just take multi-month breaks with a bit of planning.<p>&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if in the future companies go &quot;all part time&quot; and have their whole organization be tuned for part time productivity.<p>The challenge there is that the pay almost has to be less than it would be for full-time work. And a lot of (most) people aren&#x27;t really in a position to take a low salary in exchange for part-time work. Overall, I assume you&#x27;d cut your hiring pool appreciably.')
