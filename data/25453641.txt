If you chose a best seller from 2020, say <i>A Promised Land</i>, it’s $25 for approximately 15-20 hours of entertainment. I think most books are at a $&#x2F;hour or less.<p>Single player video games are also in that range - 30-40 hours of gameplay for $60. But where it gets really crazy is endless games (Sims, Factorio, Simulators) or free to play games (League of Legends, Fortnite) where you could be entertained for thousands of hours for a couple of dollars. I personally played a free to play game for 2000 hours while spending about $40 total on it.<p>Even movies are pretty cheap, considering we most of us watch what’s included in our monthly subscriptions of Netflix&#x2F;Amazon&#x2F;Disney. Even buying&#x2F;renting movies works out to about 1$&#x2F;hour.<p>Conclusion - we’re in a golden era for entertainment where the options are nearly unlimited and dirt cheap.')
