It&#x27;s cliche and generates far more heat than light.<p>The real reason it can be dangerous to ban speech connected with &quot;terrorism&quot; is the quoted term is so poorly defined as to potentially be almost <i>anything</i> abrasive and unpopular.  I haven&#x27;t seen any cohesive explanation of how the occupation of the Capitol January 6 was <i>terroristic</i> in nature, and yet the event broadly is being criticized as such, exemplifying why high-stakes laws against ill-defined things could have a chilling effect far broader than just those things we all agree should not occur.  Is the line when protesters are unlawfully in a location?  Like the middle of a street?  When they advocate for things that are not currently lawful, e.g., changes in law?  When they are agitated, animated and frighten their neighbors?')
