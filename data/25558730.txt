You assume that government reduces human suffering and that people would be running wild without one. There&#x27;s a lot more to society than government.<p>For example, why would I shoot you? I have no motive to do that regardless of what the laws may be. There is nothing the government has done to make it impossible for someone to shoot you. It&#x27;s just that if some one does and gets caught, they go to prison.<p>On the subject of dissolving the government, you are completely wrong. There is nothing stopping me from non-violently overthrowing the government. The Constitution even states that if the people want to dissolve the government, they can. So I could try to convince people to elect myself and others who would change or even dissolve it.<p>&quot;Also surely with better technology we will be able to transform prisons into rehabilitation centers and thus reduce our countries prison populations and thus become a FREER country, albeit one with less rights?&quot;<p>This is completely nonsensical. Technology isn&#x27;t holding back prison reform - social and political powers are the main drivers. Why would the number of rights be reduced? You&#x27;ve laid out no premise to connect nor support that statement.')
