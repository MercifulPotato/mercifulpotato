I wanted this so that I could easily understand and hack on any component without spending weeks&#x2F;months familiarizing with massive code-bases and waiting for things to compile.<p>I made it for myself, and honestly that&#x27;s all there is to it. I tried to describe the things that make oasis unique in the README, and I think some of those are pretty cool, but I&#x27;m not trying to market this to anyone.
