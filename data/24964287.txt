The list of cameras for which I have added special support are:<p>* Logitech C920<p>* Raspberry Pi Camera<p>* e-Con AR0521<p>* ZED2 Depth camera (in V4L2 mode)<p>In case your camera is not one of the above, APStreamline falls back to requesting an MJPG stream from the camera and then encoding it to H264 that using the x264enc software encoder. The software encoder has good quality but it requires more CPU power.')
