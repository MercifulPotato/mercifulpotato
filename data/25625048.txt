It was an absolutely standard metric to eg geo-fence ads out of a state or two for 3 months to demonstrate the impact of ads.  This isn&#x27;t easily externally visible, but tests like this are standard practice.<p>Particularly in the app install space, which is sketchy as hell once you stop buying from the top handful of vendors, buyers should be auditing by a couple million in annual spend.  To get to $150m without looking hard at big chunks of their spend is just plain arrogance and&#x2F;or incompetence.')
