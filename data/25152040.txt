A MBP 13&quot; with 16GB and 1TB is only $1,899.00. I&#x27;d fall over myself to buy a M2&#x2F;M1Z (whatever they call it) with 32-64GB ram and 1TB ssd for as much as I paid for my last MBP. I honestly couldn&#x27;t be happier that the new 13 MBP doesn&#x27;t fit my needs or I&#x27;d be very tempted to get one. Thankfully now I can wait for the virtualization story to stabilize, wait for more ram, and wait for more external display support (all of which I need).<p>I know that Apple charges a premium for their upgrades but from everything I&#x27;ve seen so far from the new 13&quot; MBP I&#x27;ll be happy to pay that premium this time around. I have always found the comparisons of ram&#x2F;ssd in recent Apple MBP&#x27;s to generic parts to be slightly disingenuous. Raw speeds don&#x27;t really matter as much as how well everything works together in my experience and the new AS computers seem to take that to an even higher level.')
