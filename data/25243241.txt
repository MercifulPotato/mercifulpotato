I&#x27;d say the issue would be 50&#x2F;50 planned&#x2F;unplanned, but I didn&#x27;t always plan appropriately so I got hit more often than scheduled.<p>I did use beeminder for 3-4 months at a time, with great benefit! But looking back at every goal I set, it starts slipping past the 3-4 month mark. I got similar results with other systems (like the Lights spreadsheet from ultraworking or keeping a journal in text files), although without the nice beeminder charts..<p>I&#x27;m not sure, do other people see these patterns with their goals? Are there any tricks for fighting this late slippage?')
