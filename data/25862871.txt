Developing a vaccine for a new strain of the flu is pretty mechanical at this point but each seasonal flu vaccine is really a combination of three different strains that World Health Organization scientists predict will be the dominant strains causing the most damage (it gets reevaluated twice a year). The way that most people take the vaccine (a live but weakened version of the virus) it&#x27;s impractical, even dangerous, to give them all of the strains at once so an educated guess of three strains is our chosen sweet spot.<p>The common cold is an even more extreme version of that process but we haven&#x27;t figured out an economic way of developing rapid vaccine candidates for rhino&#x2F;coronavirus strains like we have for the flu. Moderna&#x27;s RNA method might be a game changer here but it&#x27;ll take a while for their method to be approved as a platform instead of a single drug candidate.')
