They can push a specific version of an app to a specific person. Frankly it is meaningless to rely on Signal on a device like that.<p>The OWS team is small. They don&#x27;t have a social media team like big corps do, tracking social issue engagement, what big accounts have tweeted etc, and it is ridiculous and counter-productive to be going off about it.')
