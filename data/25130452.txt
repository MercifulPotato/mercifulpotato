From Wikipedia,<p>&quot;A Ponzi scheme can maintain the illusion of a sustainable business as long as new investors contribute new funds, and as long as most of the investors do not demand full repayment and still believe in the non-existent assets they are purported to own.&quot;<p>Bitcoin isn&#x27;t a business, it&#x27;s an asset with decentralized production and a distributed ledger. Also, assuming the network isn&#x27;t down (which it never has been to date) you can liquidate in full immediately. The asset exists and maintains ownership on an individual basis, therefore in direct contradiction to a Ponzi scheme.<p>I think you could possibly argue that stocks are Ponzi schemes too by your description. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, it was developed around the 2008 era financial crisis to act as an alternative to US Dollars, in the event that pulling out cash from a bank is no longer a valid option. Public exchanges offer a variety of options to trade BTC to USD, but there wasn&#x27;t really any of that about a decade ago. It seems more like some of tech has absorbed crypto and incorporated, or designed, their products around it. And personally it doesn&#x27;t seem likely that cypherpunks have the highest regard for corporate America.')
