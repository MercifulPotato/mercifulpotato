Everywhere I look there is something to be done. I take a break to piss then see the bathroom is a mess. I go to grab a granola bar and realize I need to take an hour later to go shop at the grocery store, and return to  my workspace hungry and defeated. I spend my days alternating between working on the couch and working on the bed, seemingly constantly doing chores around the clock. The list of things to do never ends, I just decide to put most of it off for the day once I&#x27;m too exhausted to do any more thinking or spend any more time on my feet. I can&#x27;t do any deep work anymore with all the shoehorned zoom meetings I have to show face for. I feel more beat at the end of the day than when I was working 50 hour weeks busting ass as a groundskeeper in the hot humid sun.<p>It&#x27;s suffocating spending 100% of your time in one place. My apartment feels like a submarine at the bottom of the ocean. My productivity is somewhere down there, too. Despite all this, I drag on, just biding my time for that glorious day when I can get inoculated for COVID.')
