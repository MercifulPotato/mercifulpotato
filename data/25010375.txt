Also adopting an attitude of letting it go if my attempts or suggestions are stopped.<p>That latter thing is more difficult as it means efforts to help go to waste sometimes so my first instinct is to insist, but ultimately I tell myself that it&#x27;s the clients&#x27; code and their decision, not mine. Besides, cleaning up code, sometimes by trying different ways to clean it, is always a teachable moment.<p>Fortunately, my current clients have been far more receptive and open to improvements than some other people&#x2F;companies I&#x27;ve worked with before.')
