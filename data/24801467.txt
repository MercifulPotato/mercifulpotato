Showing you exactly what they&#x27;re seeing for support or just sending you some love.<p>Well I&#x27;ve been working on a new video messaging product and have just launched the website widget so your visitors can record their screen &amp; send a video message to you directly on your site. This can be used for product feedback, customer support, authentic video reviews &amp; more.<p>All you need is one line of code and to register your domain name &amp; email so we know who &amp; where to send your messages.<p>You can try it here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zessage.com&#x2F;widget" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zessage.com&#x2F;widget</a> - Click the &quot;Try it Now!&quot; button to see it in action.<p>Instructions:\nStep 1: Go to the link to copy &amp; paste the js code above the closing &lt;&#x2F;body&gt; tag.\nStep 2: Login to Zessage and add your domain &amp; email address to ensure you receive your messages.\nStep 3: Design your own trigger button and set the ID to &#x27;zessage&#x27;. This will overwrite our default button.<p>Technical: The code for the widget is very lightweight and simply listens for a click of the record button. Once clicked, the rest of the code is added and allows your visitors to record the screen with their own video &amp; audio. There is no user tracking or over bloated non-sense to slow your site down.<p>I&#x27;ve also just posted it to Product Hunt: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;zessage-website-video-messages" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;zessage-website-video-mess...</a><p>I&#x27;d love your votes, feedback and thoughts.')
