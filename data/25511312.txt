Item(by='gojomo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608671543, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25509865, text='Agree completely that poster would want the right kind of lawyer – someone who specializes in this kind&#x2F;scale of business, and that reaching out to acquaintances&#x2F;etc who&#x27;ve been in relevant situations may be as valuable or more than legal advice.<p>Agree also that lawyer-billing-on-the-clock gets expensive fast. But unless poster already has a go-to trusted counsel – which seems not to be the case – the mere act of &quot;shopping around&quot; can get 15m-1h of unbilled pre-engagement discussion from a bunch of lawyers. Essentially, poster could type up a 1-2 page brief, in more confidential detail than the post here, and have <i>dozens</i> of short conversations with lawyers (some of which would read the brief 1st) about key issues, tactics, &amp; potential outcomes. The contrasts between what lawyers say, &amp; what they ask about, will be as informative as any one conversation.')
