Or include a YouTube video showing how to setup the light and use the app. I wouldn&#x27;t mind spending $150 on a light, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t buy one based on the two sentence description and the short video you have on the product page. I&#x27;m left wondering...<p>1. Is the app required for setup or can I just plug it in?<p>2. Do I need the app to change modes, or are there any buttons on on the light? Does it even have an on&#x2F;off button or does it need to be unplugged or turned off with the app?<p>3. Does it stand by itself? How thick is it? Can I hang or lean it on the wall? Or is it thick in the middle and I need to hide it in a corner like in your video?<p>4. The front looks clean and simple, but what does the side and back even look like?<p>5. Can I have it display a solid white light if I&#x27;m reading and don&#x27;t want all the changing colors? (I&#x27;m assuming the answer is &quot;Yes&quot; now that I viewed the editor tutorial)<p>6. How bright is it? Like a typical monitor?<p>I can&#x27;t find answers to these questions, any contact information to get those answers, or any photos of the light. I can&#x27;t possibly buy it. On a side note...<p>1. The editor looks really cool. I&#x27;m surprised this isn&#x27;t showcased on the site anywhere, or any examples from the gallery. Once I viewed the editor and some examples, I realized what is actually possible.<p>2. It looks like your site is unfinished. One of the slides on your homepage says, &quot;Introduce customers to your shop with lifestyle imagery and product photography.&quot; I was thinking about that for a while, wondering how this light with only 196 LEDs could display product photography in shop windows. After scratching my head I realized this must be some default Shopify slide, and not something you wrote.<p>Random marketing strategy...<p>YouTube&#x2F;Twitch streamers are obsessed with colorful background lighting. They also love customizing their stream. Get this in the hands of some famous streamers and show them how they can play animations or pixelated versions of their stream logos. They&#x27;ll get lots of viewers asking where the light is from and how they can buy one. Or, setup a referral program so streamers mention it during their stream or in their descriptions.')
