What do people feel about relocating to the EU.<p>Both this question and the question that OP is asking have been on my mind a lot lately. But I don&#x27;t really have much choice in the matter, because of my situation. I was living in the US for 7 years but I had to leave because I did not get the H1B visa. I could have gone to Canada, but right now they are apparently taking upwards of 9 months to process work permits so I got turned down by a lot of FAANG companies. I ended up deciding to move to Europe.<p>This decision has been really hard on me for a number of reasons. Other than the fact that all my friends are there and so are all my professional connections, being a first language English speaker, I think that I would also feel more at home in the US or Canada. Then there is the matter on compensation and opportunity. El the only things I&#x27;ve heard about jobs in the EU is that there are few opportunities and the pay is less. I feel like I&#x27;ve been forced to take a step backwards in my career.')
