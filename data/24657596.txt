Robust profitability, let alone innovation, is very difficult to achieve without monstrous scale.  The majority of recent semiconductor industry gains have come only through consolidation, giving chip suppliers more bargaining power while letting them cut staff.<p>The only area in the semiconductor industry that I&#x27;d consider marginally worth getting into is analog or RF IC design, but that&#x27;s predicated on lots of VC bucks chasing the last scraps of quick-win innovation (mostly in the Bay Area).<p>So even before picking an area to focus on, I&#x27;d take a deep look at your motivation for wanting to get into the chip industry in the first place.  As someone who&#x27;s been in &amp; out of the chip industry a few times, I can tell you that there must be hundreds of other industries that are more lucrative and rewarding than the chip industry, while still giving you whatever it is you&#x27;re seeking.')
