Since I&#x27;m working from home these days without any prospect of that changing, I&#x27;ve decided to get a new M1 Mac mini instead. It&#x27;s actually going to eliminate the need for this Elgato Thunderbolt dock I have, and really the only think I&#x27;ll really miss is TouchID. Some things allow me to use my Apple Watch instead, so that&#x27;ll have to do to.<p>At the end of the day, after four years, I want to be buying a replacement laptop that feels even moderately evolved from what I already have. I have a 12&quot; MacBook that I love, so that will be my on-the-go computer for the times I need that.<p>With the money I&#x27;m saving going with the mini, I&#x27;m upgrading my daughter&#x27;s iPad and still have some left over after that.<p>I&#x27;ll re-evaluate in the future when hopefully Apple puts some more energy into the laptops. I do actually like the TouchBar but I would expect that after four years, they could at least add proper haptic feedback. As well, the USB-C ports only one side (and the wrong side for me) feels like a downgrade from my 2016 model which has two on each side.')
