Item(by='geerlingguy', descendants=None, kids=[24993479, 24990092, 24989521, 24990909], score=None, time=1604500449, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24988917, text='I&#x27;ve been testing out both the 8GB Pi 4 and the new Pi 400 overclocked to 2.2 GHz. For many things, both are perfectly adequate.<p>But the slight bit of missing performance (compared to a $300+ low-end celeron or AMD laptop) becomes apparent when you do things like make a video full screen (takes 3-10 seconds), scroll on a JS-heavy page, or have a number of apps open at the same time and switch between them while one of them is doing some heavy processing.<p>It&#x27;s definitely tolerable and for the price the Pi is a great little computer. Also as soon as I get a few more CMs, I&#x27;m going to run some of my web stuff on them from my home since they&#x27;re silent, power efficient, and adequate now unlike previous generations.<p>But it&#x27;s not necessarily a standard more expensive desktop replacement for the majority of people yet. As it stands today I think this would be a great computer for a family, a kid learning how to type and use a computer, that sort of thing. Additionally, it would be an excellent computer for those who can&#x27;t afford a $300+ laptop but already have a TV or can pick up a $40 monitor off Craigslist.')
