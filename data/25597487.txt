The way GoT was handled should be a good indicator for TV studios that authors who can&#x27;t deliver a complete story can&#x27;t deliver a complete TV series. I already lost clout from my friends for recommending anything written by them when expected sequels haven&#x27;t materialized in almost a decade.<p>On the other hand, Sanderson&#x27;s Stormlight Archives made me actually like the genre again.')
