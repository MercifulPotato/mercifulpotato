It&#x27;s definitely cognitively dissonant to say to someone, &quot;You&#x27;re wrong, let me see your facts... but I don&#x27;t have facts about why you&#x27;re wrong.&quot;<p>I think something to reiterate is that it never goes well when you tell the other person that you disagree with <i>them</i>. A person is not just one idea, they&#x27;re made from thousands... You&#x27;re merely disagreeing with one idea, and that should be made clear when you&#x27;re speaking with them. Regarding the parent comment&#x27;s terminology of &quot;calling bs&quot;, that&#x27;s a bit of a harsh way to put it, or approach it, if you&#x27;re trying to reconcile a difference of opinion over a single idea, and not fundamentally pointing at another person and saying, &quot;You are your one bad idea and I don&#x27;t like either.&quot;')
