It&#x27;s always been technically and administratively possible, you&#x27;re just the first genius to overcome those hurdles. All the combined efforts of thousand developers at a FAANG found it impossible, but against all odds, you succeeded where they failed. Congratulations if that&#x27;s you, but don&#x27;t bet the farm on that being the result before you start.<p>2. Technological developments have only just now made it possible. Maybe your idea requires resource-heavy neural networks on the users&#x27; mobile phone, and current high-end models have just become capable of that. If tech has only now made it possible, you also have to be the first of millions of developers to realize that and get to market. Good luck, this is how most of the startup ecosystem has worked for a long time.<p>3. It&#x27;s currently illegal, and you&#x27;re just going to hope no one stops you. This is a big administrative problem, and maybe all the efforts of a big company couldn&#x27;t change the law and make their idea work when fighting eg. the hotel or taxi lobbies, but if you side-step all that and just do it anyway, well, you might see all your hard work disappear in a courtroom, or you might succeed.')
