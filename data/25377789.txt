And this complication is why patents are weird.<p>Like let&#x27;s look at it. The argument here is that it was funded with public money so the data should be public. As a big OSS person I really like this idea. But who should the data be open to (and <i>what</i> data)? Germany?[0] (the funder) The EU? {North Korea,South Korea,Iran,Vietnam,China,Russia}?(the accused) The world? Public usually refers to the citizens of the country but can also colloquially mean &quot;human.&quot;<p>Then we have to consider money (or resources, capital, whatever you want to call it. Time and effort was spent doing this and there was a loss of resources by some party). Is it fair for company A&#x2F;Country A to spend a year or research time and money and Company B&#x2F;Country B to steal that and make a profit through it because they can sell it for cheaper (i.e. B <i>stole</i> resources from A, that A spent time producing)? Do we know about how it is being produced? Are they vetted? There&#x27;s all kinds of complications here that not only include resource recuperation (i.e. ignoring the capitalism component, which we can&#x27;t because you can&#x27;t just burn resources (capital) indefinitely) but there are also safety concerns.<p>Lots of companies decline to issue patents because they don&#x27;t often protect their production rights. Often what happens is that the company produces a patent and 1) another company uses that knowledge to create something similar but distinct enough or 2) produces the same product in a country that does not respect the former country&#x27;s patents. 1) is basically that student that copied your homework but made things unique enough that they technically weren&#x27;t plagiarizing (but did they cheat?) and 2) is someone who copy pasted your assignment and turned it into a different professor. I don&#x27;t think people feel great about either of these, but slightly better with 1. But you can also see a situation where the cheater turns in the assignment first and <i>you</i> get accused of cheating. The whole process is a mess!<p>Patents are difficult enough when you&#x27;re operating in one country but get way more complex when you introduce other countries into the situation. I do think there needs to be major patent reform and personally I&#x27;d love to live in a world where all scientific advancements are available to anyone, but I&#x27;m not sure such a situation can exist until we advance to a post scarcity world. We&#x27;re all familiar with OSS here and you&#x27;ll always see people saying things like &quot;Facebook is using that person&#x27;s code, they should be a good guy and kick back a few grand for the free work.&quot; That&#x27;s because we don&#x27;t live in a post scarcity world. But in the mean time (until we get there) let&#x27;s not trivialize the situation and try to view things from the situation we&#x27;re in and how to advance things towards the dream situation.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-11-09&#x2F;pfizer-vaccine-s-funding-came-from-berlin-not-washington" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-11-09&#x2F;pfizer-va...</a>')
