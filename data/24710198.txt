I&#x27;m not convinced (and it&#x27;s not just because I&#x27;m a bad programmer, I swear!), I think if you only had good programming, you&#x27;d have very little programming and that would be concentrated of the areas that the powers that be deem most important: military, finance, police, factories.<p>Having bad programming gets you a lot of programming. I&#x27;d rather have a million people who can each build a house a day that will stand reasonably reliable for ten years than having a thousand people that can each build a house a day that will stand for a hundred years.')
