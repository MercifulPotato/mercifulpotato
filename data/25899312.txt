Item(by='andrewzah', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611550088, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25899234, text='The short of it is group chats lose functionality when even 1 non-apple user joins, and apple works hard to make sure you can&#x27;t use imessage on other devices.<p>It&#x27;s so frustrating. I want to like apple and their approach to privacy, but then they do stuff like this that alienates non-apple users.<p>Anyway, imessage is like a caveman compared to messaging apps like Kakaotalk and LINE. Those have more features and I like group chats on them much more than I do on imessage. Not that I had a choice; I don&#x27;t think I ever got my Korean friends&#x27; actual numbers because everyone uses Kakaotalk.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.androidauthority.com&#x2F;green-bubble-phenomenon-1021350&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.androidauthority.com&#x2F;green-bubble-phenomenon-102...</a>')
