If they were allowed to operate as a normal business they would have more revenue than Fedex and UPS. Their free flow cash margins have been positive since 2013. They would be VERY profitable except for legislative meddling.<p>However, they have a number of legislative mandates that suck up their profits.<p>The biggest is that they have to have cash on hand to pay out employee pensions for the next 75 years.<p>Everything that they make goes into a giant pot of money for the retirement fund of workers that haven&#x27;t been born yet. The holdings must be in cash, so they can&#x27;t even invest this giant pot of money. This was a law pushed through by conservatives with the seeming intent to ensure that the USPS is never profitable. It is a mandate that literally no other organization is saddled with.<p>Other legislative blocks to profitability:\nThey ae required to deliver lettermail to every address in the US for the same rate. They don&#x27;t get to set the rates for lettermail.<p>They are prohibited from offering additional services through their branches such as copy and print services.<p>They are prohibited by law from participating in banking and money services except for legacy paper money orders. Online service is strictly prohibited.<p>Besides all that, there is no reason that a service considered vital to the economy has to be profitable. The postal service is one of the few essential government services that is expected to make money for some reason. We don&#x27;t expect the fire department to be revenue positive even though they are allowed to charge basically anything they want for ambulance service.<p>As an anecdata aside: I&#x27;ve lived in a few countries where postal service is less than reliable (don&#x27;t know when the mail will come, deliverability rates are pretty bad.). It is not a desirable state of affairs. I remember my mom having to plan half a day to pay bills. She would have to go to the office, or an approved payment processor for the company and wait in line to make a payment for each bill. Contrast that with dropping a check in the mail. The internet has changed a lot of things since then, but I still see a mail service as required.')
