In matters of right and wrong, I consider myself on an equal footing as anybody else.<p>I&#x27;ve reviewed the reasons the judges have dismissed the cases.  The reasons typically boil down to either:<p>1) Outright dismissal without giving opportunity to provide any evidence,\n2) Dismissal on technical grounds (e.g. standing),\n3) Dismissal from declaring the affidavits hear-say,\n4) Dismissal that grants premise that election laws were not followed but this does not prove fraud<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the legal standards are on what determines an affidavit to be hear-say or not, but they can be submitted to a court as evidence.  Thus far, no judge (as far as I&#x27;m aware) has allowed them to be provided as evidence.<p>Regardless of the legal implications of affidavits and the standards they must meet to be provided as evidence in court, I have seen more than enough (dozens if not hundreds) of testimonies that provide the same consistent general picture: election laws were not followed, and in a significant way.<p>For point #4 above, either the election laws exist for a reason, or they don&#x27;t.  The election laws that prevent fraud were (in my opinion) blatantly ignored, in critical Democrat areas, amounting to hundreds of thousands of votes processed without the required legal oversight.<p>(For the record, wasn&#x27;t me who downvoted.
