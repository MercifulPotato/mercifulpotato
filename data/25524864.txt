I usually donate to causes and pass on goods because I don’t care for the merch (plus want the money to go all the way). EFF is a brand I want to wear. They’re awesome.<p>I first joined their mailing list ~1996(?) when DMCA was being hashed out. I was too young to know if I was on the right side when reading their updates (legalese on a teen was confusing). I hope more people here will open their wallets. EFF are fighting the good fight.')
