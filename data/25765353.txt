Item(by='gsich', descendants=None, kids=[25765777], score=None, time=1610559452, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25763040, text='&gt;I said I don&#x27;t care because &quot;works for me&quot;<p>I know. But then I wonder why you ask the question if you don&#x27;t care about the answers.<p>&gt;and anyways you can configure it to be less annoying<p>which was and is plain wrong. Since it doesn&#x27;t change the textbox behaviour at all. It&#x27;s still all in one box. That makes me wonder if you even use Mumble.<p>&gt;Furthermore I suggested just using another text chat option parallel to Mumble which better suits your needs, because why not?<p>Because running multiple programs is not the solution to this. Say somebody wants to join your Mumble server. Now in order to send text messages, that person also has to join&#x2F;download&#x2F;install another application. While Mumble itself could be sufficient.')
