Item(by='remram', descendants=None, kids=[25993195], score=None, time=1612207525, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25992342, text='Rust is not object-oriented.<p>You can make &quot;virtual method&quot; calls in Rust (dynamic dispatch through a &quot;trait object&quot;, a vtable). This is explicit though, the type will look like `Box&lt;dyn MyInterface&gt;` where Java says `MyInterface` (box = object allocate on heap, dyn = virtual method calls).<p>I think you might be misunderstanding what &quot;static method call&quot; means: in this context, it means a method which is not &quot;virtual&quot; (in C++ parlance), not a method which is &quot;static&quot; (in C++ parlance, e.g. not called on an object).')
