The real way to distinguish mainstream news outlets from less mainstream news outlets is that mainstream outlets have cultivated relationships with administration and intelligence officials, relationships that are maintained by those outlets&#x27; willingness to publish whatever those officials want to publicize.<p>It&#x27;s almost the only criterion. &quot;Mainstream&quot; outlets will have a lot of inside information that will later turn out to be true, but will also constantly publish completely false stories on the behalf of government officials &quot;leaking&quot; as part of their jobs, and conceal their origin.')
