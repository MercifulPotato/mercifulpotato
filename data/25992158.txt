In my DnD group only one person has not switched to Signal and they refuse to. Their answer is that &quot;I can&#x27;t fight them so why switch?&quot; Which weirds me out since this is exactly how you fight tracking. Btw, this is someone who has a PhD in computer science so it isn&#x27;t like they are tech illiterate. But I&#x27;ve seen several people like this and honestly I don&#x27;t understand.<p>I think at this point a lot of people are now apathetic and have given up. And we know people like to double down on good or bad positions when faced with adversaries. Doing things like &quot;switching to Signal&quot; (when you already have most of your friends there) and &quot;using an adblocker&quot; seem like very simple things that easily respond to &quot;what can I do about it?&quot;')
