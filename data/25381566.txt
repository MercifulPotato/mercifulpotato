This explains Theresa May&#x27;s insistence that &quot;No Deal is better than a bad deal&quot; and her unwillingness to compromise with other parties to get a deal done without the votes of the ERG.<p>It became undeniable, though, when suddenly Boris managed to unite his party and pass the Withdrawal Agreement through parliament, without any shouts of &quot;Betrayal!&quot; from the ERG.  The only reason for them holding their tongue was no doubt a promise made to them behind the scenes (perhaps by the master strategist Dominic Cummings) that the agreement was just for show, so that the UK could cross the Rubicon and deliver Brexit, with the apparent safety of a &quot;transition period&quot; to finalise the &quot;oven-ready&quot; deal, but actually with the full intention of, at the last minute, pulling the &quot;bait and switch&quot; to get the No Deal outcome which never would have made it through parliament.')
