Personal debts aren&#x27;t like government debt, they need to be repaid. The interest rates on personal loans and credit cards are high.<p>Being indebted closes off opportunities that are available to people with savings. It enslaves you to your job.<p>Note this has very little to do with being rich or poor. Anybody can spend more than they earn. In fact the poorest need to be most careful because they are the ones most exposed to usurious interest rates.')
