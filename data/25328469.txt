Do it retrospectively, and in contemplative channels, not ones that are already polemic and filled with attention to the failing that caused the original outrage.&quot;</i><p>Violent extremists are often operate under the mistaken belief that they represent the &quot;silent majority&quot;, and that most people secretly agree with what they do.<p>This is one reason that when a political party that tacitly or explicitly approves of extremist violence gets in to power more terrorist acts are committed.  It&#x27;s also why, for example, racists terrorists believe the murders they commit will spark a &quot;race war&quot;.  They believe that most people are secretly racist, and all it&#x27;ll take for such a war to start is for their murders to encourage people&#x27;s secret hatred to come to the surface.<p>To counteract this, it&#x27;s important for the real majority to not be silent, and instead condemn violence, hatred, and terrorism (which includes death threats) in the strongest possible terms.  When terrorists see evidence that the majority actually opposes them it&#x27;ll require a lot more cognitive dissonance on their part to continue to believe that they represent the majority.<p>This is not a panacea, and I don&#x27;t imagine for a moment that it will end all violence, especially as some people will never believe the evidence of their lying eyes, but many people speaking out in public against violence is one of the most effective tools we have for combating violent extremism.')
