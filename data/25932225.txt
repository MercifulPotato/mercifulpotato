I wonder if the idea of &quot;everyone can code&quot; might be root cause of current state. I mean - if after some time you cannot get intermediate CSS skills, then I&#x27;d say that web programming (and maybe any other) is not for you.<p>It was with the boom of Tailwind CSS when I started to see a lot of comments like &quot;OMG this framework is great - CSS was always hard for me, now I can do much more&quot;.')
