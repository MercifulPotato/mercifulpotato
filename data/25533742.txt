Some FreeBSD developers are even considering adding <i>systemd</i> -- or an equivalent -- to their OS (and no, not launchd, which has a few drawbacks and too many Apple-isms to be a general BSD init).<p>And again, since X is virtually abandonware at this point, the remainder of the BSDs will follow suit, especially since most of the open source kms drivers are shared between Linux and *BSD. It&#x27;s really on the compositor maintainers to support the BSD kms back end in their compositor code, though.')
