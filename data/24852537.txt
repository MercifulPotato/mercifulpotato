This can include password managers, because perhaps they prefer it. Also a password manager of all things is something most people will need to use cross platform, not solely on linux.<p>&gt; If it was something unimportant, like a game, ok. But a password manager? The key to all your digital life and secrets...<p>Games being another proprietary closed source application people run on linux. Games still present meaningful risks to your computing and privacy.<p>&gt; And in addition from an American company that will upload your (encrypted) passwords to a cloud in US?<p>AgileBits is a Canadian company.<p>&gt; And in addition, I find it deceptive that they try to confuse the potential users by pretending to be somehow involved or concerned by open source.<p>A company can be involved and concerned with regards to open source without releasing a product that is open source.
