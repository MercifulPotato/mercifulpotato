Item(by='tsimionescu', descendants=None, kids=[25147465, 25147475, 25147783], score=None, time=1605771293, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25146801, text='The problem is that, for many topics, there just isn&#x27;t a reliable source to go to. Sure, if you want information on scientific topics, you have very good options - go to one of the celebrated journals and read some papers, or at least the press releases from those same journals. When it comes to current domestic affairs (has there been massive election fraud in the US? is ANTIFA terrorizing the US?) then the mainstream media is a trustworthy source.<p>However, if you want to know about the effects of NAFTA, or US policy on Venezuela and how useful it is, or Russian involvement in the US elections, or trickle-down economics, or the benefits of a stimulus package etc, then the NYT, the Economist, and Breitbart are about as likely to give you a trust-worthy picture. So where can you look to, as an average citizen without time to conduct your own research on each topic you potentially care about? I don&#x27;t think there is any good answer.<p>Society absolutely needs a new independent, small-scale, un-elitist media. &quot;Factory journals&quot; and such - small organizations that are not owned by any powers that be, where a few people can spend the time to digest other sources and try to come up with a more accurate picture. Not multi-million dollar ad-based industrial media (NYT), and not activist propagandist media (Breitbart) - that is always going to be far too heavily biased to have any hope of being a trust-worthy source of information on most topics that they can feasibly ignore.<p>And in case you don&#x27;t believe me that most US media is a horrible source of information on the outside world, please find one single article on the biggest worker&#x27;s strike in world history, that happened in January of this year in India.<p>Edit: to be clear: I&#x27;m not in any way claiming that Breitbart is a credible news organization to any extent similar to the NYT or Economist. Breitbart are a disgusting organization whose aim is misinformation, and lying comes naturally to them; the NYT and Economist and others like them do have journalistic practices and actually care about the truth, and are excellent sources for some kinds of news - they just have massive biases in certain other areas, especially on foreign and economic policy, where they are not trustworthy, but even then I wouldn&#x27;t expect outright lies.')
