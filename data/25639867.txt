Here are the basic points it made (which I agree with):<p>- Pre-internet, generally speaking the only entities capable of widely spreading facts about private individuals were things you could sue for defamation or libel: newpapers, tv stations etc.<p>- Now Twitter, Facebook and YouTube can spread defamatory information about anyone without paying a similar price.<p>- It&#x27;s true that the services will eventually accede to taking the content down (although in one case, that of a woman murdered on camera, it seemed to have proved difficult&#x2F;impossible to fully do so given all the reposts).<p>- But they let it be put it up there in the first place! Once its up, all the damage to someone&#x27;s life can be done in a day.')
