If the US military loses that ability, it can&#x27;t secure its supply chain, and it will be crippled.<p>The unopposed aircraft carrier caused an anomaly where the US was able to have supply chains of infinite sizes without any issues. If the current threat materializes, then the US Military Doctrine for force projection crumbles.')
