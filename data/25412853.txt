Your comment didn’t really address the concern that sexism at large is effectively causing sexism in the VC industry.<p>If sexism towards female founders in the intended market is a major risk factor (I don’t believe it can be considered major, which is up for debate), then it’s a VCs opportunity to cut through to the core of what makes the _business_ and its _products_ viable... not simply to pass because the market won’t like a female founder as much as a male founder.<p>But then that’s what a VC should be doing anyway. So founder gender and any perception of market bias towards that should become an increasingly insignificant factor in the funding process.')
