Item(by='reportingsjr', descendants=None, kids=[25824244, 25824116, 25824256], score=None, time=1610990370, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25822769, text='&gt;&quot;Robots&quot; are very easily beaten on cost by manual labour unless there is crazy commitment to volumes, long production runs, and having robotisation done very thoroughly.<p>Go find me a reasonably profitable machine shop that doesn&#x27;t have mostly CNC machines. You won&#x27;t find many. Even in places with low cost labor like China CNC machines are pretty ubiquitous outside of fairly specialty shops.<p>You can look on YouTube and see tons of examples of factories that have a mixture of robotic automation and human labor. The production world has changed a ton in the last ten to fifteen years!')
