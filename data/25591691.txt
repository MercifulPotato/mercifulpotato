On December 29th Spotify, an audio-streaming service, aired the first in a series of exclusive podcasts by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. The next day Amazon bought Wondery, a producer of popular podcasts including &#x27;Dirty John&#x27; and &#x27;Dr Death&#x27;, for a sum reportedly in excess of $300m. The tech giant, which got into podcasting only in September, has also signed up expensive stars such as Will Smith and dj Khaled.<p>The deals are the latest in an industry-wide spree. Last year Daniel Ek, Spotify’s boss, declared that &#x27;audio—not just music—would be the future&#x27; of his firm. Since then Spotify has been on a billion-dollar podcasting binge, acquiring production and ad-tech firms such as Gimlet, Anchor and Megaphone, as well as shows; in May it paid $100m for &#x27;The Joe Rogan Experience&#x27;. Apple, the biggest podcast distributor, has bought Scout fm, a podcasting app, and signed up stars like Oprah Winfrey.&quot;')
