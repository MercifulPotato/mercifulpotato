School is not mandatory; education is mandatory. Ask any home schooler. A rare few private schools offer quite different experiences than the typical public school (e.g., the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools). This applies also to &quot;closed confinement&quot; and &quot;control&quot;. Of course, opting out requires enlightened parenting and lots of resources.<p>2. You are constantly <i>told</i> what to do, but outside of some broad physical requirements there&#x27;s really no forcing you to do what you&#x27;re told. Choose some good coding&#x2F;math&#x2F;philosophy puzzles during the evening and work on them instead of paying attention in class. No one can control what you do in your head. You can similarly opt of almost all graded work; especially if you stick to AP courses then the grades you are assigned by the instructor you don&#x27;t much matter anyways.<p>3. You are not given a choice in what your lectures cover, but you can choose what to learn and eschew any required &quot;creativity&quot;&#x2F;&quot;responsibility&quot;.<p>In other words, <i>you can always choose not to play the game</i> and still turn out just fine. Having a friend group that reinforces this option is helpful; I was part of one and today we&#x27;re all very highly paid and well-educated professionals because -- not in spite of -- our complete disengagement from the high school game (including the academic component).<p>To any highschoolers reading this: if you find yourself intellectually dead and generally creeped out by high school culture, consider ignoring your coursework to study for a GED and then simply attending a nearby high school instead of college.<p>However, at least finish your freshman year somewhat engaged. Many aspects of American culture are easier to understand if you know how the vast majority of its citizens are socialized. E.g., many modern political rallies are intentionally choreographed to match the structure and emotional melody of a high school pep rally. Attending a few yourself as an open-minded and non-judgemental exercise in field anthropology will be helpful.')
