I&#x27;ve got a Galaxy S4 here that is bricked with a bootloop, due a software error on the emmc chip. I know this is the case, because someone has done the painstaking work of investigating the bug on the S3, and hacking up a reverse engineered fix. I&#x27;m guessing it would take a week to retrace their steps on my model. Meanwhile if these devices were well documented by the manufacturers, it would be an easy no-solder repair.<p>Given both the complexity and the shoddy engineering of modern software&#x2F;firmware, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the majority of &quot;hardware&quot; problems are similar.')
