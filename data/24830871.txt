Amazing what was unthinkable in the early days and optimism of the net, has been replaced by near dystopia.<p>It seems that New tech has an advantage over the incumbents when<p>1) The early population of users is all experts or hackers of some sort (so diversity of use cases is low)<p>2) the regulators, are in no way or form able to project force, because they simply cannot recruit people as fast as new tech firms.<p>Eventually, the tech firms start hitting various frontiers, either slowing down, or failing and ejecting workers. New classes of workers catch up, and government projects start getting built.<p>Once the Frontier advantages disappear - the extra degrees of freedom new firms enjoyed get captured or shared with other powers, and become common place. Unless you find new degrees of freedom (With market&#x2F;rule disrupting power) are found, the new dominant firms and the old political powers will start acting on each other.<p>This is where we are. The thought of a centralized net is pretty troubling, especially where it will end up as tech develops. It has only been 20 years since 2000 and web 2.0. There are countries which don&#x27;t know that Facebook <i>isn&#x27;t</i> the internet.')
