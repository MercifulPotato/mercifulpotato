Or left wing media. They&#x27;re both terrible. (I pay for my news to try an avoid the nonsense.)<p>I will say this nicely as well, you should re-read my argument to see where the depth lies. I take caution to ask a simple &quot;IF&#x2F;THEN&quot; question that&#x27;s really just a latent criticism of media including social media. The idea that &quot;voter fraud&quot; is some &quot;Trump concocted nefarious scheme&quot; is also rather ridiculous. Voter fraud gets claimed after every election.<p>I hope our new censorship overlords are fair and honest in their censorship.')
