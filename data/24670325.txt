I can&#x27;t judge whether the trick makes sense, though. So the trick was to modify the ds2=c2dt2-dx2-dy2-dz2 equation to exp(a cos(wt))ds2=... That extra exp(...) modulation, when combined with Lorentz transforms, produced some basic QM formula. With more wizardry, the author derived the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. Someone who knows GR well could probably tell if GR has &quot;room&quot; for the exp(...) modulation, i.e. that something in GR doesn&#x27;t fall apart after this addition.')
