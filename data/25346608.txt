For me it was always about the music.<p>These are not incompatible pursuits. In fact, they pair rather nicely.<p>As a kid I was amazed by music on the cheap radio we had. And then when I listened on headphones, it was a whole other world full of details I couldn&#x27;t hear on the cheap radio speaker. And it made me fall in love with music even more.<p>As an adult I spend a few years learning about the gear and making various purchases, even building my own speakers from kits. Did I like tinkering with the gear? Yeah, that was kind of fun, but it was largely a means to an end, which was the music.<p>The unfortunate fact is that music lovers who <i>don&#x27;t</i> think about the gear are getting a crappy version of the music. If you know what you&#x27;re doing, you can get some pretty world-class sound for well under a grand or even a few hundred bucks. If not, you get a Bluetooth speaker for the same amount of money that sounds like garbage and sucks the life out of your music.<p>You can still enjoy music that way! Many do! I sure can! But it&#x27;s like wandering through the Louvre with filthy, smudged glasses. If you really like the art, it&#x27;s worthwhile to clean those things off so you can really see what you&#x27;re looking at.')
