That can easily happen. Reason enough to not push that angle, at least not directly. There are other ways of phrasing that.<p>Besides, for humans, there&#x27;s no longer such a thing as &quot;being adapted&quot; to the environment, at least not in that limited sense. This is not an Earth versus Mars thing, it&#x27;s just a matter of latitude.<p>If natural abilities were such a big factor, we wouldn&#x27;t need clothes in Norway or Canada to survive in those places, in winter. But we do. Plus heating.<p>Humans are not &quot;adapted&quot; to live in all environments on Earth, at least not without tools, which includes clothing. So, if your skin is light and you are in an area with high insolation, cover up more and try to spend less time in the sun. Add some sunscreen too. If the skin is darker, do the opposite.
