I&#x27;ve been remote contracting for years, and accustomed to working in distributed teams both locally and in timezones around the world.<p>Willing to relocate: No. I know when I&#x27;ve got it good!<p>Technologies: The usual web stuff: Node, React, TypeScript, React Native, GraphQL, Postgres, Docker, Linux, AWS etc. However I cut my teeth on statically-typed compiled languages like C++ when I was younger, and I&#x27;m writing Rust on the side. Have worked with Python in the past. Would love the chance to skill up in some system-level work if the opportunity presents itself.<p>Résumé&#x2F;CV: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;richchurcher&#x2F;cv&#x2F;raw&#x2F;master&#x2F;Rich_Churcher_2019_CV.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;richchurcher&#x2F;cv&#x2F;raw&#x2F;master&#x2F;Rich_Churcher_...</a><p>Email: rich.churcher@gmail.com<p>Right now I&#x27;m contracting and writing quite a lot of SQL. I&#x27;m interested in remote opportunities anywhere in the world, either contract or permanent. If you&#x27;re worried about the timezone, it actually ties in rather well with the US (I&#x27;m just a day in the future, so I can tell you how it all turns out).')
