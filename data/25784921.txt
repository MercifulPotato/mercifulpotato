Item(by='southerntofu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610668782, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25783663, text='&gt; environmentalists who unironically wish that humanity would cease to exist<p>Sure these people exist, but they are a tiny minority. This is just a sick form of neo-malthusianism which fails to understand climate change as a symptom of industrial capitalism. Aiming to destroy humanity is the logical conclusion of analyzing our era as &quot;anthropocene&quot;, not &quot;capitalocene&quot;.<p>&gt; I want to (and do) spend money to lessen our impact on the environment<p>Unfortunately, environmental damage cannot be fixed with money. We need to address the root problems causing the damage. Use less resources, build more durable items and reuse them as long as possible, and only employ somewhat-recyclable materials. Planned obsolescence is a crime against nature and humanity.<p>Beyond every day items, urbanization a great factor of environmental damage. Concrete is a huge problem and so-called &quot;developed&quot; countries keep on using more every year, but for what benefit to humanity? There&#x27;s already millions of empty housing units, we don&#x27;t need more buildings: we need social change.<p>&gt; I am doubly uninterested in environmental policy that encourages bad options over much-better-but-still-imperfect options.<p>Agreed, it&#x27;s interesting to explore these imperfect options. But government policies around the globe concerning climate are not &quot;imperfect options&quot;, they&#x27;re actively contributing to the problem by refusing to stop infinite growth, and trying to reconcile greed and common good through green capitalism, the green new deal and what not. Looking at the whole lifecycle of a solar panel (with the current technology), how could someone call them green. Same goes for electric cars.<p>If the industry used less materials, less-harmful materials, and recyclable materials, the situation would be less terrible than it is today. We are currently paying for them to poison us and destroy the land. In most countries rivers are now considered undrinkable according to safety standards. The system is broken.')
