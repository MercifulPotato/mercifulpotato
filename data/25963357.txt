Item(by='filoleg', descendants=None, kids=[25964843], score=None, time=1611958139, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25962189, text='&gt;I think that shitstorm is preferable to allowing brokers to manipulate asset prices to protect themselves.<p>I don&#x27;t think that &quot;biting off the nose to spite the face&quot; is the approach I would prefer when it comes to my money. And, I think, a lot of people would agree with me this.<p>Also, the whole &quot;protect themselves&quot; line sounds like pure outrage without thinking about the actual consequences. If your brokerage doesn&#x27;t &quot;protect itself&quot; and implodes, what do you think is gonna happen to the value of your assets sitting in that brokerage (as well as the assets of everyone else in that brokerage)?')
