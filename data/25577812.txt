Because you asked a question they specifically addressed!<p>The explanation doesn&#x27;t actually address anything:<p>&gt; Democratic ownership can counter act the tendency to grow and absorb competitors, because each new worker who gets a vote waters down the votes and control of their fellows.<p>It&#x27;s like saying no one will want to buy shares of a large conglomerate or vote to have it merge with another one because the shareholder&#x27;s votes will be watered down. Empirically false, happens regularly in practice. Especially when the larger company with less competition could pay higher dividends&#x2F;wages.<p>&gt; Plus the bigger the organization gets, the slower and less responsive it will get.<p>Which doesn&#x27;t really stop it once it merges to a monopoly and has no competitors.<p>&gt; And a democratic organization run by its workers will have a myriad of motivating factors to balance, other than chasing infinite profit or return for the investors.<p>But being a monopoly provides more resources to tackle those other issues, at the expense of the <i>customers</i>, and why do the employees care about them any more than the shareholders would?')
