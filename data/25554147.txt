Often they do not realize that simply being born in the US creates citizenship (many countries do not have birth citizenship). There have been court cases in the US when a family comes to the US on vacation and one of the parents gets arrested for failure to file tax returns - the birth happened in the US and the hospital filed the paperwork and the computers remember.<p>As others have mentioned, it isn&#x27;t just a case of filing IRS paperwork. I know many non-US banks will refuse to do business with someone if they discover the person is a US citizen because the bank paperwork is not worth it.')
