Apple have shown it&#x27;s possible, so - although starting now isn&#x27;t ideal - if Samsung have the wherewithal to do it they absolutely could.<p>More difficult, however, would probably be selling it - I would imagine some HPC clusters would love it, for example, but for consumer products Apple can charge through the roof because their customers are used to paying pretty high prices for (sometimes better, sometimes worse) hardware. Apple&#x27;s vertical integration also means they basically don&#x27;t have to bother building an acceptable ecosystem around their new chipset - there&#x27;s basically no documentation or vTune-style performance tools. It&#x27;s also partly a question of priorities, but AMD still lag behind Intel even after decades in the game.')
