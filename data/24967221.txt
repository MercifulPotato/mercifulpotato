I was planning to spin up the server on a &quot;proper&quot; server machine and just use the Pi as a client (which is the metric I believe you&#x27;re interested in). If public servers are available, I can just spin up two clients on Pis and give it a test calling between the two. I don&#x27;t have many options for USB cameras but I can figure something out. I do have a CSI camera I can test on one Pi though.<p>I&#x27;ve made a note to test this. I&#x27;ll need some time as they&#x27;re mounted in a server rack case I built and will need to be removed and re-installed with a DE to test at my desk.')
