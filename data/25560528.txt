Allowing your supplies to sell board components directly to consumers and third-party repair shops is.  Allowing third parties to move used OEM parts across international bounds without fear of having their property seized for being &quot;counterfeit&quot; is.<p>There is a huge community of independent repair technicians out there who are constantly undermined by the likes of Apple and other major hardware manufacturers.  The manufacturers don&#x27;t even have to &quot;design for repair&quot;.  They just have to <i>allow</i> repair to be an option in the first place.<p>Maybe if repair becames a common alternative again, &quot;design for repair&quot; would actually be considered a competitive advantage.')
