They say as much in their most recent annual report!<p>No, what the ICO does is issue press releases and notices of intent and then either does nothing or backs way the fuck down.<p>Just look at Marriot, BA, or AIQ for examples of the reality of the enforcement issues being nothing like their initial announcements of enforcement.<p>Denham is completely incompetent, and her office simply can&#x27;t get its act together.')
