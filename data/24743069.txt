Julia it&#x27;s 8ms to add up when iterating with eachrow and accessing the column by name.<p>So ~2x faster in Julia? Though it&#x27;s a sort of awkward comparison, since this type of iteration seems a little anti-idiomatic in Python&#x2F;pandas and doesn&#x27;t fully leverage type information in Julia.')
