Curation is needed to avoid redundancy and to ensure factuality.<p>Impartiality is needed in order to not alienate the parties: it undermines respect for the tool if one allows loaded keywords to be put into it. Debaters&#x27; choice of words are often &quot;tainted&quot; by their biases (especially if they believe in what they are defending), and there&#x27;s usually a more neutral way to rephrase something someone said. More generally, though, sometimes the best arguments don&#x27;t always show up at the heat of the moment, but upon offline reflection, or based on careful research.<p>What would be cool is something analogous to the &quot;slowest horse&quot; puzzle (given two people, race them to determine who has the slowest horse - the solution of which is to have them mount their opponent&#x27;s horse), but in a sort of collaborative setting. I.e. people would be teamed up so as to collaboratively come up with the strongest argument against their own beliefs.')
