From a quick look it could still be a useful place to lurk.<p>- The Youtube channels 12tone, Sideways, 8-Bit Music Theory and Nahre Sol are my go-tos now that I&#x27;m no longer in active learning mode. Music Matters, Adam Neely and Signals Music Studio are also good. There are others in the Youtube sphere too but those are the channels I&#x27;m most familiar with.<p>- Music composition videos and classes also tend to be fairly theory-heavy without advertising it overtly.')
