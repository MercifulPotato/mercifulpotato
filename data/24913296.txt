I decided to dig into all the data for fun (&quot;fun&quot;, it was all in json and you had to manually parse the bitch to read it all). There&#x27;s a fuckton (in the scientific sense) of studies that show a really good relation to Vit D deficiency and generally being sick as shit (flu, URIs, sinus infections, gastro problems, etc). While Vit C might be good for recovering, D is what you want to focus on in general disease prevention (a wide gamut at that). Outside of that 60k paper release, there are lots of studies on the mental health of folks regarding low and regular Vit D levels (low Vit D levels lead to more, worse and prolonged depression &amp; anxiety).<p>What I&#x27;ve really taken away from this crazy year, why the hell is there all this research (decades worth, not a handful of years, I&#x27;m talking about roughly 40+ years worth) on good levels of Vit D levels leads to a statically healthy life and this fact is being completely shit on&#x2F;ignored? Perfect? No. But, statistically speaking, you&#x27;re sickly if your Vit D levels are low, regardless of Covid.')
