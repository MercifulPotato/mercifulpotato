Item(by='gnubison', descendants=None, kids=[25851008, 25850559], score=None, time=1611167123, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25849456, text='In vim, most commands take the form &quot;[count] operator [count] motion&quot;.  When you learn a new operator, you can use it with any motion that you know and vice versa; and you can add a count to either.  To give a few examples:<p>- gqip to format (gq) a paragraph (ip).<p>- g?g? to ROT13 a line (doubling the operator makes it operate on the current line — in this case, g?? also works).<p>- y2w to copy (y) the next two words (2w) — this requires you to be at the start of the word, but you could use y2aw if you were in the middle of a word.<p>- dj to delete (d) two lines (j); see &quot;:h linewise&quot;.<p>- dt. to delete (d) until a period (t.), not including the period.<p>- y% to copy (y) until the matching parentheses (%).  If you aren&#x27;t already on one, vim searches until a &quot;(&quot;, which means that you can use this to copy a C-like function call.<p>Additionally, a subset of these operators and motions are available in plain vi, which is available on any POSIX system (Linux, macOS, *BSD, ...)<p>It should be possible to do this with a &quot;regular&quot; type of editor, where you have a keyboard shortcut to, for instance, select to the matching parentheses; there just aren&#x27;t any editors (that I know of) with the same range of motions and operators as vim.<p>Not moving to the arrow keys or using ctrl-, alt- far outweighs the cost of switching between insert and normal mode.')
