Item(by='wgerard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602424540, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24745724, text='&gt; My personal performance of investing in all three categories (total market index, S&amp;P 500 index, NASDAQ-100 index) matches every chart you can find online over last 5 years; the total index funds are carrying the baggage of all that &quot;not S&amp;P&quot; weight and are worse returns than the 500, with the 100 achieving almost twice the performance as the 500 (near 24% returns over 5y).<p>I think you&#x27;re perhaps inadvertently proving my point: If S&amp;P funds are performing significantly better than total market funds, either there&#x27;s something particularly special about S&amp;P companies (very valid reasoning, it&#x27;s not a random assortment) or S&amp;P companies are overvalued simply because they&#x27;re part of the S&amp;P and investors value that more than perhaps the fundamentals would support (not a completely asinine thought).')
