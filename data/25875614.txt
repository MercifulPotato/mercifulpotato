I just left the PE that bought my firm and am unemployed for the first time in 20 years. Wife is freaking because loss of income is detrimental to the house we&#x27;re currently trying to buy and just scary to her.<p>Building great things from the ground up with great people is where my passion lies. I&#x27;m not really the guy to get a job with one foot out the door or do 2 things halfways - and I know ultimately living my time passionately will win out. I guess I&#x27;m just saying that I understand where you&#x27;re at, from an inverted perspective.<p>It&#x27;s an exhausting life at times but feels well lived.')
