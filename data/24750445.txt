Their traders and algo systems decide on the trades to make, communicate them all to the POPs where they&#x27;re held behind a release gate, then the POPs do a global drop of the gate based on gps&#x2F;atomic time synchronization. It becomes impossible for any external system to get a latency arb advantage. An arbitrary number of exchanges could implement the same sort of ingress&#x2F;egress system.')
