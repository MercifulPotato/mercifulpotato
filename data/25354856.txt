I’ve been past 40m, but on air you’re not staying there very long (let alone 50m). And if I remember my nitrox training correctly, on EAN 35 you want to stay at 30ish meters or shallower.<p>My insurance through DAN also only covers me for up to 30m. Most of the colourful corals and fish that you see on TV, typically at shallower depths anyway.<p>Past 30m you definitely need further qualifications and more gear if you want to hang out at those depths.')
