So this is one of those things where a difference of degree becomes a difference of kind. I don&#x27;t think this is going to end well.<p>[edit] - as an nuclear engineer - that study you cited reminds me of perturbation theory.  You make a small tweak to the system and develop a model to fit how such small changes affect the larger system.  But perturbation theory conclusions don&#x27;t scale accurately up to &quot;large&quot; perturbations.  If you pull the control rods a tiny bit in a subcritical reactor - you get higher neutron-multiplication factor for your existing&#x2F;present neutron sources.  So you might think that if you pull the rods 10 times as far, you get 10 times the multiplication - but you&#x27;d be wrong.  If you pull them 10 times as far you go super critical and then you get like 1,000,000,000 times as much multiplication.')
