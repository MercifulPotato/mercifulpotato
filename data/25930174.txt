No idea how this will pan out, but personally I feel so much better already.

I&#x27;m also in a country that is not so steeped in technology, and thus not as far down the path of general life becoming dependnet on it.<p>Just think about that - you denpend on big tech for the very media through which you perform the majority of interactions with your &quot;friends&quot;.')
