The screen-to-body ratio is amazing. And the 4k screen is beautiful, the build is attractive, thermals are good and the speakers are nice as well. (From an Apple perspective these are the things that others often get wrong)<p>It has some design flaws („hybrid power“) but what is really messed up is the QC:\nI have ProSupport and already had 4 technicians over and am currently awaiting my third full replacement.<p>Issues are all over the place: faulty trackpad, extreme coil whine, broken display, etc.\nPerfect device for me if they could figure out their QC. \nIf the next one is bot perfect, I am getting a G14 which is the best performance&#x2F;watt, performance&#x2F;notebook volume and one of the best performing notebooks in general.')
