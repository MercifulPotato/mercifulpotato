Once you push the problem to the client a lot of them already know how to do it and by not doing two scaling steps you can make much better decisions. And you don&#x27;t need coordinates as floating point at all. What you need to do is tell the app &quot;you have a 150x150 window on which to display content at 1.33x scale, just give me back a buffer with those properties&quot;. Wayland can work at integer coordinates all the way. The app also draws at integer coordinates it just uses the scaling factor to know what to do. It can even just replicate the 2x and then scale down solution if it doesn&#x27;t know how to do anything better but plenty of code does know how to do something better and much faster. Browsers, image viewers, 3D renderers, PDF viewers, are all natively able to scale arbitrarily and yet are forced by wayland to draw at 2x and be scaled down.')
