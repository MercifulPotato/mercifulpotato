Most hospitals cannot even tell you a &quot;cash&quot; price until you really push. My whole point is that it is all so expensive BECAUSE of insurance. If insurance was not involved in preventive care for example, all hospitals and doctors would have to compete on cash price and that would lower the out of pocket costs significantly. I bet less people will need to got ER because now they don&#x27;t need to pay $10,000 for a doctor visit.')
