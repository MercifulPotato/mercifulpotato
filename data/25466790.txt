They are very inefficient at navigating between files... Use the file switcher (Cmd+E on Mac) to switch between recent files, or type search (Cmd+O on Mac, followed by initial letters of the words, e.g. to find FooBarClass type &#x27;fbc&#x27;) for anything else... and disable tabs in preferences.<p>Another good one is to use `Cmd+Shift+A` to search by action (e.g. Cmd+shift+A &gt; &quot;show bytecode&quot;)... with time you either start remembering the shortcut which is shown when you select the action, or you just get used to searching it this way which takes  just a second anyway. One more hint: navigate between implementation&#x2F;definition using Cmd+B on Mac (don&#x27;t remember the Windows&#x2F;Linux shortcut) which alternates between the two things, so you can go back and forward using just that! Talking about moving back&#x2F;forwards, on Mac, use Cmd+[ to go back to previous lines you were editing, and Cmd+] to go forwards again (very handy to look back at what you had been doing before then moving back where you stopped).... oh, there&#x27;s so much more... just watch some videos on YouTube and practice the hints you like the most.')
