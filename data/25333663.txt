Beyond a certain size (lines of code, length of time, number of people, etc) semantic markup starts to pay off.  But if you&#x27;re just trying to put together a prototype as quickly as possible, these kinds of frameworks usually speed things up because you don&#x27;t have to think about proper semantic organization.  I&#x27;ve worked on multiple projects where something off-the-shelf like this was the way we started, then at some point as the team grew we re-organized the CSS to be semantically defined.  Yes, there is some amount of waste, but this pattern tends to optimize for the things that you need to optimize for in the moment.  No sense spending time to carefully design your semantic abstractions until you know the project is going to be a large enough scale to make it worthwhile.')
