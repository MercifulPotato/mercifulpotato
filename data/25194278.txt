Unless one of her direct reports decides to turn against her and testify there will be no evidence that she ever directly communicated the monetary requirements to get a permit.  Prior to this it has largely been indirect evidence used to probe CCW issuance, looking at the correlation of donations to permits being issued and non-donors getting denied permits.  Sheriffs have even quashed that in that many won&#x27;t readily give out  or accept the paperwork to apply for a permit so there is never a record of a denial that is subject to sunshine laws.  If you keep it verbal, there is no evidence if no one will testify.')
