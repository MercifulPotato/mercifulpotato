I haven&#x27;t tried Zig, but it&#x27;s still pretty early in its history. That means a lot of syntax change, similar to Rust which is settling down, or Swift. Nim&#x27;s been around long enough that it&#x27;s settled it&#x27;s syntax a while back.<p>Before I started really digging into Nim, it seemed like it was always changing the language a lot (feature churn). However, most of those changes have been compiler support for different GC&#x27;s and other backend languages, which don&#x27;t generally break existing code. I&#x27;ve tried Nim code from 4 years ago, and its almost the exact same syntax. Sometimes stdlib names changed. I think syntax change is the part that gets people a lot in terms of daily &quot;complexity&quot;.<p>It actually reminds me of the feel of Python 2, before Python 3 that seems to add new syntax &amp; language complexity every release. Well Python 2 but with a more solid language theory (e.g. everything can be a statement, etc). The trickiest part of day to day Nim are: var vs no-var, object vs ref object, and some iterator annoyances.')
