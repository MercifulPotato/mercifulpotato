I started Crossminds.ai at the beginning of the pandemic to help CS researchers and engineers better navigate the complex research landscape and learn the most relevant work efficiently in a distanced world.<p>Crossminds has hosted 5000+ videos of top AI conference talks (CVPR, ECCV, ICML, NeurIPS, ECCV, etc.) and other tech research updates. Our team has developed a comprehensive knowledge graph to index the videos and provide personalized recommendations. We’ve also created a time-stamped reaction feature that allows peer discussion about specific parts of the videos.<p>I would really appreciate if you can give it try and share your feedback!')
