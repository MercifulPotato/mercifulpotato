Item(by='AmericanChopper', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601969490, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24695330, text='&gt; I’m only suggesting a captive audience as in “those browsing to buy on Apple.com what is compatible with their iPhone&#x2F;iPad&#x2F;Mac&#x2F;etc.”<p>This is even more outright ridiculous than your last claim. Nobody is help captive at the Apple store. If you&#x27;re browsing apple.com for a product, your captivity ends buy opening the website of any other online retailer. Yet, you somehow manage to go further into some insane rabbit hole by suggesting that because a few 3rd products were dropped by the online Apple store, that this is a signal that Apple is start dropping support for 3rd party peripherals? When people say that HN just automatically hates anything Apple does, this is exactly what they&#x27;re talking about. There&#x27;s no rationale to a comment like this, it literally just comes off as deranged.<p>Apple often does make &quot;the best&quot; accessories for it&#x27;s own devices, but it doesn&#x27;t always, and the 3rd party ones work just as well. My Sony headphones work just as well with my iPhone as my Beats ones do. Apple doesn&#x27;t even make the best mouse for Macbooks or iPads. Logitech does. There is not a single ounce of reality in anything you just said.')
