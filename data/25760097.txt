Real estate is subject to the same laws of supply and demand as everything else. The only way to make housing more affordable is to increase the supply. In certain highly desirable areas, it is always going to be difficult to increase the supply enough. Generally speaking, however, more housing = cheaper housing. (Expanding rapid public transportation can also help by giving workers quick access to larger regions, and more housing options.)<p>EDIT: Thanks to all for the good comments. I want to stress that I understand &quot;just build more&quot; (by which I really mean increase supply however you accomplish it) is often not a simple answer, but it is the ONLY strategy that has a hope of working to make housing more affordable.')
