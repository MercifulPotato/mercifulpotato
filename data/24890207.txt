When I go out, I have an older one that I&#x27;m happy to use away from my desk. Since it&#x27;s acting like a desktop now, I though maybe I&#x27;d replace it with a higher-spec mac desktop. But a high end mac mini isn&#x27;t much different than a high-end MacBook.<p>It seems if you want a high-performance mac but don&#x27;t want to spend 6k+ on a mac pro, a specced-out 16&quot; MacBook is the best choice. Is that correct?')
