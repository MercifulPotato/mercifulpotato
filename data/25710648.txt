I have forgotten all the names, but someone named &quot;Milo&quot; seems relevant, and wasn&#x27;t Alex Jones also banned from somewhere and lost a lot of influence since?<p>And those are the cases where bans would tend to fail, i. e. people that had years to grow a loyal fan base, collect names &amp; emails, etc. If it works in those cases, it should be extremely powerful when being used a bit more proactive. Anybody watching &#x2F;r&#x2F;thed... would have known it&#x27;s toxic two weeks in, before it had time to spiral entirely out of control.')
