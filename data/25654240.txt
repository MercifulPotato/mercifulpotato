It goes like this:<p>I ask my kids to say a number, and then I do something to that number and tell them the answer.<p>Their job is to figure out the calculation I do.<p>Examples:<p>- I add a number: they say 3, I say 8. They say 11, I say 16<p>- I multiply a number.<p>- I multiply by something and add something else.<p>- etc<p>If you want to drive them nuts you can count the letters of the number, i.e. four = f o u r = 4, five = f i v e = also 4, ten = t e n = 3 etc :-D<p>(I might have gotten the idea from HN, but the above is how I taught it.)')
