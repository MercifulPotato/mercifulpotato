Not unusual.<p>It&#x27;s not unusual and that&#x27;s the problem.  The process is a huge distraction to the developers and produces a great deal of undue stress if T2 is just going to override it.<p>Perhaps T1 should not have the authority to remove, ban, etc.  They can approve all day long but rejections are escalated to T2, at which point T1 must justify the escalation and perhaps allow the developers to respond if T2 finds the escalation warranted.<p>Even if this Amphetamine App were found to violate ToS and need to be removed or modified, there was no urgency.  It wasn&#x27;t driving droves of people to Meth addiction.')
