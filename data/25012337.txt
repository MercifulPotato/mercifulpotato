Item(by='wahern', descendants=None, kids=[25016657, 25012393], score=None, time=1604708356, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25012141, text='If negotiating costs with the arbitrator could, per se, constitute cognizable collusion I don&#x27;t think arbitration would be a thing. It is a thing. Therefore we&#x27;re stuck with the system.<p>What really needs to happen is for Congress to legislatively overturn conservative justices&#x27; belated, radical reinterpretation of the Federal Arbitration Act, effectively preempting traditional state law-based policies that reign in unfair arbitration practices. But anti-trial lawyer propaganda has permeated deep into the American psyche, including among Democrats. Legislation that could be spun as empowering trial lawyers has become something of a third rail in American politics, especially at the national level. The alternative to fixing the FAA is to do like Civil Law countries and create more regulatory bodies, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. But 1) both conservative legislators and judges make it their hobby to cripple those agencies; and 2) I, for one, would prefer going back to a regime that permits more private actions because, at least in modern American politics, a centralized consumer protection process is politically impractical even without the disingenuous and baldly partisan efforts of politicians and judges.<p>The problem with regulatory agencies is that to be effective they have to stick their nose into everybody&#x27;s business <i>preemptively</i>. That&#x27;s not a good fit for American-style enterprise and politics. The nice thing about civil suits is that, at least in principle, they can only happen when someone has <i>actually</i> been wronged and suffered <i>actual</i> losses. Which means companies can move fast &amp; break things, so long as they&#x27;re prepared to pay for any damages.')
