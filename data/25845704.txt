Item(by='staplor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611146315, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25844439, text='&gt; The argument to allow second user sales of computer games is that it drives first user sales.<p>Digital games have their own benefits — sales. If games can be resold, one person may buy a game and then sell it to another person. With non resealable games, both of the people in the above example would buy the game later in a sale. Sales are one of the best uses of price discrimination; practically everyone gets to play a game eventually if they want to, but those who especially want to can pay more.<p>&gt; So, Netflix should only allow one person to watch the screen at a time, and everyone in the room watching the tv show needs to purchase an account, or maybe a pay-per-view watch?<p>I don’t see how my statement implies this. Single use tickets and subscriptions services are different things.')
