They provided tax credits for the incremental progress Amazon made on the terms of the subsidy. So the state was not paying up front and then at risk of being left in the red if Amazon were to change plans. It&#x27;s up to the government to design an airtight subsidy structure that protects their interests - but it can be done.')
