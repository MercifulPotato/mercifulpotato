It was relaxed, or rather reverted, in September 2010. The latter version of the agreement actually allowed limited support for running scripts on-device.<p>&gt; There was certainly more pettines there than &quot;Steve didn&#x27;t think Flash was performant enough.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s important to distinguish between Apple not wishing for Adobe to create a meta-platform atop UIKit (which started just prior to the release iOS 4, roughly the start of 2010) and not bundling or allowing the Flash plugin (since day one, mid-2007). Thoughts on Flash reflected criticism received against Apple for that three year run.<p>It wasn&#x27;t performant in 2007. It wasn&#x27;t performant in 2008. It wasn&#x27;t performant in 2009. It wasn&#x27;t performant in 2010. It certainly wasn&#x27;t performant in 2011 when Adobe killed it for Android.<p>It&#x27;s not that anybody, let alone Steve Jobs, <i>thought</i> it wasn&#x27;t performant enough; it <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> performant enough.
