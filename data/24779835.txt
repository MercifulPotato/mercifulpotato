Item(by='toast0', descendants=None, kids=[24780578], score=None, time=1602699883, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24779621, text='The most straightforward way to handle adaptive audio&#x2F;video quality in a multipoint video call is to send the highest quality the sender can to the server, and have the server transcode that to participants in varying qualities.<p>If it&#x27;s E2E, the server can&#x27;t transcode the stream. Realistic options are the sender sending multiple quality streams and the server picking the right one for each receiver, or sending to the server at the quality of the least capable receiver.<p>There&#x27;s a concept of bitrate peeling, which would be great for this --- send the highest quality to the server, and the server sends a truncated stream to receivers with poor bandwidth etc. The transport stream would have to be designed so that the truncation points are known to the server, and that the receiver can verify integrity at any chosen truncation point. There&#x27;s the real problem that this isn&#x27;t a productionized concept; AFAIK, it&#x27;s only an expiremental feature in Vorbis, and in that case, quality at a given bitrate is inferior when truncating to that bitrate vs directly encoding at that bitrate.')
