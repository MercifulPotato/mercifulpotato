My workflow is exactly the same, and I’d love to be able to write code in a high-level language like Python and then use that directly instead of having to rewrite.<p>However, in my case the reason for rewriting isn’t just performance, but also to be able to build compiled binaries. Julia aims to be as high-level as Python but faster - is there a language that’s as high-level as Python but AOT-compiled?')
