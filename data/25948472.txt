Elastic has always bemoaned being open source, so everyone should have seen that coming. And CentOS died when they were bought by RHEL. Anyone who put their weight into these programs after those red flags went up were taking a risk.<p>And that&#x27;s exactly why OSS is not cracking. Not even close. So CentOS and Elastic aren&#x27;t open source anymore. Who cares. &quot;But my workflow! How will I do xxx or yyy now?&quot;<p>Do what you did before CentOS and Elastic. Find an open source alternative. If there aren&#x27;t any and it&#x27;s important enough make your own. The world will go on people.<p>Just like Gitlab jacking the price. They want you to assume that your choices are to either pay more or go without source control. It&#x27;s up to you to be smart enough to say &quot;I&#x27;ll just find another source management solution that fits my budget.&quot;')
