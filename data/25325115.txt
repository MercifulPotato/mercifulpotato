It has a precise meaning, which is that <i>as demand continues to increase</i>, supply decreases sharply and suddenly, with very little or almost no warning at all. Price explodes by several multiples more-or-less overnight. Demand hasn&#x27;t increased, it&#x27;s decreased. Supply hasn&#x27;t decreased sharply. Neither condition was met.<p>&quot;We don&#x27;t need as much oil anymore because of a worldwide pandemic&quot; is certainly an interesting development but we don&#x27;t just get to call it &quot;peak oil&quot; so that people who were wrong 15 years ago can suddenly feel vindicated.')
