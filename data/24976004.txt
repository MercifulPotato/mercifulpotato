You don&#x27;t save the PVT output of the receiver on the vehicle. (I mean, you could save that too, I guess.) You save the raw observables, and post-process along with data gathered at the same time by stationary reference stations. (Either run your own base, or use data from networks like unavco.)<p>This gives you a remarkably precise picture of the vehicle&#x27;s position, motion, and acceleration, in 3 dimensions, throughout the entire run. If they want to be transparent about it, they&#x27;ll publish a multiconstellation RINEX file of the whole shebang, so anyone can analyze it themselves. There might be fewer internet sleuths who know how to sling rtklib or gpstk than youtube-dl and audacity, but the ones who can, will produce a wealth of data.<p>For bonus points, put two receivers on the car, a few feet apart. This allows moving-baseline so you also get an orientation solution.<p>1: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;rtklib.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;rtklib.com&#x2F;</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;sgl-ut&#x2F;GPSTk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;sgl-ut&#x2F;GPSTk</a>')
