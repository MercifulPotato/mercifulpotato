Online chess has cut into the time I used to spend reading and playing music, but I&#x27;m an amateur at all those things. Plus, I&#x27;ve started playing more with my kids in the evening. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get back over to music and the &quot;long novels I need to read&quot; project eventually, and no real harm.<p>Brief infatuations can have a lasting tail, and I hope that&#x27;s what happens here, for chess, which really is a phenomenal game. Kind of like archery and &quot;the hunger games&quot;, the initial bump isn&#x27;t sustainable, but there may very well be a lasting increase in interest.')
