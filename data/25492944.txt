YMMV.<p>This looks like the same type of Gold Rush that happened 20 years ago in the dot.com boom&#x2F;bust.  Same advice I learned the hard way applies today as I wish I&#x27;d learned it then - &quot;when there&#x27;s a gold rush, go sell shovels.&quot;  Or in this case, as a technologist, sell topographical survey info you&#x27;ve collected, gold panning tutorials, fully outfitted claim excursions (you get the idea) - ANY knowledge you have about HOW to do what people THINK they need to do to find gold.  Don&#x27;t take equity, take cash today.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if they get rich or not, YOU make sure you get paid FIRST and be clear that if they don&#x27;t want to pay for your services, their competitors certainly will.<p>To continue to abuse the analogy, to the business person we technologists are now and have always been &quot;resources&quot; to be used as a means to an end.  You think they want to give their &quot;pack mules and shovels&quot; a cut of the gold?  Unless you have some business domain knowledge, you&#x27;ll never get an equal seat at the table.  9 times out of 10, if you DO have some business knowledge, you can probably make more money by going off to become a direct competitor.  Or, better yet, gain some knowledge of the field and work with a competitor who has a better vision.<p>I&#x27;ve been inside 4 start-ups in various stages, and one post-IPO company that included stock options over the past 20 years.  Only the dot.com era company ever amounted to anything, and that was dumb luck WRT having an IPO when people would force money on you for doing eAnything(TM).<p>I follow one primary rule when taking a job: you&#x27;re either there to earn, or you&#x27;re there to learn.  It you&#x27;re humble enough and not an idiot, you realize that there&#x27;s a number of things to &quot;learn&quot; at any point in your career between different industries, different career paths, and different levels of position.  If you think you&#x27;re &quot;too good&quot; to do some job, you may be right but you may also just be an asshole.')
