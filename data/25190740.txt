That is a conceptually neat solution to the problem, but since it&#x27;s a somewhat strange thing to want to do, we can&#x27;t do it in our case. Storing the extended values is something I also considered, but there are tens or hundreds of billions of them in production. Couldn&#x27;t really ask for an extra PB of space for the relatively small performance and elegance benefit you get from not copying these things.')
