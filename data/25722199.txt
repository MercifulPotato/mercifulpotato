Item(by='OJFord', descendants=None, kids=[25727943], score=None, time=1610324501, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25717736, text='Yes it is, it&#x27;s marketed as &#x27;pyrolytic&#x27;, it&#x27;s the norm above roughly Â£350 and unusual roughly below.<p>But yes, it is just an element that can go hotter and a shell that can withstand it. Ovens are incredibly overpriced for how rudimentary they are IMO. Ripe for &#x27;disruption&#x27; if you had something non-bullshit to compete on but price - sizing is already standardised.')
