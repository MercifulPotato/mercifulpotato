I have a goto mount telescope, and I&#x27;ve used this software: (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;heavenscape.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;heavenscape.com</a>) to track the space station with the telescope.  It&#x27;s a little tricky, and you don&#x27;t have too much time to realign the mount etc if something is wrong, given that the ISS passes usually only last a few minutes, but I did manage to get it to work after a couple of tries.  If I had to do it again I&#x27;d practice with other random satellites first.<p>What I&#x27;ve been thinking about is coaxially mounting an antenna and using the telescope mount as an antenna mount.  The only problem is that you do need a telescope on the mount to shoot some alignment stars, so you can&#x27;t just mount the antenna, and I don&#x27;t know how much the metal in the telescope would interfere with the antenna.')
