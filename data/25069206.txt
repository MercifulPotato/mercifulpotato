It&#x27;s been rock solid, unlike every machine I have ever built from scratch that always had weird issues (most not occurring with any regularity, but annoying enough when they occured).<p>even if one can save a few pennies by building a server like this themselves, I&#x27;d always strongly recommend they go with a similarly specced off lease server.')
