Came from a state with open carry&#x2F;no license needed.<p>I found CA’s laws to be quite reasonable; I was told all variety of stories about guns being taken from my home when I told people I was moving out. Weird stuff.<p>I think CA is highly demonized and I don’t really get it, even as someone originally from a very conservative (and also evangelical Christian) background&#x2F;area.<p>I actually live in a very ethnically diverse area that’s about 50&#x2F;50 red and blue, and right near the ocean in SoCal. Love the diversity in this state!')
