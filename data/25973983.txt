Item(by='Gibbon1', descendants=None, kids=[25974474], score=None, time=1612048328, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25973864, text='&gt; designed for planned obsolescence after 5-7 years<p>The big three tried that in the 1970&#x27;s.<p>I have a thoery why it doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s because resale value matters. Price out how much people are willing to pay for a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter. Now look at the price of a used sprinter with a 150k miles on it vs a random Ford or Dodge van. It&#x27;s about $20k vs under $10k<p>Companies that play the planned obsolesce game with EV&#x27;s are going to find themselves in a quality vs price corner coffin. Because customers rightly perceive the companies cars as shoddy. The company can&#x27;t charge enough to build quality cars. They get stuck just the way GM did 40 years ago. And is still stuck today.')
