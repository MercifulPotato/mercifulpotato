For something that is library, or the thing which usually used by technical users, I generally have good experience with those, because I can get good bug report and quality PR.<p>In contrast, I also have some projects that can be used by nonprogrammers. I didn&#x27;t have a good experience dealing with issues in these projects. It is usually just &quot;not working&quot;, bad questions or some feature requests for their use case, so it is rare to have good bug report or quality PR. \nExamples: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;maple3142&#x2F;aria2c-ariang" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;maple3142&#x2F;aria2c-ariang</a> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;maple3142&#x2F;GDIndex" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;maple3142&#x2F;GDIndex</a>')
