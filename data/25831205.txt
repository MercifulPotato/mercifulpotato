It&#x27;s hard to take any of the rest of your recommendations seriously when they start with Today.<p>Certainly there are other BBC programs that are better, and a small number that are very good, but at this point I honestly don&#x27;t think they are enough to make up for how awful BBC News is and how much damage it&#x27;s doing to UK society. In the past I would have made excuses for the regressive way the BBC is funded, but it&#x27;s really hard to do that now.')
