What they probably should have done was have python 2 code somehow declare itself as python 2 (Racket does this with #lang at the top of files). Then, just have a python 2 compatibility layer that works in two steps. First step is to compile&#x2F;parse it into a similar form as python 3. Additionally, provide a small python 2 runtime which provides different versions of the functions which changed from 2 to 3. I think the two steps are important because some stuff is easier to solve via compilation like &quot;print&quot; while other stuff may be only possible at runtime like strings being unicode.<p>You would still have some differences which can&#x27;t be papered over, but it would have made writing code that works in both python 2 and 3 much easier.')
