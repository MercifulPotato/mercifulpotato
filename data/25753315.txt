It is supposed that the Phoenician pronunciation was simplified so much because it was used as a lingua franca for commerce, by many people.<p>This reduction in the number of consonants created later problems for other Semitic people, e.g. Hebrews and Arabs, who still pronounced distinctly some of the consonants that were deleted from the Phoenician alphabet, so they had to invent diacritics to mark the missing consonants (e.g. shin and sin in Hebrew).')
