Our society relies on centralized server farms run by huge states and corporations and we see the result. Suddenly people care about Big Tech because of Parler and WhatsApp but these are just two blips in a long line of consequences of living in a Feudal society.<p>WeChat for example is used every day in China and has replaced cash for millions of businesses, and now you have a centralized social credit system, controlled by the Party, and anyone can be blocked at any time, as can those who associate with them. And the digital dollar is coming soon to your neighborhood, which means one account at the central bank, and yes most people will sign up. Meanwhile you’re sitting around saying 10 transactions a second is good enough... this is how the centralized state and corporation wins. When cypherpunks do nothing.<p>Enjoy living in a world where Facebook and Amazon and your Federal government OWN your identity, data, transactions and let you live as a digital serf under strict supervision.<p>But yeah, it’s all about “shilling my coin” LOL')
