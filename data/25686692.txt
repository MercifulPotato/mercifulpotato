When you see the approval rating is in the lows 30s, abut approval rates are in the 90s, something is definitely wrong as in need of a massive correction.<p>Andrew Yang found this out the hard way and his lobbying efforts in Washington to help get the 2nd stimulus checks approved can be pretty much summed up as congress was oblivious that the People needed further financial assistance. That is how far detached they are from reality, I think this recent stunt pulled in the capital by blind ideologues served as a warning to how fast things can devolve.<p>The US experiment showed great promise and had amazing prospects for a desirable model that Human Civilization could aspire and achieve, but much like its predecessor (Rome) it too decayed into oblivion due to the inherit and predictable fact that power corrupts. Human&#x27;s cannot to be trusted with such power and to believe otherwise is to fall back on to this absurd notion of a chiefton caste system, that really on serves the upper tier of Society and creates a poorly incentivized system that ensures by the time you&#x27;re even a possible candidate you&#x27;re already so marred by the corruption you&#x27;re just as bad as you what you wanted to change.<p>I really do want things to get better, not just in the US, but on the entire Earth as we have such a limited window of opportunity to live up to our potential as Species; but so long as we abide by these whimsical make-believe popularity contests--with people we frankly couldn&#x27;t or wouldn&#x27;t leave our pets under even the most dire circumstance--who then in turn act as the arbiters of everything aspect in Life that matters and use the pubic purse for personal largess we will always succumb to the same result.<p>Software engineers at FAANG really should be working on a protocol of governance that automates all the decision making congress could and would do with it&#x27;s priority on rolling out a proper beta in the next 5 years, that could actually be suitable challenge for them to redeem their squandering talents and skills instead building this horrible panopitcon.<p>Remember, those rabid Q-anon&#x2F;conspiracy guys are just as much your fault as they are Trumps&#x2F;Fox news when you look at what most of you people do everyday. And it isn&#x27;t until they do something as stupid as they did this week that it becomes obvious to those who did it.<p>But, hey: it&#x27;s just money, right?')
