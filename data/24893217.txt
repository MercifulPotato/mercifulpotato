You can’t read the whole thing in 5 minutes, but you can read the three figures and their captions, which say a lot, and it’s open access, peer reviewed and recent. Maybe your point is that the Earth system is too complicated to explain in 5 minutes, and that’s fair enough, but I do think the climate change policy debate would be a little more sensible if you were expected to spend at least 5 minutes reading this kind of literature before participating.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;115&#x2F;33&#x2F;8252" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;115&#x2F;33&#x2F;8252</a>')
