I said that they can see 15 moves in advance when they spend weeks (or even years) before the game preparing their openings.  It isn&#x27;t unheard of for players at the &gt;2000 level to pull out a planned novility 15-20 moves into a game - a position never before reached in chess that they prepared for one specific opponent in a tournament.')
