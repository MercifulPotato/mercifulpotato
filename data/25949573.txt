When the bubble invariably bursts, they will be left penniless. We will see people making actual, huge losses that they very much care about.</i><p>You&#x27;re not wrong, but how is GME different that any other stock someone could have gone all-in on?<p>Nick Maggiulli posted this on a somewhat unrelated matter (some TikToker&#x27;s strategy to fund their lifestyle):<p>&gt; <i>If it wasn’t obvious before, it bears repeating now</i>—some people are going to beat you at investing.  <i>Some of them will be dumber than you.  Some will be less knowledgable.  Some will even be completely wrong about the future.  But they will beat you just the same.  There is no great arbiter of justice in the investment world.  There is no cosmic force that ensures that only the knowledgable make money.  If there were, then I would be a far richer man today.</i><p>&gt; <i>But what does exist in the investment world is the inevitable pull of fundamentals.  The inescapable attraction between prices and reality.  Like a moth drawn to a flame.  Yes, markets will go through periods where some people make lots of money very quickly with little effort.  We are seeing such a market today.  But, eventually, these same markets find their way back.  As the legendary Benjamin Graham once said:</i><p>&gt;&gt; <i>In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.</i><p>&gt; <i>So let them vote.  Let them vote on which stock will be the next to double in a day.  Let them vote on which non-profit will make them rich.  Let them vote on what to buy and what to sell. Let them vote I say.  Because gravity will eventually set in.  Maybe not today.  Maybe not tomorrow.  Maybe not next week or even next year.  But eventually it will set in.</i><p>&gt; <i>So there is no point in making fun of other investors because they happen to be doing better than you, even if they are using a seemingly foolish strategy.  If they are truly fools, they will learn their lesson.  Maybe not in this market, but maybe in the next one.</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ofdollarsanddata.com&#x2F;let-them-vote&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ofdollarsanddata.com&#x2F;let-them-vote&#x2F;</a>')
