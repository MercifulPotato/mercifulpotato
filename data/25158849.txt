Declarations basically are the same in Dart&#x27;s. But I couldn&#x27;t find a Dart equivalence for the following bit of Swift:<p><pre><code>    if let sample = cachedSample, searchResult.isRecent {\n        sampleViewModel.mode = .success(sample)\n    } else {\n        sampleViewModel.getSample(number: sampleNumber)\n    }\n</code></pre>\nDo they have plans for that as well?')
