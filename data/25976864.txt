They were made just as much as an experiment as something necessary. As a young web developer at that time, I often had to do all the programming, ux design and graphic design myself. There wasn`t any budget for more people. Full stack development wasn`t a thing yet. I still get amazed by how well staffed and funded web development projects have become. Web development has become more complicated too. More animations, accessability and higher security all adds up to making the whole project being more time consuming.')
