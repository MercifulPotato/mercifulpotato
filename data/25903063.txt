Here is my limited coping strategy as it relates only to minor task delegation:<p>* Keep good notes. Be better prepared to jump back into a different task by knowing exactly where you left off, problem state, and what the next step is.<p>* Anticipate the switch and plan your day&#x2F;time to accommodate change. The switch to a different task is the easy part. It is building the necessary focus a given task requires that is hard. Know that and plan accordingly so that stress and interference are lower.<p>* when it comes to automating this stress away embrace the stress state directly and make notes about it. Use those notes to identify repeated problems and delays. Solve not for the stress but for the repetition.<p>* I cannot provide guidance for dealing with the emotion or mental stress directly as my situation is a bit more extreme.')
