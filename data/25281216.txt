Spiers is a trans person. I think it&#x27;s relevant to mention this as a fact, as I find it misleading (my personal belief) to keep referring to Spiers as &quot;she&quot; in HN comments. I think some commenters wouldn&#x27;t have done so if they were aware that Spiers is a trans person. Not a big deal, of course, but I know this type of factual information gets censored out quite a lot, so I just wanted to shine some light on it.')
