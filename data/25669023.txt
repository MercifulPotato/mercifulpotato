I have 4 step-kids, and during the first UK lockdown, 3 of them played regularly in roblox with me (I don&#x27;t live with them, and didn&#x27;t see them for 3 months).<p>Some of the games are immense - full on theme parks, weird physics games, movie tie-ins, &quot;total wipeout&quot; physical games, all sorts.  There was a really accurate Natural History museum at one point.  It&#x27;s so incredibly diverse, that it&#x27;s hard to get a real handle on it unless you play it.<p>It seems to have got real traction with some of the kids in terms of the effort they put into programming their games, and hopefully it&#x27;ll be a gateway to programming for some of them.<p>I think kids spend too much time playing games, but Roblox is pretty good, and they even make an effort to censor the chat - which can never be 100% but it&#x27;s better than a lot of places.<p>FTR I&#x27;ve played minecraft with them a lot too, but the issue is that ends up being a fighting game ones the boys&#x27; hormones kick in (sadly!)')
