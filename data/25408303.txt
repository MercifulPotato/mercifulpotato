I thought the electoral college should have selected someone else, I thought Trump should not have been sworn in to office, and I wanted him removed on the first day. I honestly believed it might happen because it seemed like the only sensible thing.<p>This election fraud nonsense is payback. It’s awful that the right can’t see that this is terrible for everyone. It’s terrible that the left can’t admit that the same passions existed on their side after the 2016 election.<p>I don’t want to argue about which side is worse. I’m not trying to highlight hypocrisy. I’m simply saying that the eye for an eye mentality has us all stuck.<p>I’m hopeful that Biden does understand all of this. His demeanor throughout all of this inspires some hope. We need more people on both sides to follow his lead.')
