An old roku.<p>At some point however not sure how but my roku updated and im pretty sure its monitoring all my stuff (mostly yt)<p>Ive read about router hacks etc to dumb down the roku and prevent it from calling home but it seems super hard.  I was barely able to use my own domain with proton.<p>Neutering roku seems like mission impossible for a non sysadmin. Is there a simple solution to this with or without roku?')
