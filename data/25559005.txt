If we find a technology on any of the pages, it is considered to be used by the website.\nWe include only the top 10 million websites (top 1 million before June 2013) in the statistics in order to limit the impact of domain spammers. We include all sites that are either in the Alexa top 10 million or in the Tranco top 1 million list. Website popularity rankings are sometimes considered inaccurate for measuring website traffic, but we find that they serve our purpose of providing a representative sample of established sites very well.\nWe exclude sites that have no useful content, e.g. sites that only show the default web server page.\nWe do not consider subdomains to be separate websites. For instance, sub1.example.com and sub2.example.com are considered to belong to the same site as example.com. That means for example, that all the subdomains of blogger.com, wordpress.com and similar sites are counted only as one website.\nWe do not include redirected domains. For example, Sun.com redirects to Oracle.com, and is therefore not counted.\nBecause our definition of &quot;website&quot; differs a bit from Alexa&#x27;s and Tranco&#x27;s definition, the &quot;top 10 million&quot; websites are actually not exactly 10 million. However, this has no statistical significance.\nOur reports are updated daily.\nPlease be aware of the limitations indicated in our disclaimer.&quot;')
