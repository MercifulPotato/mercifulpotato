I&#x27;m not going to hire an electrician who thinks electicity is made by evil spirits haunting wires and wants to rip them all out, I&#x27;m going to hire someone that will methodically find wiring faults and fix them. \nMany regulations are written in blood. There is no shortcut to fixing problems, no matter how loud someone is shouting simplistic answers.')
