That&#x27;s absolutely true, but that complaint goes for regular matter too! Every time the location of some body was predicted from the motions of what we could already see, the theory of light matter was fit exactly to the data. What makes it stay within the bounds of Occam&#x27;s Razor is that before ever noticing oddities in the motion of planets, we could say that probably matter would be clumped up, and could affect other matter.<p>Similarly dark matter has to be fit to each galaxy. However, before doing the fitting, dark matter suggests that galaxies would behave not just heavier than their matter content would suggest, but also that they would be lopsided. That is the first prediction you&#x27;d make as soon as you were told to consider invisible matter, even without seeing that the data fits.<p>More importantly, dark matter also elegantly explains the behavior of other massive objects, like galaxy clusters, which MOND struggles with. The figures that roughly work for galaxies don&#x27;t predict anything like what is seen in clusters, suggesting that they work by coincidence on the more common types of galaxy. That&#x27;s not to say we don&#x27;t have more to learn about gravity; to my admittedly limited understanding weaker flavors of MOND could explain the effects of Dark Energy. Dark Matter is just a more elegant explanation of the extra mass issue.')
