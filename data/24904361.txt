No GPU Accel on Chrome means scrolling is horrid on QHD&#x2F;higher resolution (besides YouTube being pretty much useless). Firefox is fine but there&#x27;s no user profile modes to separate between my various profiles. With so much work being done on browsers, it feels weird that Linux is so behind on this. And Chrome seem to not want to implement the GPU acceleration at all. I guess I&#x27;ll pay the Apple tax for the foreseeable future.')
