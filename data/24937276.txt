Possibly, but generally not, and words matter.<p>Words in propaganda, especially matter. In that statement, he was definitely advising against masks.<p>Third - it&#x27;s all moot - he made similar statements during the same time. His <i>exact</i> and <i>repeated</i> statement on 60 minutes was <i>&quot;People should not be wearing masks.&quot;</i> [1].<p>Fauci went on national TV and <i>repeatedly asked Americans to not wear masks</i>.<p>How much clearer can the man be?<p>There&#x27;s no decontextualization here.<p>3) So the report from CSIS didn&#x27;t mention mask wearing ...<p>... are you arguing that masks are &#x27;not important&#x27; in combatting COVID?<p>So the people concerned about the shaming and forceful wearing of masks are not conspiracists?<p>This isn&#x27;t helping your argument.<p>While you&#x27;re right to point out &#x27;there are a lot of factors in Asia&#x27; - the situation was fluid and ambiguous - and we know that they have a &#x27;mask wearing culture&#x27; which clearly must be &#x27;part of the overall solution&#x27;, which would indicate that in the context of a pandemic that&#x27;s about to kill masses of people - the mask wearing might be a good idea.<p>How could we possibly not err on the side of mask wearing?<p>Because: “We are concerned that the mass use of medical masks by the general population could exacerbate the shortage of these specialised masks for the people who need them most,” - WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Gheybresus<p>4)  &quot;use this resource right now in a way that is largely ineffective&quot;<p>You&#x27;re seriously contradicting yourself here.<p>Masking wearing is &#x27;largely ineffective&#x27; during the explosion of a pandemic (?!?) while at this very moment Dr. Fauci literally wants to <i>legally mandate</i> mask wearing? [2]<p>If masks are &#x27;effective now&#x27; then they would have been &#x27;just as effective then&#x27;.<p>The science has not changed - what has changed is the availability and prioritization of masks.<p>5)  Dr. Fauci and the WHO <i>directly advised against masks</i> full well knowing that there are material benefits, at the very same time they were publicly, acutely concerned about &#x27;mask shortages&#x27;.<p>They were playing a very obvious game of &#x27;wartime triage&#x27; in order to ensure the best possible outcome at the time, given priorities.<p>Their propagandistic communications strategy really quite obvious.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=p6pEcgDmEUk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=p6pEcgDmEUk</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marketwatch.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;dr-fauci-says-if-people-are-not-wearing-masks-then-maybe-we-should-be-mandating-as-new-us-covid-19-cases-hit-85000-2020-10-24" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marketwatch.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;dr-fauci-says-if-people-ar...</a>')
