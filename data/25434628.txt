I will do whatever I can to hang out with friends to have fun and enjoy my time, even if that means when some people think it isn&#x27;t worth it. (either money wise or time wise)<p>You saying this gives me some kind of weird feeling of knowing that it will probably get less in the future. I don&#x27;t mind the feeling now and it keeps my on my feet and makes me do things, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d want to keep this feeling when I&#x27;m approaching the 40s.')
