Jobs have disappeared, but other jobs appeared. People can be replaced with automation, or with other cheaper people. What difference does it make if you lose your job because your output can be done now more efficiently by a script, or by someone in Mumbai, or by a kid fresh out of school? I personally came to terms with the idea that at some point in my career I will be subject to a round of layoffs. I am not looking forward for that moment, but if&#x2F;when that happens, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll feel so happy when I&#x27;ll deposit my first paycheck from my new job. It&#x27;s like being young again. What&#x27;s not to like ;) ?')
