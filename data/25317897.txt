I can just say I got people what they asked for, without false pretense, while being looked down upon by the likes of you.<p>&gt; looking down on and mocking people who still have to work for a living<p>Guess what, actions come with consequences. You created your HN account in 2008. You most certainly knew about crypto in 2009. But you decided not to act - again, and again, and again for 12 years. While we both had to work for a living, I was selling my services for various things like sysadmin of mining rigs, and learning finance on the side to get into the industry.<p>Maybe you have a part of the blame?<p>&gt; for not having your dispassionate visionary insight<p>It&#x27;s never too late to get in the industry if you really want to, we&#x27;re still in the early days - like the net in 1995.<p>However, you may have to change your bad attitude. You do not need passion, but you must at least drop the hatred if you want to work in crypto.')
