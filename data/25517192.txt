Item(by='MontyCarloHall', descendants=None, kids=[25519190, 25517205], score=None, time=1608728746, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25516933, text='&gt; That Robinhood sold its order flow is unremarkable, but the scale of its activities certainly merits comment. Forbes reports that in the first quarter 2020, 70% of Robinhood’s revenues derived from payments for order flows, as opposed to 17% for E-Trade and just 3% for Schwab. Yes, Robinhood has observed standard practice–but with distinctly above-average enthusiasm.<p>Those other brokerages charge trading fees (these days, just for options trading), so of course their proportion of revenue from order flow will be lower.')
