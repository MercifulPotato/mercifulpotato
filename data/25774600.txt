There are still companies and universities pushing the boundaries, just fewer than before (due to the massive brain-drain caused by the war). In turn, European companies often tend to play catch-up and they more often need competent executants rather than independent innovative thinkers. Competent executants are cheaper as they do less significant work.<p>To this you of course have to add the social security, shorter office hours, longer holidays etc. that you get in Europe, but maybe not so much in the US.')
