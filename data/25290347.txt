Right now more of a long-term gamble.<p>In my opinion the value is in the network and the ability to move money instantly (or at very least faster than traditional methods), securely, to anywhere in the world for a fraction of a cent. That ability alone is valuable and hasn&#x27;t existed until now.<p>There are other arguments along the lines of deflationary vs. inflationary, anonymous vs. private, irreversibility of transactions (no charge-backs) that are good or bad depending on your views, but in general crypto represents a brand-new &quot;investment&quot; (or gamble if you like) for this generation.<p>The different cryptocurrencies that various teams are building follow different philosophies, but I think the space in general is pretty interesting.')
