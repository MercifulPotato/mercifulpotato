So that&#x27;s good.<p>On the other hand, light pollution is so bad that kids grow up never seeing the night sky, effectively they are inside a virtual world.  Shall we become <i>Krikkiters</i>?\n( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sites.google.com&#x2F;site&#x2F;h2g2theguide&#x2F;Index&#x2F;k&#x2F;krikkit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sites.google.com&#x2F;site&#x2F;h2g2theguide&#x2F;Index&#x2F;k&#x2F;krikkit</a> )<p>When you look at a picture of the Earth at night from orbit and see the synthetic human mycelium of light spread over the land, it&#x27;s kind of beautiful, but at the same time all those photons are waste, pollution.  In infrared bands the waste is even more glaring. (That&#x27;s not a pun, it&#x27;s literal.)<p>Also, humans have great night vision.  There&#x27;s a whole <i>mode</i> where the peripheral vision takes over from the foveal vision and you can see just fine.  It&#x27;s quite literally like &quot;nightvision&quot; in D&amp;D: you can&#x27;t see in the actual absence of light, but you can see in starlight.  Also, in this mode you can see luminescent fungi and bugs and such clearly.  There was an article in the old &quot;Whole Earth Quarterly&quot; (which I think is now online and maybe searchable somewhere, so maybe I can dig it up...) about folks experimenting with this.  They made hats with a bit of clothes-hanger-wire attached and a dot of glow-in-the-dark paint, such that the dot of luminescence was in the air in front of their eyes and, um, several inches (?) away.  The method was to go into a natural (dark but not deep-forest-pitch-black) area, put on the hat, let the eyes fixate on the dot (to prevent you trying to look around with your foveal cells) and then direct your attention to your peripheral field of view (basically everything from the foveal &quot;sweet spot&quot;, which is actually quite small,  IIRC the size of your fist on your outstretched arm, to the sides of your head.  Humans can see nearly 180°.  You can test this yourself.  Put up your arm and do a thumbs&#x27; up gesture.  Wiggle your thumb as you move your arm to the side while looking straight ahead (don&#x27;t move your eyes or head.)  You should be able to see the motion to nearly 90°.)  Anyhow, the folks in that article were running around in the woods and fields at night with no flashlights.  Literally running.  I&#x27;ll see if I can dig up the link later today.<p>(Not to rant, but these new LED street lights and car head lights (and bike lights too) are blinding.  They hurt my eyes!)<p>- - - -<p>Edit:  Derp!
