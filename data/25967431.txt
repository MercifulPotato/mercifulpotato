Item(by='eqvinox', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611996479, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25966444, text='I can see the difference in my 8-bit desktop background gradient, which is blue, and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s surprising at all since it&#x27;s a brightness&#x2F;value difference which is probably perceived through more cells (or more sensitively) in the eye.  I can&#x27;t link a study either but I&#x27;d like to have 10-bit even if it&#x27;s just for the light axis.<p>Coincidentally in a YUV encoding I&#x27;d only push the V axis to 10 bit - maybe even 12 to cover extra HDR range, i.e. higher absolute brightness when the display supports it.  (Or go with a logarithmic encoding, in which case even 8 bit might be enough...)')
