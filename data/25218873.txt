So I torrented a VMWare image for macOS (Lion at the time) and started dabbling in it.<p>My host machine was running Windows 8 and it was the first time I had ever used macOS. Gradually I began to notice that I was spending more time in the Mac VM than in Windows and loving every minute it. My next personal computer was a MacBook and I’ve never felt the need to go back to PCs yet.<p>So yeah. The iPad was to computers what the Wii was to games.<p>In fact, I think it’s gotten unnecessarily complicated since then, with its mystery meat menus and arcane gestures and removal of Dock labels etc.<p>On one hand it should have stayed true to its original purpose, bringing basic computing to the computer-shy masses, but on the other a simplified OS would be a painful waste of the iPad’s beautiful hardware.<p>Maybe it’s time to offer “Casual” and “Pro” UI modes in iPadOS?')
