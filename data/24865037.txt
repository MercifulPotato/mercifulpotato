This was probably a good decision with regards to performance (though I&#x27;ll never know for sure), but a horrible decision with regards to readability, maintainability, and my sanity. The amount of bullshit I&#x27;ve had to put up with from the compiler&#x2F;assembler&#x2F;linker is insane. It&#x27;s like there&#x27;s a demon in there that makes sure my code is sufficiently deformed, and if not, makes up stupid reasons why it shouldn&#x27;t compile. In order to stay sane while writing this code, I&#x27;ve had to ignore best practices in code structure and naming. You&#x27;ll find macros and variables with such descriptive names as ss and s and a. Assembler macros nested beyond belief. And to top it off, there are almost no comments.<p>&gt; So a warning: Long-term exposure to this code may cause loss of sanity, nightmares about GAS macros and linker errors, or any number of other debilitating side effects. This code is known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects, and reproductive harm.<p>Mâ€¦maybe I&#x27;ll hold off on that PR.')
