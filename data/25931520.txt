They spread misinformation that would get people killed, and were banned for it.<p>I&#x27;ve not in my 30 years on the internet spent more than a passing moment on a BBS, forum, social media that let anything go, nor would I want to as I&#x27;ve seen what it devolves into.<p>You have not displayed any basis for your assertion that the moderation enforcement on twitter is biased.<p>What point did I prove for you?')
