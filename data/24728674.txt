Rectangle allieviates some of those issues, but things like command+tab not working on minimised application, having to use a different shortcut to switch between windows of an application is not ideal. In MSWindows, windows are first class citizens and alt + tab works across all the cases mentioned above.<p>Keyboard shortcuts are good, the issue is it does not work across all applications. One example is the end key going to end of line in some application and end of page in others. Ctrl + E does not work on some application etc. This probably partly the applications fault, but it does make for a subpar experience. \nI assume the butterfly keyboard needs no explaination.')
