There are only two hopeful scenarios here: action from the top, and collective action from the bottom.<p>Action from the top means that we will have capitalists willingly going against their own short term interests.  This is unlikely to happen; capitalists don&#x27;t even look past the next quarterly earnings projections if they can help it.<p>Action from the bottom is also unlikely, since people at the bottom of the economic ladder can&#x27;t take time off work to protest.<p>I don&#x27;t see any other scenario that even comes close to saving us.  At this point, I would say only God could help us, if I believed.')
