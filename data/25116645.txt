Item(by='ris', descendants=None, kids=[25117151], score=None, time=1605558749, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25113636, text='There&#x27;s... a lot of hand waving in this article and no numbers.<p>I&#x27;d be pretty surprised if `malloc_trim` had a significant effect on cpython memory usage as most python memory gets allocated in 256KiB &quot;arenas&quot;, which, what with fragmentation, are unlikely to _ever_ be reclaimed.<p>On the other hand, the article dismisses threads with some vagueries around the GIL, suggesting people need to reach straight for processes if they&#x27;re serious. Really, unless your code has almost no I&#x2F;O or C-accelerated, GIL-less sections, if you&#x27;re not using both threads <i>and</i> processes, you&#x27;re just burning memory unnecessarily.<p>(edit: oh and then there&#x27;s async but I&#x27;m a bit old-fashioned for that)')
