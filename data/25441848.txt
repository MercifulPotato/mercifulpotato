I actually literally had this thought yesterday walking down the street and I&#x27;m far from a low level security researcher. Row hammer[0] is a real attack worth actual money to thousands of entities. This attack is literally one of the simplest imaginable and any computer that it would apply to would already have shielding. Had it gained true wifi <i>access</i> then yes, maybe worth a tiny amount of money if it were faster for the like 12 computers in an office whose sole protection is some snipped wires on an ethernet cable and incoming data on UDP. For any real actor that has to worry about this type of attack they already employ all sorts of measures to defeat it, including actual bunkers underground with a secret entrance in the cow fields.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Row_hammer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Row_hammer</a>')
