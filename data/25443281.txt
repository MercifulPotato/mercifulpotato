This is clearly a waste of time.<p>Nobody is arguing against freedom of speech, what every other country objects to is is <i>unrestricted</i> freedom of speech, meaning protection of lies, propaganda, slander, calumny, defamation and inciting of violence as being acceptable forms of free speech.<p>I can explain it to you, I can&#x27;t make you understand this: no other country in the world, no other people in the world, accept that unrestricted free speech is a good thing.<p>Moreover, those countries believe it so strongly that there are laws against it. European countries are functioning democracies. Clearly your point that unrestricted free speech is essential to democracy is false.<p>I&#x27;m not going to bother responding any further.')
