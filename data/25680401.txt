How they managed to do that is a total form of evil genius.<p>As more and more new cars are relying on these display screens to entirely operate the car its become clear that the money has skewed way harder on parts and labour (which was already high) and away from deliveries&#x2F;sales since I left the Industry.<p>Personally, I want Cybertruck as its the first original design in ages (all other Teslas remind me like of crystal pepsi type marketing on design) but I already drive a Toyota hybrid and these screens put me off so much. I just want the option to go back to dials and buttons just so I know how to trouble-shoot things.<p>These things that are really computers with wheels but are now calling &#x27;cars&#x27; will likely remain a total black box hidden behind a bunch of firmware walls that require proprietary software and code readers&#x2F;tools, and an exclusivity on parts.<p>I&#x27;m so tired of the automotive Industry&#x27;s, at large but specifically the German ones I worked on most professionally, attempts to maintain any relevance and have resorted to the captured market in such a disappointing way and seem to have given up on trying to innovate in engineering or design in any meaningful way: big screens? Really, that&#x27;s the best you can do?<p>Why not a EV version of the AMG A Klass that can compete in price and range with a base model Model 3 all the way up to dual motor performance?<p>Hyundai is already working on that EV hothatch, too, now that they&#x27;ve refined their QC&#x2F;QA issues this last decade and made the most of their alliance with LG.<p>Nissan is trying to bring AR into their cars as moves most of its lineup entirely toward EV.')
