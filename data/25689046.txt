To most people, the absence of &quot;discrimination&quot; means race-neutrality. Most people on the left have embraced the idea that discrimination between groups can be justified to achieve more equal outcomes.<p>&gt; Some people are held responsible for things that happened before they were born, and other people are not held responsible for what they are doing right now.<p>This is how my wife&#x27;s grandmother perceives a lot of the discussion of &quot;white privilege&quot; and &quot;whiteness.&quot;<p>&gt; $5 billion for border security is too expensive, but $1.5 trillion for “free” health care is not.<p>I think there is an increasing number of people on the left don&#x27;t care about defending the border. They may not be fully &quot;open borders&quot; but within their intellectual framework, they really can&#x27;t articulate what the legitimate purpose of controlling the border would be and thus aren&#x27;t willing to spend money on it.<p>&gt; If you cheat to get into college you go to prison, but if you cheat to get into the country you go to college for free.<p>There is a major push to offer tuition-discounted or tuition-free community college to undocumented immigrants, including in Oregon. A number of states that offer tuition-free community college are extending those programs to undocumented immigrants.<p>Traditionally, the view was that welfare benefits should be for those here legally. There is a great discomfort about the idea of extending those benefits to people here illegally. On the left, and in much of the liberal media circle, the prevailing view is opposed to distinguishing between Americans and non-Americans in provision of welfare benefits.<p>&gt; killing murderers is wrong, but killing innocent babies is right.<p>There is again been a real shift in how abortion is conceptualized. <i>Roe</i> was justified on universal principles of bodily autonomy. Today, the right to an abortion is treated as axiomatic. And increasingly, there is a push to conceptualize it as &quot;healthcare.&quot;<p>My point is that we&#x27;re seeing quite a major divergence in basic assumptions about society, which has become particularly acute because most in the media have embraced these new axioms while most of the rest of the country have not. Whatever logical framework causes some people to view the term &quot;unbearable whiteness&quot; as not a racist term is just one example of that divergence.<p>Moreover, because, for the left these things are increasingly axiomatic, there is no way for them to talk to my wife&#x27;s grandma about these issues. If you view abortion as a balance between bodily autonomy and the developmental advancement of a fetus, you can have a discussion between someone who supports abortion and someone who doesn&#x27;t. If you view abortion as &quot;healthcare&quot; you can&#x27;t have that conversation.<p>Or, if you have a diluted concept of &quot;citizenship,&quot; you can&#x27;t formulate a response to why anyone would oppose free college tuition for undocumented immigrants other than &quot;bigotry.&quot;')
