Altera? Other?) - typically a logo on the chip.<p>* Chip part number (typically the first row of letters and numbers on the chip - typically the second row is the date of manufacture in the form YYww where ww is the week of manufacture - all numbers are useful)<p>Is there a 10 pin or 14 pin header near the chip? If so, check for power and ground on the appropriate pins for a standard JTAG pinout. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=jtag+connector+pinout" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=jtag+connector+pinout</a><p>If the card has a clearly identifiable JTAG connector and is a common FPGA, you should be able to look up the chip part number on the manufacturer&#x27;s web site and find the software tools that support that chip. You will need to figure out which JTAG interface the tool set supports - if it is a newer toolset, it probably supports a relatively inexpensive USB-attached JTAG. If it is an older toolset, it may need a specific, often expensive and likely no longer available JTAG interface.')
