(Well, except for the lack of a build step.)<p>In practice, I&#x27;ve forgotten how the generator works, the system and generated layout is confusing, it&#x27;s undocumented, and it&#x27;s all in Python 2.<p>Also, one of big markdowns to doing it yourself is you likely have far less experience or knowledge of how to arrange a site than someone who has developed a widely-used SSG.')
