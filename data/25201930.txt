I will say that your &quot;toy&quot; comment didn&#x27;t make it seem like you were interested in having a real discussion, but mostly just throwing shade, as they say. The whole comment has this vague undertone of &quot;I am above this whole thing.&quot; This is probably why you&#x27;re running into some difficulty. There&#x27;s not just the crew that loves Rust, but also a very, very dedicated set of Rust haters, and it&#x27;s really easy to bucket someone, incorrectly, into one or the other, based on initial impression.<p>One interesting thing in this comment, and why I chose to respond to it though, is it seems like what you want isn&#x27;t just a description, but a specific kind of description from a specific kind of person. That is, it has to be &quot;first-hand&quot; but also not from someone who &quot;sell[s] some product written in Rust.&quot; How can you get first-hand knowledge without building something? How can you demonstrate that that knowledge is legitimate without also letting people know that you have done that work? It seems impossible to me.')
