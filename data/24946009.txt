I migrated from one email address to another ten years ago, and I still get personal correspondence sent to the old one.<p>I told everyone I know that I&#x27;m using a new email address, I set up forwarding, I only send using the new email address, and I have an auto-respond message that I&#x27;m not using that email address and to send to the new one instead, and nonetheless people still send to it.<p>Also, for security reasons I&#x27;d recommend to not close the old email address, because if you happen to forget an account there, there is some risk that someone nefarious could grab the old email address and have password resets sent there.')
