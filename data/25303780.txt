I know those are classified as service animals under the ADA and not ESAs.<p>I also mentioned in another comment below that my general interaction with ESAs is people using it as a loophole to take their pets places and causing issues for people with service animals. You&#x27;re right that there are certainly good cases for it and I&#x27;m sure plenty of responsible people with ESAs that aren&#x27;t part of that group.')
