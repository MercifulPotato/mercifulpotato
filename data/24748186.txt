Everyone&#x27;s digging out the rust-bucket under their porch and trying to get it overhauled, when they&#x27;re not snapping up entry-level road bikes and casual cruisers&#x2F;hybrids&#x2F;commuter bikes...<p>The ultra-expensive stuff remains more available, though not necessarily service for it. That&#x27;s the stuff we hardcore roadies buy anyway, but now it&#x27;s pretty much the only thing sure to be in stock, and even then, far from assured in all cases.')
