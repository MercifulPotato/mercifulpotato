I cannot use this list &quot;officially&quot; as most of the entries are either illegal or at least unethical.<p>One of these items specifically involves finding out whether the candidate uses anything Apple&#x2F;Beats for music listening. Don&#x27;t ask me why, it&#x27;s a telltale sign on who I am hiring.<p>When Apple decides to make its &quot;airpods&quot; even bigger and more visible from further away, I can only feel happier.<p>p.s. Because there is so much dissonance in this thread, I will intentionally not mention whether I actually keep these candidates or let them go ;)')
