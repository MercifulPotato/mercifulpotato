We should be able to address counter-points when making high level arguments. Their existence doesn&#x27;t mean broad sweeps are useless or incorrect.<p>Arguments in the weeds are disingenuous when they&#x27;re not challenging the actual pattern. They believe to invalidate an argument as if by demonstrating an axiom in a mathematics proof false, when they may actually demonstrate ignorance of variance.')
