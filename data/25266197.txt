It is bearing fruits, just not as well as we&#x27;d hoped. And yes, I&#x27;m aware of the problems it caused too.<p>Look, I&#x27;m a strong liberal but it&#x27;s hard not to dislike the Muslims if you were born before 2000 (which most of the BJP brass is). Muslims just don&#x27;t assimilate well. And not their fault to a large degree, but actively protesting against raising the marriage age, triple talaq and faulting the French government in the latest bombing.
