That is the same as the &quot;herd immunity strategy&quot;. There are only two ways of getting herd immunity, either through a vaccine or &quot;naturally&quot;.<p>In march it became apparent that stopping covid would not be possible (at least in Sweden) and the time frame of a potential vaccine was unknown - possibly that it would arrive too late to be useful.<p>At that point in time there is only one strategy left, herd immunity. The <i>ONLY</i> choice you have is how you want to approach it. Full lock-down and wait for vaccine? - not practically enforceable nor desirable. No restrictions? - Would overrun the hospitals and lead to massive suffering even outside of corona victims (at least in countries with an old population, for countries with a very young population that could very well be the  best hing you could do).<p>Flatten the curve is about curbing the spread so that the hospitals can keep up. Not about stopping the disease. Navigating that road is full of compromises. Taking more risk with children in schools - that have a lot to loose on a lock-down but has low chance of getting seriously ill shouldn&#x27;t be that of a controversial statement. Even if it turns out that the assumptions made when making that decision was wrong.<p>There are of course infinite considerations to make but yes, of course he had that in mind when making decisions! As he should have.')
