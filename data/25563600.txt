I&#x27;m not even saying that recruiters must respond to every cold email they get with a resume.  But if there&#x27;s been any back-and-forth at all, the candidate is owed some kind of response, period.<p>&gt; <i>Ghosting also happens in both way - as a hiring manager, I&#x27;ve had a many times where I had to reach out to the candidate patiently waiting for their response to the next round or getting back to me for a coding exercise with no response</i><p>That&#x27;s also shitty, and candidates shouldn&#x27;t do that.  But &quot;candidates are disrespectful so I can be disrespectful too&quot; is not an excuse.<p>&gt; <i>Finding a job is a lot like dating</i><p>No, it&#x27;s not.  Finding a job is a business transaction, while dating is a social&#x2F;romantic activity.<p>And for the record: ghosting in dating sucks too.<p>Basically your argument boils down to &quot;we&#x27;re too busy, and everyone else is disrespectful in other parts of life, so this is fine&quot;.  Not buying it.')
