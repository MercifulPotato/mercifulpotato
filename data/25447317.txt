Brave is not <i>only</i> about &quot;pessimism&quot; and never was. Of course this makes us hard to categorize.<p>Main point is we grew and grow. Firefox shrinks, it&#x27;s dying. I&#x27;m not saying that a bigger browser in decline would be easy to turn around, but Mozilla has not done right by Firefox.<p>I do agree with Ian that loss of Firefox founders hurt. We made brevet promotions and hires who did not hit the heights of hyatt, blake, joehewitt, and bengoodger.
