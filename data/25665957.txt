The expected remaining lifetime of the average individual in Scotland (if it remains unchanged) is ~37 years, which would reduce the lifetime adjusted death toll by at least 3.7.<p>There have been a significant amount of excess deaths that are not attributable to COVID [2]. I suspect that such deaths have a lower average age (e.g. due to suicides), than COVID deaths, further reducing the average life years saved due to the lockdowns.<p>I&#x27;m not proposing that we should optimise for life years saved, but I do think that the death of a 86 year old is less tragic than that of a 38 year old, and that we perhaps shouldn&#x27;t evaluate lockdown vs no lockdown purely based on the percentage of the population which died.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk-scotland-54433305" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk-scotland-54433305</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newswise.com&#x2F;factcheck&#x2F;are-a-third-of-the-excess-deaths-this-year-not-linked-to-covid-19-yes-are-they-directly-linked-to-the-lockdown-it-s-complicated&#x2F;?article_id=740863&amp;fc=politics_channel" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newswise.com&#x2F;factcheck&#x2F;are-a-third-of-the-excess...</a>')
