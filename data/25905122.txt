This variant also has the E484K found in the B.1.1.248 &#x2F; Brazil (vulg.) variant.<p>That said based on the title you might assume the vaccine to be <i>as</i> effective, but that&#x27;s not quite what the study says. In short it states:<p>&gt;A six-fold reduction in neutralizing titers was observed with the B.1.351 variant relative to prior variants. Despite this reduction, neutralizing titer levels with B.1.351 remain above levels that are expected to be protective.')
