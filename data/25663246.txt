You think that&#x27;s rather a minor problem, ok. Let&#x27;s skip past the question of offensive speech for now...<p>Let&#x27;s talk about preserving a democracy. What happens when people no longer feel any responsibility for citizens having trust in that democracy? They use their speech to weaken it (this is a much broader group than just Trump) and now, with Trump, even to incite violence if they think it will benefit themselves. Fault and responsibility seems to clearly lie with <i>them</i> and their choices, they shouldn&#x27;t be able to dodge that responsibility by redirecting to abstract discussion of the pros and cons of restrictions on speech.<p>You are dodging the direct &quot;how did we get here?&quot; answer of &quot;people are making blatant shortsighted power plays&quot; by talking about people&#x27;s &quot;iddly-widdly-fweelings.&quot; That&#x27;s ridiculous.')
