The article tries to make it seem like only altruistic donations existed in the past, but that&#x27;s very wrong.<p>Back when I was in college 20 years ago, Microsoft had a program to do this.<p>Part of it was doing things like :<p>1. Hiring students as liaisons to represent and advocate for MS stuff at the school.<p>2. Giving away free copies of software away to CS departments and students in exchange.<p>3. Try to help get these things on the curriculum&#x2F;etc (often in conjunction with #2)<p>4. Find opportunities for MS to donate computer labs and other  meaningful things in exchange for people being taught visual studio&#x2F;etc.<p>(How far they would go depended on where in the top-N programs it was, etc)<p>This is the genesis of a number of the Microsoft-named computer labs in US universities.')
