Item(by='disillusioned', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603928024, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24924406, text='I own a Nest Secure and actually really really love it. It syncs with my Nest + Yale door locks, so when I keypad into my house, it auto-disarms, which is amazing. I don&#x27;t carry keys with me anymore, and the lock is gorgeous.<p>It&#x27;s also just _really_ nice. They put a lot of thoughtfulness into the Nest Detect motion&#x2F;door open sensor. They filter out my dogs near perfectly. The voice warnings are great and useful. The keypad is nice. And it&#x27;s integrated into the Nest app so I have a one-stop shop.<p>Google just invested $400M into ADT... so I have to believe these things are related. They also committed to re-manufacturing Nest Detects, so they&#x27;re not _completely_ sunsetting this. I wonder if they have another version of this, or an ADT-linked version that just got delayed by pandemic, but they sold through their stock and decided to do this in the interim, but I feel like it&#x27;s weird they wouldn&#x27;t just announce that.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that the monitoring service for Nest Secure is NOT ADT, it&#x27;s Brinks&#x2F;Moni. So I wonder if that&#x27;s a big part of their reasoning. They&#x27;ve put their money behind a direct competitor essentially, so maybe they don&#x27;t want to feed money away from their new investment.<p>I&#x27;m more worried about the clear writing on the wall to spin down the Nest app. The Google Home duplicated work is simply no where near parity yet, and I fear it won&#x27;t be for quite some time. When they eventually tell us they&#x27;re sunsetting the Nest app (in a year or two, if I had to guess, maybe sooner?), I really hope they&#x27;ll have the scrubber timeline view and maintain the auto-lock and such.<p>As someone who&#x27;s bought fully into the Google Home&#x2F;Nest ecosystem, but is also keenly aware of Google&#x27;s penchant for Old Yellering the hell out of things... this doesn&#x27;t really surprise me. But I hope they support it for a long time to come. It&#x27;s a really nice system.')
