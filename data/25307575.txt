Bill Gates wouldn&#x27;t be a billionaire if he didn&#x27;t build amazing things, but he also exploited at scale the unjust IP (&quot;ImaginaryProperty&quot;) system, which was a critical part of achieving the scale Microsoft achieved.<p>Startups like Airbnb and Lyft likewise have built amazing things, and would easily make their founders 100&#x27; millionaires, but there is a point where to reach a certain level you need to leverage some flawed, unjust legal system at scale (stupid regulations around housing&#x2F;hospitality&#x2F;and taxis, in these examples).<p>None of these founders created these legal systems, but their rapid success and scale I can&#x27;t see happening without those dumb legal environments they found when they started.<p>Now, maybe the best method to fix unjust laws is exactly this: when you see a stupid legal system, found a company to exploit it, become a billionaire and then finally society will take notice that the legal system is stupid and will fix it.<p>So I could see an argument that maybe not only should we not penalize billionaires who built their wealth from scratch, but we should thank them, like we thank white-hats, for identifying inequitable laws that they were able to leverage at scale.')
