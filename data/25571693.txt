Perhaps I don’t yet fully grasp what you’re thinking of with those ideas of state. Especially given the correspondence between continuation passing style and ANF.<p>I had seen it as “remaining reduction” which in some sense is embodied in the syntax tree being reduced. So in that sense, it’s kind of static from the written text of the program (though duplication can force that to be a runtime concern).')
