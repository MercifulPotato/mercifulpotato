I am totally susceptible to bias and I do not claim to be otherwise, but there are certain ground rules we can set. Rush Limbaugh always starts off his rants and problematic messages with straight up incorrect statements. As in statements that are verifiably false. He then constructs arguments around these false ideas. The issue is, to the average viewer its difficult to know that those ideas are false (how are you gonna do that after working for 40+ hours a day doing manual labor, commuting, cooking, taking care of a kid, etc).<p>There are also people like Tucker Carlson who say things without validating their claims. Here is a recent example\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsweek.com&#x2F;fox-news-tucker-carlson-lockdown-punishing-rural-america-mindless-cruel-1499942" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsweek.com&#x2F;fox-news-tucker-carlson-lockdown-pu...</a><p>and now guess what, oklahoma for example is experiencing increasing covid cases and now local officials are advocating for lockdowns, which is something scientists were advocating from the start. He was clearly wrong, however people DO listen to him. I know because I&#x27;ve lived with people who do and think he knows everything.<p>We even have a president who dog whistled a terror plot against the governor of Michigan. Trump is a white supremacist and white supremacism is inherently a non fact based ideological stance, yet it leads to stuff like the terror plot.<p>I am advocating for clamping down of purposeful disinformation. America itself knows how powerful purposeful disinformation is given its experiences with it during the cold war. What we should probably do is punish purposeful disinformation that has an intent to harm a specific group, the general public, or for the gain of an entity at the expense of the public (tobacco companies and polluters come to mind here. Lots of disinformation regarding health effects). Its generally very difficult to prove things like hate crimes (which the spreading of disinformation to harm a group is) and even cases like the michael richards incident wouldn&#x27;t involve a punitive action. He was angry because he was bombing his set and said something wrong out of a moment frustration. He might truly be racist (or not, who knows other than him), but he doesn&#x27;t seem to be actively working to advance his life at the expense of other&#x27;s. He didn&#x27;t actively work to disenfranchise a group of people, unlike people like David Duke who actively works to disenfranchise specific groups of people and has never suffered the consequences of it in America (he went to jail for tax fraud, but not for his awful actions funnily enough).')
