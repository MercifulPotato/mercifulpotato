I used to spend 10+ hours a day on a desktop. Then that time was split between my desktop and a laptop, after I got my first one. Then smartphones came out, and it&#x27;s now split between a laptop and my phone. Hopefully the next phase is phone&#x2F;wearables. I&#x27;m sure there are still people spending that much time on desktops to mess with VR, since you&#x27;re still tethered to a computer.')
