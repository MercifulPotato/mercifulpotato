Your workload is increasing, so your manager gets approval to hire a 3rd person so you can take on more work. Unfortunately, your manager is fooled by a charismatic person who greatly exaggerated their experience on their resume, to the point that they work about 1&#x2F;4 as fast as the rest of the team and tend to code by trial-and-error.<p>Suddenly, the expectations for your team&#x27;s output have increased by 50%, but the 3rd person can only really contribute another 10-20% at most. By extension, your job just got harder.<p>Worse yet, the average talent of the team has now gone down significantly. You spend more time fixing bugs and chasing bad work. You&#x27;re also faced with the fact that you&#x27;re probably getting paid the same as the over-leveled person next to you. This breeds resentment, wastes time, and ultimately leads to good people quitting for other jobs.<p>Alternatively, imagine if the company hired quickly and fired quickly. Every time a new person showed up, you had no idea if they were actually good or if they were just rushed through the interview process. You also don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re going to be around after the 3 month probationary period, so why bother building a relationship? High turnover like this tends to destroy morale.')
