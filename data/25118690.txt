I could see AirBnB turning into a double-edged sword for communities. Yes, AirBnB would bring in some nuisances but it would also bring in tourists - who spend money in your community. Areas that ban AirBnB would suffer the loss of tax revenue and have to figure out how to deal with that.<p>Also AirBnB just gets blamed for the rental shortage in many communities. The truth is poor zoning results in a shortage of rental units. Many areas with rental unit shortage have that shortage because zoning does not allow for high-density construction. The easiest solution to any shortage is to simply increase supply.')
