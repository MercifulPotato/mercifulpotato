Past the surface-level veil of &quot;online presence,&quot; this article more or less just tells me &quot;if you get famous, you can quit your job.&quot;<p>You could replace &quot;online presence&quot; with &quot;acting,&quot; or &quot;baseball skills&quot; and get largely the same outcome. Growing my acting presence isn&#x27;t optional anymore, because if I get famous I can quit my day job. Growing my baseball skills isn&#x27;t optional anymore, because if I can throw a crazy 12-6 curveball I can get drafted and quit my day job. Growing my online presence isn&#x27;t optional, because if I become an influencer I can quit my day job.<p>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m biased because I try to keep a very minimal online presence and it has, if anything, positively affected my day-to-day life, but this article just rubbed me the wrong way.')
