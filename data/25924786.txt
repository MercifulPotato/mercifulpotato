So many mechanical parts. So much to go wrong, such as air seals, bearings, etc. Even if the drive survived, will you be able to connect to its interface? No!<p>If you want to store data for 100 years, you will need to copy that data over, approximately every 5 years, onto the then current storage medium.')
