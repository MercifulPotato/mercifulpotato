And compare the recent effective rates to the ones at the start of the table. About the same for the top quintile, significantly lower for all the others. So we should be seeing a reduction in wealth inequality then, right? Or at worst it should stay the same, so why are we seeing the opposite?<p>Obviously this doesn&#x27;t prove that the thing that hasn&#x27;t actually been tried would actually help, but it does point to the idea that maybe the problem lies somewhere else entirely. For example, lack of effective antitrust enforcement.')
