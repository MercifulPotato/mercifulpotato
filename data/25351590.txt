MacDonalds make the best hamburgers because they sell so many of them? Windows is the best OS because billions of people use it?<p>&gt;Do your &quot;solved problem&quot; bluetooth headphones allow EASY audio sharing when the kid is sleeping and you want to watch something with your wife? These are two bluetooth devices on same audio stream.<p>So in your mind, &#x27;solving&#x27; a problem is buying not one, but TWO $500 headphones instead of $10 earbuds and a $5 Y connector? Oh wait, you also believe that the headphone jack is stupid. Yeah, sure, sell people a $1000 solution for a problem you created. Great job!<p>&gt;It&#x27;s amazing to me how many folks seem to have no clue about what folks value in the apple ecosystem.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of Gucci products either. ;)')
