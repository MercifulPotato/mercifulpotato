Item(by='jefftk', descendants=None, kids=[25431346], score=None, time=1608046155, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25431013, text='<i>&gt; Advertisers can purchase fixed display ads on reputable sites by contracting directly with the site owner.</i><p>But what is a fair price? That depends on the traffic, but we are positing that detection of &quot;is this a real user&quot; is not possible, right?<p>Traditionally, advertisers have gone by Nielsen style ratings for broadcast media (pay people to track what they consume, extrapolate) and circulation numbers for print media.  In our hypothetical world the former would still be possible but the latter wouldn&#x27;t.  Unfortunately, in addition to being really inefficient, if you pay people to track what they consume you will essentially never compensate niche publications.  This strongly promotes centralization.<p>Privacy Pass &#x2F; Trust Tokens &#x2F; etc seem much more promising to me?')
