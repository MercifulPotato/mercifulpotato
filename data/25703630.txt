Did they break windows and try to climb across barriers with secret service on the other side with guns drawn? Were they chanting about heads on pikes or about hanging Pence? Are you so completely biased that you think an group of protestors taking over an empty building without force is somehow equivalent to a group of people attacking police and literally breaking into a building occupied by congress while chanting about and actually performing violence?')
