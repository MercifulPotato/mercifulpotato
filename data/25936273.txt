When I want to buy a thing from a retail chain, I go to their site ready to search and have to click through multiple pop-ups first. No I don&#x27;t want to subscribe to whatever bullshit, no I don&#x27;t want to allow access to location data, no I don&#x27;t care about stupid cookies, no I&#x27;m not wasting time talking to a chatbot that interleaves computer generated and human generated text with unpredictable delays. Just get out of my face and let me buy the thing I&#x27;m here for. I could understand all that for, say, a news site where they need to suck you in to subscribe for them to make money, but not a retailer where you&#x27;re obviously there because you already want to buy something!')
