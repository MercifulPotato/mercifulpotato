We still don&#x27;t have the data but I think a large part of infections is happening at home were prophylactic measures are highly impractical and impossible to enforce.<p>We probably would have been able to control better the pandemic if students (of all ages) didn&#x27;t go back to school, the assumption being that students are acting as silent spreaders (due to the low morbidity in young people), reaches home and multiplies easily there.<p>But our societies are not prepared to handle this scenario so we were stuck between a rock and a hard place. Preparation between the first wave and the second wave has been also pretty poor.')
