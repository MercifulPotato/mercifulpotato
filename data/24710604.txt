Item(by='vosper', descendants=None, kids=[24711642], score=None, time=1602091995, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24709682, text='&gt; developers started feeling this part of the work wasn&#x27;t very important, and gradually moved to spending more time on delivering regular features from the Sprint, neglecting the bugs.<p>Do your developers maybe have too much autonomy, or lack an appreciation for the way bugs impact users&#x2F;customers?<p>I&#x27;ve never worked somewhere that we didn&#x27;t prioritise the backlog, with input from the Product team. You didn&#x27;t just get to skip fixing bugs because you didn&#x27;t think it was fun or interesting. Fixing bugs is part of professional engineering. And, lucky us, they&#x27;re not actually always boring.<p>Perhaps I missed something from the rest of the blog post, but it seems like a lot of this system could have been unnecessary if the backlog was properly prioritised and&#x2F;or management made sure developers were aware that bugs have to be fixed. If you have to assign bug tickets to people because they&#x27;re not getting voluntarily chosen, then you do that.<p>Edit: I agree with the point of the section that I took my quote from, which is that you need to have retrospectives&#x2F;team meetings, work on bottlenecks and processes, etc... But none of those are an excuse for not fixing bugs, they&#x27;re just hindrances.')
