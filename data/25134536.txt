But if you are within an urban setting incentivizing more vehicles (eletric or otherwise) is not a good government investment in my view.<p>I think a big issue with people that say that public transit doesn&#x27;t work for their particular use-case, or their logistics, or their 5 kids, is because they never experienced high quality, high frequency, reliable public transit.<p>This is arguably a near impossible task in Automotive-centric North and South America but it is absolutely feasible in Europe, Asia, and Africa.')
