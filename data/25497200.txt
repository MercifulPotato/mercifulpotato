Facebook is 100% in the wrong here. Apple is not blocking jack shit. Apple is just forcing Facebook to ask permission before exploiting their users. This will be harder on android because google is gonna want to make an exception for themselves. But that won&#x27;t exactly stand up in court.<p>This entire debacle is making me lean towards switching to an iPhone just for this feature alone.<p>Having said that, I currently use system-wide adblockers on my android so even if facebook was to try, they couldn&#x27;t get this info (granted, I don&#x27;t have fb installed).<p>Edit: as far as I understand it:<p>- you must ask for permission before gathering&#x2F;serving personalized data&#x2F;ads<p>- you must NOT disable any features of the app if the uses says no (similar to the tracking cookie stuff in EU)<p>- you can still display generalized ads that are not personalized.<p>(I am replying to a comment because I want to add on to it, not because I am debating against it)')
