Item(by='teddyh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611826525, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25936521, text='&gt; <i>so the world can see that we aren&#x27;t doing anything wrong here</i><p>The world will see whatever the media, in aggregate, report.  They got lucky that the first reports were “Elon Musk tweets about this quirky thing happening”, but the media will soon find another angle to the story.  The only thing selling right now is outrage, and since people can’t be quite as outraged about Trump anymore, anything to fill the void is welcomed.  You don’t have to <i>do</i> anything outrageous for the outrage maching to get you; they’ll get you anyway for whatever you were alleged to have been associated with, somebody who agreed with something somebody else claimed was from you.  Add to this that there’s huge financial pressure for this kind of thing to be put out of business, and they’re probably completely doomed.')
