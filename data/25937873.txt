Item(by='samblogs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611805405, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25936652, text='Regulations (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;r&#x2F;regsho.asp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;r&#x2F;regsho.asp</a>) exist to prevent more shares being shorted than exist. However, those lending out shares to be used in a short can demand them back. Also, banks might demand you put up more capital as a stock you shorted increased in value. But I wanted to clarify that there are regulations such that you can&#x27;t short a stock out of thin air, the stock you&#x27;re shorting must be &quot;located&quot;. Making shorting completely illegal would likely lead to irrationally high values in the market, creating more bubbles like this one.')
