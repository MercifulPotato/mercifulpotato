I have yet to encounter a single mutable variable. However, it is constantly poking at a database, and different modules communicate with each other asynchronously over a message queue.<p>Sounds like Elixir.  I&#x27;m also on a similar project but I thank my stars that I don&#x27;t <i>also</i> have to worry about mutable state at the micro-level, and that I can chisel away at my small corner of the monolith with blinders on and not worry about messing up other corners of the codebase via spooky action at a distance.<p>Sometimes, your domain&#x2F;business logic itself is just really complicated and can&#x27;t get simplified without domain level (re)organization and that&#x27;s hard as feature requests pile in and make your codebase more and more complicated.')
