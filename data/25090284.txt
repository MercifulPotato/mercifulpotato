I have a public album for sharing family pictures. It allows for comments and &#x27;likes&#x27;.<p>I have talked to my family about my privacy concerns and that I don&#x27;t want pictures of my kids on Facebook unless I approve or my kids approve. I think it is important to respect children privacy requests (my son sometimes don&#x27;t want pictures being shared) but it is a way to share memories with close family members that would enjoy the moment.')
