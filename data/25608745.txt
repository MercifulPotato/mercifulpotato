Google indexes compensation by cost of living. Not sure what the disconnect here is, since that&#x27;s the origin of the topic chain. Also not sure where you get off making claims about people&#x27;s skill levels, or who you are and what your knowledge of Google is, but you&#x27;re making some very questionable claims. There&#x27;s a reason Google has an office in Waterloo and it&#x27;s growing aggressively, and it isn&#x27;t to get lower quality or cheaper talent. Saying it&#x27;s a &quot;fraction of MTV&quot; is also exaggerating. Google pays generously in Canada.<p>Maybe you should apply and see how loose the standards are.<p>There&#x27;s no re-interview to move between offices or countries. The only &quot;interview&quot; would be to be accepted onto a team at the destination and then request the transfer. I know people who have gone both ways. For what it&#x27;s worth, these days more people seem to be coming back to Canada than the other way around. Ability to move around is actually one of the perks of Google employment.<p>As for acquisitions, I came into Google via acquisition 9 years ago. Of a company divided between US and Toronto. I am not privy to the details on North, and I haven&#x27;t met those people yet because of not being in the office due to COVID etc, but they report up into the same general product area as me. They definitely brought in many of those people as employees in Waterloo. If it&#x27;s like the acquisition I was \npart of, not everyone gets an offer, some get put on contract, etc.')
