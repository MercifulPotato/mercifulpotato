I ran them through the tools on hackerfactor.com and I see no obvious fakery.<p>I&#x27;ve heard rumors that Hunter was allegedly hacked to get them, but I have yet to see media reports of this from prior to this story breaking.  If you can provide some, please do!<p>Right now, my take is that, at best, this is an elaborate cover story for releasing real dirt and at worst, it&#x27;s legit, like the time Hunter returned a rental car with a crack pipe in it.  We&#x27;ll need to dig into it further, though, I want to see if the emails have DKIM validation with a body hash parameter, etc.')
