I&#x27;m not going to argue against the fictional legal system you&#x27;ve set up in your head.<p>The 36 Cinema stuff resulted in a <i>new</i> copyrighted derivative work: the commentary. And they can distribute that commentary all they want...but to distribute the underlying <i>films</i> as part of a <i>commercial offering</i> they need copyright licenses to those films. It&#x27;s irrelevant that the underlying films are not for sale at retail, since they can still acquire a copyright from the copyright owner.<p>Format-shifting isn&#x27;t fair use. It&#x27;s literally an act of copying that is subject to copyright protections. Format-shifting <i>might</i> be fair use, but you have to do the full analysis, and format-shifting to avoid paying for a copy in the destination format is not fair use.<p><i>That&#x27;s just one of the things that the fair-use rules and exemptions in copyright were written to help resolve positively.</i><p>Now you&#x27;re just making stuff up. 17 USC 107 sets forth the basic rules for fair use, and they&#x27;re quite limited.<p><i>When was the last time you saw a VCR?</i><p>Last week. Best Buy and Walmart still sell VCRs...Millions of people in this country still have old TVs with purely analog connections.<p><i>You are not obligated to pay for content again and again in every medium, format-shifting is also an allowable kind of fair use.</i><p>Actually, yes, you are, since each offering of the content in a different medium is a different copyrightable work subject to its own copyright. A VHS copy of a film is very different from the Bluray copy of the same film.')
