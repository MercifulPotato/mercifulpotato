Item(by='imtringued', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603269539, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24845303, text='&gt;The fact that it is possible to have a very successful career in finance as a quant or trader also seems to me like evidence the efficient market hypothesis (taken in its strongest form, that markets are perfectly efficient) is false.<p>It&#x27;s the opposite. Traders increase market efficiency up to a certain point. If traders didn&#x27;t exist then markets couldn&#x27;t be efficient in the first place. Liquidity problems would persist and cause large spreads between buy and sell prices.')
