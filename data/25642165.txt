If it’s owned by another entity, kindly explain the situation and ask them (though, that’ll be an awkward conversation, as the messages quite often have ‘do not share this code with anyone’)<p>The password reset also supports a backup email along with a ‘when did you sign up for this account’ question - for me the backup email was not working. I was able to derive the creation date via an email to my account (which was the backup email address). For me, the backup email function wasn’t working, thus sniping the mobile number from a provider was the solution.')
