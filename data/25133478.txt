However, getting twice the performance with a fanless design looks interesting, even if there is throttling after a while. For what I do, I don&#x27;t regularly wait for compiles that take ages, but having a silent computer without losing performance is a net win.<p>Curiosity got the best of me too and I ran the test on my late 2013 MBP, 2.3 GHz i7, 16 GB ram. Compilation took 44 seconds and the fans didn&#x27;t even spin up (with 23 ÂºC ambient temperature).<p>A little further down the thread [0] he gives the actual numbers, which are around 20s on the M1, which puts the i7 [1] at around 40s.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how much of this is Rust specific, but for my own projects I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference between my mbp, an old i7-3930k and a newer i5-8500. The MBP is somewhat slower, but it only has 4 cores while the others have 6.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;rikarends&#x2F;status&#x2F;1328706132752347138?s=20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;rikarends&#x2F;status&#x2F;1328706132752347138?s=2...</a><p>[1] A tweet corrects the MBP CPU as being an i7 and not an i9.')
