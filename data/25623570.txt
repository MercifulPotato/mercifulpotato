If you have a function like connectToSite, and tell it to connect to &quot;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mysite.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mysite.com&#x2F;</a>&quot;, then minification will rename connectToSite to just the letter &quot;a&quot;, but the site URL stays the same and will be easy to search for in the code. If you want to connect to www.evil.com and make it not clear, you&#x27;d have to do stuff that results in longer code, like split it up into individual characters, add number values to them to get different characters, and string cat a bunch of them together to get the final URL string.')
