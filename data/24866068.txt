Basically Uber &amp; Lyft threatened to put the initiative they wrote, on the ballot if the legislature passed AB5, which they did.<p>Uber and Lyft are now doing everything they can to get it to pass which will set up its own court fight.<p>Watching this fight I wonder &quot;Who is in charge of governing California?&quot; is it the Legislature&#x2F;Governor or is it special interests who can spend enough to put bespoke laws into effect and make bespoke changes to the state constitution?<p>California didn&#x27;t help itself when it implemented term limits which had the unpleasant side effect of never having any legislators with enough experience in the job to know how to really get things done, and so the &quot;work&quot; of writing laws has also fallen to special interests. This has never been more clear than the last 4 years where California has had a single party in both houses, and a Governor and still cannot legislate anything that special interests oppose.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the &quot;solution&quot; would be but it does not feel like it is serving the people of California well (as someone who lives here).')
