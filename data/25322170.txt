You can write Scheme procedures in C and you don&#x27;t need to gobthrough FFI.<p>As far as I know both languages have FFI. CL has CFFI, Guile has it in its standard library.<p>But can I actually ship some C code with my CL system and have ASDF take care of building it? If I want to ship CL bindings for a C library, as far as I&#x27;ve understood I need to tell users to install the library first. Maybe something like Clasp offers a C++ API?<p>Then again in both languages you can always use FFI and if things get hairy you can use grovelling.<p>With Guile, it&#x27;s really easy to have a C library and package its guile bindings in the same place. Not saying you can&#x27;t do this in CL, just that I don&#x27;t know what it would look like to ship both C and CL in the same package.<p>(author)')
