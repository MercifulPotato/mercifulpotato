He thinks the technology behind bitcoin is somehow so advanced that it is even better protected from governments than gold is.<p>Those are his main points. And I think they are both wrong. The gold example is from ancient times without KYC&#x2F;AML and absolute surveillance. There is nothing substantial you could possibly do nowadays without proper invoicing and inventory tracking. Regulators will notice instantly.<p>The tech behind bitcoin isn&#x27;t really that advanced and hiding from the government was never a focus. The tech used by regulators has evolved significantly from the times of previous &quot;defeats&quot;. People don&#x27;t realise how much work goes into tracing payments worldwide. Remember FATCA took only two years to deploy worldwide along with a roadmap to tighten control over the next decade.')
