Whether hackers can demand a ransom in crypto currency or not doesn&#x27;t change that the school district made their students&#x27; personal information vulnerable.<p>If the school feels that they cannot handle cyber security at such a level then use a typewriter for students&#x27; personal information. Once this information gets out there it can&#x27;t be unreleased.<p>Edit: I do concede that crypto currencies probably increased the amount of ransom attacks on systems. I also think that security in systems that don&#x27;t contain any PII probably isn&#x27;t as important and these attacks do affect them too.')
