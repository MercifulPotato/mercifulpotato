It&#x27;s just McDonald&#x27;s. Context matters. Maybe if it was a school, or a hospital, or a fire department, y&#x27;know something that actually matters? But it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s just McDonald&#x27;s.<p>Currently McDonald&#x27;s finances the slaughter of 67,000 cows every single day. This is a massive waste of food, water, and land resources and extremely harmful to human society. It releases massive pollution into the land, air and water. Also if you are in any way spiritual, there is the massive group karma resulting from raising billions of cows in bondage to be slaughtered with a mechanical efficiency reminiscent of the Holocaust. In a more reasonable world McDonald&#x27;s execs would be labelled criminals, but we don&#x27;t live in a reasonable world. We live in an irrational world where poor people try to defend megarich corporations from harmless pranks for basically no reason.')
