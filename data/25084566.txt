They would take their temperature at their desk and announce it as if they were doing something amazing.<p>Even worse is when I&#x27;ve worked for managers who during your review compare you to those people saying things like you should make more effort to reduce your time off sick (even if under the average yearly sick days) or make more effort to come in when you&#x27;re just feeling a &quot;bit under the weather&quot;.<p>It is a terrible attitude but it is extremely common the world over sadly.')
