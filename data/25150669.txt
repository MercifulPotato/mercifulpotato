Item(by='belorn', descendants=None, kids=[25151058], score=None, time=1605800944, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25148801, text='This article focus a lot on the technical and operational aspects of DNS and DoH, and only a single sentence about Trusted Recursive Resolver and a link.<p>The trust model in this change for improved security do not sit in the technical and operational aspects of DNS and DoH (assuming we trust the math involved in encryption that we already use for things like https). What the model depend on is the Trusted Recursive Resolver, and if we find those third-party to be more trusted than other alternatives. Mozilla is however not doing much work to convince and explain why that program should be trusted. Who verify that the logs and commitments are followed through? What is the consequences if someone fails? How can the individual user who is giving away their private data exercise control and agency?<p>In the linked document the only answer that I can find is this: The decision of who to include in (or remove from) Mozilla’s Trusted Recursive Resolver (TRR) program is at Mozilla’s sole discretion.<p>I personally do not think that is enough for me in regard to my own data. Where I live (EU) I at least got GDPR to use if my ISP decide to go rouge with my data. I also got a contract with the ISP. In additional my country have a few different government agencies that in theory could jump in. Neither of those would be an option if the data is shipped over seas.')
