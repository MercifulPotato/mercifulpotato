I have projects which I have considered open-sourcing, but haven&#x27;t because I don&#x27;t want to deal with the public maintenance and community management aspects.<p>I think there is sometimes too much pressure around what is the &quot;right way&quot; to do open source, that a project has to tick certain boxes to be a valid open-source project, and I think it&#x27;s perfectly fine for an individual to want to tinker away at a pet project on their own, and share the results with others.')
