Item(by='zeroxfe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609675746, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25620729, text='&gt; Is it easier to just run containers as root and not worry about the permissions inside of the container? If so, wouldn&#x27;t it really make more sense for the container runtime to have some sort of mechanisms in place to allow people to do what&#x27;s easy within the containers while also making sure that it has no harmful impact outside of them?<p>This is correct in principle, but very hard in practice. This is because kernel support for containers were kind of &quot;tacked on&quot; and more-or-less scattered across the code-base. And although they&#x27;re getting a lot better, there&#x27;s still no easy way to reason about their security. So a lot of the advice around permissions management and access control are a kind of defence-in-depth.<p>I&#x27;d love it if we get to a point where containers can make strong statements around security.')
