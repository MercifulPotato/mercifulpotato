There was a run of them a few years back where the quality sucked though. I had new ones where brand new out of the box one had to mash some of the keys really hard to get them to register.<p>As someone else said though, they are very susceptible to crap working its way under the membrane since its oddly shaped (and there are a bunch of individual sections IIRC). I&#x27;ve fixed the coffee on the keyboard problem a couple times by opening them up, and very carefully cleaning them (both the contacts and the membrane) with isopropyl and lint free q-tips.')
