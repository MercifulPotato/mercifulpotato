If no other companies want to host Parler, isn&#x27;t that more a reflection of Parler than the hosting companies? It doesn&#x27;t seem like they should be obligated to host, since that&#x27;s as slippery a slope as not hosting is. Perhaps this is a decision where not everyone will ever be happy, and that&#x27;s just how it&#x27;s going to be?')
