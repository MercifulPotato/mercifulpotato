I know it doesn&#x27;t matter but I think this is despicable. Facilitating someone who calls  kids who were the victim of a mass shooting crisis actors and rants about the &#x27;Jewish Mafia&#x27; and accuses Bill Gates of making people sick with vaccines <i>during a pandemic</i>, this isn&#x27;t &#x27;diversity of opinion&#x27;. It&#x27;s just greed for clicks.')
