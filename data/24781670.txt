That makes it really easy to misconfigure it in such a way that the SFTP users can get a shell, which is a giant footgun.<p>Meanwhile the biggest problem with FTPS is just that people misconfigure their own firewalls to prohibit outgoing connections to arbitrary ports for no good reason. (Spoiler alert: All the bad outgoing stuff these days is on TCP&#x2F;443).  Which fails by getting your users to complain to you to fix it, instead of failing by silently giving attackers instant RCE.')
