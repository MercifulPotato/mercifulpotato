When you encounter features you cannot do, contract them out to developers on a per-feature basis.<p>This should let you keep costs under control, while also allowing a non-programmer to figure out which features require programming and which don&#x27;t, but more importantly - break them up into the smallest features you can which decreases the risk and cost of developing it.<p>Try a few contractors by posting the features independently, and once you find a really good contractor, use him&#x2F;her for everything else directly and without a middle-man.')
