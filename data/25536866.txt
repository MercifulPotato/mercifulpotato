Sound does not require near the bandwidth of video, and I am sure you could get a decent rig setup for that price. I have been doing low-latency audio on Windows for over a decade. I have used Ableton on Windows with my Novation X-Station 25 from 2005, and I play with Extempore[1] for livecoding, and Windows has been more than adequate. I used the X-Station as my soundcard at the time, because it was better than my cheap PC at the time. I also work for the Entertainment division of an engineering company and we do (did before COVID) lots of mechanical&#x2F;structural work for Broadway.<p>[1]  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;extemporelang.github.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;extemporelang.github.io&#x2F;</a>')
