He said that honey is one of the most difficult markets for IoT.<p>What&#x27;s so hard about it? Connectivity isn&#x27;t great in NZ - there&#x27;s no phone signal in the remote places where beehives are common. Artisan beekeepers don&#x27;t care about analytics to increase their yield; they&#x27;re just doing it for fun (sometimes after retiring from other careers). Larger companies already have systems in place, or can afford the loss.<p>It seems like it would be an excellent opportunity: beehives get stolen, or overflow with honey, and the temperature and humidity of the hive have a huge outcome on the resulting product. Swarm Space or LoRaWAN might be able to help with connectivity. But the market is just really hard to get into when the customers don&#x27;t have an incentive to pay for efficiency.')
