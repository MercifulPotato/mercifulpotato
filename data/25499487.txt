Who cares about human rights and moralistic laws in a country where every government service is for sale, except for those which are needed by one of Putin&#x27;s friends, that being the only thing that trumps money?<p>What is &#x27;morally right&#x27; is just not the issue there. Russia will need to go through some major development steps before moral issues can even be meaningfully talked about.')
