Well done.<p>To me the dark theme with stars makes me think of space, horoscopes, fortune telling. Not sure if that is good.<p>All though I like it, I cannot think of a use case. Maybe you should give visitors more suggestions on how to use it. And something to get me started quickly. Maybe add a button prominently to select something I could have, like a calender (I noticed from the faq that you can import ical and rss). Or maybe by giving me a link to some interesting public rss feed. Add a long list of public time based rss feeds with import buttons?<p>i think being able to quickly get started with something even mildly useful is now missing. You have to think more about connecting &#x2F; importing existing time based (or maybe not even that) content. The customization comes later, as a next step, once I have something that I like.<p>How about git repos? Make it look interesting so people want to embed on github. Good publicity :-)')
