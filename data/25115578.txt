They had 10 minute windows available. You reserved online your spot in one of those windows. When you arrived a person at the door asked your name, checked you off the list, and gave you a pre-printed label with your information, and sent you in.<p>There were two or three people administering the vaccine, so two or three people for each 10 minute window. You went an stood in line with the others who shared your window, with the line very spread out.<p>When it was your turn you went in to get the vaccination, gave the person their your label, got vaccinated, and were sent out a side or back door so you would not cross paths with the people waiting or arriving.')
