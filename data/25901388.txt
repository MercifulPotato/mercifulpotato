But Wikipedia says:<p><i>&quot;The MCAS flight control law was implemented on the 737 MAX to mitigate the aircraft&#x27;s tendency to pitch up [...]&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;m a layman but it sure doesn&#x27;t sound like safe or normal behavior for a passenger airplane to be fundamentally designed so that it &quot;tends to pitch up&quot;... is it? Are there other airliners that do such a thing?')
