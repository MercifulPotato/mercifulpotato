They&#x27;re all analytical, and for example mechanical engineering is just applied physics and physics in practice is often about programming simulations and data processors. So, in a way, it doesn&#x27;t matter that much what you choose, as these fields have very similar &quot;feel&quot; to them, and also you can fairly easily change fields in the future.')
