We&#x27;re now at a point where every major consumer operating system now has an ARM version available.<p>You can build your own general purpose PC with ARM today. It&#x27;s not done regularly because ARM chips historically tended to be less powerful, so the type of person that went out and built their own PC wouldn&#x27;t want to build an ARM PC. This is now rapidly changing given chips like Apple&#x27;s M1 and the upcoming Arm Cortex-X1 are surpassing their x86 competitors in performance orientated benchmarks.<p>Once Microsoft gets their act together with their own version of Rosetta 2 and we reach the X2 generation, you&#x27;ll start to see a rapid shift towards ARM desktops with X1 chips in the mid-tier segment. Eventually the premium &quot;gamer&quot; tier will follow as M1 has proven that it&#x27;s possible create an ARM SoC that surpasses top tier x86 single threaded performance at a fraction of the power budget and mountains of thermal headroom. This will be accelerated by the fact Nvidia is purchasing ARM and now has massive incentive to get Nvidia discrete graphics cards paired up with ARM SoCs.')
