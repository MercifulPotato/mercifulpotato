There are the exotic hardness assumptions: are those mathematical problems really hard to solve or not? They aren&#x27;t classical, natural problems like discrete log. Then there are the odd threat models, e.g. plenty of algorithms out there claim to be proven secure in the honest-but-curious model. Although this threat model isn&#x27;t entirely naive, in the real business world &quot;honest but curious&quot; adversaries do appear in the imaginations of business leaders at least, but most people assume the point of cryptography is to keep you secure against arbitrarily malicious adversaries.')
