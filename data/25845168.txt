Went out several times in the last week for a long walk.  It&#x27;s allowed for exercise.<p>Streets were fairly busy with people.<p>The local town square was packed, every bench spot was taken.  Seems people have decided lockdown 3 is for hanging out at the local square.  Pancakes were on sale.<p>At the same time, hospital ICUs are fuller than they have ever been, some hospitals are having to reduce oxygen supply per patient due to overload, and the death rate is higher than it&#x27;s ever been.<p>And people are outside those hospitals protesting without masks that the pandemic is a hoax and hospitals are &quot;empty&quot;.  What a thing for doctors and nurses coming off shift to walk into.')
