The number of times WSJ opinions alone have declared California dead is probably 20+.<p>The thing that will stop the oft remarked upon &quot;death spiral&quot; is, ahem, the fucking CA housing market. Where there are fluctuations in expensive asset prices, people see opportunity. If housing prices in SF drop by 5%, it&#x27;s not like all the wealthy individuals who can buy just sit on the sidelines. Younger people with lesser means see opportunities to get rent control at a decent price etc. I&#x27;m looking forward to retractions of all these level zero takes when rent prices spike in July.<p>This is of course nothing new, for instance NY has gone through many ups and downs of its own and all along many in the media claimed &quot;NY is dying!&quot;')
