As another commentor said, maybe it&#x27;s the audio channels. But I can&#x27;t think of a reason I would ever personally want to tune in to audio rather than reading information, it&#x27;s just faster to read than to listen to someone &#x27;ummm&#x27; their way through a thought.<p>Of course, I still have a hard time using YouTube as a learning resource because of my preference for reading, so I&#x27;m probably an outlier here.')
