Proton has normal wine issues.  Check ProtonDB for a compatability rating  before buying any windows game on steam.<p>Most all of the games worth playing (factorio, subnautica, KPS etc) either have native linux clients or work fine via proton&#x2F;wine, but the latest and greatest non-indi titles generally don&#x27;t.  Anti-cheat&#x2F;DRM&#x2F;spyware is a linux killer because it wants to inspect the operating system during play.  Whatever the latest batman game is called... it probably doesn&#x27;t work.')
