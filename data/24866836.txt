What the author states is not just &quot;10 tomato plants per person&quot;. But it is &quot;10 tomato plants per person per year&quot;. In this calculation, the plant&#x27;s CO2 respiration during life is considered, but not the CO2 respiration after death.<p>So that means to compensate for the stated amount of CO2, you need to plant 10 tomato plants extra each year (the second year you would have 20, the third year you would have 30, etc.). That is not taken into account that it is challenging to overwinter plants outside.<p>According to the first referenced article[1], the tomato plant stores the largest part of the CO2 in its fruits. If you eat your freshly grown fruits, you will respirate (a large amount of) this CO2 again.<p>Besides that, I enjoyed the read. I had nine tomato plants on my balcony this past summer. They take a lot of room and a lot of work, but it is lovely to eat your own homegrown fruits. I can recommend it to anyone! I only think the calculation is way off.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lessco2.es&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;noticias&#x2F;ponencia_cisc_ingles.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lessco2.es&#x2F;pdfs&#x2F;noticias&#x2F;ponencia_cisc_ingles.pdf</a>')
