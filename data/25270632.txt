And in fact, lots of middle class people become wealthy and manage that wealth fine.<p>The real difference is whether you were raised in poverty or not. Because poverty imparts a very different psychology on a lot of people.<p>Many raised in poverty have the mentality that you had better spend money while you have it, because it will eventually run out or be taken from you. Maybe stolen by someone on the street, but more likely stolen through bank fees lending schemes and other institutional grifts.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that poverty can&#x27;t lead to the extreme opposite, which is to hold on to and save every penny. But either way, poverty can have a strong effect on people.')
