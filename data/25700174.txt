Case in point: One of the men in the Capitol building was John Sullivan, founder of a pro-BLM protest organization. If specific tools of mayhem were brought to this event, then specific individuals can be identified who own those tools. Those individuals should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, and that’s that. You don’t get to use some vague cloud of evidence to declare that a conspiracy to armed insurrection existed here—we need the same standard of evidence that is e.g. required of Trump to prove his claims of election fraud.')
