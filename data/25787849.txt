Also Debian denotes versions in official notices and it&#x27;s widespread in internet so, codenames are not hindering anything in practice.<p>OTOH, codenames play a bigger role in the ecosystem. It adds motivation, fun and sense of originality. I love to have them, I love they&#x27;re in fact Toy Story characters.<p>It makes it almost lifelike and masks the burden of maintaining one of the biggest distro projects in the existence.<p>While I love minimalism and utility, I think Debian should keep these. It&#x27;s fun, memorable and original.')
