Item(by='Mountain_Skies', descendants=None, kids=[25808253], score=None, time=1610853787, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25807298, text='I&#x27;ve had both a deluxe $500 washlet seat and a cheap $50 model. They both get the job done but if it fits in the budget, the more pricy model is worth it for the water temperature control alone. Due to the mechanical nature of the item, this is one of the few things I&#x27;d buy an extended warranty on if available. The $500 model lasted about five years before it died, which I suspect was caused by several watermain issues rather than a manufacturing defect or misuse. Stepping down to the $50 model was a bit of an adjustment and a minor quality of life reduction.')
