Item(by='madaxe_again', descendants=None, kids=[24978251], score=None, time=1604396517, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24976628, text='I bought my first RPi six months ago, and now I have four (two 4s, two zeros), and six arduinos.<p>My uses are all brutally utilitarian.<p>One pi 4 is openhab, grafana, mqtt broker etc., and the other is doing all the network gumph - vpns, qos, Wi-Fi ap, Bluetooth presence, LoRa. One zero is a controller in a micro hydro system I’m building, the other runs a couple of remote cameras.<p>The arduinos are being used in a lora sensor network, using dinky batteries and solar panels - they’re so low power it’s ridiculous - most of them using ultrasonic rangefinders to measure depth in tanks (water, gasoline) and monitor river levels here and upstream - we live in a mill, so being able to see the delta-h will hopefully save us from a surprise flood this winter. The government operated river gauges were all destroyed in the floods last year, and haven’t yet been replaced. I’m managing to build serviceable river gauges for under €100 a pop - I might have to see if they’re interested, as I think their issue is money - they use these big mechanical gauges that I can’t see being cheap.<p>Another arduino is a weather station, and the last one for now is controlling a valve way, way uphill that I got bored of walking to.<p>Over the winter I intend to build out a heap of arduino&#x2F;lora irrigation control valves, and am toying with sapping a tiny amount of energy from the water with an impeller to power the things - my ultimate aim here is to automate everything that reasonably can be, so we have more time to do the things that can’t be.<p>Also, damn, it’s fun to be tinkering again - 15 years of working in tech kinda killed my passion for playing with tech, but it turns out it’s still there.')
