Though I don&#x27;t remember python behaving this way, exactly, in terms of ignoring attempted use of non-existent variables.<p>&gt; you don&#x27;t find out until you run the app and hit that code path.<p>The real problem was that we didn&#x27;t -- or rather, he didn&#x27;t -- even find out then, since it just looked like the variable was somehow holding nil, instead of the variable not actually existing. It looked like there was some other reason for the variable accidentally being nil -- and when you&#x27;re a total beginner, it could be nearly anything.<p>This setup is just...it&#x27;s plainly more beginner-hostile than a compiler&#x2F;runtime simply telling the coder that there&#x27;s a problem, what the problem is, and what line it&#x27;s at. So I don&#x27;t understand the people talking up Lua like it&#x27;s great for beginners.<p>But yeah, I definitely dislike dynamically typed languages in general. Having static typing with type inference ala Kotlin just seems to be much better all around.')
