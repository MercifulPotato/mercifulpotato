But the standards applied to financial transactions are <i>way</i> more stringent than other businesses. KYC&#x2F;AML laws basically create an affirmative obligation for financial institutions to proactively determine whether each and every customer is engaged in illegal activity.<p>Unlike in other businesses, it&#x27;s not enough to just say that you weren&#x27;t aware of your customers intentions. Unless you&#x27;ve taken efforts to affirm that all their activity is legal, you can be criminally liable.<p>If some guy walks into a bakers and asks, &quot;What&#x27;s the best cannoli to bring alone to a mob hit&quot;, then the baker is obligated not to do business with him. But the equivalent of KYC&#x2F;AML would require the baker to verify and document that none of the pastries are being used for illegal activity.')
