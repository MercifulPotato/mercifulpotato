That was until I touched the screen with my palm. Then all hell broke loose - the app got stuck imagining there are some input events happening in the middle of the screen, so every attempt at drawing created a squiggly mess - every nth point dropped by my pen got connected with an imaginary point in the middle of the screen, and then back to my drawing.')
