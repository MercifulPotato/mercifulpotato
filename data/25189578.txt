We are a vocal group who on the whole have a decent understanding of the mechanisms used to influence people, and if we didn&#x27;t have ad-blockers, we would complain loudly, entertain alternatives, or try to subvert the comfortable business model that is targetted advertising. We&#x27;d raise awkward questions, constantly.<p>As the author points out, to our eyes the internet is unusable without an ad-blocker. With an ad-blocker, it is somewhat OK, and with it we grudgingly accept the status quo. This is fine as far as those platforms are concerned. The working ad-blocker is our pacifier.<p>We are being tolerated.')
