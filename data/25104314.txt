There are several concerns, and while there were some ideas put forward, and some patches applied to non-mainline Linux trees, all of those are untested. Values for the NTC were taken from some random datasheet on the internet in the hopes most 10kOhm NTCs have a similar R-T characteristic (they don&#x27;t), and that the random datasheet I picked matches NTC that&#x27;s in the battery.<p>Just to give you a perspective on the level of quality of existing solution.<p>It&#x27;s better than before, though.')
