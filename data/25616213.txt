If you&#x27;re going by core time, then it assumes you&#x27;re serial which is never the case.<p>That also doesn&#x27;t include rendering multiple shots at once. It&#x27;s all about parallelism.<p>Finally, those frame counts for a film only assume final render. There&#x27;s a whole slew of work in progress renders too, so a given shot may be rendered 10-20 times. Often they&#x27;ll render every other frame to spot check and render at lower resolutions to get it back quick.')
