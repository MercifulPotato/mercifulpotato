You can get a 64-bit PC on eBay shipped to you for &lt;$50. 10+ years old but will still run the latest Windows or Linux.<p>If phones worked like this, people would keep them for many more years, but there would still be more than enough 10+ year old phones available for a close approximation to the shipping cost.<p>It would also mean that the older phones would go to poor countries that could still use them instead of being slag, because &quot;slow but runs current software&quot; is usable whereas &quot;not even old enough to be slow but can&#x27;t run current software&quot; means you can&#x27;t use the thing because websites will throw certificate errors from missing roots, apps won&#x27;t run on it and it will be full of known vulnerabilities and get malware.')
