I just means there&#x27;s a little XML document embedded in your dependencies that 99% of developers never pay attention to, whether they&#x27;re using Maven or ant or any other build tool. It&#x27;s entirely irrelevant.<p>Secondly, Gradle does not require you to learn Groovy. Use Kotlin if that&#x27;s your thing - I get the impression that&#x27;s the preferred DSL nowadays anyways.<p>Sadly I think those are the only two reasons really presented. Neither is especially convincing. IDE support seems just fine for both platforms.<p>I actually _like_ Gradle and I think I could come up with a longer list of things about it that aggravate me. But either way, use whatever build system you want, and if, as stated, their projects have fairly humble requirements build-wise, I&#x27;m sure either system will get the job done.')
