Moreover many citizens, especially those who have savings, hate inflation and will fight against such a trend.  Taxes and various other &quot;resource extraction&quot; also are limited because more and more citizens will fight against such measures, up to deliberately reducing their income or living the country.<p>A business can in a way &quot;print money&quot; and &quot;extract resources&quot; by raising its prices. In many trades their customers will remain customers because switching would be more expensive.  But there is also an obvious limit there: the amount of prospects will decline and at a given point more and more customers will depart.')
