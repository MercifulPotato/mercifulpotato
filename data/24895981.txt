Someone whose intent is to gain access to your father will bring you money bags.<p>Hunter Biden has a bachelors degree in history and no real life experience. He got himself a very nice position that he clearly didn&#x27;t earn.<p>During the primary when this Burisma thing came out originally; NYPost no doubt investigated it and found much more information. Then sat on it until the most damaging moment. Very unlikely that these are lies and really the Biden campaign hasn&#x27;t denied it. The reality is that Joe Biden was probably too busy to see his son selling his influence. Joe Biden is probably quite innocent, his silver spoon son on the other hand...<p>Then Twitter pulled the censorship trigger a little too fast. You can see the bias for yourself. Wikipedia calls this whole Burisma thing an unevidenced conspiracy theory. Is it really unevidenced? An objective viewer can see the evidences. Is it really a conspiracy theory? I really don&#x27;t think so.<p>MSNBC&#x27;s response to this burisma ordeal is to assert that the NY Post is a tabloid that regularly reports known false stories. They never really attacked the evidences or story. They just outright attacked the ny post calling it unreliable.<p>This is such a great story though. You can use it to identify your echo chamber. the polls seem to be saying biden is going to win HUGE. My echo chambers I am in seem to think Trump is literally hitler who is killing mexicans. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.msn.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;trump-is-trailing-so-far-in-polls-that-hunter-biden-scandal-has-little-impact-gop-pollster&#x2F;ar-BB1alMtA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.msn.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;trump-is-trailing-so...</a><p>November 4th is going to be an exciting day to see if my echo chambers are right or wrong.')
