They are based in San Jose, California.<p>While they may have shut down activist accounts in China before that is more likely because they want to maintain their unblocked status in China for business reasons.<p>It is also possible that Zoom must cooperate with Chinese authorities in providing local user information to maintain their unblocked status, that is true about all Microsoft and Apple products as well and true about several other countries besides China as well. Your information shouldn&#x27;t be touching servers in China unless you are communicating to or from China.<p>That said, personally, I don&#x27;t fully trust anyone&#x27;s end-to-end claims unless the client is open source OR protocol is open for third-party clients.')
