They really designed it nicely. It was a different set of registers that worked normally. The permute instructions were very useful! When trying to port AltiVec code to Intel SSE at the time, it would often come out worse because of all the constraints. You couldn&#x27;t intermix floating point and SSE code because they used the same registers. There were stalls if you did as it switched back and forth. A friend actually hired Intel engineers to port his AltiVec code to Intel at the time and even they couldn&#x27;t make it work as fast as it was on his PPC Mac. So I&#x27;m hoping the Neon instructions bring back some of the elegance and sanity we had in the PPC&#x2F;AltiVec days.')
