You&#x27;ve completely ignored the difference between the actual goals of the &quot;far-left extremists&quot; and those of these Trump supporters. You&#x27;ve completely ignored the difference in harm done by a protest turning violent and damaging a business and a group storming the US Capitol to overturn the results of a democratic election in the most powerful nation on Earth. The details matter and to simply throw up your hands and kvetch about vague &quot;extremism&quot; deflects responsibility from the individuals and ideologies which promote attacks on democracy.<p>This kind of cowardly equivocation in the face of fascism is <i>exactly</i> how the events of yesterday were allowed to happen. Your attitude — sadly held by too many Americans — is pathetic and it will not solve the problem of right wing extremism.<p>1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;5886348&#x2F;report-peaceful-protests&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;5886348&#x2F;report-peaceful-protests&#x2F;</a>')
