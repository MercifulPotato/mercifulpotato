Item(by='roryokane', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610078235, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25678244, text='Euro Truck Simulator 2 is the most realistic street driving simulator I know of, and it includes roads in the U.K. I found it good driving practice when I hadn&#x27;t driven for a while (as I don&#x27;t own a car).<p>ETS2 only comes with trucks as driveable vehicles. A lot of the skills are the same as driving normal cars, but trucks have more gears, are larger, and accelerate more slowly. Truck cabs also don&#x27;t have rear-view mirrors; to look backward you have to either use side mirrors or stick your head out the window.<p>I have seen mods that add normal cars to drive. I downloaded one of those mods but haven&#x27;t tried installing it. I&#x27;m not sure if those mods unlock the cars from the start or if you have to first save up for and buy five trucks to unlock the in-game online vehicle ordering catalog (which takes many hours of gameplay).')
