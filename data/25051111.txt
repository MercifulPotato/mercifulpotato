I mean, sure, we need some amount of polling because it informs decisions such as who gets to participate in televised debates, etc.  But other than that, what does the general public get out of polling?  It&#x27;s a spectator sport.  In the end, all that matters is the votes, and people should really be encouraged to remember this.  I&#x27;d think 2016 and 2020 would be a healthy reminder of that.')
