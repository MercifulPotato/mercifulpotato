Item(by='Alupis', descendants=None, kids=[25694644], score=None, time=1610154741, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25693890, text='Intel has been stuck on the same process since at least 2018, and continually delayed their next node process.<p>Right now current estimates put Intel&#x27;s 7nm node at least 2-3 years away... and that&#x27;s after all the delays that they have already experienced. It&#x27;s so bad, Intel is seriously considering outsourcing chip production for not just GPU&#x27;s, but CPU&#x27;s as well - that means Intel believes it&#x27;s in a really bad position.<p>By the time Intel finally gets their 7nm process working at acceptable yields... 7nm will be old news. TSMC is working on 5 and 4nm processes right now, and of course AMD will be using them to their advantage at the earliest date possible.<p>Meanwhile, Samsung shipped AMD chips for Ryzen 1 (and 2?), and is producing GPU chips for AMD to this day. TSMC is producing Ryzen 3 (and possibly other things for AMD). Both companies will be producing <i>something</i> for Intel soon, it seems.<p>Like it or not, Samsung is obviously producing things Intel cannot.<p>Clearly, allowing Intel to use current state-of-the-art fab processes from whichever company at the time happens to be the best is a sure winner for Intel.')
