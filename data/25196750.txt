The two main reasons for the fact that we decided on just gender and age are on the one hand the more data you ask for, the less people will take the time and effort to start the survey (so we wanted to make the &quot;barrier&quot; for participation as minimal as possible). On the other hand, this study has been designed completely in alignment to approvals by the ethics committee of our university and they demanded us to gather as little as possible &quot;personal&quot; data of the participants.\nI hope that explanation helps a little bit. Thank you for your support!')
