None of them injured all of them were not direct falls most of them were scrapes along walls. I&#x27;ve also seen way more people fall from step ladders two or three feet tall and get injured worse. One case in the early 90s a painter exterior work about 32 ft tall fell from maybe 26 ft his primary concern was not spilling his paint landed in a koi pond on his butt didn&#x27;t spill the drop of paint.')
