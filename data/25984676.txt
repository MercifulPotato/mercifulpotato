I asked her what her plans were and she said she was unsure. She then listed off a few places and finally said &quot;probably Miami because that&#x27;s where everyone I know is going.&quot;<p>Now, take this with a grain of salt, but this person has lots, and I mean lots, of friends in NYC. All of which primarily work in the tech, art, finance, or advertising field. I didn&#x27;t think much of it, and moved on with the conversation. Then, I see this post. My first thought is &quot;Oh, ok. She&#x27;s just repeating whatever Twitter or media is click-baiting now.&quot; Googling Miami and looking through the news, I couldn&#x27;t find anything except one article.<p>Now I can&#x27;t confirm what my friend told me, but this was a casual conversation and she has quite a large social circle. Always keeping up with everyone, and keeping everyone updated about everyone else. Miami might not be a tech hub, but something is happening, and it isn&#x27;t being noticed. When unnoticed massive change is taking place, opportunities are usually right around the corner.')
