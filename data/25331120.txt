With the same downside that individuals are usually much worse judges of projects than institutions, so what you gain in reduced costs you lose in high risk.<p>Then comes the blockchain bit, which suffers exactly the same problem of every project I&#x27;ve seen like this which is there is no technological way to tie the tokens to the energy use. Saving energy cannot &#x27;generate&#x27; tokens, therefore you have to come up with a contract that ties the energy savings value to the value of the tokens. In which case there is basically no difference to just using cash since all the &#x27;security&#x27; of the arrangement comes from contractual obligations, which are easier to create and more reliable to enforce using regular currency.')
