His neighbor in the trailer park made amateur porn websites, so he pretty much learned web development purely in the context of pornography.  He was addicted to meth and came to SF looking for a job and the free methodone treatment. His laptop got stolen so I gave him an old Macbook I had lying around and told him to check out Codecademy.<p>I was hoping to get a feel-good story out of it after reading about Leo (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;leo-the-homeless-coder-2015-2015-4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;leo-the-homeless-coder-2015-...</a>), but the truth of the situation is he simply wasn&#x27;t skilled or educated enough to actually learn computer science or even get past a phone interview (meth really ruins one&#x27;s ability to maintain a train of thought). Somebody told him the legends of high-paying tech jobs in SF, and reality was a harsh teacher <i>like it is to many people everywhere</i>. He lived in shelters and on the streets for a while until he lost his phone, which was my only way of connecting with him. Haven&#x27;t seen him on the streets for years and no idea what ended up happening with him.<p>My point being that people have really complex reasons for being homeless in SF and it&#x27;s hard to put everyone into distinct groups, but for the most part your camps describe at least 90% of homeless people I&#x27;ve seen.')
