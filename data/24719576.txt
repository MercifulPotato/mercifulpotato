Paying dues is the same thing as joining. In Europe we don&#x27;t do that, you just go to a site and say you want to join and then you are in a union and you don&#x27;t pay to any union if you don&#x27;t. no need to vote or talk to colleagues about anything, that is just stupid. I can join and leave a union whenever I want, if USA had such unions then they would already have huge union participation among software engineers and we wouldn&#x27;t need these stupid discussions since you could join a union if you want and I could ignore it if I want, you don&#x27;t have to convince your colleagues to join just because you want one.')
