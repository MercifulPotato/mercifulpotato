Biden and his son&#x27;s ukraine, russia, china, etc endeavors are just as bad or worse.<p>&gt;  One candidate built up a mob and pointed them at the Capitol in an attempted coup.<p>Right. And no rioting from biden&#x27;s side.<p>The only people who think like you are brainwashed political zealots. You are part of the problem. The only difference between you and a tea party or trumpist is political party affiliation. That&#x27;s it. And it doesn&#x27;t really matter because DNC and RNC are ultimately on the same team. They serve the same master. And it isn&#x27;t the american people.<p>But whatever, you do you and keep up the good fight.<p>I may be mistaken, but you sound like the type who cries about &quot;privileged white males&quot;. But man, you sure do love Biden.')
