At best, you produce a day&#x27;s worth of code in a day, but you also require someone to manage you closely to make sure you code the right stuff.<p>This seems to miss the point of teams. Everyone should have a role if you hire someone as a software engineer and they spend all their time doing devops because they like it more you&#x27;ve made a bad hire. If all your engineers are having product meetings with various departments then you&#x27;ve again made bad hires. Everyone should have their role and fullfill that role to work as a successful team. People thinking they&#x27;re above fullfilling the role they were hired for is one of the fast ways to have a poor performant team. To put this into sports you don&#x27;t want your defender to be constantly hanging around the other team&#x27;s goal mouth.')
