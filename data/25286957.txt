I mean compilers should empower that, allowing for good, readable code that compiles to blazing fast code.<p>That&#x27;s the theory anyway, but I know in practice it&#x27;s different.<p>I keep thinking of my time working on iOS software, where I experienced the transition from objective-C to ARC to Swift; it still felt like the end result was the same, if not even better (Swift whole-module optimization), but the developer ergonomics were much improved.<p>Still kinda miss xcode, a shame it&#x27;s not really usable for anything that isn&#x27;t obj-C&#x2F;Swift.')
