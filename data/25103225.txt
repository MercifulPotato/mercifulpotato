The Tesla Model S came out in 2012? How much has it improved by 2020? 100kW instead of 75kW? At the same price?<p>Yes, I know soothsayers claim battery packs are $100&#x2F;kwh, but even at those prices, we are seeing $100k pickups with roughly equivalent capabilities to a $45k ICE version. Factor in 200k mile lifetime with 20mpg and $3&#x2F;gallon fuel, and an electric pickup is still a hard sale.<p>Iâ€™m skeptical the industry will make a 2030 deadline.')
