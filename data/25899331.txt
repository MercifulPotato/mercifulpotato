Why do we keep electing prosecutors to the high offices?  Why do so many prosecutors feel they are good if they can put away the baddies for a long time?  I wish we would promote and elect more defenders because they seem like the only people who see that the people facing life in prison and a family thrown into poverty are not &quot;they&quot; but are &quot;we&quot;.')
