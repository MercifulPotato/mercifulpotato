And Google is  all over the map as usual, OpenPOWER, ARM, RISC-V. And I would not be surprised if they roll their own just like AWS. Marvell has ARM offering as well. ( They really should consider buying Ampere ) So it does seems like Server ARM CPU are consolidating to a few players anyway. And Despite what they claim, Ampere and Graviton 2 are pretty much customised from ARM&#x27;s Server SoC reference design.<p>Apple will have a super large M1 like design for future Mac Pro. What I am interested in is if Apple would use this, assuming rack mountable Mac Pro for their own DataCenter usage? ( i.e Installing Linux )  Or Bring back Xserve?')
