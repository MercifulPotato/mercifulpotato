Which I can understand, but in practice when I need a parser in my day job I usually don&#x27;t have much say in the structure of the input &quot;language&quot; (since I&#x27;m usually parsing something coming from another source that I have little control over). And it would seem if you have an instructor in a compilers course with this point of view, what other class would give you an opportunity to learn parsing in a formal setting?')
