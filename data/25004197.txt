Manual memory management would just be yet another roadblock.<p>Again, I think the complex industry solutions are more harmful here. These kids don&#x27;t need to make Call of Duty 3. They are more at the Pong skill level. A tool that is far simpler and far less featureful is superior here.<p>When they get older and need to use Unity or Unreal or whatever, they can switch without having lost much.')
