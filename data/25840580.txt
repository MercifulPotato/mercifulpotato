My first paycheck (was printed on a dot matrix printer and paid in cash) I framed and put on the wall.<p>Making great money now - and I loved those jobs.<p>The news here is that apple cut off a subcontractor. It does take time to shift supply chains. I wish these folks trashing apple spent even 10% of their effort on the cheapo android phone companies. Environment, device longevity, privacy, supply chain issues etc - I&#x27;m convinced some of these activists are getting funding from these crap companies because they turn such a blind eye to what is rampant and truly terrible behavior in other supply chains.')
