I use various tools that haven&#x27;t been updated for many years but have been easy to keep working as Linux userspace has changed. For closed-source things indeed it&#x27;s different.<p>Closed source or <i>unmaintained</i>. Setting up build environments is such a chore with a high probability of conflict that people often use docker containers for it. On top of that, compiling unmaintained older software yourself often requires enough knowledge to dig into the code and correctly fix the errors that have been introduced by API changes. Personally, I find it easier to try and get old binaries working instead.<p>Besides, closed source software not only exists, but also describes some of the most popular professional tools in existence.<p>&gt; The example was ffmpeg. You&#x27;re right that there probably aren&#x27;t that many examples of common libraries of that size. But Qt is a good example and why shouldn&#x27;t it be reasonable to use it and not have a burden placed on me to provide security updates?<p>Windows provides both its own media and GUI layers. I don&#x27;t see why Windows should be expected to maintain any alternatives people choose to use.<p>&gt; If I am writing an app and want to use something like libcurl, I would prefer not to have the onus placed on me to monitor and distribute libcurl security updates for the rest of my life, especially if this is just a hobby project. Suddenly I am taking on the role and responsibility akin to a whole Linux distribution, and all because I wanted to write some silly little app.<p>Your choices as a developer have consequences! Windows has its own APIs for this. If you don&#x27;t want the burden of maintaining a non-platform dependency <i>then don&#x27;t use one</i>. If it is &quot;just a hobby project&quot; and you don&#x27;t want to update your dependencies then just don&#x27;t. The alternative is being beholden to third party volunteers to keep your software both available and working.')
