It&#x27;s been nothing short of a joy to work with (even though there have certainly been some beginner frustrations). Vue presents topics clearly and implements them in ways that allow me to be productive without getting caught up in the Webpack and transpiler madness. For the same point from Swimm - you can add as much or as little Vue to a project (can personally attest to this point).<p>Vue is less ceremonious than Angular and that&#x27;s a huge selling point in my opinion. I have pity on folks who have to learn Angular.<p>I&#x27;ve never touched React. Given that React is so popular, (I imagine) there to exist a superb amount of info on the web targeted towards beginner and getting started audiences to make it difficult to wade through all of the bullshit. There&#x27;s significantly less bullshit on the web about Vue which I find helpful because that generally means the existing content is not totally beginning oriented. Maybe I&#x27;m biased on this topic idk.')
