Traffic simulation is incredibly hard, and its very fun to resolve that issue (or &quot;attempt&quot; to resolve the issue). To truly solve traffic problems requires you to understand how and why all the cars are moving the way they do.<p>The main issue IMO with City Skylines, is that once you &quot;solve&quot; the traffic problem (which is almost always a combination of Highway -&gt; 3-way Artery road with few intersections -&gt; &quot;cul-de-sac&quot; style distribution of cars to their final endpoints + a few mass-transit options), there&#x27;s nothing else to the game. All problems start, and end, with traffic management.<p>As such, if you&#x27;re already a &quot;traffic expert&quot; (due to playing games like Factorio or OpenTTD beforehand), you can quickly build an optimal City Skylines setup and then have not much else to do.<p>SimCity was truly a game with multiple dimensions. Skylines is mostly a traffic simulatior (a good one, but still... &quot;just&quot; a traffic simulator).')
