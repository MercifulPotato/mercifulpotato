It’s yellowed and littered with turds to stand in. I run both platforms side by side and the Mac is by far the least painful. Windows 10 on an average day is like gargling sand. I mean for two months now alt-tab is broken on 20H2 release. No fix incoming yet. Zero days unpatched for 90 days etc. On WSL it’s a networking and HyperV encrusted nightmare. Have fun trying to get anything vaguely complicated to do anything even remotely sane.  Total shit show.<p>A fine comparison is the windows App Store which is genuinely like playing Russian roulette with a gun made of butter. The Mac App Store is much much much less crazy.<p>The Mac has its fair share of suck but my word at least they actually tried to put something cohesive together.<p>Going to put it honestly but I don’t think Microsoft are earning my respect or attention, just shouting about how wonderful their product is while it’s falling to pieces in my hands.')
