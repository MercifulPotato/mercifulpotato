If this is indeed the price and it&#x27;s a one-time cost without costly maintenance overheads (such as ongoing audits) I might just pay that to be able to release simple money management or just better UIs than the existing banks (even modern bank&#x27;s apps have gotten worse lately as they try to push their &quot;premium&quot; offerings - looking at Monzo specifically here).')
