Then everything you say gets live-streamed to anyone who’s dialed into your show.<p>Fans and friends (and foes, if you want) can call a Capiche FM show’s number to listen on a phone call (yup: every show has its own phone number), or just open a new tab and stream the show online from the show&#x27;s page. Hosts can invite anyone on air to chat live, too.&quot;<p>EDIT:\nHonestly your help page is great. Concise description about what it is and how to use it. You should consider bringing some of that content to the homepage. The skateboarding heart person is neat, but I&#x27;d rather you tell me about the product.')
