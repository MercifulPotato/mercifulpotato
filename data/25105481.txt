Globalisation just made it a lot faster. So there will be imbalances and local system collapsing and temporary a dominating species etc., but alltogether the diversity of species will be increased, with fast global exchange. Because there are more candidates to fill a niche.<p>Local established ones still have a home bonus. Their DNA is adopted to the local climate and soil, unlike the invaders. They won&#x27;t vanish anytime soon.<p>The thing really threatening diversity are monoculture fields with pesticides.')
