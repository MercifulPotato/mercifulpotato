The mind reels.<p>Yup. This mentality drives me absolutely insane. People seem to regurgitate whatever propaganda fake-open-source-company-X tells them.<p>Sorry, I&#x27;m not going to feel bad that the $15B company that built their business off the backs of open source - which is totally fine - is upset that another company is competing with them. And the biggest irony is, Amazon&#x27;s not eating Elastic&#x27;s lunch, they&#x27;re both eating respectable lunches. Elastic&#x27;s built a great business, which they are now doing their best to ruin as quickly as possible.')
