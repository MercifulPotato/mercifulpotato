If so much spend on ads is required to generate revenue growth then there will either never be profits or the revenue growth will stall (and thus the equity is worth rather little), if ads are not required then why are they spending so much on them, or maybe when will they stop spending.<p>All the &quot;heroes&quot; of the tech boom (Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft) did not suffer from this problem - they were profitable before going public.<p>It feels like this time we&#x27;re in an advertising bubble. Nearly every single S-1 submitted to HN has this feature.<p>I am genuinely puzzled by this, if someone can offer some perspective on how can you model something like this I would be grateful - what assumptions you&#x27;d be making here.')
