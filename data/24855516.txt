Also the trains are notoriously unpunctual, and expensive compared to other EU countries. The cause of the internet seems to be a mix of the mobile frequency auctions that didn’t leave any money for a good network combined with low competition. The trains also have pretty bad incentives for infrastructure, eg they can have the state pay for rebuilding a line and not for maintaining it, so they wait till it breaks.<p>The Swiss model seems to be to think of the consequences of policies before putting them in place, the lower taxes seem to be more of a result of that.<p>(I’ve lived in all three countries, this is my impression)')
