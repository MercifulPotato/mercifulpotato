Now I&#x27;m not advocating that ISIS videos should be allowed, but if you are in fact thinking &quot;there are no buts&quot; than you should have been shouting loudest at those times, because if you only shout when someone you agree with is being &quot;censored&quot; it suddenly seems much more that you only care about your freedom to say what you want, not the freedom for everyone to say anything.')
