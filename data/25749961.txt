Remember the $999 MBA is only 8GB RAM &amp; 256GB SSD. It&#x27;s not exactly a good configuration, and Apple&#x27;s upgrade pricing means it quickly becomes a $1400-$1600 MBA when you give it modern specs on those two aspects.<p>The X1 Titanium Yoga then offers a touch screen, a better aspect ratio, convertible usage, and significantly faster multi-core performance, at least in bursts. That can easily be worth another $400 depending on the use case &amp; personal preferences. It&#x27;s also fully possible the X1 Titanium Yoga will be overpriced, of course.')
