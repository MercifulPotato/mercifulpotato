That&#x27;s a pretty common setup in VR software.<p>I learned to mouse right handed because that&#x27;s always where the mice were (and often specifically shaped for right hands). Other peripherals like joysticks and throttles tend to be set up that way as well. First person shooters always have all their characters holding items in their right hand, even if that doesn&#x27;t affect gameplay.<p>But in VR the two controllers are often equals - they&#x27;re your hands, and you can use whichever one of them you like. There&#x27;s a ping pong paddle or a lightsaber or a laser gun, and the game doesn&#x27;t care what hand you pick it up with. The lightsaber dojo clip I posted has me using the sabre with my left hand the whole time, but you can even pass it from one to the other mid-game if you want to.<p>Probably not exciting for all you righties, but I enjoy it.')
