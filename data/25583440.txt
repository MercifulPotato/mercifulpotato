And we don&#x27;t need two eyes to gauge depth. Neither does a machine, but adding stereoscopic cameras is not hard.<p>The stereoscopic effect is very poor on driving distances, doesn&#x27;t help us that much. Primarily we use clues form the environment to gauge distances. We also have to focus our eyes to the correct distance - that also tells us how far an object is.<p>Primarily we have had an insane amount of training to understand our world. An understanding that a self-driving car will never achieve unless singularity happens. It might not need that, but it will need other ways to compensate for it.')
