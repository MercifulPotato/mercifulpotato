The thought crossed my mind but I didn&#x27;t know if the effort&#x2F;cost would be worth it.<p>It&#x27;s been awesome, really. I run Pleroma[1], which is magnitudes lighter than Mastodon, and I can comfortably run it on my Raspberry Pi, from home. And due to the nature of ActivityPub, my server going down doesn&#x27;t mean I miss out on messages&#x2F;mentions etc. It all federates when I come back online.<p>&gt; Also, how much of your curated feed is Mastodon-like, and how much is other kinds of content? Been poking around at blog platforms that connect to the fediverse and would love to hear some insight if you have any.<p>It&#x27;s all mostly just Mastodon&#x2F;Pleroma and PeerTube on the occasion. The other stuff doesn&#x27;t get too much traction across the network, at least from my experience.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pleroma.social" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pleroma.social</a>')
