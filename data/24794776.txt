But we never succeeded, and over a time span of decades, <i>lots</i> of coding conventions start to resemble premature optimization, making it painful for modern eyes to look at this old code.<p>In fact the latter may be the stumbling block for automated translation. If the old code wasn&#x27;t so &#x27;quirky&#x27; (read: byzantine as hell) we would have ported it already.')
