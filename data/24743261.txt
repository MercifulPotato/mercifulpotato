I didn&#x27;t pay attention to what it really claims to be, but made a connection with the Crockford book, and started mentioning in discussion with acquaintances that it&#x27;s a subset of JS (it must be because that&#x27;s what the community wanted).<p>Lo and behold, one of them heard TS is a &quot;superset&quot;, not a subset, and dissed me as a knowledgeable tech person, despite himself knowing so little that barely weeks ago he didn&#x27;t know the difference between Java and Javascript.<p>Sorry, I&#x27;m done with this mess.')
