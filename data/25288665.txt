I&#x27;m sure you didn&#x27;t mean it, but your comment gives the impression that <i>all</i> &quot;organic&quot; food is a shame. There are plenty of sustainable farms that don&#x27;t use harmful pesticides. It&#x27;s unfortunate the word has become what it has, but it&#x27;s not a catch-all one way or the other.')
