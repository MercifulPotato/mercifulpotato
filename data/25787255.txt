The justice.gov link explicitly states:<p>&quot;SULLIVAN is the leader of an organization called Insurgence USA through which he organizes protests&quot;<p>He is not a Trump supporter. He&#x27;s a professional rioter and instigator. This is filed Jan 13, well after your supposed &quot;debunking&quot; media spin from Jan 8. The affidavit filed indicates Sullivan was there to instigate and turn a peaceful protest into violence.<p>Nobody is stating there were zero Trump supporters present. To the contrary, there&#x27;s ample video evidence that capitol police opened the gates, waved Trump supporters in, and held the doors for them as they entered the capitol. That&#x27;s a strange thing for police to do during a &quot;seditious coup.&quot;')
