Our glorious leaders were urging us not to buy masks because they donâ€™t work, and besides, doctors need them.<p>I think this is a bit disingenuous. First of all, you&#x27;re looking back with the benefit of hindsight and the knowledge of the virus that we have today. Additionally, weren&#x27;t most of the recommendations around mask wearing that people not gobble up PPE because there was such a shortage of it around the country for first responders and hospital staff? Isn&#x27;t that one of the primary reasons why people across the country started making homemade masks out of t-shirts and other spare cloth?')
