With startup he and his cofounders could focus on applying incubator and&#x2F;or angel investors early on. They would get some feedback on their ideas. They could even get a little funding to hire a designer or contractor to help build the UI (which appears to be the big drag). In this case you are trading ownership to additional support systems. If you do bootstrapping, then you&#x27;d need to prepare for the longer timeframe, and financial burden. Maybe still keep the original full-time job and working par-time on the side project.')
