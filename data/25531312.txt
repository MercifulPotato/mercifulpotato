I know developers who have reverse engineered applications, fixed unbelievable bugs deep an application stacks, written top tier code that make them the go to people in teams for all the tough problems and yet they barely get any call backs much less for companies like Facebook. They have to grind leetcode for 1 year just to get interviews at no name companies in the mid-west(despite willing to relocate anywhere). Its like there is this &quot;in&quot; group of developers and if you are &quot;in&quot; you can act like how you do and if you are not, then you are in starvation mode with all the other starving fish in the sea.<p>Likewise it just seems so selfish to talk like this during a pandemic situation where so many people (including people in tech) are out of a job.')
