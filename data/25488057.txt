I believe distraction is a solution for many because it allows them to discover the self at their own pace. It’s a more indirect route that may take longer, but which may be less psychologically jarring compared to direct introspection. For these types, self discovery might involve something as simple as watching a film and identifying with both the hero and the villain, something which hadn’t happened heretofore in their development. The film was intended as a distraction from the self, but the self is not avoidable; we constantly compare “not self” to “self” and update our world view based on these comparisons. Distractions may help people cope with their unavoidable development. In trying times, more of us may need more distractions because we are developing at a breakneck pace. I disapprove of shaming people for coping with their growth using distraction, because that’s how they prefer to learn.')
