Nobody is going to use it until there are good apps. and nobody is going to make good apps until there is a market of users. IMO this is the same problem that kept Sandstorm and remoteStorage from getting big.<p>I see 2 solutions currently:<p>1. Make an awesome storage product, that just happens to implement Solid. It might have to start out also implementing S3, which unfortunately doesn&#x27;t support OAuth, which basically kills it for apps. You could try making it compatible with another proprietary protocol like Google Drive, or provide a frontend library that easily talks to all the major cloud storage providers, plus Solid...<p>2. Take the slow track. If developers themselves want to use it, they&#x27;ll write useful open source apps over time. This can take forever though. Even after 30 years there are still large feature gaps on Linux because the market is too small to attract big app developers.')
