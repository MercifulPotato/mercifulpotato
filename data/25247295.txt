Item(by='endymi0n', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606677723, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25246733, text='I&#x27;m completely convinced by now that fact-checking is utterly useless, because it is based on a specific worldview that truth is something important.<p>While I happen to share that worldview, recent populist politicians didn&#x27;t just ignore that, but managed to turn it on its head.<p>There was no shortage of scandals, proven disinformation or exposing books and I saw liberals and progressives stumped over the fact that exposing those lies did absolutely zero to change opinion over the populist administrations.<p>The thing they don&#x27;t get is that the average Bolsonaro or Trump supporter simply does not _care_ whether their politician lies, if they simply come out of the argument as stronger. It&#x27;s not logical at all, it&#x27;s psycho-logical.<p>Any facts are pretty simple to get off the table if you&#x27;re brazen and sociopathic enough: Just accuse the other side of doing it before they do, and if they do, double down on it in order to keep the narrative lead.<p>It doesn&#x27;t even have to make the slightest sense, it just needs to make small egos feel good and in the know.<p>&quot;ABC: I&#x27;m lying? Look at XYZ, he lied two times and I can prove it! So nasty!&quot;<p>Suddenly the distinction between ABC lying every day and XYZ a dozen times in their career does not matter anymore. All politicians lie, why does fact-checking matter? In fact, probably even the fact-checkers lie!<p>And if you don&#x27;t believe me, just remember that &quot;Fake News&quot; was an invention of the left that was rhetorically completely spun around (extremely successfully so) from meaning creating fake news to meaning that all (mainstream) news are fake.<p>It took nothing more than repetition and massive confidence. As long as you keep people more scared about China, socialism, gun-robbers and making the next paycheck, it&#x27;s rather easy to control the narrative, no matter the facts.<p>Fact-checking is a liberal pipe-dream.')
