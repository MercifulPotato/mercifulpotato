But I saw liberals and progressives stumped over the fact that exposing those lies did absolutely zero to change opinion over the populist administrations. No matter the previous results, all those years they still worked with the mindset that just exposing one more lie would suddenly change everyone&#x27;s mind.<p>As Einstein said: The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.<p>The thing they don&#x27;t get is that the average Bolsonaro or Trump supporter simply does not _care_ whether their politician lies, if they simply come out of the argument as stronger. It&#x27;s not logical at all, it&#x27;s psycho-logical.<p>Any facts are pretty simple to get off the table if you&#x27;re brazen, narcisstic and sociopathic enough: Just accuse the other side of doing it before they do, and if they do, double down on it yourself in order to keep the narrative lead.<p>It doesn&#x27;t even have to make the slightest sense, it just needs to make small egos feel good and in the know.<p>&quot;ABC: I&#x27;m lying? Look at XYZ, he lied two times and I can prove it! So nasty!&quot;<p>Suddenly the distinction between ABC lying every day and XYZ a dozen times in their career does not matter anymore to the casual onlooker. All politicians lie, why would fact-checking matter? In fact, probably even the fact-checkers lie!<p>And if you don&#x27;t believe me, just remember that &quot;Fake News&quot; was an invention of the left that was rhetorically completely spun around (extremely successfully so) from meaning creating fake news to meaning that all (mainstream) news are fake.<p>It took nothing more than repetition and massive confidence. As long as you keep people more scared about China, socialism, gun-robbers and making the next paycheck, it&#x27;s rather easy to control the narrative, no matter the facts.<p>Fact-checking is a liberal pipe-dream.')
