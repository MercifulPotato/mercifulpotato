It&#x27;s not at all hard to find evidence of pro-nationalist propaganda because it&#x27;s ubiquitous.<p>Anti-nationalist views are much rarer and much less common in virtually all media. In the US you&#x27;re going to have a hard time finding progressives who explicitly want to destroy America. They may <i>disagree</i> with American policy in a number of areas, but that&#x27;s a long way from wanting to get rid of the country and its traditions.<p>Likewise elsewhere. It&#x27;s probably weakest in the EU because the EU isn&#x27;t a country so much as a work in progress - and it doesn&#x27;t even have its own sports teams.<p>Personally I&#x27;ve never heard of the Open Society Foundation, although it sounds as if I&#x27;d agree with their views.')
