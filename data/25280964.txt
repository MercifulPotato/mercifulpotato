Doesn&#x27;t even matter what the content was in that context.<p>When you do consider the content&#x2F;context, then we need to consider that this vendor&#x2F;partner (IRI) was likely offended by the implications and the relationship between Google and the vendor&#x2F;partner was likely damaged.<p>IRI did the right thing in not publicly commenting on the issue, though, so we&#x27;ll never know for sure what actual affect this incident had on that relationship.')
