We had a footworker guy from the Census who went around double checking all the vacant units to ensure they didn&#x27;t shirk their census obligations. They would post these shipping label looking things at the doors and door steps of the units asking them to complete their census forms by whatever deadline was listed.<p>The guy knocked on our door asking about these neighbors to which we pointed out their moved, died, etc. For the ones who moved he got down to asking about roughly when they moved because residency counts up to some month, like April or something I forget. It was definitely earlier in the year by a few months from when he went double checking on all the residents. Depending on our memory for when the guy moved out he was going to count him as a resident even though he may not even have been in the state anymore nor filled out a census form apparently. We directed the fella to the Managers office to get more precise dates than the rough stuff we had in mind. I remember the guy seeming to be troubled and flustered that there were a boatload of vacancies he had to comb through and didn&#x27;t want to invest too much time hunting down facts about various residents. We wished him well and he went on his way.')
