If you&#x27;re not using at least somewhat proper form, the seat really isn&#x27;t going to go back to the neutral position and you&#x27;re going to occasionally be bouncing off the bumpers at the front or rear of the rower.<p>While I don&#x27;t know how to make a machine that promote the following without putting telemetry in the handle, I also coach people using my machine to row with a D-shaped motion that mimics taking the blade out of the water and almost scraping the top of your knees on the return. The goal is to force people to mostly return the handles with their forearms and torso before collapsing their knees.<p>The RP3 display is definitely something worth trying out. It&#x27;s not perfect, but I really like it. Contact the US distributor and he might be able to put you in contact with someone local to you that has one.')
