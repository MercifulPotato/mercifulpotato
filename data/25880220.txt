No, wait.<p>You honestly think the Manhattan project, and by extension operation paperclip, was a byproduct of bureaucracy? The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki? The inhumane levels of carpet bombing campaigns over civilian homes in Tokyo that actually killed more than the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined?<p>And this is not to even mention the event that preceded Pearl Harbor bombing, the US&#x27; <i>American Volunteer Group</i> Mercenaries (I actually met one of the pilots of the flying tigers in San Diego when I was in my early 20s at an airshow event) intervention and involvement in aerial warfare in China against the Japanese Imperial Air force.<p>The US was already at war with Japan before Pearl Harbor which led to its formal declaration of war, and had been in an economic war long before that with restricted oil sales.<p>Japan was not innocent here, and I&#x27;m not an apologist for them as they quite honestly were one of the worst in committing acts of barbarism and war crimes all over the Pacific in that war. It&#x27;s appalling to see the level of cruelty they were capable of with the notion of &#x27;racial superiority&#x27; driving them, which was in direct odds with their allies&#x27; (Nazi) supposed belief about <i>Aryan</i> supremacy, and put the entire Asian race at a very low, perhaps even sub-human, position.<p>And what&#x27;s even harder to believe was this wasn&#x27;t even that long ago, either. Many of those people are still alive, perhaps less now due to COVID.<p>But if you think for one second this was done from bureaucratic decree, rather than Imperialist ambition and a lust of global and corporate hegemony you really have a narrow view of that war.<p>To be honest the Nazi&#x27;s records were kept way better and operated in a very systematic and bureaucratic way (very Germanic) throughout that war which was very useful in lining out the SS&#x27; fiances in the last years of the War and its relationships with major Corps&#x2F;Banks on both sides of the war.<p>I highly recommend the story of Martin Borrmann to see the pinnacle of bureaucratic and corporate-state power at its best. Consider that almost all of the biggest Corporations that supplied the German&#x2F;Nazi regime ended up becoming some of the biggest in the World afterward, and that extends to auto manufacturers, banks, and pharmaceutical corps.')
