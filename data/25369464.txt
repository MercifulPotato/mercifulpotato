Because you wouldn&#x27;t want to see yourself as a kool aid drinker or idiot, right. Meaning you&#x27;re blind to it&#x27;s effects, which I&#x27;m not saying makes you say idiot. This dynamic happens everywhere. It&#x27;s similar to how people choose familiarity, over what &quot;objectively&quot; is better. What you said matches what I&#x27;m saying about it. People can tell when something is slow and clunky, or slick and snappy, and while they may praise, or rail, it doesn&#x27;t mean they will think slick and snappy works better, or feel more comfortable using it. This is why those big softwares don&#x27;t violate your implicit expectations that they are slow and clunky.<p>Another thing is just because people complain (about their enterprise software, or country, or house, or romantic partner) does not mean they would switch. And just because they praise your slick and snappy startup enterprise app doesn&#x27;t mean it will solve their problem better, doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;ll feel more comfortable using it, and doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;ll buy it.')
