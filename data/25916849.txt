This was 2006. I wasn&#x27;t involved in it but my office-mate was. He randomly turned his chair around and said &quot;hey, can you go on Dell.com and see if you can build the most expensive server imaginable&quot; – so I did and I ended up at around $350k. I don&#x27;t remember what it was, but at the time the stats just felt absolutely obscene. I do remember that, at that scale we were buying a closet, not just one box.<p>And I told him the price, and he said, &quot;They have set aside $20 million for server hardware, and what you configured is way way overkill for what they think they need&quot; – so we were both so damn perplexed because, at least from what he told me, this didn&#x27;t need that much. And it wasn&#x27;t one of those classified projects where they couldn&#x27;t tell you what it was for. It was a pretty boring line of business type thing (like HR or building access control or something).<p>Maybe that&#x27;s probably more a story of just how much cash was being poured into that agency during the years after 9&#x2F;11.')
