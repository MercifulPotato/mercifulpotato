On the one hand Starlink costs 10x as much for equipment and 10x as much for service as compared to LTE. On the other hand Starlink is 10x faster and half the latency of LTE.<p>A simple factor of 10 increase in both price and speed is not impressive. I&#x27;m gonna say I&#x27;m not overwhelmingly convinced until Starlink delivers more for less.')
