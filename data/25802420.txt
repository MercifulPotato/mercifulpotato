It got absolutely nowhere because after everything you describe—setting up a repo; learning the Maven API, which is one of those expansive APIs that has a lot of metaphoric semantic constructs—distributing it involved getting it into Maven Central by which point I had run out of time&#x2F;mental bandwidth and never made it happen.<p>Compare if I had been using Gradle at the time: I would have just coded it up in Groovy, a language I thoroughly enjoy, right there in setup. There are some things I don&#x27;t like about Gradle, but there&#x27;s a lot it has going for it, too. Personally, I <i>like</i> XML and enjoy Maven for situations where existing plugins are enough—which is 99% of the time—but that lack of flexibility can be constraining when existing plugins aren&#x27;t enough.')
