In my experience, consumers feel differently about these categories.<p>I&#x27;ve sat in on a few dozen user research sessions for ecommerce. This was qualitative research that included their general shopping habits, and additionally testing new features. The most interesting thing that I learned is that consumers (a) are generally pretty aware of when they&#x27;re being pressured, and (b) are fine if it&#x27;s transparent and accurate.<p>A classic example of this were low-stock notifications. The shoppers were generally okay with being told that something was low stock <i>if that was really true.</i> Many people could name specific items they lost because they were sold out. Some could also name instances of when they had bought something &quot;1 item remaining&quot; and seen it on sale the next day. They preferred having the information because it helped them make an informed decision. It turns out that lots of people browse the same items for a while, and use sales or almost-out-of-stock as a &quot;now or never&quot; moment.<p>The most interesting user session I ever sat in on was for a countdown timer for a sale ending. The designer refused to design it at first, and then was like, &quot;fine, I&#x27;m going to design the hell out of this and then show you in user research that nobody wants this.&quot; And then she showed it to 5 people in user research, who were generally okay with it on the condition that it counted down to the actual sale ending. Some said they actually liked knowing, because when they&#x27;re just looking on their phones they might not be in a good position to buy it, and want to know how much time they have later to get it. They said that they&#x27;ll often refresh the page to see if the timer resets, because if it starts ticking from the same time, they feel like the site is just scammy and they&#x27;ll leave.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;m not trying to defend lots of these patterns. Most of them are clearly wrong, and the ones that I mentioned above can also be used to lie and deceive. But I wouldn&#x27;t put them all together - in my experience, consumers generally want accurate information even if they&#x27;re aware that the company is doing it to pressure them.')
