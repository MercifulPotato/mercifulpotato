Tons in VLSI as well.  Just google for it.<p>You&#x27;ll find most are doing various ip blocks on someone else&#x27;s process or finding novel process flows on known equipment.  Obviously most are fabless because it&#x27;s just so much less capital intensive. My company has invested many millions into just the equipment in just my lab and I can only measure stuff someone else made. CAD software is very expensive as well.<p>As for startup specifically related to novel manufacturing techniques.  I guess it depends on what a startup is.  Is a newly founded company with $50M in funding a startup or just a new company?  The bay area has some companies doing interesting things in silicon photonics (in-package optical io is a hot topic as well as quantum computing)<p>And if you&#x27;re willing to expand the geographic area outside Silicon Valley there is quite a lot more.')
