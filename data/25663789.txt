This is the kind of thing people who don&#x27;t actually know anything about Fascism say. Trump was not a Fascist or even close to it.<p>Stop falling into the tired rhetoric of the 20th century. New words are needed to name the problem.<p>The name for the system that you need to start using is &quot;Totalitarian Liberalism&quot;. The leader is less important than the sum total bureaucratic control that slowly and &quot;rationally&quot; usurps freedom, flexibility, and leisure time from society for the benefit of the people who have the most influence over policy.<p>It is not a populist system that benefits the aristocracy and the working class by aligning corporate and state power in the national interest (fascism) nor a system that purports to benefit the working class by giving them the means of production (communism) - it is a system that works to benefit the existing rich by exploiting and undermining social divides, papering over them with rules and laws that marginalize the entire working class while setting it against itself.')
