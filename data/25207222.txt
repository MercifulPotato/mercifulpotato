Item(by='chopin', descendants=None, kids=[25207572], score=None, time=1606294527, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25206716, text='&gt; It is probably pretty safe.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t hold my breath. MCAS may have been fixed although I am even unsure about that. The regulatory capture problem hasn&#x27;t been solved and I didn&#x27;t hear that the FAA widened its capabilities. EASA will follow FAA as they don&#x27;t want to risk Airbus certifications as a retaliation.<p>What concerns me even more: MCAS has been unknown to pilots and maybe the FAA. What about other unknowns Boeing didn&#x27;t reveal? I don&#x27;t believe that they came forward voluntarily with unrelated concerns. I don&#x27;t believe that the FAA did look thoroughly into other corners (they lack the capability anyways). I don&#x27;t think that EASA did an independent vetting either.<p>I am sure that Boeing did change the least they could get away with. And that proper independent oversight is lacking. The only safety net the public has is that maybe, maybe someone high up at Boeing wouldn&#x27;t want the risk of more failures as this may destroy Boeing. But I don&#x27;t hold my breath for that either. There is no honor among thieves and no personal incentive for executives.<p>FAA should have been dropped as trustworthy authority worldwide. Only in that event I would have trusted a 737 Max. But there&#x27;s too much money at stake on all sides.')
