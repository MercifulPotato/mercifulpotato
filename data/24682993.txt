He loved owning his environment thus carefully designing his engagement with his ecosystem. Being the big brother that he is, he showed me some of the more tangible components such as his latex editing environment (he’s a bit of an editor junky), the simplicity of arch, and the power and brevity in nix tooling, Naturally, studying engineering forced him to pickup programming. He introduced me to project Euler as a means to learn the basics of programming.<p>At the time I had no marketable education. Using python, I ran through puzzles on project Euler and have progressively increased complexity since. Ultimately, I had the opportunity to finish a degree I had failed to finish 5 years prior. Computer science was the obvious choice. Fast forward some time, now I’ve worked at 2 of the bigger companies in the northwest over the last few years.<p>With the help of my brother, I found a new challenge I’ve since parlayed into a career at the corporate empire. I wouldn’t have done this alone. For the most part, none of my friends were really into tech or they were not well equipped  to speak to it in an attractive manner.<p>So to all of you who try to spread your hobbies and interests to other people, thank you. You make the world a better place for anyone listening.<p>Cheers brother')
