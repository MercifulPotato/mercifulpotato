They <i>can</i> be, if your test&#x2F;operation isn&#x27;t urgent. Urgent things are treated right away.<p>Frankly, as an American, I think we have shit quality of health service, based on the insurance cos&#x27; red tape and restrictions and paperwork alone. Getting healthcare in this country is a bureaucratic nightmare. Maybe the docs and meds and tests are good, but the overall service is bad.<p>(Disclaimer that I insist on Kaiser, an HMO – I would not live in a US area without it – which is pretty good, but helping family through health issues who had &quot;gold standard&quot; normal PPO was... different).')
