They will be accidents that a human driver (at least with the benefit of hindsight) would appear unlikely to have caused.<p>Things like that Tesla driving straight into a wall and killing its driver. Or not seeing a van right in front of it because the sun was too bright. Things where a bit of common sense (not something AI excels at) might have avoided them.<p>On the flip side the lives saved will be based on having super human reaction times &#x2F; situational awareness and will be things no person would have been able to do.<p>So maybe there’ll be a battle of public opinion (and PR!) weighing these things against each other.')
