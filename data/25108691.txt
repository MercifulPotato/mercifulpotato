They&#x27;ve continually added features for improving system security that have proved to be major impediments to a computer being used as a general purpose computing device. A separate section (maybe under Security &amp; Privacy, add in loads of warnings, I don&#x27;t care) with a deep dive allowing users to enable&#x2F;disable security features of macOS would be ideal<p>The general taboo asking users to even disable any of the security protections of macOS needs to disappear in my honest opinion. With Big Sur and Apple Silicon, I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s hyperbole anymore of a locked up macOS just tailored towards casual users and dragging along developers in the process.')
