It shipped in a product, yes, but it wasn&#x27;t very <i>good</i> either. It ran ARM code, but not very well, and was a horrible nightmare to work on. The JIT&#x27;d aspect completely breaks profilers. ie, what do you mean this simple field access took 20ms?? Oh, because the CPU wasn&#x27;t running <i>my</i> code, it just silently went out to lunch to JIT some random shit, cool, thanks. There&#x27;s then also the questionable security design of a globally read&#x2F;write&#x2F;executable chunk of memory where security is &quot;enforced&quot; by the JIT which is a complex bit of microcode, totally nothing can go wrong there...<p>It&#x27;s only noteworthy &quot;feature&quot; was that it was able to ship ARMv8 support before ARM had a proper ARMv8 CPU design. Time to market for a new ISA was fast, but that&#x27;s about it.')
