Item(by='nialv7', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603673608, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24886074, text='&gt; massive fragmentation issues across the graphical part of the Linux ecosystem<p>This is a fair criticism. It is true that we see each of the compositors rolling its own extensions to the protocol. But I believe wayland is trying to standardize a lot of the protocols which should cover common use cases.<p>&gt; each new compositor implementation reinvents the wheel many times<p>This is not true. There are libraries like wlroots[0] which you can build on top of. You don&#x27;t have to redo the work that is already done in other compositors.<p>&gt; application that needs to grab the entire screen will need separate code for each compositor it supports screenshots<p>There is the PipeWire[1] effort to support screenshot and screen capture on wayland in a unified way.<p>&gt; Wayland is also, with its forced composition, hostile to interactive applications requiring low latency, e.g. video games.<p>Also not true. On a properly implemented compositor, video games frames shouldn&#x27;t have longer latency to screen than on Xorg. X server has to do composition too, whether you run a compositor or not.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;swaywm&#x2F;wlroots" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;swaywm&#x2F;wlroots</a>\n[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;PipeWire" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;PipeWire</a>')
