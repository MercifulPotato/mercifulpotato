Chat is far less organized compared to email or forums and it&#x27;s difficult to find the result you&#x27;re looking for unless you&#x27;ve seen it and have a vague memory of what it was and when it was posted.<p>When I try to use Slack&#x27;s search feature, I typically get a bunch of irrelevant results. In fact, I&#x27;ve had better luck scrolling back and finding the message I&#x27;m looking for.')
