There is &quot;pre-masking&quot;, where a sound is rendered in-perceivable by a sound that _follows_ it (your &quot;forgetting&quot; case). And there is post-masking, where a sound is in-perceivable because of a masking sound that preceded it. And yes, this is due to inherent slowness &#x2F; lack of temporal resolution in the auditory system.<p>Temporal masking widely exploited in all kinds of lossy audio compression (MP3, AAC etc), to remove the data that cannot be perceived anyway.')
