Time is money is not just a saying. The fundamental currency, the one thing that ever person needs and wants, is time. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so tightly coupled with other valuable things such as money. Time and money are essentially the same thing, though of course time is less fungible. And different people with different circumstances are able to expedite their actions with varying efficiency. Time is a more fundamental economic concept than money.<p>UBI is essentially just socialist redistribution policy in a different guise, and all it will do is obscure (but of course not erase) existing incentive structures.')
