Everything as long as it isn&#x27;t plastic?  Does Amazon itself not already sell the products you&#x27;ll have available?  Target?  Wal-Mart?<p>Who are the likely customers?  Wealthier people with money to burn on more expensive, but eco-friendly products?  Is there a plan on how to reach and &quot;intrigue&quot; the target customer group?')
