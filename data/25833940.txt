Item(by='MrRadar', descendants=None, kids=[25838745], score=None, time=1611068092, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25830745, text='&gt; If someone nefarious wanted to MITM my web site, the easiest would be to spoof DNS so it went to some other host, and do the MITM that way. Your ISP could do that to you, no?<p>That&#x27;s what certificates are for. While certificate authorities can also be compromised, most ISPs don&#x27;t run their own so they&#x27;d have to get a separate organization to cooperate with them to do this.<p>&gt; They aren&#x27;t injecting ads into my blog. They are injecting ads into your transfer of files from my site. Why are you using an ISP which does that?<p>This seems like a very strange semantic argument. From the customer&#x27;s point of view they <i>are</i> injecting ads into your blog. Many people are not technically-savvy enough to understand that it&#x27;s the ISP that&#x27;s putting the ads in and not you. And for many people in the US and I&#x27;m sure also around the world they may not have a choice in ISP for a given level of service (would you choose dial-up or satellite over broadband if the only broadband provider that serves your area injects ads on non-secured pages?).<p>&gt; Again, what&#x27;s the threat model? I&#x27;m pretty sure simple traffic analysis would be enough to figure out, based on download size and number of additional requests made, which pages are downloaded.<p>The threat model is pervasive passive surveillance. The IETF recognizes this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc7258" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc7258</a> HTTPS greatly increases the costs of such surveillance (you can no longer just look at the bytes on the wire, you need to closely examine the site the user is connecting to to correlate the amount of data transferred with specific pages on the site; for dynamic sites or sites using HTTP&#x2F;2 this can be much harder).<p>&gt; Does it make a difference?<p>Not to my argument, but I was genuinely curious what 10-year old phone anyone can consider usable today and the use-cases they have that still accommodate such old hardware. (I could see a basic non-smart phone still being useful, as long as the networks it supports are still active (which in the US will probably not be for more than another year or two)).')
