Being and Time is absurdly difficult for even Philosophy Ph.Ds to parse. Worse yet, Phenomenology is kinda like metaphysics in that many people in the field don&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s even truly legitimate. Heidegger had to go and claim that his biggest fans (Sartre) actually compleatly misunderstood him entirely. If Sartre can&#x27;t get it right, can a random newcomer understand it the way Heidegger intended?<p>As far as Nietzsche goes - by his own words (he is very clear about this in one of his books - I think it was ecco homo) - you&#x27;re supposed to have read ALL of the works of Kant and then Schopenhauer before you can even understand Nietzsche. Not that many people agree with him about that, but it did color my perception of him (and the study of the two that he asks the readers to look into does a massive amount to explain why Nietzsche sounds like such an edgelord)...')
