Meanwhile, studies from Taiwan, Japan, and Korea show that myopia truly has an environmental component to it, e.g. childhood eyestrain and video games. It&#x27;s also undeniable that myopia manifests more in middle class workers than working class, which indicates some sort of systematic environmental component.<p>Since the article is specifically about Japan and Asian markets, I must add this: One may argue that the discrepancy in mainstream scientific conclusions could simply be due to differences in genetics between East Asians and Europeans. This  mainstream &quot;myopia can&#x27;t be cured&#x2F;prevented&quot; rhetoric has been extremely harmful for approximately 2 billion people on this planet.')
