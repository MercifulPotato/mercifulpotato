They appear to have been up for sale in Ukraine for at least a year, suggesting that the Giuliani “found it in Delaware” story is possibly a lie, but the emails exist nonetheless.<p>Their content has no bearing or connection to Joe Biden. Drawing that line would be deliberate misinformation purely for election destabilization.')
