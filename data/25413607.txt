Bluetooth works, but just barely, and it feels like it&#x27;s getting worse.<p>Somewhere between 5.8 and 5.9 reconnecting became <i>incredibly</i> flaky for me (XPS 9300).  Headphones will pair and connect fine the first time, but then completely fail to reconnect properly if I turn them off or walk out of range.<p>Sometimes I can connect to them again, but they don&#x27;t get registered in pulseaudio, even after killing and restarting it.<p>Sometimes they will connect, then immediately disconnect again 5 seconds later (rinse and repeat until removed and repaired)<p>Sometimes they fail to connect entirely.<p>I end up consistently removing the device, restarting the bluetooth service, and then repairing fresh.  In which case they work until the next disconnect.<p>---<p>It&#x27;s hardly the end of the world, and it&#x27;s a little amazing that my biggest complaint about linux desktop these days is flaky bluetooth, but it&#x27;s certainly annoying.')
