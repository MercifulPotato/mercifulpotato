Since we know covid has high asymptomatic infection rates, it helps control the spread of the disease for everyone to wear a mask even if they think they have no reason to stay home.<p>- There was no recommendation for the control group <i>not</i> to wear a mask.<p>- Very few people, percentage-wise, get covid at all, and many people are staying home, avoiding crowded events, etc. anyway. You could run a similar study demonstrating that over a month or so, a group told to wear seat belts did not get injured or die in car crashes at a higher rate than the control group, just because so few of them got in crashes at all. It would mean nothing for whether seat belts are worthwhile.<p>People are going to die as a result of the propaganda citing this study. I wonder if the scientists are okay with that.<p>There may also be an argument that it was immoral to use research money to <i>conduct</i> this flawed of a study in the first place.')
