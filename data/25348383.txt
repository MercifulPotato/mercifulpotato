RHEL has a major release every three years, with minor releases every six months.<p>The major release of RHEL is usually forked from a Fedora version about a year before the major release, so with some exceptions software versions tend to be about a year behind those in a Fedora release initially, and then as RH backports patches rather than revving versions, drifts further.<p>It&#x27;s the patches and smaller updates — and new hardware enablement in the full-support phase — that will be landing in CentOS Stream. Previously, this stuff was developed internally and only released to the world at the minor-release drop every six months. Now, it&#x27;ll be developed in a shared space. So what you&#x27;ll have in CentOS Stream is whatever is intended to ship in a RHEL minor update within six months.<p>There may occasionally be a situation where an update introduces bugs into Stream that would have been caught by QA before a public minor RHEL release and subsequent CentOS Linux rebuild. But I don&#x27;t actually expect that to happen enough to worry about in any case where you can justify not paying for actual supported RHEL in the first place.')
