They’ll talk about the few cases  where the finance guys didn’t capture most of the wealth and ignore all of the people who eventually netted a few months salary or less (I’m reminded of the people from meetings with pets.com who were visibly just keeping a chair warm until the IPO made them rich, and ended up calling to ask if we were hiring later that year when the layoffs started).<p>It’s a cliched observation but it really does remind me of the kids hoping to make it big in pro sports – there are way more who peak at the minor league level at best but the owners make a ton of money by encouraging everyone to think of the exceptions as the rule. Humans are prone to misjudging statistics in general and that’s really bad when one party has the best data and a strong incentive for other people to misjudge it.')
