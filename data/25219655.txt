It can do much more than just people use it mostly for - reading books and gaming. In fact, I&#x27;m using an iPad air right now and feel held back by the limitations of iOS imposed on me as a developer. I can&#x27;t write code on an iPad (reliably). The machine itself is capable, so is the OS, but the narrow use cases Apple wants to portray it for gets in my way.<p>In fact, I was so frustrated, I was even looking at some alternatives. The only thing that gets closest to what I want is a Surface Go - a full fledged windows computer that can literally do everything I want (SSH, Coding, etc) I would switch instantly in a heart beat. But, the longer term consequences of an ecosystem switch pull me back. I&#x27;m invested in the Apple ecosystem heavily at this point and would much rather have something from Apple that also covers developers&#x27; use cases. I&#x27;m sure even Apple employees doing programming would like to see something like that. But, Apple needs to listen to make it happen. And they don&#x27;t. Hence, such posts. At least, that&#x27;s what I can infer.<p>P.S - I&#x27;m far from an Apple &quot;fanboy&quot;. I&#x27;m a developer first and use whatever helps me achieve my end goal.')
