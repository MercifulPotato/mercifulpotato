The common example would be libel laws on speech or punishment for causing panic in a crowded theater by yelling &quot;fire.&quot;<p>Vehicles can be a deadly weapon but are highly available. We put reasonable regulation in place so that getting a driver&#x27;s license for a small car is not very onerous while obtaining a commercial driver&#x27;s license to pilot an 18 wheel tractor trailer requires more training. Similar rules around firearms with differing capabilities to harm others seems reasonable. We also require insurance for vehicle owners at various amounts based on risk.')
