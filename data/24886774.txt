I&#x27;ve had more success using xpra for forwarding, as I&#x27;m often connecting over Wi-Fi (hostel, campus rooms...).<p>It&#x27;s also rather complicated to set-up on the server side (xauth, magic cookie, etc).<p>waypipe, on the other hand, was a breeze to use, even though it&#x27;s very young. I tried with Firefox and 500Mbps of upload capacity, it worked fine as long as the window wasn&#x27;t too large.')
