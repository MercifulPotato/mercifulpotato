In my experience, most of the complexity in a software system emerges from excessive shared state between components and poor modeling of the domain.<p>If you can break your problem up into smaller, independent pieces, you can pretty easily manage complexity throughout.<p>By having a good domain model (which to me means context-agnostic and represented approximately in 3NF&#x2F;BCNF), you automatically clear up most of the nasty interfacing between components. Also, having a domain model in a normalized form enables much easier querying for any required dimension of fact (i.e. SQL&#x2F;LINQ&#x2F;et. al.). The methods will almost automatically follow from a good domain model.<p>Being able to develop good models of the domain and manage incremental complexity are the hallmarks of a master software engineer. You should note that neither of these fundamental skills requires the use of a computer.')
