Leonardo had genuine curiosity, and no need to show off (except when looking for a job [0]). I feel that Nathan could learn from that.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theladders.com&#x2F;career-advice&#x2F;leonardo-da-vincis-resume" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theladders.com&#x2F;career-advice&#x2F;leonardo-da-vincis-...</a>')
