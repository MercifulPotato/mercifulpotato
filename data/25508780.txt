The tricky part is long term maintenance and storage.<p>This times 100. Deploying basic clusters is easy. Keeping a test&#x2F;dev-cluster running for a while? Sure. Keeping production clusters running (TLS cert TTLs expiring, anyone?), upgrading to new K8s versions, proper monitoring (the whole stack, not just your app or the control-plane), provisioning (local) storage,... is where difficulties lie.')
