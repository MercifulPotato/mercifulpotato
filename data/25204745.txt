Epstein was a comic-book villain walking free. I believe that if the media can make it clear that they&#x27;re fighting _for us_, people won&#x27;t look to QAnon for salvation.<p>QFT. Epstein&#x27;s death, and the way the media immediately circled the wagons to browbeat anyone questioning its circumstances with charges of &quot;baseless conspiracy theory,&quot; was basically the decisive factor in my switching from a <i>Skeptic</i>-reading blanket conspiracy doubter to someone who takes a pretty wide number of theories seriously.<p>The media hasn&#x27;t even bothered asking the FBI why they haven&#x27;t raided Epstein&#x27;s New Mexico ranch. Whether that&#x27;s an explicit directive from on high or they just instinctively know where their bread is buttered, it&#x27;s clear whose side they&#x27;re on.')
