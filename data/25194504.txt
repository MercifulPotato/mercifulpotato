But they&#x27;ve turned the front page into endless facebook-like memes, tik-toks, and posts that I&#x27;d read from a lesser informed individual who dropped out of college and works at mcdonalds. There&#x27;s no nuance and it just appeals to a broad audience. Also the group think and excessive mods have ruined the site. Like getting banned because you&#x27;re opinion doesn&#x27;t 100% chime with the group? Half of &#x2F;r&#x2F;popular&#x27;s got you covered there!<p>Plus banning literally everything to cater to the puritanical mommies out there is absurd. Reddit was an interesting place. Now it&#x27;s kind of like how HN reacts when google creates something new where you go &quot;Wonder how long it&#x27;ll last before they kill it...&quot;')
