So not exactly fully comparable. And also this omits in both case two other elements needed to do a proper comparison: whole life cycle carbon emission, including hardware manufacturing and development time, and induced footprint of the usage (what it replaces and what is also purely new usage consumption). Without these figures, it is difficult to compare them.<p>But just as a reminder, the figure quoted in the paper for bitcoin is 10,000 times the yearly figure we have for Falcon 9.')
