Notably, after a moderate polling miss in the 2015 elections, which predicted a hung parliament where in fact the Tories managed a small majority, UK pollsters went on to overcompensate in the 2017 election, showing a Tory blow-out win whereas in fact they ended up with a hung parliament.<p>(That one, incidentally, shows one danger of polls! The first poll allowed Cameron to safely promise a vote on the EU, because he assumed they&#x27;d be either out of government or in coalition with the libdems, who wouldn&#x27;t allow it. In fact, they won and were forced to go through with it. The second one allowed Theresa May to call a snap election to gain seats so as to have enough spare MPs to be able to ignore the ERG and negotiate a semi-sensible Brexit. Instead, they lost seats, had to deal with the ERG and Unionists, and ultimately ended up with the current catastrophe. The current Brexit mess is at least in part due to polling misses.)<p>In the US, pollsters have started to pay a lot more attention to education, which was a major predictor in the 2016 election.')
