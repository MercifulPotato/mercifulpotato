It is the standard unicode encoding of the internet.<p>If anything, I would say the UTF-8 paved the way for emojis, not the other way around as the ubiquity of a unicode encoding allowed for the existence of emojis. Can&#x27;t encode emojies with ASCII. You have to have unicode and its encoding first before you can have emojis.')
