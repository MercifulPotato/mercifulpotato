These days [1, 2, 3, 4].map(x =&gt; x + 12).filter(x =&gt; x % 2 == 0) is obvious at first glance.  Twenty years ago most people would have begged you to rewrite it with for loops.<p>Right now I am in a hell of trying to figure out if the Scala codebase I&#x27;m working on is terrible or if I am just not fluent enough yet with FP and cats and related libraries.  There are some points of style I&#x27;m confident are poor choices, but when it comes to other aspects that seem horribly convoluted to me... I&#x27;m still not sure if the code is written for somebody with more experience in the style, or if it&#x27;s a poorly executed example of the style.')
