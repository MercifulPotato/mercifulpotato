On one hand, raw population per square kilometer is obviously a useless metric for epidemics. It&#x27;s trivial to understand that taking a small country with a few cities, and adding a vast uninhabited area will drive people&#x2F;sq.km towards zero without actually changing the actual density where people live (See Canada, Sweden, Australia and many others).<p>So it&#x27;s not people per area. Perhaps a better measure is &quot;mean distance&quot; between people? That means Australia is pretty dense because most people live in dense areas. Urbanization is obviously a much better metric than raw density.<p>But this also misses another important factor: Australi, and Sweden (which are sparse but urbanized so low pop&#x2F;sq.qm but low mean distance), unlike the UK is pretty &quot;disconnected&quot;. There are clusters with high density, but they are separated by areas of low density.<p>It&#x27;s likely better in an epidemic to  have 3 cities with 1 million separated from each other, than 30 cities with 100k people each, where people in each cities visit&#x2F;commute to the next 5 cities. That&#x27;s  what some places like UK&#x2F;Netherlands&#x2F;Belgium have. They are extremely dense in the sense that it&#x27;s always close to the next population center. There are no natural borders or empty spaces.\nPeople from city A work in town B, and some fraction of people in town B work in city C and so on. Towns A and Z are connected by just a few days worth of normal commute for thousands of people.')
