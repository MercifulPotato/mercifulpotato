Some people may love this, but I hate it. How do I know? I lived it the first 30 years of my life until I bought a house in the burbs. My quality of life is so much better now. No I didn&#x27;t buy a McMansion. I have lived in bigger apartments, however I have space and nice solid walls between myself and neighbors and it&#x27;s a huge % increase in quality of life not to hear other people&#x27;s sex, family quarrels, or bad taco bell incidents at all hours.')
