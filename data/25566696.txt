It&#x27;s called Mother Earth&#x27;s Plantasia, because it was primarily distributed at plant boutique in L.A. named &quot;Mother Earth&quot;.<p>My dad had a copy lying about that I used to listen to in high school when I&#x27;d be studying. It turns out its become a cult classic online, as a sort of pioneering electronic work [1][2]<p>Anyways, included with the original album is a wee book suggesting that plants benefit hugely from listening to music. Whether that claim has any basis in reality aside, Garson also names 15 hassle-free plants for the home. I can attest to the fact that they are easy to take care of as a relatively new indoor gardener.<p>They include:<p>Chinese Evergreen, Sansevieria, Spathiphyllum, Palm, Nephthytis, Philodendron, Boston Fern, Piggyback, Maranta, Dracaena, Dieffen-bachia, Aspidistra, Pothos, Ficus and Grape Ivy.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sacredbonesrecords.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;mort-garson" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sacredbonesrecords.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;mort-garson</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dazeddigital.com&#x2F;music&#x2F;article&#x2F;44931&#x2F;1&#x2F;mort-garson-mother-earth-plantasia-reissue-history" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dazeddigital.com&#x2F;music&#x2F;article&#x2F;44931&#x2F;1&#x2F;mort-gars...</a>')
