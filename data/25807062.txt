With Clojure, not knowing Java is a pain. I&#x27;ve tried both several times and was frustrated by constantly being referred to something Java related that I didn&#x27;t understand. Because of that, I feel like those languages will never pick up anyone outside of regular users of C# or Java that want to try something different. Of course there are exceptions, but they&#x27;re just that.<p>I agree with you that perhaps one should go through all of what you&#x27;re referring to Ex: learn assembly, write a Forth...etc.<p>I&#x27;m just saying a lot of these supposedly amazing languages stagnant with regards to their userbase for a reason. APL uses an entirely different way of doing things than Clojure, but I&#x27;d bet I could get up to speed a lot faster with APL than Clojure where I constantly have to fight with learning the daunting ecosystem.')
