Anything that threatened that was drug out and shot.<p>If you were a dev who was like, &quot;Hey, we need to test our stuff... do proper code reviews... not outsource quite so much...&quot; you were not treated kindly. QA cycles were definitely rushed to hit launch dates; if Dev was delayed, rather than push the launch the QA window just got shorter. And the QA team was outsourced -- which further reduced their ability to give any push back.<p>I just remember it was the sort of place where -- again not uncommon -- but every password was like &quot;$olarwinds&quot; (making that up, but password reuse was rampant) and passwords were shared in plain text &#x2F; written on whiteboards, etc. Also a lot of tool &#x2F; account re-use, and a lot shared passwords there too -- everyone using the same Google Analytics account sort of thing, and huge walls up around getting more licenses for tools you needed so you&#x27;d have to share sign ins with other people. I remember a ticket to &quot;sync passwords&quot; across a bunch of test environments with production... just intentional bad practices left and right; convenience &gt; security at every turn.<p>At times it felt a bit like a frat house. The sales guys had a big gong they&#x27;d ring, the CEO was a cheerleader who would run down the halls yelling at the top of his lungs, &quot;Woo! Woo! Another sale!&quot; type stuff. There was no security training in place... for anyone. No password managers. No security audits as far as I could tell. No 2FA as far as I could tell. Generally speaking any badge worked to open any door. And you&#x27;d be met by anger if you ever tried to flag anything like, &quot;Hey, I think the QA team just closed all my tickets without actually testing them...&quot;<p>Been a while, and like I said, not unique... but they were just sloppy. But back to the question: what can you do? There&#x27;s not like one magic bullet here. But they need to make security a priority. Do whatever it takes to make it so everyone in the company stops and thinks for 30 seconds about if what they&#x27;re doing is a good idea from a security standpoint or not.<p>Here&#x27;s a good starter pack for you to help your company get their foot in the door for security best practices.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sudo.pagerduty.com&#x2F;for_everyone&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sudo.pagerduty.com&#x2F;for_everyone&#x2F;</a>')
