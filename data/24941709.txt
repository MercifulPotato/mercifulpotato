Your most expensive resource is your programmers, and a few talented operations guys, and you need a good reason to expend those resources.<p>We work rather closely with other municipalities, and one in particular is very adoptive of new things. One of the things they adopted was kubernetes. But the thing is, we’re not Netflix, and kubernetes isn’t easy, and the result was they spend two years worth of man hours on something that didn’t make them anymore competitive than us because the advantages never really comes into play in our small enterprise organisations.<p>We spent those two years worth of manhours improving our Azure strategy, getting our operations guys up to speed on powershell and our developers on python, and actually moved our organisation forward in a manner that was useful.<p>Maybe Rust is useful, maybe it’s going to have a brighter web-future than .Net Core, but if you can’t show me how that is, or why I should adopt it, then it’s a really big risk that I’m happy to let other people take. We can always adopt it later.<p>Of course you probably meant to ask the question in a different light, and I think that point is very valid. I just can’t stress enough, how little something being all the hype actually means. What if Rust turns out to be another Ruby on Rails or “Node.JS for everything” craze? Then I won’t lose any sleep over never having thouched it, and if you look at our local job market, then there hasn’t been a single Rust focused job in my entire country for two years now. Not even as a “nice if also you know” listing. That doesn’t exactly install me with confidence that Rust is ever going to be important.')
