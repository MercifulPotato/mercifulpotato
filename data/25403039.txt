Item(by='rebelos', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607818164, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25402844, text='Naval Ravikant is a bit of a &quot;head in the clouds&quot; type, but he does have some genuinely interesting ideas that are worth paying attention to.<p>The problem with both Ravikant and Graham is that they&#x27;re pontificating in a space where the ideas seem superficially trite but become powerful when applied.<p>I think of Dale Carnegie&#x27;s book &#x27;How to Win Friends and Influence People&#x27; as a good illustration of this. People around here especially love to hate on it, but that&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t quite understand the point of it. The point of that book (and of the musings of people like Ravikant and Graham) is to explain to people that success is a product of attitude and behavior as much as it is a product of intellect. That simple ideas, routinely applied, can yield wondrous outcomes. And, perhaps most importantly, that the ingredient for success absent in most STEM-inclined minds is the capacity to restrain analytical&#x2F;cynical impulses in just the right way.<p>Neither Ravikant nor Graham is an intellectual slouch. They have noteworthy backgrounds in STEM that categorically refute any possible accusation of dimwittedness. When they decide to discuss &#x27;soft&#x27; ideas, it&#x27;s because their experience in the real world, pattern matching against countless observations made in the trenches of the tech industry, has taught them that these ideas are crucial.')
