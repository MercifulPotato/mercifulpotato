No need to mess with backblaze and containers unless you want to back up your server configuration too. If you lose your server, just push your working copy on a new server. With enough people, losing data becomes almost impossible.<p>In fact you don&#x27;t even need a server, just push&#x2F;pull between your machines, a server just makes things more convenient.')
