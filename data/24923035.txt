Use that time to do (thorough) cleaning, maintenance, etc. I doubt that would put NYC&#x27;s subway near the level of Tokyo&#x27;s or other cities with actual great transit, but it would help a lot.<p>Whenever this gets suggested, there is a loud outcry from people that say they would gladly put up with the filth, unreliability, and occasional assault&#x2F;rape&#x2F;murder if it meant 24hour service. Usually arguments put forth is that there are always people (including lower income night shift workers) that must have the subway at wee hours of the night&#x2F;morning. I&#x27;m pretty sure Seoul and Tokyo also have night shift workers and they manage to do just fine using buses or other alternate transportation. If anything Seoul and Tokyo have an even more notoriously hardcore &quot;city never sleeps&quot; workaholic culture than NYC.')
