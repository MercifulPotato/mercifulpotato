None of the other languages had interesting names, i.e., glass, whitespace, chicken, lolcode.<p>Edit: They&#x27;ve probably done something similar with other technical topics, but we don&#x27;t watch the show to know.  Such as, having a rocket scientist on the show talking about building rocket recovery wadding or something after looking through a GIS for &quot;rocket parts.&quot;')
