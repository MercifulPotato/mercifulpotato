Item(by='jseutter', descendants=None, kids=[25205986], score=None, time=1606275763, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25205140, text='You&#x27;re probably correct, but there is more.<p>Take a 200 pound payload, add some rocket to it, let&#x27;s say 10x the weight to be generous, then spin it in a circle 200 feet in diameter.  You&#x27;re looking at 18 thousand tons of force spinning it at 5000mph.  So you&#x27;re spinning 4 navy destroyers worth of force in a circle, which means you need a latch mechanism that can not only hold that much force, but release it at the exact moment to exit the biggest vacuum chamber ever created through a door that just opened at the right time, generating a mach 6+ shock wave at about 0 meters distance from the door and somehow not destroying it in the process.  I don&#x27;t know that it is impossible, but it is highly improbable.  They&#x27;d probably have a burst disk rather than a door, because that would let you use the capsule as a bullet to penetrate the exit.<p>In the article they mention the payload experiencing 10000g, so they must be planning on a circle greater than 200 feet in diameter.  I can&#x27;t find numbers on existing satellites, but I remember reading that rockets typically top out at 6g acceleration and figure on a 10x momentary acceleration due to vibration.  To tolerate 10000g the payload being launched will need to be built like a tank, rather than the relatively light current designs.  To ease that requirement you could submerge the payload in liquid, but that would decrease your usable payload accordingly.<p>It would be impressive if they could actually pull it off.  I think it would be useful for limited applications.  I have watched science fiction shows where mass accelerators could basically nuke planets without radioactive fallout.  Maybe this would be something similar.')
