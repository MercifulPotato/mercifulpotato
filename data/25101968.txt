People who deeply appreciate FLOSS work, who use it all the time, who&#x27;s life has been greatly improved by it, who are willing to pay for it when they find something that is valuable, who learn lots of valuable design&#x2F;implementation lessons from it by studying&#x2F;hacking on the code.<p>For those people I don&#x27;t want to hide my code.  Please consider a &quot;source available&quot; approach (at least for the &quot;core&quot;).')
