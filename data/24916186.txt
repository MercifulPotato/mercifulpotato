Spending time to do something else than please yourself is questionable. What are you working for? To improve society and the world? First you&#x27;ll improve things for a limited range of human beings only - not counting other humans and the animal world. Second, it&#x27;s only a drop in the infinity of time. Third, it most always has counter-effects meaning you always do as bad as good.<p>Thus, you&#x27;re better off playing games or reading.
