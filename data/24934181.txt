If you assume people are paying attention say 90% of the time in practice then their only catching less than 90% of the potential accidents they could avoid.  Further, assuming identical rates of accidents to the average person the other car is at fault 1&#x2F;2 the increase is further reduced.<p>As such, I think the regulation is a good idea for now as the net benefit to fully autonomous driving is to the individual while the risks include other drivers.')
