Much like you can unsubscribe to all the default subreddits and only subscribe to the subreddits that interest you, only this time you don&#x27;t have Reddit &#x27;s commercial interests&#x2F;standards hanging over your head with the power to shut you down.<p>Granted I&#x27;m not sure of the value (other than censorship resistance) vs. a set of fragmented, specialized forums we had way back when.')
