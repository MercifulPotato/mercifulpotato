Both selling land, and building on it will massively increase taxes.<p>Property values are rising at 5%-10% per year, but bulidings themselves only depreciate without dumping more money into the building. So that 5%-10% is all land value gain. As a property owner, why increase taxes by using the land more productively with new buildings, when you can continue to profit just as much without that? Also, attempting to build is hugely risky, because the permitting process is fraught, long, and likely to fail.<p>If we didn&#x27;t have Prop 13, every single property owner would have a <i>lot</i> more incentive to actually try to build.')
