No, your Tesla wouldn&#x27;t stop in time for a fully stopped car in that situation.<p>It does slow down for traffic, but I think many people don&#x27;t realize something - it works with <i>moving</i> traffic, because then it can definitely recognize that you are approaching a car(or at least something that moves in the same direction you do), so it knows it has to slow down for it.<p>&gt;&gt;It also beeps when it thinks I’m going to hit a stopped car and other things that demonstrate that this claim is false.<p>Read up on it, I&#x27;m sure the upper limit for this function is when the delta speed is &lt;50km&#x2F;h. It won&#x27;t work with a delta of 150km&#x2F;h because it&#x27;s physically not possible.<p>&gt;&gt; but it’s not true that “the system is trained to ignore stationary objects”<p>These are not my words, that&#x27;s exactly what Tesla said after the &quot;trailer across a highway&quot; accident, saying that of course they have to ignore stopped objects otherwise the car would emergency brake for overhead signs since they reflect radar the same way a stationary car does - at large enough distance there is no difference.')
