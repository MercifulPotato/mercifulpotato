All the boxes, and a well respected PhD. So it&#x27;s hard to imagine how they&#x27;d be racist against someone they head hunted and desperately wanted. It&#x27;s not like they hired her from behind a curtain and only found out who they hired once they said yes.<p>&gt; Based on conversations with managers ... nearly an explicit policy HR holds ... that ultimatums would never be tolerated and could result in termination.<p>Yes, but it&#x27;s <i>would</i> not could. And especially quickly when the demand could never be fulfilled.<p>I&#x27;ve heard of only one ultimatum that worked, but it was for the benefit of both parties. A senior engineer said they&#x27;d be leaving at the end of the quarter if the company didn&#x27;t let them hire a team around them, including a peer. They gave two choices, fold the project and move me into a supported team, or support this one.<p>&gt; one would hope that a company would trust an established ethicist about whether it were appropriate to issue an ultimatum<p>If she&#x27;d said &quot;stop, don&#x27;t release that AI, it&#x27;s got a critical bug that will hurt people&quot; then they probably would. That&#x27;s the role they hired her for.<p>But I imagine they&#x27;d think she&#x27;s a bit too close to her own situation, and out of her area, to take her word here and <i>tell her the names of the anonymous reviewers</i> for great justice.')
