Item(by='api', descendants=None, kids=[25929805], score=None, time=1611760107, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25928908, text='A <i>lot</i> of things happened in the early 70s:<p>- Many overseas markets opened to more outsourcing. Nixon &quot;going to China&quot; was one of the big ones.<p>- The rest of the world had pretty much fully recovered from WWII and started being more competitive with US manufacturing.<p>- The collapse of Bretton Woods and the removal of the gold peg for the US dollar freed central banks to pursue aggressive monetary policy.<p>- Automation really took off in the 1970s, and the computer revolution really got going.<p>- Women entered the work force in large numbers. In case anyone misreads: I am not against this. I&#x27;m just pointing out the supply and demand effects.<p>- Unions started declining for numerous reasons including the rise of anti-union politics and corruption in unions themselves.<p>- Increased racial equality is another thing I&#x27;m not against, but I am forced to point out that it increases the supply of labor in many labor markets that had been at least partly closed to non-whites.<p>- Finally, more immigration is definitely on the list too.<p>... there&#x27;s a lot more, but those are the big ones. Almost everything I listed is deflationary to labor prices. So many things hit in the 70s it&#x27;s like the floor dropped out. It&#x27;s amazing US labor has managed to hang on at all.')
