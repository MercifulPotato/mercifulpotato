[1]<p>So 1.4 million people on the oceans is still virtually empty overall. Think about it this way. There are 3.2 million Mongolians and Mongolia is quite large -- thus, Mongolia is extremely empty. There are less than half as many seafarers as Mongolians, and they are spread over a much larger area.<p>That being said -- those seafarers are actually mostly just in shipping lanes -- which are actually quite crowded. So crowded such that when they intersect with whale migratory routes, the likelihood of impacts is extremely high.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastcompany.com&#x2F;3016331&#x2F;think-the-world-is-crowded-you-could-fit-the-entire-human-race-in-new-zealand" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastcompany.com&#x2F;3016331&#x2F;think-the-world-is-crowd...</a>')
