It&#x27;s about forcing mega-corporations that provide what could be termed essential infrastructure to modern life.<p>There is a lot of precedent. Banks, electricity companies, railway operators, ... cannot arbitrarily refuse to serve customers. I see nothing immoral and fully support extending this to big tech (while not suppressing competition of course, i.e. it should only affect companies once they reach a certain size).')
