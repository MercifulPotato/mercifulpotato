Not out of any desire to reward loyalty, but because the worker is a known quantity familiar with the internal culture, and because the fact that they are applying for such positions means it&#x27;s also likely that they are considering outside positions and that if they don&#x27;t get an internal job they are likely to take an external one and leave the existing position uncovered anyway.')
