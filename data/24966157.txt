Google provides a number of services and seemingly, if you break the T&amp;Cs on one of them, your entire account is disabled and you no longer have access to other Google services (including email).<p>I can&#x27;t imagine not having access to my email - at this point I&#x27;m kind of locked in. Google keeps a lot of my passwords and I register all of my important accounts to my main gmail account. If Google were to close my account suddenly, it would certainly disrupt my life quite a bit.<p>Email grew into an essential part of modern life. Taking away access willy-nilly would distress most people. I understand that this is a free service and we&#x27;re the product, but I believe companies should only offer email accounts knowing that access can be denied only in exceptional circumstances (e.g. abusing the email service directly).')
