We can continue to use less and less material, and come up with designs that require less and less labor per watt.<p>And there are entire directions we haven&#x27;t really explored yet to reduce costs even further. For example, panel lifetime. If we can extend panel lifetime by 5 years, that&#x27;s a 20%-25% reduction in costs. Yet lifetime has stayed fairly constant and unoptimized up until now. 10 years from now we will have a ton of new lifetime  data from existing panels that can help us guide the next generation of panels.')
