When people asked, &quot;What have you given as Mr.Franklin?&quot; He said, &quot;A REPUBLIC. IF YOU CAN KEEP IT&quot;. What if, I am and my friend will decide to beat you up and steal your stuff? It&#x27;s bad, isn&#x27;t it? But what if we outvote you and send a senator to steal your stuff, why is this ok? The wealthiest country in the world was built by freedom and supremacy of people&#x27;s rights (Life, Liberty, Property, Pursuit of Happiness). None of that exists anymore, America has Democrats(Left) and Republicans(they actually Democrats, today JFK would be Republican).')
