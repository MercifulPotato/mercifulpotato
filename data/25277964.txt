Other proteins can be used, but it&#x27;s the most common by far.<p>The comparison might still not be perfect, but OPs point about needing a well-balanced diet is still relevant and important to this discussion. We don&#x27;t get all our nutrients from a single source, especially not meat. So not getting all our nutrients from lab-grown meat isn&#x27;t a problem. We&#x27;ll get them from somewhere else.
