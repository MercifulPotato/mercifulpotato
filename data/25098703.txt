I honestly have no idea) browsers don&#x27;t do OCSP. This is because it&#x27;s a huge privacy problem (as we saw here for Apple) <i>and</i> because the OCSP servers have too often been unreliable.<p>Firefox has OCSP Must Staple, but in that scenario the remote web server is responsible for periodically ensuring it has a sufficiently up-to-date OCSP response about its own certificate which it then &quot;staples&quot; to the certificate to prove its identity. So if the OCSP server fails for an hour a good quality stapling implementation just keeps using older responses until it comes back. Also it&#x27;s optional, most people haven&#x27;t chosen to set Must Staple anyway.<p>Everybody else has various CRL-based strategies, so your browser learns about certain important revocations, eventually, but it doesn&#x27;t pro-actively check for them on every connection and thus destroy your privacy.')
