Let&#x27;s say you lose the farmland and Alaska and some other important, but low population states.<p>Is that worth it so everyone could say that the most votes will always win?<p>We already have a system where candidates can just ignore states. They really can&#x27;t ignore regions though with the electoral college. They have to have some cross regional appeal to win. That&#x27;s a good thing.<p>Straight popular votes is too risky for little gain.<p>I care more about the states and their rights, the preservation of the union, the country&#x27;s assets, and other things than ensuring that every vote is counted 1:1 in practice. For many, yes, their vote will not matter depending on who they vote for and where they live. But the founders anticipated more than most realize.<p>It&#x27;s like when you have an election with 10 candidates. Nobody gets a majority, but some people are like - whoever gets the most votes should win!<p>That&#x27;s not likely to be the best result.<p>I&#x27;m a big fan of keeping it simple. But I don&#x27;t believe a straight popular vote would be a better system with our history, today&#x27;s divisiveness and the goals of preserving the union.')
