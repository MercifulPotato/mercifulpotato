Item(by='c0nsumer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606534671, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25234274, text='I&#x27;m a fairly serious mountain biker as well, and I&#x27;m wholly sold on carbon rims. In particular, I&#x27;m waiting on a set of rims to be delivered to rebuild some I9 Hydra Trail S aluminum-rimmed wheels with carbon.<p>I&#x27;ve been riding on carbon rims on both hard tail XC bikes and my full suspension trail bike for six years. I&#x27;ve also had aluminum rims on my single speed and hard tail trail bike. I can&#x27;t count the number of times I&#x27;ve hit the carbon rim and had it be just fine, but all of my aluminum rims have some degree of denting from much lesser riding.<p>Between the bikes with carbon wheels there&#x27;s about 12,000 miles of trail riding and they&#x27;ve been just fine.<p>After I dented the rim on the I9s and had a spoke break I decided a good winter project would be rebuilding the wheels to carbon rims because my previous experiences with them have been so good.<p>I think the primary benefits of carbon are stronger sidewalls (less likely to dent) and that they cannot be bent and thus can&#x27;t go out of true (unless the wheel is built wrong). Yes, they can be broken, but it takes a LOT more than it would for a comparable aluminum rim.<p>(For reference, the rims I&#x27;ve beat on so hard are Light Bicycle RM29C07 and I&#x27;m replacing the stock rims on the I9 wheels with AM930.)')
