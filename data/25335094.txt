It was <i>really</i> good. But then at some point it&#x27;s accuracy dropped significantly (it would guess my object less than a third of the time). And their design changed for the worse. I suspect that either someone bought them out, or people messed up the training in the NN, or both.<p>As an example, once it felt it was close enough to the answer, would show you the list of candidate answers with weights at the bottom of each question. That was fun to see how it would get closer or further to my object with the answers I provided. They stopped showing that a long time ago.<p>My favorite question it asks: Does it weight more than a duck?')
