With my insurance plan, that will max out my $8,000 deductible, + another $8,000 co-insurance to hit my out of pocket maximum of $16,000. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;d pay, $16,000.<p>Or, I can go to Tennessee and get the appendectomy (MSDRG 343) for $4,700 and pay that directly.<p>Many people will make that choice Kaiser gets less business putting downward pressure on their pricing. And the folks in Tennessee might see they can raise their prices so that it starts to equalize to some point.')
