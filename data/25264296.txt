It&#x27;s not a good idea to <i>just</i> pop up on Reddit and buy whatever the first thing you see them recommend is. You need to do some minimum amount of critical thinking. You need to spend some time browsing a given subreddit.<p>The idea behind using Reddit for product recommendation is the observation that an active community of enthusiast of some niche is hard to game by marketers - such community will try to moderate away spam, as it interferes with their regular discussion, and expert community members will be able to call astroturfers on their bullshit. It&#x27;s orders of magnitude more reliable a source than in-store reviews and most review sites, as they&#x27;re all thoroughly gamed and&#x2F;or owned by marketers. But you do need a little bit of critical thinking to evaluate what you read there.')
