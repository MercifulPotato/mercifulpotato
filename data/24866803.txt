The legislature does have plenary power to &quot;enforce a complete system of workersâ€™ compensation&quot; but no one&#x27;s going to undertake the challenge of massive labor reform challenging Borello and the ABC test for Ubers&#x27; sake, especially when it&#x27;s so contentious (for what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m slightly biased because of the fear it&#x27;ll open the door to other labor law poison pills). AB5 brings the existing framework into spec with Borello&#x2F;Dynamex and clarifies open questions.<p>That&#x27;s why Uber, Lyft, et al have thrown almost $200 million behind the prop 22 marketing campaign. Even if the legislature overturns AB5, the core reasons behind the court&#x27;s decision remain for future lawsuits to hammer home. AFAICT Uber&#x27;s only hope is the CA Supreme Court not doing to Prop 22 what it did to Prop 8 or Federal reform. They&#x27;re not going to get it from the state legislature.')
