The more people who do this, the more difficult it becomes for those who don&#x27;t.<p>You can&#x27;t download even free apps from the App Store without providing an email address, phone number, and street address (to get an Apple ID).  The App Store app also sends the mac&#x27;s hardware serial number to Apple when you launch it, associating it with your identity in the logs. The email and phone required are verified so you can&#x27;t just make some shit up.<p>This means that to get any apps from the App Store, even free ones, you must be thoroughly de-anonymized.<p>Not caring about privacy because you have nothing to hide is like not caring about free speech because you have nothing to say.<p>Developers should reject the App Store on customer privacy grounds alone. When this becomes the sole method of distributing apps on the mac, as it is on iOS, the world becomes a much worse place, as then the US government had permanent access without a warrant to every app you use.<p>Please don&#x27;t contribute to building that world.')
