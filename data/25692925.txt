Item(by='gwright', descendants=None, kids=[25694347, 25693792], score=None, time=1610150872, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25692191, text='&gt; Plotting armed violence to overturn a legitimate election result isn&#x27;t.<p>Not condoning any sort of violence or the riots from Wednesday but I think it is worth observing that the problem isn&#x27;t that there are people who are trying to &quot;overturn a legitimate election result&quot;.  The problem is that there are people who believe that the election results were not legitimate. They are acting on that premise and so in their mind they are acting to overturn an <i>illegitimate</i> election result. Simply asserting that they are wrong will not change things, in fact it has a good chance of making things altogether worse as it simply emphasizes the grievance that their concerns aren&#x27;t being addressed.<p>Resolving these issues isn&#x27;t going to come from simply insisting that the other side is wrong. and it isn&#x27;t going to come from disappearing Trump. Trump is <i>not</i> the source of the problem. Anything we can do to create extreme transparency and rebuild trust in our voting mechanisms would be a good start.<p>Even if we could magically convince everyone that the vote was 100% accurate as is, the result is still evidence of significant divisions in the American electorate. Resolving these political differences isn&#x27;t going to be easy.<p>I&#x27;m not going to pretend to have some magical solutions to these divisions but we are going to have to find a better way to understand and mediate our differences. We need to find a way to rise above the tribalism that is growing stronger every day.')
