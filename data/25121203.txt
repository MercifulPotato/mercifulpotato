I don&#x27;t want to sign up to Youtube to watch a video and definitely I&#x27;m still not a robot whether they ask me one or a thousand times, but apparently they keep using these dirty tactics (nagging for login and endless captchas) because they think I&#x27;m bending over if asked enough times.<p>Well, thankyou for the consideration, but no is no. The last Google related thing I use is email, which I&#x27;m already planning to ditch as I already did most of the times with their search engine and completely with Android phones.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, that is not a Google only thing, but rather modern businesses attitude to monetize everything to the smallest detail. All those companies are turning the Internet&#x2F;Mobile&#x2F;Desktop experience into crap in which users spend more time filtering out things they don&#x27;t want. That is not going to end, until users won&#x27;t send a strong message by ditching software that treats them like idiots.')
