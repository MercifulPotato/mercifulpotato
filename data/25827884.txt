While no video proof exists that he was or was not doing so, this is a pretty good indicator that he was. Since there&#x27;s no indicator that he wasn&#x27;t pointing a gun at her kids, at we can see that he is in fact pointing a gun upstairs where her family is, it&#x27;s more reasonable to believe he was. Unless you have some sort of evidence that he wasn&#x27;t.<p>Also, notice the lack of trigger discipline that they&#x27;re using in the videos... Absolutely disgusting.')
