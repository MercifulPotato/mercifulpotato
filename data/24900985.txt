Plus of course someone can just steal your phone, force you unlock it and steal more than they could ever steal from you if you only had cash.<p>Your enhanced security is a box containing more money than you can carry. This box can (most of the times) only be opened with a key but this key is always with you. So whoever steals your force will just force you to open the box')
