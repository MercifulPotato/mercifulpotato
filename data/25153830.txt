The option is to sell the family business and distribute the cash or start a &quot;family office&quot; and run it and it&#x27;s assets together in a pool.<p>For both sentimental and other reasons the family business is not sold (i.e. may have never had audited financials since it had a single owner and no outside investors so it would be near impossible to sell it for a price the family believes is fair).<p>These type of &quot;family offices&quot; don&#x27;t have any full-time investment management staff. They work with the same type of advisors an individual who had $5M of investment assets would.')
