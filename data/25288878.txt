Few things that make difference for me.<p>1. Notifications are leagues ahead of anything on iOS.<p>2. Little accessibility features like sound search, automatic caption, text selection from any screen&#x2F;pictures, better integration with google assistant adds up.<p>3. Customizability. Yes, even now iPhone is super limited in the layout you can have on home screen or the new app launcher. You can&#x27;t group things or put them wherever you want on the screen. This is ridiculous.<p>4. Android phones have higher refresh rates. Almost any flagship in 2020. The punch hole camera feels better than the notch. Face ID = problematic in the pandemic with masks. Though, I like it generally but apple could have given touch ID on the same device as well.<p>5. For tinkerers, it has better support again. Youtube vanced, tachiyomi, advanced adblockers, &quot;real&quot; firefox with extensions, etc are only available on android.<p>The best part is you can get the pixel 4a for $300 with some carriers. 3 years of updates which is what typical upgrade cycle looks like for iPhone users even if they get &quot;updates&quot; for longer.<p>Source: Own both.')
