The caveat is that my agreement is based on my understanding that these bans are justified because of terms of service (TOS) violations.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure that Google Play, for example, has banned other apps in the past because of issues with &quot;user-generated content&quot; that was not sufficiently moderated.<p>If tech firms are enforcing TOS and doing it in an even-handed way, then I&#x27;m OK with that. Freedom of speech is important, big companies with lots of power also have lots of responsibility, but I think they should still be able to have TOS.<p>Whether it&#x27;s truly even-handed is an important question. Even if  a TOS agreement is written objectively, it&#x27;s possible enforce it selectively. Personally, I don&#x27;t see any clear sign that it isn&#x27;t even-handed. Given the timing, it&#x27;s obviously reactive, but that seems OK to me because there is new information to consider, and the app took on greater importance, so it&#x27;s natural to look more closely at it (among all the many apps out there).')
