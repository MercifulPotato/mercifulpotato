Why should I have to install my own bootloader to multiboot? Why can&#x27;t the motherboard do that for me?<p>With UEFI I can set up my own boot entries and boot directly into whichever Linux kernel I like with whatever arguments I like. I can write a script that easily boots me into another OS exactly once. And it&#x27;s a delight to not have to think about traditional bootloaders anymore.')
