The Hind, while well armored compared to other helicopters, is much more vulnerable than the A-10. For example, an A-10 can lose an engine and still make it home. If a Hind loses a rotor, it&#x27;s probably dead.<p>And the real issue is whether the A-10 can survive against a near peer like Russia or China. Considering that in the late 70&#x27;s the life expectancy of an A-10 over the Fulda Gap was measured in single digit sorties, expecting them to survive today against modern SAMs (both radar guided and infrared) is unrealistic.<p>CAS in bush country like Iraq&#x2F;Afghan is much better performed by fast jets that can respond quickly with a JDAM or SDB.')
