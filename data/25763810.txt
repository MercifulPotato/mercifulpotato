The compiler knows the type of &quot;bla&quot; after all.<p>Also this would be nice to create a zero-initialized struct value:<p><pre><code>    const struct bla_t bla = {};\n</code></pre>\n...this would basically be a C99 designated initialization without any initializers (it works as a language extension in gcc and clang, but is an error in MSVC).')
