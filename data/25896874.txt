Item(by='ascar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611527540, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25891628, text='&gt; I feel like you’re disagreeing with a pointlessly weak version of the comment you’re replying to.<p>No, I&#x27;m disagreeing witht the one-sidedness of the GPs comment. I don&#x27;t disagree that the socialising aspect of university is good for *some* (or to some degree even for everyone). I do disagree that it&#x27;s something that fits *everyone at all times*.<p>That is why I finished my comment with the outlook that every student has the option to choose what is best for him&#x2F;her. Reality is, especially before covid, that remote learning and self-studying had avoidable disadvantages, because it wasn&#x27;t a first class citizen and I really hope it remains a first class citizen, while in-person studying is still available for everyone who likes to use it.<p>&gt; It would be cynical to think that university is just a book<p>I don&#x27;t think you learn how to learn or how to live from reading a book. I do however think you do that throughout university. You have a certain curriculum, you have certain goals that you chose willingly and you have to figure yourself out how to learn them, but also how to motivate yourself and often also how to go through life without your parents. It&#x27;s this unstructuredness and self-governance that I really appreciate about university. Once you start working, your life is much more structured and externally motivated than during university.<p>&gt; unlike school, you’re no longer surrounded by people who don’t really want to be there and it is an environment where people are particularly similar without all having the same goal.<p>In computer science undergrad I experienced that a lot of my peers were not actually intereted in the engineering, in the building part of things, but that they chose the field because of the career outlook and the money. It wasn&#x27;t particular interesting to work with them and like another commenter said I also did feel they slowed me down. After the first years I tried my best to choose peers that were interested in the engineering for all group work.<p>Things aren&#x27;t black and white. That&#x27;s also why I said having the opportunity to choose on any given day is great. I&#x27;m not arguing against in-person class and socialising. I&#x27;m arguing for choice! For opportunities! If someone thinks 2 in-person days at university are enough, in an ideal world he should have the option to self-study remotely the remaining three days and not be forced to be at campus just because some think it&#x27;s best for him. Figuring out how you work best youself as an individual is an integral part of the experience and if you aren&#x27;t given enough choice, independence, freedom, you can&#x27;t really figure that out.<p>Finally, because of the flexibility my university provided, I was able to work up to 2 full days (legally up to 20 hours, in reality I did like 14-16) per week. Not in some unrelated job, but as a junior&#x2F;student software engineer building and shipping production products together with senior engineers. So, I could also socialize and learn from more senior peers, while earning some additional money. This was, at least at my university, rather common among the software engineering focused students and in addition to a possible summer internship. This might also not be right for everyone, but it just shows there are a lot of different paths that all can be successful and it highly depends on the individual. Arguing in-person university is best for everyone and that the socialising is indispensable for everyone is missing the point.')
