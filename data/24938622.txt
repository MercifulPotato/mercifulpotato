They get paid by Medicare for short term rehab in their facility and the rate is about $400&#x2F;day.  The majority of the people are long term on Medicaid and the reimbursement is between $120-200 per day depending on case difficulty.  There are certain games they play to increase the reimbursement such as getting most of the patients diagnosed with depression.  I have heard zingers such as “there is a very fine line between optimizing patient care and Medicaid fraud”.  At Medicaid rates the only way it works is if the people providing the care make about $10&#x2F;hr.  All the good caregivers tend to work at the best run facilities, so quality tends to be bimodal.')
