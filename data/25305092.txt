Item(by='golergka', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607102775, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25298748, text='&gt; I feel investing anything more than the bare minimum to get your assigned work done is worth less than just grinding leetcode and otherwise studying for interviews. Doing an actual good job, above and beyond, is not going to be worth much when you&#x27;re looking for your next job.<p>Does it mean that CV credentials like &quot;developed requirements for a complex system, built it from scratch and overcome significant technical challenges in doing so&quot; don&#x27;t mean anything, in your opinion? Because in my experience interviewing, things like this get a lot of attention, are discussed in depth and leave impression on the interviewer. I think that my results interviewing would be significantly worse if it was just &quot;fixed bugs and did incremental improvements&quot; instead.<p>But again, I have very little experience (or desire) interviewing at FAANGs of the world, may be they do things differently?')
