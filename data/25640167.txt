Item(by='taurath', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609805549, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25630752, text='&gt; Employees can ask for better, but when you already work at the company that pays and treats their employees like Google, I&#x27;m not sure what more you are entitled to.<p>Alphabet makes $1.7 million per employee. Its clear that those employees don&#x27;t necessarily individually have that level of contribution. Nor is it that the business model that sergey and larry made would necessarily be possible with any given number of people who aren&#x27;t sergey and larry. Its much more about the ratio.<p>The business idea + investor money is the original capital for the business. Sergey&#x2F;Larry and the investors deserve to be compensated, and are, wildly. No problem there. Basically everyone believes that inventors and creators have all sorts of rights to be compensated for that. The question is how much, since they utilize the labor of others to realize their goals.')
