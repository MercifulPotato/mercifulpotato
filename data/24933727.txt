Since they involve movements of entire ethnicities, they become ethnic wars that are actually resource wars where the haves vs have-nots to deal with the environmental or resource disaster are delineated along ethnic divides.<p>The Sudan crisis was explained to me as being fundamentally a water war in this way.')
