If I have 10 bitcoins, I can lend them to whoever I want. I have to rely on the legal system to get them back in the case of a bad actor, but there are other emerging coins which encode the idea of credit into the blockchain itself. I doubt they&#x27;ll work very well; the legal system is still critical to ensuring credit functions, and that doesn&#x27;t have to go away with crypto.<p>Credit systems are not created by the government. Sure, the government is the biggest player, but at the philosophical level, credit systems are created by anyone who has an asset but doesn&#x27;t need it right now.<p>The bigger thing that crypto does actively do away with is actively managed monetary policy. The populace hates on the people in power (banks, funds, government) for their quest for wealth and power, but for all the wrong that happens, monetary policy has been the single biggest driver in providing creature comforts and a modern lifestyle for the average citizen of the planet.<p>There absolutely is a substrate of &quot;holy shit nothing is actually anything&quot; at the very core of our economy. We print money to pay off loans given to us by other countries bought with their printed money. Nothing actually is anything. But, computers aren&#x27;t cool with that; there is very real, hard math in the deepest parts of cryptocurrencies. You can take one of two sides in this argument, and I&#x27;m not sure either is absolutely correct (partly because, I&#x27;m not even sure there is a definition for was &quot;correct&quot; means in this context): Either you believe that substrate should be hard math, and modern economics is a farce, or that you believe monetary policy is the only way to ascend an economy beyond trade and barter, that we need men in suits at the top pulling levers and twisting dials to keep this machine running another day.<p>Maybe its alright that nothing is actually anything, and it can stay that way forever, chasing infinite growth as we expand into the cosmos. Or, then, maybe someone hacks our computer and changes the value of the Blemfark from One of its itself to Zero of itself.<p>Here&#x27;s what I do know; whether or not it would be better, people seem to increasingly desire less top-level control and less delegation of so much power to wall street firms. Crypto is going to continue to get more and more popular, even <i>if</i> its against the best interests of the people, because our government and wall street underestimated how much influence the 300 million people that aren&#x27;t them actually have. That&#x27;s the cost of democracy and a free society; it sometimes takes the wrong path.')
