The modern style of home ownership (30 year mortgage, house in the suburbs, local control of land use) has really deeply screwed up many economic feedback mechanisms that in previous generations powered the economic engine of the US. The economic history of our nation is a history of people moving east to west to new opportunity (both 100s of years ago to farm the land, extract resource and displace native peoples, and today to move to high productivity jobs near low cost housing in sunbelt cities), as well as people moving south to  north to flee the Jim Crow south and a rentier economy based on the dispossession of black farmers. It should be easier to move, we should reintroduce the modern equivalent of &quot;boarding houses&quot;, and the lowest tier of housing in urban centers should be much less expensive.')
