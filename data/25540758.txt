Or rather, to satisfy the collection of niggling doubts[1] we call the &quot;inner critic&quot;. That voice constantly questioning us in our own heads, poking holes in our logic, and ensuring we&#x27;re actually thinking and not pretending to think.<p>The problem with fallacies, as I see it, is they&#x27;re often employed to fool that inner critic. They can dress up any emotional, thoughtless reaction in the guise of reason.<p>&quot;I thought that person was rude&quot; becomes &quot;I believe this person is engaging in an ad-hominen attack.&quot; Or &quot;they have a belief I don&#x27;t like&quot; becomes &quot;Clearly, the other person has a  case of confirmation bias.&quot;<p>I think our inner critic will detect us taking such mental shortcuts; it won&#x27;t be quieted so easily. I also think that&#x27;s why fallacy-first thinkers will spam their views across threads. Unable to persuade themselves, let alone others, they resort to rhetoric to silence their own creeping doubts.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.peirce.org&#x2F;writings&#x2F;p107.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.peirce.org&#x2F;writings&#x2F;p107.html</a>')
