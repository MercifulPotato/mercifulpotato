Seeing the trademark so blatantly misused was especially painful to me. Our efforts to resolve the problem with Amazon failed, forcing us to file a lawsuit. NOT OK.<p>&gt; We have seen that this trademark issue drives confusion with users thinking Amazon Elasticsearch Service is actually a service provided jointly with Elastic, with our blessing and collaboration. This is just not true. NOT OK.<p>&gt; When the service launched, imagine our surprise when the Amazon CTO tweeted that the service was released in collaboration with us. It was not. And over the years, we have heard repeatedly that this confusion persists. NOT OK.<p>&gt; When Amazon announced their Open Distro for Elasticsearch fork, they used code that we believe was copied by a third party from our commercial code and provided it as part of the Open Distro project. We believe this further divided our community and drove additional confusion.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elastic.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;why-license-change-AWS" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elastic.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;why-license-change-AWS</a>')
