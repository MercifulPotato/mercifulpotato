But this isn&#x27;t feasible advice.  It is <i>never</i> possible to drive perfectly safely, it&#x27;s just not.  Everyone makes mistakes in cars, and preventing them needs to be a defense in depth treatment and not an impossible prohibition like this.<p>Saying &quot;people sometimes drive tired&quot; (goodness knows I have) leads to &quot;maybe a driver-facing camera might save lives&quot;.<p>Saying &quot;You should never drive tired!&quot; is just a recipe for blaming the driver and fixing nothing.')
