Almost everything I read about it falls into two camps:<p>* Most people in free software: The FSF wrote it, therefore it&#x27;s fine, because the FSF are trustworthy when it comes to freedom%. All server open source projects should use it, it&#x27;ll magically protect us from the SaaS loophole, and there is nothing to worry about if you&#x27;re not an evil corporation.<p>* Most every big corp: the AGPL is a ginormous can of worms and we aren&#x27;t touching it with a 1 mile pole. Nope. Stay away.<p>Guess what? Reality is in between those two extremes. The problems with the AGPL are widely underreported in the free software world, and almost nobody has taken a close look at its wording and what it really means. &quot;Leave it to the lawyers&quot; but then nobody ever actually goes and asks a lawyer for a clean take on it.<p>We should do better. The FSF has done a terrible job of educating people on exactly what the AGPL requires and how it interacts with typical free software project development and deployment workflows. If <i>you</i> haven&#x27;t asked a lawyer about this then maybe you should think twice before slapping it on your project. Relicensing after the fact is a very costly ordeal.<p>% The FSF, through their &quot;Respects your Freedom&quot; hardware rubber-stamping program and its absolutely broken requirements, which actively encourages reduction in user freedom, makes it much harder to detect hidden proprietary backdoors, and hurts projects that are actually aiming for maximum openness, have amply proved that they are not infallible and are not to be trusted without careful review of their policies and projects. I can go into a whole different tangent about this, but my point is, don&#x27;t treat the FSF as the good guys by default. Look at what it is they&#x27;re doing <i>exactly</i> and all of its consequences.')
