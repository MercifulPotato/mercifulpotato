The internet coming via coaxial cables is sharing the road with TV service.  TV service earns Comcast&#x2F;Spectrum&#x2F;Cox&#x2F;etc more money than internet service, so they don&#x27;t necessarily want people to consume via internet yet (at least not until they own the media companies like Comcast).<p>So they probably only have a tiny amount of bandwidth available for an entire neighborhood, and then they sell you 100s of Mb in download, except that if you read the fine print, it&#x27;s only burst speeds, so it&#x27;s not like you get 300Mbps sustained download bandwidth.  It&#x27;s just a temporary boost while they take it from others in the neighborhood.   And the upload, who knows how little is allocated for that, they don&#x27;t even bother advertising upload bandwidth.')
