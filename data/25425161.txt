Item(by='huskyr', descendants=None, kids=[25426405], score=None, time=1607990509, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25424810, text='I think there&#x27;s something to be said for putting this data in their own Wikibase instance. There are <i>a lot</i> of items here, including many items like &#x27;Inventory of person X in year Y&#x27;. Adding so many items to Wikidata would not have been without its controversy. Also, i could imagine they need a lot of properties that are not available, or aren&#x27;t used in the same way on Wikidata. There is a reason why all museums and other heritage institutions use their own databases and thesauri instead of putting it all in the same database.<p>However, the beauty of using a linked data platform is of course that it&#x27;s easy to link back to other sources, like Wikidata. I could definitely see that in the future Wikidata could do an import of many of these items, or link properly to them using a new property.<p>I do agree that it&#x27;s unfortunate that they&#x27;re licensing everything under CC-BY instead of CC-Zero.')
