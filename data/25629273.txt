First, you are not going to get in unless you know the right people and they want to let you in.  Once you&#x27;re in, though, you can&#x27;t quit.  You are a founder and you took money.  They want their promised returns.<p>Now you have to understand the west coast cities are far leftists mobs.  They want communism in America.  They want more Chinese CCP control in America.  CCP are their benefactors.  They want BLM burning cities to help them achieve these political goals.  Since I know people in Denver don&#x27;t want that, probably you don&#x27;t want to look for money over there.<p>Denver is further spiritually from silicon valley than Siberia. Most west coasters have a vague notion of Denver.  They know it is in flyover country and that they&#x27;ve been to the airport on their way to vail, breck, or aspen.  Maybe they even have an office in Boulder or 16th street mall, but they know nothing about the mountain states or surviving in them.<p>If you still think taking money from the radical leftist mafia in the bay area is a good idea, I would suggest skip the middle man and go straight to China.  That is a long shot unless you have people helping you who play on the international stage.  But, ycombinator type money is also a very long shot unless you are a leftists bent on communism and leftist political control of America.  Just being outside of the Bay Area, Portland, or Seattle you are already suspect to them.')
