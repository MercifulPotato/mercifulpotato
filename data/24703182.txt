I personally stopped watching YT just because it’s hard to find quality content, not to mention, unless you have premium, it’s impossible to watch with all the ads. However, just by chance, I’m working on a project with a partner I met a few months back, that aims to help users find and organize curated content from YT in a sane way. But first I felt I should ask others with the same sentiments about YT and see what else we can do.')
