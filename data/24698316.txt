I do this because I need to convey complex ideas to important teams who are NOT programmers: Product, Marketing, People Ops, and the C-suite.<p>Helping people understand my ideas through illustration creates buy-in from them and trust in me. You can be a great programmer, but if people don&#x27;t know and don&#x27;t trust in what you&#x27;re doing you&#x27;ll never be given the space to execute.')
