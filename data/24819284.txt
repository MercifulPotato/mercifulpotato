I.e. how Rust in this example helps me as a reader of the code to be sure if the right metadata function was called?<p>Call me old fashioned, but only C is more sure to be explicit there as it wouldn&#x27;t allow two different functions having the same name. If in C++ the corresponding names are also overloaded, both C and C++ &quot;aren&#x27;t cutting&quot; if the obviousness is not there.')
