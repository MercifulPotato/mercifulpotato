Item(by='Guvante', descendants=None, kids=[25695550], score=None, time=1610155400, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25694277, text='&gt; sustained left-wing effort to paint the 2016 election as illegitimate<p>That is such a purposely flawed statement that it is effectively a pure lie even if some of those beats are somewhat true.<p>Trump has been claiming election fraud since 2016. He claimed he got more votes than Clinton and that three million people voted illegally in California which is why he lost the popular vote.<p>The only things claimed illegitimate by anyone with any power in the left were either &quot;it isn&#x27;t fair that the popular vote doesn&#x27;t matter&quot;, &quot;we shouldn&#x27;t disenfranchise voters as the GOP keeps trying to do in the name of &#x27;election security&#x27;&quot; or &quot;certain actors illegally acted around the 2016 election&quot;.<p>There is a world of difference between that last one (the closest to illegitimate) and an actual claim of fraud.')
