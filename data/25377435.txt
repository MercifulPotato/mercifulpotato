Lots of people say they don&#x27;t want to &quot;pump money&quot; from customers, bit you do need a way of making money, and if most of your customers will give you very little &#x2F; no money, some customers are going to have to give you a lot.<p>I would personally recommend ruthless simplicity. Particularly on mobile (other than gatcha), most of the most popular games are fairly simple, but polished to a shine. Extra features won&#x27;t help attract players, and anything that puts people off in the first 5 minutes of play is a disaster. No-one likes a 10 minute intro, that explains 20 different things to them.')
