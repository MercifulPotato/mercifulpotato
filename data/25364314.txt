Item(by='joshuamorton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607545617, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25362399, text='&gt; But we do expect them to be able to evaluate the facts relevant to the basic political participation of voting.<p>Do we?<p>Let&#x27;s address this on two levels: First do we really expect people to evaluate the facts relevant to who they choose to vote for? I mean on the one hand, the system does this, yes. But not because we have any particular amount of faith that everyone is ready to bear the responsibility. Instead, we&#x27;re resigned to the fact that all the other options are worse. I mean the founders absolutely didn&#x27;t trust the people to evaluate their leadership, unless you were willing to restrict the definition of &quot;people&quot; to &quot;white male landowners&quot;.<p>Hell, even more, the constitution as written (and federalist 68 explicitly) suggested that the people themselves shouldn&#x27;t select the president, but only select representatives who ultimately do the selection. The justification for this was that said representatives would hopefully be more capable than the average individual of weighing all of the requirements of the office.<p>So the founders certainly didn&#x27;t share your faith. Nor, even today, does the constitution itself. Ultimately though, having a well informed populace is very different from having a kritarchy, and having reputable media is necessary for a well informed populace.<p>If you&#x27;re bombarded with two contradictory pieces of information (which I&#x27;d argue is in many cases the explicitly strategy of some of the media), you either need to be an expert on the topic, or your only approach is to trust people. Like, are you really saying we expect the average American to be able to evaluate the facts relevant to economic policy? Nobel prize winners disagree!<p>But that&#x27;s just the first layer. There&#x27;s a second layer here:<p>At this point we&#x27;re no longer talking about the political participation of voting. That&#x27;s already happened. The votes are in. What we&#x27;re talking about is asking people to evaluate the facts of obscure election law that&#x27;s in most cases never been tested. The average American isn&#x27;t a constitutional Judge. But, to use your word, the president has asked unelected judges to <i>directly</i> overrule the will of the people literally dozens of times. That&#x27;s kritarchy (or just raw authoritarianism, your choice). The actual experts, the judges, have <i>resoundingly</i> said no. Like, among the experts, there is no controversy here. And yet the conspiracy theory persists. Why is that?')
