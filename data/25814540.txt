As can be seen with Mastodon, federation tends toward centralization of the servers if there&#x27;s even an incremental benefit to doing so and nothing encouraging otherwise.<p>Matrix at least seems to have fewer barriers to usability&#x2F;functionality when self-hosting, which decreases the detriments of self-hosting and slightly lowers the drive to centralize, but until P2P is default standard for clients the convergence is likely to remain with a mostly centralized federation infrastructure target than a heavily decentralized one.')
