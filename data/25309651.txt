The prices varied depending on features but it wasn&#x27;t twice as much unless you failed to control specs (I remember forum posters accusing everyone of being fanboys when they came up with a number like that by comparing, say, an Apple device with an SSD to something with a previous-generation processor and spinning metal drive). If you&#x27;re buying comparable quality you get fairly comparable cost.')
