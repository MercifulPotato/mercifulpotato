(2 if you count MST3K as &quot;sci-fi&quot;..?)<p>But my wife wanted to give it a shot because she&#x27;s such a sci-fi nerd (even more than me), and you&#x27;re right: they captured the utter essence of Star Trek so completely that I&#x27;m not entirely sure why he&#x27;s not on a short list to do a serious Star Trek show&#x2F;movie.<p>The qualities that make Star Trek so compelling (especially Next Generation and to a lesser extent DS9 and Voyager) are ever present in The Orville in spades. That it somehow manages to combine a very serious look at life in space with some pretty raunchy potty humor is nothing short of incredible.<p>I would fully support McFarlane (or whomever is responsible for that &quot;essence&quot; in Orville) doing a dramatic space opera, hands down, no question. That would be one hell of a show.<p>Not sure the market would bear it, unfortunately, though.')
