After changing home location, there is always this feeling of where do I belong now? Am I a Swede or a German? Well neither, Germany has moved along since you emigrated, and you are now trying to catch up with Sweden.<p>Same thing with south and north Sweden, there are places I can&#x27;t even understand what they are saying. This on a small place like Sweden, can&#x27;t imagine the differences you have in America and China.')
