The most critical time for spread is when they let everyone go to each other homes.<p>The reason is simple, so no one can say they didn&#x27;t let us celebrate Christmas, and they warned us to be careful - this is politics, it&#x27;s not dealing with a pandemic and an health system on the verge of colapse.<p>---<p>So replying to your question, until there&#x27;s no spread it&#x27;s the right decision. Because living with the virus isn&#x27;t good for the economy, and proof is countries with the virus controlled or with little to no cases, are in economic recovery (like we needed that data to know this, but still, there&#x27;s something).')
