I lost my smell and taste capacities for about 4 days. My wife and oldest son (13) still have very limited smell and taste.<p>But now, I still cannot smell my body odour when I sweat. Normally, it is really a strong odour. But not any more. As my wife and oldest son cannot smell, I cannot ask them and going next door and ask if I smell or not after doing a workout is not something I want to do right now :-D<p>I would not be surprised if dogs could smell a disruption in the &quot;normal human body odour pattern&quot;.<p>This is just a unique sample point without statistical value but if you have the same experience, do not hesitate to contact me.')
