Item(by='curryhoward', descendants=None, kids=[24963361], score=None, time=1604271063, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24963140, text='One important difference between algebraic effects and resumable exceptions is that with algebraic effects, the handler gets access to a reified version of the current continuation. The handler can then use that continuation to resume an arbitrary number of times, or not at all. For example, the handler could resume once for each item in a list, essentially using the continuation to map the list to a new list. The handler can even return the continuation to be invoked later, after the handler has finished. This is very unlike the restricted kind of resumable exceptions that you see in hardware.<p>Algebraic effects are a structured form of delimited continuations, for people who know about that concept. They give you nearly the full power of monads.')
