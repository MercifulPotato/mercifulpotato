Which do you think is more likely to have a significant negative effect on your health? These vaccines or COVID?<p>We have plenty of reason to believe these vaccines will be effective with minimal adverse effects (including the relatively small study of 40k individuals).<p>Conversely, we have definitive proof that in the best case COVID can be asymptomatic and&#x2F;or a nasty, but survivable, virus. At its worst, it kills you or leaves you with long-lasting health issues that we don&#x27;t yet fully understand.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ll take my chances with the vaccine. My biggest fear isn&#x27;t adverse reactions, but rather lack of efficacy.')
