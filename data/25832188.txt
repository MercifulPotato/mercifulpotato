And then you need to receive it on the other end - you don&#x27;t have a plug, but obviously your receiver now has the same issue. You just moved where the problem is. I&#x27;d argue that having such an incredibly strong inductive field is a problem as well, but yeah, you&#x27;re not even going to get that far.<p>Parallel charging is potentially the answer - but even with 10 cables, for a 100kWh battery, you&#x27;re still talking.....600kW per cable? CCS goes only up to 200kW(and those are THICK cables), so if you increase the charging speed to 3 minutes then yes, you could do it with 10 cables. 6 minutes with 5 cables, 30 minutes with one cable.....and we&#x27;re(almost) back to what existing technology already allows?')
