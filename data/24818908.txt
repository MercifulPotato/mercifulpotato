Via DNS, the telecom companies had all the server contact knowledge that Microsoft is prying from users&#x27; memory with their data collecting.<p>There was Cliqz, a European search engine, that got dismantled due to Covid, without anybody offering some emergency funding to keep it going.<p>If a EU firewall is installed, millions of jobs will be created because everything will be done manually again.
