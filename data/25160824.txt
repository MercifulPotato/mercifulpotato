Every new project could have been using OpenID Connect instead of rolling their own authentication. I really wish web frameworks pushed for this.<p>I suppose some of the blame lies with the identity providers. So many of them use a custom OAuth protocol instead of OIDC, which shifts the burden to the developers. Adding a new IdP should be as simple as adding a new trusted URL, instead it&#x27;s often integrating a new SDK.')
