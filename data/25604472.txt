Item(by='jerf', descendants=None, kids=[25608372], score=None, time=1609519469, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25604272, text='&quot;Why is the popular conception of leadership &#x27;bossing people around?&#x27;&quot;<p>That&#x27;s a good question I&#x27;ve been pondering for a while and still don&#x27;t have a great answer for.<p>I think some of it is that one degenerate form of leadership is to conflate it with authority, and a lot of people&#x27;s experience with &quot;leadership&quot; is simply to receive orders.<p>I actually would call what you describe as the ideal form of <i>management</i>, which is not leadership either. An ideal manager is not simply an authority user&#x2F;abuser, but someone who clears obstacles out of the way and works to enhance the ones they are managing&#x27;s skills, but ideally, only a bit of authority is deployed, and a manager may in fact exhibit no leadership at all. (For instance, corporate goals may simply come from higher up, or market pressures, or things other than &quot;leadership&quot; per se.)<p>(There are also degenerate cases where raw, naked authority is in fact necessary and extensively used; I&#x27;m sure a lot of us worked a job at McDonalds or some rough equivalent and have memories of how much it was based on authority... fewer of us have experiences of <i>managing</i> in that environment and being directly exposed to the fact that it is just the only way to make it work, however distasteful you may find that fact.)<p>For me, leadership should be reserved for the cases in which one is visibly <i>leading</i>, e.g., you start a new initiative somewhere, gather up people to voluntarily follow you by a variety of non-coercive means, and then hold the group together in a variety of very context-sensitive means.<p>True leadership is rare. Authority is inescapable, good management is a gem to be treasured but still not <i>that</i> rare, but <i>leadership</i> is a rare thing. Most groups are held together by other bonds.')
