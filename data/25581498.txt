The counties in Finland (Österbotten and Sadakunda), across the Bothnian Gulf on the same latitudes, have higher population density, but have not had this high infection rates, at least so far.<p>But I agree with the point; urbanization rate in the sense of having lots of people using public transit might have significant bearance on the spreading of the epidemic, while population density in the sense of people&#x2F;km² is utterly irrelevant.')
