They’re all making a similar tradeoff for performance: forcing you to consider how you use memory. Does anyone work in a field where the performance difference between these specific three platforms matters? I’m genuinely curious. Edit: also, if you could explain briefly why and what makes particular choices out of the three unsuitable, that would be awesome too.')
