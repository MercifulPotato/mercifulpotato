I can make a deepfake video using open source tools with a few hours of work. There is a video floating around on the internet that shows Trump in a hotel with women peeing on the bed. Mainstream news doesn&#x27;t report on that video because the origin of the video is uncertain. NY Post has made zero effort to verify the authenticity of the documents they have. And they are a right wing tabloid, so have no prior credibility to trade on.<p>And please post links to your sources. Until then, I am going to go out on a limb and assume that the reason you are not doing so is because they are also coming from sites with little to no credibility.')
