Actually, we might even enter phase 1B in some areas and have a mostly parallel administration system start to come up...<p>It&#x27;s unclear to me how much of the slowness so far in administration (13.5% of doses allotted are reported as administered so far)... is A) (fixed?) delays in reporting, B) (fixed?) delays in logistics getting doses to administration sites, C) limitations on rate of administration, D) holiday-related slowness.  Only C really matters in the long term-- if it is ramping poorly compared to production than that&#x27;s a problem.  But I think it&#x27;s premature to assume C is limiting when A, B, &amp; D are surely large right now.')
