If your site is a low value target or the spamming in general is low-value, it&#x27;s often effective. Running any sort of small time open to the internet blog or forum will make the value of CAPTCHAs abundantly clear. The issue here is being inclusive to people, not making them &quot;work&quot; against robots.')
