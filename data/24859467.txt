I am not currently a tor user, but absolutely would if I could integrate it with my current workflow (using the temporary containers addon).&quot;<p>This is my every-six-months wish&#x2F;rant on this subject ...<p><i>What we need</i> is the ability to &#x27;jail&#x27; a GUI browser process.<p>It is too resource intensive to spin up an actual virtual machine to run a browser window&#x2F;tab.  However, a facility like &#x27;jail&#x27; (or zones or, perhaps even Docker) that simply chroots a new process with its own network interface, etc., does not have any of that expense.<p>It really is just a fancy chroot and the expense is limited to the overhead of just the process you&#x27;re running.<p>If you could &#x27;jail&#x27; a GUI application, you could have a browser window that was not merely its own cookie domain or history domain, but that was on an entirely different network and it&#x27;s own chroot.')
