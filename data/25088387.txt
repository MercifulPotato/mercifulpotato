Once you get the bootstrap U-235, then you don&#x27;t need the throttling as much, unless you have a massively overbuilt nuclear plant.<p>(I designed my system when I moved from 3 separate 2×2 nuclear plants to one large 2×6 system, and, as you say, even then it was mostly because I wanted to design such a system, and I didn&#x27;t want to worry about power ever again).')
