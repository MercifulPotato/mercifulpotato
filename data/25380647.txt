I suspect I&#x27;ve cut some important context!\nThe most enjoyable stuff I&#x27;ve done in the past few years has been with Vue and React. I&#x27;ve done a little of both at work and on side projects, but these projects at work are really uncommon — like once in a year sort of things.<p>If I&#x27;m being honest, I&#x27;m not even begrudging these experiences — I have actually, legitimately enjoyed them.<p>My main motivation in getting away from frontend is really getting away from client-driven front-of-frontend stuff. Constant, pointless, niggly changes. That kind of stuff.<p>Working with an interactive component with Vue&#x2F;React, and&#x2F;or working with api data definitely has been actual fun.<p>Appreciate your reply!')
