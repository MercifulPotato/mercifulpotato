The story goes something like... He put on a pair of wired head phones to listen to music while scrubbing the oven, when his wife came home she called out to him but got no response, upon entering the kitchen she saw he was still not responding to her, hunched over and twitching with wires wrapped around his head. Thinking he was being electrocuted and knowing that she could get shocked if she touched him, she grabbed the broom and tried to knock his head free of the wires!')
