Perhaps it&#x27;s because I am a freelancer. I work for a company to bring results and I just try to communicate clearly. When there&#x27;s doubts we have a chat over Skype, since sometimes direct communication is just more efficient than using chat.<p>I believe people can work well as teams while WFH and some kind of company culture (whatever that means) isn&#x27;t really necessary for people to be effective.<p>For the past 1.5 years I&#x27;ve been working for an Australian company. I do mobile dev from Thailand. There&#x27;s an Indian team doing some BLE-related mobile dev from India. There&#x27;s a guy in Vietnam also doing mobile dev. We have a guy in Taiwan doing low-level hardware programming. A guy in Japan doing hardware design. A Russian guy in Georgia who&#x27;s doing we web-related stuff. And the leadership is in Australia. Everyone seems to be able to get along pretty well and without much misunderstanding. Perhaps it&#x27;s also the nature of our work, the product we work on.<p>Why do people feel it&#x27;s important to build some company culture? What does a company culture even mean?')
