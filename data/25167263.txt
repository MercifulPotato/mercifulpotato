I am not going to link to any resources on gangrene because I can&#x27;t readily find any that don&#x27;t make me cringe and I live with a serious medical condition (and processed accident claims for five plus years), so I am pretty callous about stuff like that. (Someone not taking my warning about medical photos seriously previously: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20680819" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20680819</a>)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hopkinsmedicine.org&#x2F;health&#x2F;treatment-tests-and-therapies&#x2F;hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hopkinsmedicine.org&#x2F;health&#x2F;treatment-tests-and-t...</a><p>One of the potential causes of gangrene is <i>anaerobic</i> bacteria. And, so, my layman&#x27;s understanding is that what happens is HBOT forces oxygen into tissues because it&#x27;s under pressure. It&#x27;s like some multiple of earth&#x27;s atmospheric pressure and it can help kill anaerobic infection by exposing them to oxygen in parts of the body that otherwise wouldn&#x27;t be getting good oxygen for some reason.<p>I have a form of cystic fibrosis. It is best known as a respiratory condition, but that&#x27;s not really accurate. It&#x27;s a genetic disorder and it impairs cell function throughout the body and this impacts some tissues more obviously than others, such as the lungs.<p>So cystic fibrosis causes a compromised immune system but, like, I spent a lot of years wondering &quot;What does that even mean? Where is the <i>immune system</i> in my body? Which organs are they? How does CF make me so vulnerable to infection?&quot;<p>And the answer is that &quot;the immune system&quot; doesn&#x27;t really mean a specific set of organs like &quot;the circulatory system&quot; or &quot;the digestive system&quot; means a specific set of organs. It&#x27;s just kind of a catch phrase for &quot;how the body protects itself&quot; and it&#x27;s not really that well understood or explained exactly that happens.<p>People tend to die really young with CF (like in their 30s or younger) and they very often die of lung infection and treatment of lung issues is a really big part of managing CF.<p>So one of the things I have concluded is that most likely one of the ways CF impairs my immune function is low oxygen in the body. Oxygen gets used to kill stuff. I think oxygen is an underrecognized part of your arsenal of tools to protect yourself from infection and it&#x27;s useful against some things that are really nasty, like anaerobic infections, which tend to be ugly, from what I gather.<p>So I have only skimmed this study. The science is probably over my head and, as if often the case, I am only futzing around on HN because I&#x27;m too tired to work at the moment (see the aforementioned deadly genetic disorder). So I am not going to thoroughly read this piece. If I were that mentally focused, I would be working.<p>But I&#x27;ve skimmed it and I&#x27;ve skimmed the comments here and someone has pointed out this is not about red blood cells, it&#x27;s about immune cells.<p>And I will suggest it is plausible that immune cells in the blood would be revitalized by HBOT and &quot;made younger&quot; (that&#x27;s basically what telomere length gets used as a proxy for) because of what I know about how HBOT gets used to treat certain infections and what I <i>think</i> -- the word <i>think</i> indicates <i>personal opinion</i>, so &quot;don&#x27;t @ me&quot; as they say on twitter -- what I <i>think</i> about the importance of oxygen to immune function based on trying to understand &quot;So, what on earth does it mean that my immune system is impaired? And how does that work with CF?&quot;')
