If I were you I&#x27;d take the signal from your body as a message to stop doing what you&#x27;re doing, work normal hours, renegotiate your contract to work less for your employer and more for yourself.<p>If you&#x27;re still willing to do that and trying to diagnose: Could it be age &#x2F; family related?\nI used to work 12-16hrs a day when trying to start my startup. When I went contracting I had to check my hours not to work too much and I was very active on my side projects.<p>I all changed when I had kids. 5 years of bad sleeping and stress took their toll: I started having health problems and I barely have the energy to work.<p>The point being: maybe you need to fix some other parts of your life in order to have more energy?<p>Check your sleep, amount of physical activity, happiness.')
