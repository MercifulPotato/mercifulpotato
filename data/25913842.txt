So nobody (not even facebook) except for the recipient can read it.<p>Except, you know, if you or anyone you speak to or are in a group with has cloud backups to Google Drive or iCloud enabled, which anecdotally 90%+ people do. In which case at least two extra parties (Facebook and Google&#x2F;Apple) are free to play fast and loose with your data.<p>It&#x27;s a perfectly good post, but it feels unnecessary to shoehorn this line into it so you can have WhatsApp in the title and get more clicks.<p>As for BSNL, this is shameful and quite bizarre. I don&#x27;t understand what they&#x27;re getting out of the adware injection. If they wanted to track you, they could store whatever they wanted in localstorage or wherever without putting this front and centre.')
