After spending waaay more time on it than I really wanted to I got it working here on MS Windows.<p>Of course, since MS Windows doesn&#x27;t have emacs daemon processes one needs to keep the emacs window open in order for it to be used to open more files in the future.<p>In other words, I spent a ton of time to set up emacs so that when it&#x27;s already open new files will be opened in that already running instance.<p>On the one hand it was kinda fun to fiddle with and I was happy when it was done.  On the other hand I spent a ton of time getting something to work that most other editors do automatically out of the box.<p>In a way that kinda sums up my experience with emacs - fun to fiddle with, but takes a lot of time to set anything up.<p>That said, org mode is awesome, and like single-handedly keeps me using emacs :)')
