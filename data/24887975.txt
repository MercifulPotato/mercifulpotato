Github&#x27;s actions are pretty much required as far as I can tell.<p>Edit: I&#x27;d like to add that one thing Github <i>could</i> do is accept liability for copyright infringement and fight against frivolous claims like this in court. Maybe users should start demanding companies protect them from tactics like this, but the existing legal penalties are severely in the claimants favor.')
