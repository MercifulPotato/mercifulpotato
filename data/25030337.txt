Whereas here we&#x27;re talking about empowering users to filter out the stuff on their terms - i.e. subjective&#x2F;relative reputation.  It&#x27;s possible that a server admin might apply unilateral filters, but a) the user would be able to visualise those (assuming the server admin doesn&#x27;t maliciously withhold that info), b) the user can switch to another server with different filtering rules.  So, I definitely wouldn&#x27;t characterise it censorship (although I can see why many have a kneejerk reaction of &quot;ooh, this sounds a lot like censorship&quot;).')
