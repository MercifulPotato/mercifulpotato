I&#x27;m working on this analytics library [0] and this game server management app [1] at the moment.<p>I started the first one with my own website in mind and as it gained some popularity, decided to try to make a commercial product out of it. Instead of making everything open-source, I develop the platform closed-source and keep the core (this library) open-source, but set limits to what can be contributed and under what conditions. This isn&#x27;t clearly communicated in the repo yet, but it helps to stay sane.<p>For the game server project, which is older, I see a lot of feature requests and small contributions, because people actually depend on it. But boy, the support requests drive my crazy sometimes. Even if you only have a hand full of users, they can get demanding some days, when a new DLC for the game is released for example. I really want to support it and keep it up-to-date, but I sometimes have to ignore them. This week someone asked me if I could support them setting it up as they had trouble making it work for their drivers. Turns out they&#x27;re a professional e-sports team. As soon as I asked for compensation, they didn&#x27;t write back (after sending them 4-5 emails, taking half an hour to write). This is when it gets frustrating...<p>I don&#x27;t know how to fix the issue, but we, as open-source maintainers, should value our time.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pirsch-analytics&#x2F;pirsch" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pirsch-analytics&#x2F;pirsch</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;assetto-corsa-web&#x2F;accweb" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;assetto-corsa-web&#x2F;accweb</a>')
