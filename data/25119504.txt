I thought about returning to the USA as lockdowns were abruptly being declared nearly everywhere, but the USA handling of COVID seemed so poor that I decided to stay in Spain.  A few days after I committed to staying in Spain, it was announced that all of the hotels &amp; hostels were being shutdown.  It wasn&#x27;t clear if that order included Airbnbs, but it didn&#x27;t specifically include Airbnbs, so I booked Airbnb stays on La Palma for all of March, April, and May.  That decision ended up working out for me.')
