Not even close. Large would be orders of millions to billions. And yes, I have had to munge datasets that large on many occasions.<p>&gt; <i>But a quick translation to straight awk gives cleaner code, more power, easier conversion to a script, and access to a small library of awk-based utilities I&#x27;ve acumulated.</i><p>- cleaner: only if you find awk readable. Plenty of people don&#x27;t. Plenty of people find Go or Python more readable.<p>- more powerful: again depends. You wouldn&#x27;t have multithreading builtin like pipelines would. And Python and Go are undoubtedly more powerful than awk. I&#x27;m not knocking awk here, just being pragmatic.<p>- easer conversion to a script: at which point you might as well skip awk entirely and jump straight to Go or Python (or any other programming language)<p>- and access to a small library of awk-based utilities I&#x27;ve accumulated: that only benefits you. If you&#x27;re having to sell the benefits of awk to someone then odd are they don&#x27;t have that small library already to hand ;)<p>&gt; <i>We&#x27;ve spent far more time discussing this than coding, let alone running, it.</i><p>Some of the larger datasets I&#x27;ve had to process have definitely taken longer to munge than my reply here has taken to type :)<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve honestly not got a problem with awk, I used to use it heavily 20 years ago. But these days its value is diminishing and a lot of the awk evangelists seem to miss the point of why awk isn&#x27;t well represented in blog posts any more. It&#x27;s both more verbose than pipelining to coreutils and less powerful than a programming language -- it&#x27;s that weird middle ground that doesn&#x27;t provide much value to most people aside those who are already invested into the awk language. Some might see that as a loss but personally I see that as demonstrating the strength of all the other tools we have at our disposal these days.')
