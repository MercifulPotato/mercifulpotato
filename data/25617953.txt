Well-meaning comments here ridicule the idea of structuring personal goals, either in this way specifically, or entirely. They ask, why not just live your life?<p>That perspective may misunderstand those who are engaged in a multitude of activities that are all extremely worthwhile, which does include relaxation and self-care, but may also include nurturing a marriage and developing oneself, or developing a child.<p>There is finite time &amp; opportunity in the author&#x27;s day, and he is perhaps acutely aware he must choose his time expenditures wisely. It is good to step back, admit this, and install structure to support your true and prioritized goals.<p>Otherwise, we may easily find ourselves neglecting activities that are dearly important to us, like connecting with a spouse.<p>To those that say: &quot;just do less,&quot; I would say: there is a time where that suggestion will become natural law for each of us. Enjoy your abilities while you can.')
