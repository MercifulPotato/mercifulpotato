But I&#x27;ve tried newer ones over the years: Sublime, Atom, VSCode, etc. None of them seem to stick with me and I always go back to Vim. I think I&#x27;ve developed some sort of dependency to Vim shortcuts and on every new code editor I try I immediately install a Vim shortcuts plugin to make it feel more familiar. I still find the editors mentioned above to lack the &quot;ease&quot; of customization you can have with VIM. I put ease in quotes because learning vimscript is not simple, I highly recommend taking a look at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com&#x2F;</a> to learn how to do it. Thanks to that guide I was able to write my first simple plugin <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ElHacker&#x2F;vim-gitstatus" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ElHacker&#x2F;vim-gitstatus</a><p>I&#x27;m working on building VR applications with Unity and C#. For that task I have to say that VSCode works pretty well, it has a ton of really nice features I regularly use: like debugging unity code, autocomplete&#x2F;snippets from the unity API, and my favorite Zen Mode. My biggest complain with VSCode is how slow it runs sometimes, I can type faster than VSCode refreshes which adds noise to my flow, note that I don&#x27;t consider myself to be a fast typist. If they would only fix that I would be very happy with it.')
