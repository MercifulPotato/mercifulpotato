From a European exaggerated POV, everyone over there wants to either be a victim or fight against discrimination towards a group they are not part of, which always feels like people just seeking attention or making yourself feel good like a white savoir, without solving an actual problem.<p>At least you actually asked women about their opinion on this image. Fwiw, I just sent the image to my family group and only got two replies so far which were both just a confused &quot;huh why?&quot;. To be fair, both are not in CS or even engineering.<p>Again I think this is due to cultural differences. The image doesn&#x27;t contain nudity or suggest anything sexual to us over here. It&#x27;s a woman with an attractive face. A prime example for the difference in perception is how (gun) violence and nudity are perceived in Europe vs the US in movies or games, it&#x27;s pretty much reversed.')
