But notice that var is linted out of every modern JS codebase. Where’s PHP’s equivalent of let&#x2F;const?<p>Also, I think a huge part of JS’s staying power was that besides its obvious warts, it always had a solid FP foundation as well. JS was one of the first mainstream languages with full closures. That was a powerful tool for building abstractions right from the start, and I don’t think Node.js would have happened without this.')
