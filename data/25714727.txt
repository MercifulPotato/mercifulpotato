Item(by='_Understated_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610287687, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25714106, text='&gt; I really dislike this method of trying to catch them<p>Look at it from the teachers&#x27; point of view:<p>1. They know students are cheating by going to the bathroom and looking up answers (not all of them, but enough)<p>2. They can&#x27;t prevent them from going to the bathroom<p>I suppose they could insist that everyone wears trousers and tops that have no pockets and they all put their phones in their bags (and demonstrate that this has been done) but I could imagine this being a violation of some sort of rights...<p>The point is that there was a question in the exam that was hard. Impossibly hard by the sound of things. Some students threw their hands up and said &quot;I have no idea&quot; and skipped it. Some went to the bathroom, looked up the (wrong) answer, and cheated... it&#x27;s black and white for me I&#x27;m afraid.')
