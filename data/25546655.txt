We developed a command-line tool for CI that continuously distributes funding between project contributors and open source dependencies. After our first prototyping phase and evaluation, we have distributed around 3000â‚¬ between contributors of our own project and collected further requirements from multiple partners like the Debian project or GNU. By successfully applying the concept to our own development we have shown that a free and open alternative to GitHub Sponsors is possible.<p>As many of our partners need a Gitlab integration we are looking for a partnership to lift the prototype to an open, free and independent alternative to GitHub Sponsors that allows projects to switch to any git platform without losing the funding. We are willing to shift the major development repository to Gitlab as we think this will give the project more opportunities and flexibility in the long term.
