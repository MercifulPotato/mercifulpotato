I see people making a better soap dispenser, the hardware equivalent of what most SaaS startups are working on. You need to invent a new kind of soap that is better than anything else out there. It should take the grime off of everything from kitchen to bathroom scum. It replaces IPA, Acetone, LimeOff, EasyOff, Ivory bar, Dawn soap, and Gojo. You&#x27;ve got an explosive popularity just around the corner. Popularity isn&#x27;t luck. It germinates from knocking people&#x27;s socks off when they use your product.<p>I equate startup advice to those &quot;Teach you how to become a millionaire&quot; books you find at grocery stores. If these people really were good at making soap, they wouldn&#x27;t be around giving advice. That includes my own advice in this comment ;-).')
