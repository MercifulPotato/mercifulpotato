Item(by='lotsofpulp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608910992, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25536900, text='&gt; Perhaps you will end up with &quot;Law and Order&quot; cities, where technology is used unempathetically to punish harshly and discriminate without penalty. Then you would have less strict cities, where freedoms are less trampled in the pursuit of total control.<p>This is already true.  People are free to use marijuana&#x2F;brothels&#x2F;certain guns&#x2F;etc in some places and not in others.  Some cities have license plate readers on their police cars and roads and red light&#x2F;speed cameras.  Some prosecutors go after certain crimes and not others.<p>Although, Iâ€™m sure in every place there is little transparency so if you know the right people, you can get away with a lot more.')
