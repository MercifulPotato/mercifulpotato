I will not comment on the research (because I do not know the field) but rather comment on why character matters and why motivation is important.<p>Having read her email and tweets; it is quite clear that she is as much a political activist for a far-left “woke” interpretation of the world that I view as of immediate threat to our way of living, democracy and free speech.<p>Of course you can still author great papers but you would be naive to expect her to reach any conclusion that goes against her political goals.<p>In her email she makes this clear. She even posts demands if her paper is not published. In her email she professes to being “dehumanized” for her color and makes it clear that - irrespective of any factors - hiring only 14% women in a year is not acceptable.<p>She continues to say that they had been “enough talking”. We need action.<p>This type of urgency to take action (of course only the actions she herself approves of) and stop talking are clear indications of a person who no longer lives by liberal values but has embraced an ideology to which they now belong.<p>At that point, as an employer of researchers, I would consider her credibility to be severely damaged. If at that point I receive demands from this person “or else”. Then I would of course also accept her resignation.<p>I think the tech industry will need to continue to stand up to the anti-liberal values of these “woke” people before they cause too much harm.')
