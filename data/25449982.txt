But not passing is a far cry from &quot;almost guaranteed&quot; to be spurious.<p>&gt; Hence - the result is equivalent as if no test has actually been performed.<p>A result like that takes a big list of plausible correlations and distills it down.  If you think even a handful of the original list items are likely to have merit, then the distilled list is useful for suggesting where you should collect more data.<p>&gt; Or, a more simplistic example, imagine if someone observes an asteroid and says &quot;it might be aliens&quot;.<p>What fraction of asteroids to you expect to be aliens?<p>If it&#x27;s one in a billion, then cutting the list by a factor of 20 is useless.  If it&#x27;s one in a hundred, then cutting the list by a factor of 20 is very helpful.<p>&gt; I feel that the same is true for &quot;yeah, but the correlation might still be true&quot;.<p>It depends on the original list being sufficiently plausible.  You can&#x27;t distill tap water into vodka.')
