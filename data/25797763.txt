Too many people and companies are willing attack &quot;patent trolls&quot; but still defend the patent system in general and even software patents in particular. Apple, for example, received a large settlement for design patents from Samsung[1], apparently including, for example, a patent for the &quot;home screen app grid&quot;.<p>My guess is that the leadership in large companies like the fact that the company owns patents, since it&#x27;s some manifestation of the company&#x27;s innovative capabilities, without realizing the pernicious effect the patent system has on their ability to innovate. I seriously think the patent system could contribute greatly to the end of worldwide U.S. technological prowess, especially as it seems to me the trend is toward more restriction.<p>Ideally, all tech companies should commit to complete patent non-aggression. And employees should pressure legislators for radical patent reform.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;6&#x2F;27&#x2F;17510908&#x2F;apple-samsung-settle-patent-battle-over-copying-iphone" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;6&#x2F;27&#x2F;17510908&#x2F;apple-samsung-se...</a>')
