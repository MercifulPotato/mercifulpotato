But that’s not what Gödel proved, right?<p>My understanding is: All of mathematics can in principle be derived from ZFC. Gödel proved that there are mathematical statements (conjectures) that are true but cannot be proven (in ZFC). They are however, by definition, not theorems (in ZFC) and not part of mathematics in any reasonable sense.')
