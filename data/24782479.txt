I made my best friends playing football, gained confidence, learned countless life lessons...but I still wouldn&#x27;t let my future children play the game because of the risk of brain injury. A few weeks ago, I had a conversation with a former teammate where we wondered if there have been long-term effects on our brains. And we played at nowhere near the level of the athletes here.<p>I&#x27;m convinced we&#x27;re going to see football go the way of boxing. Boxing still exists, but it doesn&#x27;t have nearly the appeal that it did 40-50 years ago, when a quarter of the planet watched The Rumble in the Jungle. [0] Boxing (competitive boxing, not workout classes) isn&#x27;t a sport that upper-middle class kids get involved in. Youth football is headed in the same direction; participation rates are down as parents don&#x27;t let their kids play (and other sports increase in popularity).<p>Every activity we choose to engage in comes with some degree of risk. The ethical issue here is twofold:<p>1) Do we adequately understand the risks, and are the people playing the game (children) equipped to make the decision of whether or not to play?<p>2) As a society, what degree of risk are we willing to tolerate? How many suicides is too many?
