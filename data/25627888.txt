I can have that by the end of February. Putting the Software-Developer-Estimation-Error in play, I&#x27;ll have that count by Christmas next year.<p>Manually. Got it. \nLearn to sell -- &gt; How&#x2F;docs would be appreciated<p>Don&#x27;t Automate: Agreed, the human element is nice and makes me feel like I&#x27;m heard and understood.<p>I don&#x27;t have enough domain knowledge to know what ICP is in detail, but I know that I want to create things that help me and help those directly around me - VFX, developers, people who want to code but cannot yet, managers that want to streamline process, but cannot because current process and detail knots prevent them, Architects who want to make changes, but are ignored, and best practices not followed due to neglect of being heard and understood.<p>Ah, next sentence says I don&#x27;t need to worry about it until its big ... and previous sentence above says Walk before you can run...<p>Okay, well, thanks for your context&#x2F; advice.
