The preformative aspects come from competition with their peers.<p>It&#x27;s why white collar workers are so bent on doing public speaking things, TED Talks etc.. It&#x27;s hard to be a VP you have to somehow get everyone else to think you&#x27;re &#x27;that much better&#x27; than the workers.<p>Watch the news: almost every contributor is making a performance.<p>Trump&#x27;s the &#x27;Apprentice&#x27; is a giant bit of performance, nothing to do with reality.<p>The elite use leverage. Think of them as VCs. They don&#x27;t &#x27;work&#x27; like we do, they negotiate hard deals with workers and try to grab all the surpluses.<p>It&#x27;s really just a basic take on working&#x2F;middle class + capital class.')
