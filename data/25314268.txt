It wasn&#x27;t fair to center out book sellers as almost every product imported and sold in Canada is under the same scheme, the idea behind it is because it is a smaller market the suppliers need protections against price wars to remain profitable and ensure supply. You can consider it kind of a &quot;Supply management&quot; scheme, not as strong as the one covering Canadian dairy farmers but alobg the same lines. For books they managed to apply copyright legislation to it which is a bit different.<p>The good news is in the USA there are competition laws that make it illegal for a seller to NOT sell You or your friend those books within the USA and You CAN import them into Canada without fear of seizure if they are for personal use.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ic.gc.ca&#x2F;eic&#x2F;site&#x2F;020.nsf&#x2F;eng&#x2F;00621.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ic.gc.ca&#x2F;eic&#x2F;site&#x2F;020.nsf&#x2F;eng&#x2F;00621.html</a><p>&gt;&gt;&gt; It should be noted that these regulations do not apply to any of the following:<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; individual consumers, who are free to “import” books from a foreign bookseller, such as Amazon.com, at any time;')
