Over the prior few years big tech more than hinted about what they were going to do. This could all be seen coming a zillion miles away.<p>The long-term outcome of their extraordinarily dumb choice is obvious and it will have immense, horrible consequences politically (the Republicans will do a lot of damage going to war over this in response).<p>There&#x27;s a recent op-ed in the Washington Post saying that the Biden bought-and-paid-for scandal should be lied about and proclaimed to be a foreign intel operation regardless of whether it is or not. That side will do anything to get rid of Trump at this point. There is no length big tech won&#x27;t go to, to assist and play their part. They&#x27;re betting the downside risk is minimal and the upside is Biden wins and they&#x27;ll face zero consequences (the FBI will immediately cease any interest in anything the Bidens have done, absolutely nothing will come of it, all evidence will be washed away forever - instead of eg the FBI following the money trail back to Joe Biden for his cut of the proceeds).')
