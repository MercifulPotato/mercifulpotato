I was just trying to prove, using your own words, that on the internet it&#x27;s really easy for anything to turn into a binary choice.<p>You chose a less known word, a &quot;fancy&quot; word, and I pretended to be offended by it.<p>Just like Qt tried to add what they considered some funny lines to their examples, and several people here considered those lines &quot;cringy&quot;.<p>Unless everything you say or present is bland, you can&#x27;t really escape criticism.
