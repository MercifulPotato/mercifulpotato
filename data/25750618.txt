The right in particular has less reason to recognize these institutions as “truth authorities” as even when the right has a good point (e.g., when the right asks, “how do we know that racism and not crime rates belies police shooting disparities?”) , they can rely on these institutions to ignore or misrepresent them. So some of them decide to go shopping around for their own epistemological institutions which will support <i>them</i> in a similar (albeit cruder and more overt) way to how universities, media, etc back progressives and progressive viewpoints.<p>The way out of this, IMHO, is to reverse course—to restore integrity to the media and generally to show the right that there is a good faith process through which their <i>legitimate</i> ideas can succeed and be rewarded. Trying to force an ideological hegemony isn’t going very well, however cathartic it may be or however right we are about our points and policy issues.')
