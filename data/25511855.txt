It says <i>&quot;the term ‘digital transmission service’ means a service that has the primary purpose of publicly performing works by digital transmission;&quot;</i> which to my eyes does not clearly restrict it to platforms as opposed to, at, a YouTube channel.  Unless, as you say, there is a restriction somewhere unspecified on what can be meant by &quot;service&quot;.')
