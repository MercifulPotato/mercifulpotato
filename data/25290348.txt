Does that mean some lisp implementations listen on a tcp port?  How does one actually connect to or disconnect from a repl?  Is it just that when NASA launched their probe, someone went in on ssh and moved the process to the background with C-z?<p>How does one deploy a lisp application?  Can I compile my code into an executable with, say, sbcl which is what everyone seems to use?  Or am I forced to rsync all my source code to my server and get e.g. systemd to manually invoke an entry point?')
