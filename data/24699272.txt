It would be fantastic if she could find 3 pages of text from her next chapter, upload it to this tool, and get a URL that she can send to all of her students. Then they can all do a typing assignment in line with their reading, from just a link. (This could apply to many more courses, and cover many aspects of the curriculum!)<p>Would you be interested in adding that?')
