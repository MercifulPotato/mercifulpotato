Now I actually want to go a step farther, but I realize the president is a kind-hearted man and a good man. I’d actually like to go back to the old times of Tudor England, I’d put the heads on pikes, right, I’d put them at the two corners of the White House as a warning to federal bureaucrats.&quot;<p>You&#x27;re saying &quot;pikes on heads&quot; is a figure of speech, meaning firing and making an example of them. But he&#x27;s saying &quot;let&#x27;s go beyond just firing&quot;. So what does &quot;heads on pikes&quot; mean in the context of the quote? Seriously, I&#x27;m trying to understand.
