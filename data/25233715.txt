You can dual-license a project as (A)GPL &amp; commercial. Business-wise it&#x27;s like a freemium model. The GPL option is friendly to FLOSS projects while avoiding being free-as-in-free-labor. Companies happily pay for a commercial license, because that&#x27;s easier and safer for them than to think how GPL could work for them.')
