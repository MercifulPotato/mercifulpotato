My only problem with it is that so many of the modifiers depend on my pinkies, which are my weakest finger.<p>Luckily, the default layout maps control as &quot;hold Z key&quot; which means my pinky doesn&#x27;t need to travel as much, but it still leaves me with a sore pinky. I&#x27;m thinking of mapping a key like &quot;O&quot; that gets hit with a stronger finger like my ring, but inertia is great when changing a habit you&#x27;ve developed daily.<p>One thing I&#x27;ll say about the ergodox is that you really notice it&#x27;s value when you go back to your e.g. laptop&#x27;s keyboard. Whenever I use my T495, I immediately notice that, while my typing speed is higher, it&#x27;s putting a far greater strain on my hands and wrists (and back!)')
