I maintain an index at the beginning of the book where I add topics and the page numbers that I have information about it on. Still not ctrl-f speed of course, but I am not flipping through my notebook trying to find the right page. For your situation, I&#x27;ll probably right down the job reference on the page of the day, and then add a `Job References` entry in the index and add the current page number beside it. At the end of each year, I&#x27;ll digitize everything important for archival purposes (usually very little), and move over ongoing collections (like book list), to the next notebook.')
