Also most stdlibs and DBs, like GP said he uses, also fall into that.<p>Dependencies in general, like 95% (or more) of the kind we see in modern package managers? No, they&#x27;re mostly untested liabilities and the majority of them could be rewritten in an afternoon.<p>This whole discussion is a bit strange. GP clearly uses dependencies, just not as much as everyone else today. I don&#x27;t understand why the fixation with polarizing the discussion into &quot;use lots of dependencies&quot; vs &quot;write everything from scratch&quot;.')
