If you need a fancy UI, then there is no question being in the JavaScript ecosystem is important.<p>Blazor is great that provides language and framework unity.  You don&#x27;t have to hire, train, and retain separate developers in the UI framework&#x2F;JavaScript&#x2F;Typescript world.  The front-end worlds moves at such a rapid pace, not having to be in that world is valuable.<p>Backend inclined-C# developers have less interest in keeping up with the front-end JavaScript world.  Boring technology in a familiar language is great for them.<p>Somehow people started using React before there were react devs so I don&#x27;t understand the hiring issues.  If you need to hire 100 developers then sure the framework matters, but if you hire few people a year then getting talented C# developers who would like to learn the newest tech from Microsoft should be easy.<p>I actually don&#x27;t think Blazor is ready for a major project yet because the developer experience isn&#x27;t great yet.  The WebAssembly debugger is shoddy and the lack of hot reloading in both server and wa is demoralizing.')
