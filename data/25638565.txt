It is substantially easier to find a new position when you are currently employed, even if your stint has been brief. This is common knowledge, and as such self-reinforcing: if you quit, then apply somewhere else, the new place will assume you were forced out, since nobody on their own volition leaves a job before finding another one.\nSo there&#x27;s no way around it right now, so here&#x27;s my advice: unless you are about to have a breakdown, never quit until you find something else.')
