But if they are breaking the law, they are breaking the law (or we have to change the laws). And start with the few cases that are the most likely to be convicted. Those cases will then set precedent, be reported on in the press, and hopefully help society refind a path to legal discourse.<p>A bit like we do with almost all other crimes really. For exemple, when people started flaunting COVID restrictions, we did not hire thousands more officers to enforce the law. We prosecuted the most willful cases, and reported about them in the press.')
