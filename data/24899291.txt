Rather, you&#x27;re just treating it as a text document and using certain tags or code snippets as boundary points for finding the data that you want. It&#x27;s certainly way faster, though prone to its own issues that don&#x27;t come up as often with something like a DOM library or headless browser.<p>Many HTML documents will have the same data included multiple times, so a lot of the limitations can be avoided by targeting the places that appear the most consistently. Most of the reason why a web scraper would break would be because only one place was being targeted for data, and often very loosely. That place would get changed. Suddenly, you wind up with either a lot of wrong data or none at all.')
