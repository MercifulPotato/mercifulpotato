(1)<p>- Being able take extended breaks during the day and make up hours without using FMLA. (Flex time)<p>- Work from home when I need to.<p>- No on call. (Company has to respect my consistent sleep schedule.)<p>- No overtime. Maximum of 40 working hours per week.<p>- Ability to take extended leave for inpatient care.<p>My team knows I&#x27;m out occasionally for medical issues but they don&#x27;t have an issue with it.<p>I really do work for a wonderful company that takes care of their employees. Having someone&#x27;s kid interrupt a zoom meeting is common right now and no one except the parent gets annoyed by it. Even the CEO isn&#x27;t immune from his kids interrupting an all hands meeting. He just laughs and sets the tone for the rest of the company. :)<p>1: Basically, I can take time off in 1 hour increments for any medical reason, any time.')
