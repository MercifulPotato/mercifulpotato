PSD is not a good format. PSD is not even a bad format. Calling it such would be an insult to other bad formats, such as PCX or JPEG. No, PSD is an abysmal format.”<p>(Followed by the real rant)<p>I’m not sure it’s worse than PDF, though. PDF started life as a text-based postscript replacement that made it possible to index into postscript files, allowing one, for example, to render page 214 of a file without rendering the previous 213.<p>When files grew too large, they added compression. Initially, that was base-85 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ascii85" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ascii85</a>), keeping the file text-based, but other compressors were added so that, now, the file is binary. They kept the index and all metadata in uncompressed ascii, though.<p>Then, they layered zillions of different features (3D graphics, forms, JavaScript, font embedding, etc) on top of it.')
