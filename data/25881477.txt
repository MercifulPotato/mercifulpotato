A large part of moral culpability is proximity. How close are you to the issue at hand, and how easy is it for you to take&#x2F;not take some action. For example, worrying about poverty in a country on the other side of the world, when there are homeless people sleeping on a bench on your street. I can&#x27;t possibly convince a mega corp to stop wasting energy, but I can try and waste less myself. I can&#x27;t stop people from using Bitcoin, but I can try and develop&#x2F;advocate for better alternatives. When all is said and done, is it better to have shrugged and done nothing, or done what was within your power to do? &quot;All we have to decide, is what to do with the time that is given to us&quot;.')
