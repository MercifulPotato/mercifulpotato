Effective eradication is also an option. It will be significantly harder now that the virus has spread around the world, but if we can create low-covid areas - where the case count is low enough to support test-and-trace, we can place a cordon sanitaire around those areas, and slowly expand them as more areas lower their case count. If we can get to the point where, say, the entire Schengen area is low-covid, we can use that as a template for other similar parts of the world, like the US. It requires active work to maintain, but it will be worth it as there will be a return to normalcy within the cordon sanitaire, as well as a clear path out for regions still in the grips of the infection.')
