Item(by='deathanatos', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606239998, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25197155, text='As indicated by `enctype`, and the resulting Content-Type on the request, you&#x27;re POSTing plain text, not JSON. A server needs to verify the Content-Type of the incoming data to ensure it doesn&#x27;t fall victim to this sort of thing, or just misinterprets other data. In this case, the server is mis-interpreting plain text as if it were JSON.<p>(A good HTTP framework, IMO, should come with this built into its API, on requesting the payload as a JSON object. Some frameworks â€¦ try. A lot do leave it up to the user, which is hideously error prone. Also, this isn&#x27;t to defend that cross-origin POST is sort-of allowed. I wish we could remove that historical wart.)')
