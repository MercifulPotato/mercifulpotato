Bluetooth is supposed to be a standard, no?<p>While I like the ergonomics, I&#x27;m wondering how much of the lack of it in non-apple headphones products is the result of Apple not fully supporting them and thus, monopolistic practices.<p>Replacing the cable with (modified?) bluetooth technology allows distinguishing &quot;our hardware&quot; from &quot;their hardware&quot; and adjusting software to only support certain features.<p>So, why would not apple devices only support these features on Apple headphones?')
