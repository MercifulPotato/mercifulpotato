They are also all the control circuitry around those transistors.  When you write out, you aren&#x27;t just involving the 6 transistors to store, but rather a whole host of control transistors.<p>Next up, changes in current on a wire induce current on surrounding lines.  This induced current is results in what&#x27;s known as &quot;cross talk&quot;.  There are a bunch of methods to combat this, the primary one is to make sure there is enough space between lines to avoid it.  This means that while your transistor size may get smaller and smaller, you still have a limit on how close you can place those transistors, otherwise you risk unwanted bit flips.  DRAM has a major advantage here simply because it requires fewer lines to control state.  That results in a more dense packing of memory.<p>With those two points in mind, there&#x27;s simply no way for SRAM to ever have the same price&#x2F;GB or density as DRAM (without the market screwing with prices).')
