But the price is forecasted to continue to drop the way it has over the last 50 years.<p>Energy is a massive component of the price of much of what we consume, from food to travel to chemicals to material.<p>Solar &amp; wind energy have some troublesome characteristics, like their intermittency.   But where some see problems, entrepreneurs see opportunity.<p>I&#x27;m not sure exactly how cheap power will transform the economy other than the obvious (fossil fuel producers are in big trouble).   But I have no doubt it will.<p>Energy prices dropped massively and regularly between the industrial revolution and the oil price shock of the 70s.   They&#x27;ve been relatively constant since then.   It might not be an unreasonable prediction that the boom times between post-WW2 and the 70s might return.')
