I&#x27;m sure you just watched the Veritasium video [1] on this very subject. The point wasn&#x27;t to claim that space has a preferred direction (which would contradict known physics) but highlighting that there is no way to prove the speed of light is uniform, only that the round trip speed is &#x27;c&#x27;.<p>Second, even if the speed of light is unbounded (or has a much higher bound) in one direction, that doesn&#x27;t give a free ride for objects with mass to travel any faster than they currently do. It would take an incredible amount of energy to accelerate such rocks to near&#x2F;above the constant &#x27;c&#x27; and then you&#x27;d need to explain how it returns to normal asteroid speeds before crashing into Earth.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pTn6Ewhb27k" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pTn6Ewhb27k</a>')
