Timnit wrote that if we didnâ€™t meet these demands, she would leave Google and work on an end date. We accept and respect her decision to resign from Google.<p>I find it unlikely Dean would lie about that, not least because the email would be easy to find.<p>Now, were the actions leading up to that effectively a firing, ie Timnit would have been unable to effectively continue in her role?  Quite possibly.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.platformer.news&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.platformer.news&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-withering-email-that-got-a...</a>')
