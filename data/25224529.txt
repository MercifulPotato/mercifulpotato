How do you monetize random strangers coming to your town, taking photos of themselves in sometimes &quot;lascivious poses&quot; with your sign and sometimes stealing it? What&#x27;s the business angle there?<p>It&#x27;s a tiny village. Such places often have a real sense of community that you don&#x27;t have elsewhere. Injecting a lot of sexual nonsense into their little town because of the name likely feels rather rapey to them.<p>That&#x27;s sort of like the old fashioned advice that if a woman is going to be raped and can&#x27;t avoid it, she should try to enjoy the ride -- which is all kinds of deeply offensive and morally depraved.<p>These people find this behavior offense, offensive enough that they changed the name. They don&#x27;t seem to find the name offensive. They seem to only find the behavior of random people coming to their village offensive and they don&#x27;t know another way to stop it.')
