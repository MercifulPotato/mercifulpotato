The AT&amp;T router is essentially &quot;invisible&quot;, but it takes up so much physical space, power, costs me $10&#x2F;month, and is one more link in the fragile chain between me and the Internet.<p>Other comments here mention how to put the AT&amp;T router behind a Ubiquiti gateway and proxy the authentication to it via some scripts.  This reduces the reliance on the AT&amp;T router for direct traffic, but you still need the router operational for those authentication handshakes.')
