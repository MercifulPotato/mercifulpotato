It&#x27;d be great to have a CV service that could render the CV either with or with out them.<p>Also, maybe I&#x27;m the only one, but I&#x27;m starting to experience a bit of &#x27;mindfulness&#x27; fatigue.  Seems like it&#x27;s mindlessly being added to everything regardless of whether it makes any sense or not, so I dislike &#x27;Mindful professional profiles&#x27; as a subhead.')
