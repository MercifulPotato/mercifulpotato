In terms of turning gears, I find that a surprising amount of the time, the evil people (greedy bankers, landlords, unions, execs, VCs police) are caricatures held by outsiders who don&#x27;t see the full set of incentive structures driving their behavior.<p>Instead, from afar, they become cartoon bad-guys. When this happens, most people take the easy route and decide they are all &quot;evil&quot; rather than looking at the incentive structure of the system, and the behavior it encourages.<p>Next time you see one of these, see if you can instead see it as a bunch of people in roles mostly acting in their own self interest, and think on whether policy, institutional organization, or law could alter the incentives and change what is in their self-interest in a better way.')
