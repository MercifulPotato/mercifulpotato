Suffice to say that chili pepper fans are different to the populace in more ways than one. these kinds of broad studies seem to be a waste of time in my honest opinion. Studies seem to be attempting to crown one particular ingredient or lifestyle and apply that over the whole population thereby destroying the effects of certain diets on the individual. I&#x27;m positive that more imformation could be gained by trialling small dietary changes with a control group and measuring the mentioned health markers.<p>It goes without saying that its easy for me to criticise but I still appreciate all the studies')
