If you actually don&#x27;t like dancing, that&#x27;s okay, and you shouldn&#x27;t feel guilty about not forcing yourself to like it. And other people shouldn&#x27;t feel obligated to &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; you over it.<p>If somebody says they&#x27;re not interested in something, don&#x27;t try to force them into it. You&#x27;re not really doing them a favor. The dancing example is appropriate, because for some reason people who love dancing have a hard time understanding that others might legitimately just not enjoy doing it.')
