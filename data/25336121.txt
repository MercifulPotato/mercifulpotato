You&#x27;re confusing blockchain (the algorithm) with Proof-of-Work (a method for providing decentralized consensus).<p>&gt; Blockchain does nothing to verify the correctness of the data it holds, only its consistency with the history.<p>Correct. Nor does any other data structure. Blockchain is literally <i>just</i> a data structure, nothing more.')
