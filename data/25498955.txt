Typically just triage to the network team because they didn&#x27;t give students access to the network logs.<p>We had strict requirements on not exposing student data.  On the other hand we had to minimize the University&#x27;s risk.  This meant at least a nastygram to the offending student.  I think there was some kind of three strike system where students may get booted off the campus network.<p>The whole setup was pretty slick back then so if that happened they really wouldn&#x27;t be able to do anything.  Like they wouldn&#x27;t even be able to get a wired connection in the library.<p>Was a pretty neat place to work actually.  Still have fond memories.  Buy me a beer some time and ask me about working phones and email in ~2007 after news was published that Sarah Palin attended the Univeristy.')
