In particular, I don&#x27;t see how you maximize user control over the information they receive if information providers are going to be partial to one political party. And I don&#x27;t see how you have forums for a true diversity of political discourse if forums are going to be partial to one political party.<p>If you can tell me, I would love to know, how do Twitter&#x27;s actions in this case maximize user control over the information they receive? I don&#x27;t think they do, I think it is quite the opposite of that, but go ahead and make a case if you have one.<p>Now it is true that the implementation of section 230 lacks an enforcement mechanism to enforce the policies that it advocates. That&#x27;s a problem with the law, and it is what some people are advocating that we fix. I agree with those proposals, I would like to see section 230 amended so that companies that don&#x27;t maximize user control over the information they receive lost section 230 protections. And the same thing for companies that don&#x27;t allow a true diversity of political discourse.')
