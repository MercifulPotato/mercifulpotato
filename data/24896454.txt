Some code don&#x27;t even have to be rewritten and might work on python 3 without any modification. However, some applications requires major migration because their core functionality depends on some feature in python 2 that now changed python 3, and they won&#x27;t do major refactoring effort until the benefit of migrating to python 3 outweighs staying on python 2. They were essentially waiting until the ecosystem migrated to python 3, but as they&#x27;re also part of the ecosystem (and often the essential part in their niche), this created a chicken and egg problem that needs a decade to be resolved.<p>The situation with wayland migration seem to be somewhat similar with the python 3 migration. Many gui apps that uses gui toolkit probably don&#x27;t need major modification, or no modification at all. But some apps that requires platform-specific access are heavily affected and might require some major refactor, and they probably won&#x27;t do it until the benefit of migrating to wayland outweigh staying on xorg.<p>Also, unlike python 3 migration where most of the community agree that the move is justifiable will have to happen eventually, in the case of wayland migration, the community opinion seem to be split which certainly harm wayland migration progress.')
