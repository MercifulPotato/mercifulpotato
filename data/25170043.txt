Item(by='tristor', descendants=None, kids=[25172780], score=None, time=1605970634, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25169335, text='Agreed that good equipment is a worthwhile investment, but unfortunately most companies don&#x27;t see it that way.  I&#x27;m now in management and get issued a standard option 13&quot; Macbook Pro or Dell XPS13 as my system at both my current and prior company, both of which I&#x27;m permanently remote.  That honestly does the trick because other than how shitty Electron is for memory consumption, I don&#x27;t do the things as a manager that require extra equipment and I&#x27;m at home anyway so have my entire array of personal equipment as well.  Prior to that, I was an engineer, and it was a struggle to get a proper setup.<p>One company, several employers back, I brought my own equipment in and nobody said anything.  I had my own desktop PC, monitors, mouse, keyboard, and chair in the office and other than the unplugged PC asset tag assigned to me sitting in the corner, I returned everything else to the supply closet.  I eventually (after 3 years of using my own) was forced to use company issued equipment.  Here was the contrast, the box I brought in to use was a quad-core proc with hyperthreading and had 32GB of RAM, and four SSDs in RAID10 w&#x2F; a decentish GPU driving 4 24&quot; 1920x1200 IPS displays.  The box I was assigned (3 years later) was a dual-core proc w&#x2F; HT, 8GB of RAM, and a 500GB 5200rpm HDD, with onboard video that only supported two displays.  The two displays provided were 19&quot; TN panels.<p>I invest in quality equipment at home, but many, if not most, employers do not.  They may think they do, but they don&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s 2020, I consider 64GB of RAM in a engineer&#x27;s system a good target, 32GB a minimum.  Most developer systems I see are lucky to have 16GB of RAM these days (often the maximum offered in laptops issued).  Meanwhile, at home I have a max spec desktop PC less than 3 years old, multiple 4K displays, Herman Miller chair, an electric drive sit&#x2F;stand desk, split ergonomic mechanical keyboard, an ergonomic mouse, a mini-split AC&#x2F;heater in a separate room in a house with a door I can close, and in my closet a small rack of servers I can use w&#x2F; distcc to accelerate builds.<p>The great irony is that box I used at the office many years ago (8 or 9 years old), is still superior to what&#x27;s issued as normal engineer equipment at most companies in the US, and I&#x27;ve since moved on to better systems at home, again.  The poster you&#x27;re replying to is largely correct.  I love working from home partly because of no commute, but also because I can equip myself to my standards, which are much higher than the standards of a corporate IT department with accounting looking over their shoulder.')
