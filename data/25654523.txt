Item(by='madamelic', descendants=None, kids=[25654633, 25655046], score=None, time=1609905456, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25654421, text='$300MM isn&#x27;t even an absurdist number for a AAA game [0].<p>Cyberpunk 2077 single-player was $121MM and they have multiplayer planned so probably add another $50MM - $60MM on top, if not more.<p>I have no doubt that GTA 6 and Elder Scrolls 7 will both come near or break $300MM. $300MM is an absurd amount, but that&#x27;s just where the market is headed; big and expansive games.<p>I am not defending CIG necessarily but scoffing at a number out of context is disingenuous.<p>But yeah, the price tag is likely to be $500M - $750M but their goal isn&#x27;t to put out a rehash of a rehash for $80 then rinse-repeat next year.<p>CIG is pretty upfront they are trying something crazy and Chris Roberts (SC creator) is well-known for his scope creep + desire for perfection. It&#x27;s not like CR is demanding monthly subscriptions to play or that everyone spends $x &#x2F; year on SC.<p>If you want to buy an overpriced ship, go for it... but you can buy most, if not all, ships in-game for in-game currency that&#x27;s easy to get. It looks like the most expensive ship purchasable in the game is an &quot;890 Jump&quot; which costs 32M aUEC or $950. You can get 300k aUEC every two hours so like 212 hours of grinding (but seriously, this ship is purely a status symbol. Just like those crazy rare flying mounts in World of Warcraft.)<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_most_expensive_video_games_to_develop" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_most_expensive_video_g...</a>')
