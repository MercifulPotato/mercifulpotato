Please have the decency NOT to convert my educated and reasoned points into a straw-man argument. I spent years working in nuclear physics.  I&#x27;m not making some idiotic &quot;nuclear reactors will turn us into glowing mutants&quot; argument here.<p>The real issues with nuclear are -- and always have been -- simple, practical problems of cost, time to construct, and the usual problems of cost overruns and delays that you see with constructing a very complicated system.  The Flamanville EPR has been a fiasco, with costs triple its original estimate and a timeline that ballooned to 15 years.<p>In comparison, the competition from renewable energy has heated up rapidly.  Economies of scale are rapidly driving down the costs renewables and batteries (and the underlying technology is improving rapidly).  Between 2010 to 2019 wind energy become 70% cheaper and solar became 89% cheaper: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lazard.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;451082&#x2F;lcoe-8.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lazard.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;451082&#x2F;lcoe-8.png</a><p>Battery costs have dropped 75% over the last 6 years: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.greentechmedia.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;read&#x2F;report-levelized-cost-of-energy-for-lithium-ion-batteries-bnef" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.greentechmedia.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;read&#x2F;report-levelize...</a><p>Nuclear energy in 2020 is often quite expensive compared to renewable energy, and the comparison is only getting worse over time.<p>&gt; France has no plans on eliminating nuclear in the foreseeable future.<p>In 2020, Energy Minister Élisabeth Borne announced the government would not decide on the construction of any new reactors until Flamanville 3 starts operation after 2022.

They&#x27;re going to look and see how the energy market shakes out.')
