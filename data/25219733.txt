He says the fact that we tend to place the burden on the positive side is because it&#x27;s essentially impossible to prove the negative, for a lot of cases.<p>If every claim and it&#x27;s negative need to be proven, how do you think we proceed? Add in that you can formulate the negative without using standard polarity flippers like &quot;not&quot; and &quot;never&quot;. We have to start somewhere, and generally the guy who says &quot;God exists&quot; is the guy who has to make the case. The one who says &quot;There&#x27;s no god&quot; might need to explain what he means, but he doesn&#x27;t need to go get a bunch of evidence. I doubt that you disagree with that example.<p>The question of which is the positive claim arises because it&#x27;s possible with some fancy footwork to act like you&#x27;re not saying &quot;God Exists&quot;. This is what needed to be picked apart, or not, in the case of the economic argument at the top of the thread.<p>&gt; I might add: your selective quoting<p>I didn&#x27;t quote anything, I referenced the entirety. Part of the point of that is so we avoid picking out a headline and then claim to be finished.<p>But the fact remains, in school we don&#x27;t spend much time thinking about all those critical thinking skills. If we at least tried it, kids would be better at it. Much like physical training, it&#x27;s something that should be brought to our attention in school but needs to be maintained.')
