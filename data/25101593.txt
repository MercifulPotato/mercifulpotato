Because work was unfulfilling, I kept working after work on some web app projects using React, Nodejs, Django, GraphQL etc. (nothing is publishable at this point in time though). I find full stack development to be a lot more suitable to my style (I&#x27;m a generalist) and enjoyable.<p>Realistically, how can somebody like me be considered for a full stack position? If I have to have a portfolio, what would be a respectable project that would help me sell myself well?')
