By briefly observing it at my pre-Covid work-place, it seemed that (somehow) a book was chosen, people would buy and read it within about 30 days, and then sit around the lunch table and discuss their impressions or feelings or something.<p>I read about 5 fiction and 2 non-fiction books per week, so the reading is not the challenge for me. The challenge for me is that I feel that I will be judged if I have a non-consensus opinion about (for example) what everyone else thinks. On tech-stuff, I hold my own (Because I&#x27;m always right! Ha!), but with some of these more touchy-feely books, I&#x27;m not sure I won&#x27;t be excoriated (and I don&#x27;t enjoy that, and don&#x27;t feel like fighting battles I don&#x27;t care much about), I just don&#x27;t share. And I&#x27;m not the only one in the group that does exactly what I just said. We want to have a convivial group and grow, but, isn&#x27;t a Happy Hour slightly more inclusive (esp. with Hors d&#x27;oeuvres and Ginger-ale or whatever?)')
