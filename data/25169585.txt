The conspiracy theorists then or now?<p>More stupid example? You have religious people in eg. Iran saying that women should cover parts of their bodies, that men don&#x27;t have to cover. And you have instagram saying that women should cover parts of their bodies, that men don&#x27;t have to cover. On one side, if you advocate that women should cover up parts of their body, that men don&#x27;t have to, you&#x27;re a misogynistic hate group, and get banned, unless we&#x27;re talking about nipples, then it&#x27;s instagram itself doing the deleting and banning.')
