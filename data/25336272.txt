So even though the margins are high, the perceived quality, regardless of raw benchmarks, is still something. It&#x27;s not just marketing to me to say the marriage of software and hardware is unique. (Gruber&#x27;s observation about NSObject alloc&#x27;s being a lot faster on Apple Silicon, for instance).<p>Now that I think about it, honestly Google is the only other company playing by these rules... ie pixelbook, pixel phone, etc. But they&#x27;re much earlier in the evolution, and have less upstream control in software (especially since Fuchsia seems to be somewhat lower priority than before, though this is second hand knowledge).')
