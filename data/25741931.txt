You size your batteries for the rare times when you have long periods of no sun. By definition these rare occurrences shouldn&#x27;t greatly impact the life of a lead acid battery. Especially flooded lead acid cells.<p>Conversely if you discharge your Li-ion cells 100% on a daily basis then you have no capacity for longer periods of no sun.<p>The &quot;100% discharge&quot; myth comes from grid-tied installations that are working their batteries hard each day to claim the surplus power rebate.<p>Re (7): &quot;They will (correctly) limit the current to the batteries based on their current charge level, tapering off as the batteries near full&quot;.<p>The better regulators keep track of the state of charge (rather than just voltage), so are able to charge at the maximum safe current until the batteries are full. They don&#x27;t &quot;taper off&quot; towards the end of charge.<p>It is true that most Li-iron batts can safely absorb greater current than lead-acid, but that is not the fault of the charge controller.')
