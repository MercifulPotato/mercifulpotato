Confusing language, hidden unsubscribe buttons, requiring extraordinary actions (such as phone calls), unexpected price increases - you&#x27;ll see these popping up every day across social media (including HN).<p>And, in my opinion, a subscription is inherently a dark pattern no matter how good the intentions may be, since their very nature encourages people to forget about them and keep paying long past the point of usefulness. Throw in CC auto-update for subscriptions, and there&#x27;s no natural event that would ever cause the subscription to end (short of death, and even that&#x27;s questionable).<p>Desktop software is not the place for subscriptions. Such recurring revenue may be great for your business, but that literally comes at the expense of your customers.<p>As an addendum, pinky promises of continued access to <i>your own media</i> aren&#x27;t worth the bytes they&#x27;re stored in these days. Feel free to blame your corporate predecessors.')
