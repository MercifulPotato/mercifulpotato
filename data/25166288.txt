Literally zero resources used, aside from the decoder.<p>Heck, you can perform &quot;xor rax, rax&quot; as much as you&#x27;d like, because that&#x27;s also a rename. It doesn&#x27;t use any pipeline at all either.<p>Register renaming (aka: &quot;malloc&quot; a register) is the fastest operation on modern CPUs. That&#x27;s xor blah,blah, or mov foo, bar, etc. etc.<p>----------<p>Its only really an issue if you somehow need more width (&quot;Instruction-level parallelism&quot;) than what the architectural registers provide.<p>And even then... I&#x27;m not sure if it matters. There&#x27;s store-to-load forwarding. So any register you write to L1 cache (that is read back in later on) will be store-to-load forwarded, and the whole memory read will be bypassed anyway.<p>And even then, L1 cache is 4-clock ticks latency, and issued at the full speed of the chip&#x27;s load&#x2F;store units. Even if store-to-load forwarding failed for some reason, L1 cache is damn near the speed of a register.')
