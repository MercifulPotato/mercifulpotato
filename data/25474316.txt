And it was diy, because it saved money, we got to recycle paper lying around the house, like old calendars, and also the textbooks would last all through the school year. We had a roll of good quality binding tapes for the expensive ones. I still have some of the books in our old house which are nearly 30 years old now, and his grandchildren are going to have them. If this is not interesting and useful I don&#x27;t know what else is :)')
