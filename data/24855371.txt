They can be ignorant on how it&#x27;s all put together, that&#x27;s the CTOs job, but they really should understand the domain.<p>I think the thing that confuses people is that the true domain for some companies isn&#x27;t what the end consumer sees. I worked for a car website for a while, and very few of the executives were really car people. But they were all incredible experts on how <i>dealerships</i> worked, and that was actually what our business was, not how cars work.')
