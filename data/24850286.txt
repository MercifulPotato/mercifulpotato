Item(by='Rochus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603302665, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24850139, text='&gt; 4 times is a huge boost, and that&#x27;s on average.<p>It&#x27;s in geometric mean, not average (see <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ece.uprm.edu&#x2F;~nayda&#x2F;Courses&#x2F;Icom5047F06&#x2F;Papers&#x2F;paper4.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ece.uprm.edu&#x2F;~nayda&#x2F;Courses&#x2F;Icom5047F06&#x2F;Papers&#x2F;paper4...</a>). The same principle is applied to all testees. It&#x27;s normal that certain benchmarks run faster than others. That&#x27;s why we compare geometric means.<p>&gt; Also comparing a volunteer project to an interpreter that has the resources of google behind it is IMO pretty unfair.<p>Didn&#x27;t the project run for nearly twenty years with seveal rounds of EU funding? I think it&#x27;s rather the approach than the team size or corporate support. See e.g. LuaJIT which was implemented by a single person in a shorter time frame and achieves similar performance like Node.js.<p>&gt; Also saying the effort of PyPy is purely around speed is misleading<p>Didn&#x27;s say that. But unfortunately also the other RPython based implementations also don&#x27;t seem to be faster.')
