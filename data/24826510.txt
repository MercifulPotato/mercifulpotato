Even if you called, you cant reasonably expect everyone to wait for you with dinner for an hour. I would also expect the partner to let me know in advance, but if he is forgetful we would either eat or call.<p>&gt; People do that all the time - A person who has promised their partner they&#x27;ll get home by 6:30pm every evening for dinner has ceded control over their schedule. Nothing unusual about that.<p>I was literally reacting to parent who said this: &quot;you could accomplish the same thing by reliably leaving work at the same time every day - but some would say ceding authority over your own schedule is a greater indignity than ceding privacy over your current location.&quot;<p>In any case, promising something is not ceding authority by any reasonable definition. Parent claimed that having partners location all the time is necessary to avoid &quot;ceding authority over schedule&quot;. Theory was his, not mind<p>&gt; A partner who will have dinner ready when you get home from work doesn&#x27;t seem like a red flag to me.<p>When that requires constant location tracking, then it is red flag. If your schedule have you coming in within an hour long span, I find it odd to organize the dinner so that it is done exactly wherever you come it. I would expect the dinner be more regular, at the time when you are usually already at home.')
