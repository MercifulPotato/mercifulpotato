From poking around it seems like your execution on the pdf generation is high.<p>My (possibly useless) .02 -- I would not pay for this as is. What I would pay for though is an API that reliably converts internet articles to markdown of the same quality your pdf generation seems to have. A couple years ago I poured 3 or 4 months into a site that let users select time-boxed streams of articles clustered by topic (i.e. &quot;give me a 25 min list of content about Glacier National Park for my subway commute&quot;) By far the most challenging part of this project was formatting content in a readable way from various sources, which it seems like you have done VERY well here.<p>Anyway, congrats on shipping something, regardless of customer base that&#x27;s very impressive!')
