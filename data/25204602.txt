My company’s 60kLOC typescript codebase takes several minutes to compile and I don’t know how I’m supposed to diagnose what the problem might be; diagnostics flag exists but I don’t understand how I’m supposed to take action on it. Current plan is to break the project into a lot of smaller project references but yeah compile speed has probably taxed my company significantly in productivity and I don’t feel confident about addressing it.')
