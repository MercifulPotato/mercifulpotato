There were likely at least a couple of <i>orders of magnitude</i> more 3.5&quot; drives in use in their time than 5.25&quot; drives were in theirs.  I remember my last 5.25&quot; drive costing ~2x more than a 3.5&quot; drive in the mid-90&#x27;s.  Also, widespread 5.25&quot; drive usage ended 10-15 years before 3.5&quot; drives were superseded by flash.<p>3.5&quot; was also the last widely used removable magnetic disc and used by virtually everyone for a time for backups, in all kinds of industrial devices etc the way microSD cards are today.  Sure, there were Zip disks etc. but those were typically add-on devices and had a degree of compatibility issues vs 3.5&quot; drives which were standard equipment for well over a decade whether you wanted them or not.  So the majority of computer users from that era (as well as any still in service equipment) are most likely to still have, and possibly need replacements for, 3.5&quot; drives since they most likely switched over long ago and have been a rapidly dwindling replacement market vs 5.25&quot; which was pretty much dead by the early 90&#x27;s.')
