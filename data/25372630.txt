It&#x27;s profoundly unhelpful when terms are diluted and muddied. We should use the OSI&#x27;s definition not because they say so, and not for legalistic reasons like trademarks, but because it&#x27;s important to have meaningfully precise language.<p>It&#x27;s right that when a thread is submitted of a project falsely claiming to be open source, the HN community unfailingly tears it to shreds. We don&#x27;t want the term to be cheapened into becoming meaningless. I don&#x27;t see that the origins of the term are relevant.<p>Personally I tend to capitalise, I typically use <i>Free and Open Source software</i> to be more clear that I&#x27;m referring to <i>free software</i> as defined by the FSF, and <i>open source</i> as defined by the OSI. It&#x27;s unfortunate that I&#x27;ve found this to be necessary, to close the door on obtuse misuse of these terms.')
