Can you reliably make and receive calls?  Can you reliably send&#x2F;receive SMS and MMS?  Does it have error recovery if for some reason you don&#x27;t get a message?  Does the battery last for a reasonable day (&gt;= 16 hours)?  What networks are compatible, and do they work with MVNOs and not just the big boys?<p>I&#x27;ve used SailfishOS in the past and enjoyed it—and would&#x27;ve continued using it, but my phone died and I bought a KaiOS burner and never updated.  I&#x27;ve toyed with the idea of picking up a PinePhone because it&#x27;s more within my budget; but I want my phone to, you know, be a phone—not (just) a miniature computer that fits in my pocket.  I have a fairly high pain tolerance (Sailfish wasn&#x27;t exactly polished the way I wanted), but if I can&#x27;t make or receive calls or SMS&#x2F;MMS, that&#x27;s a serious problem whether I can run Blender on it or not.')
