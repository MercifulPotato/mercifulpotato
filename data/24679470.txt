It doesn&#x27;t cost much to support and probably sells a bunch of Macs. Windows on ARM is not really something people would want to use, not to the enormous extent people want to to use Windows on x86.<p>Speaking from what people expect from a &quot;Windows PC&quot; - Windows on a current MacBook makes a decent Windows PC. Windows on a future MacBook makes for a very poor Windows PC that will make customers regret their purchase.<p>Apple currently uses standard PC architecture, with identical CPUs, GPUs and Wifi chips to standard PCs, and a (sort of) standard EFI booting mechanism. With ARM Macs, it won&#x27;t. Clearly Apple in its hardware design is already not invested enough to support Windows - they could use standard EFI on ARM, for example. So why would they spend a lot of money to do it in software, so people can run a &quot;crippled&quot; version of a competitor&#x27;s OS?<p>Note I don&#x27;t actually believe Apple will actively lock this down. I do believe we will get native Linux on these things to some extent. But I do believe Apple will not lift a single finger to make alternative OSes happen on ARM Macs. Apple only cares about macOS and virtualization. I also think Windows on ARM is a great product, but I also know that common people that just want to use a Windows computer won&#x27;t agree with me.')
