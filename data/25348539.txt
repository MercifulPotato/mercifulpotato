All you&#x27;re doing is steamrollering over legitimate opinions with an ad hominem attack.<p>For example, while I don&#x27;t mind the GPL, I prefer to use more permissive licenses for my own code, because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s more in line with my personal ethics. I&#x27;m just not a &quot;strings attached&quot; kind of person. There is a courage criticism to make of how I do things, but it works in the opposite of the direction you&#x27;re trying to take things: I sometimes wish I had the guts to follow SQLite&#x27;s lead on software licensing.')
