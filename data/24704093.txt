Genres wax and wane in popularity, and so does the talent in that genre, as talent becomes attracted to other genres (you ask who the modern day Van Halen is: who is the modern day B.B. King? Or Frank Sinatra? Or Mozart? On some level, it&#x27;s a silly question, because those genres have become somewhat pass√©).<p>A few years ago, garage band rock n&#x27; roll was topping the charts: The Black Keys, The White Stripes, The Arctic Monkeys, etc. Now, not so much - or at all. But as much as my soul is warmed by a tasty guitar lick, I&#x27;m okay with that, because the seasons change and all we can do is watch as they do.')
