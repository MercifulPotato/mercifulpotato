Item(by='jkaplowitz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607057951, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25298407, text='&gt; Plaid is literally the only way to do ACH without microdeposit verification.<p>The only way to do that in what context? When I had a very tiny freelance IT consulting side business in 2011 (and maybe some of 2010), TD Bank was happy to sell me ACH origination access as part of my business account.<p>Yeah they charged me $10 per batch, so not great for a micro use case, but more tolerable when there are a bunch of higher-price-tag transactions per batch. They didn&#x27;t require me to do any verification of the other account - they couldn&#x27;t since the other account didn&#x27;t have to be mine. I just had to agree to follow NACHA rules and I could put in any account number and routing number I wanted. It&#x27;s amazing how much access a random individual is easily granted to pull and push money... (Obviously I didn&#x27;t abuse it, and the blowback following a complaint would have been severe if I had.)')
