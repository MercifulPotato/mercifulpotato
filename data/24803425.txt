Regardless if his malevolence is due to backwards ideology, deliberate foreign agenda, or just Dunning-Kruger ego, the Senate needs to express a newfound willingness to convict on a new impeachment. That&#x27;s the proximate cause of our ongoing dumpster fire, which at this point indicts all Republican politicians who have supported the corruption.<p>The longer term fix is of course to stop delegating so much authority to the federal executive in the first place. Ideally more powers would be vested to the states and therefore under control of state governors, but that&#x27;s a libertarian pipe dream.')
