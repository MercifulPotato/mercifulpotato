It&#x27;s just awesome experience. Kodi, TVHeadend, MumuDVB. If I were to buy a new TV again, I would definitely want an OLED one for the real black and high contrast, being able to light individual pixels. QLED has more effective backlight tech but it is still LED. Mini-LED is better but nothing beats OLED or plasma. If there were no dumb OLEDs then I would buy a smart one and just wouldn&#x27;t connect it to the internet. And if it wouldn&#x27;t work without the internet I would wait till some manufacturer realises there really are people who don&#x27;t want to connect the TV to the internet.')
