It claims I frequently fake positive responses to getting gifts. Being Dutch I fake it less than I probably would in USA culture, but I also just <i>very rarely get a gift I don&#x27;t want</i>. Is this the norm elsewhere? For me it&#x27;s just my grandma that doesn&#x27;t understand what my life is like and gives me a book about local cooking history or some similar crap. Everyone else will remember if I tell them what I actually like and is able to actually go beyond a 1km range for stores, so she&#x27;s the exception where I don&#x27;t say what I want and subsequently get crap that I pretend to be thankful for. Everyone else gives me things they think I&#x27;ll like and they&#x27;re almost always right. (And a simple thank you suffices, no need to claim you&#x27;ll treasure this regular blender forever...)<p>It goes on to claim that the giver cares about the aspects surprise, desirability, materiality, and social responsibility. All well and good: I can see myself fitting to those values the way I can see myself fitting to a horoscope.<p>But then the receiving side. The receiver is supposed to care about:<p>- Usefulness: correct.<p>- Versatility: what do I care about it being able to do multiple things if it&#x27;s already useful? This is a variant on the first if anything and really not a quality in itself.<p>- Quality: what do I care? It was free. If it breaks after a single week, I still got value from it. It&#x27;s not about how much money the person saved me (three years of not having to pay for my own blender versus one week) but that they knew or figured I wanted the product and took the effort of earning the money to buy it for me as well as the buying itself. What does &quot;is it going to last&quot; matter? At best that&#x27;s a duplicate of &quot;materiality&quot; but the author tried to claim the values or giver and receiver are completely misaligned so that can&#x27;t be what&#x27;s meant.<p>- Whether I asked for it: huh, a gift is much <i>better</i> if I <i>didn&#x27;t</i> ask for it! Then the giver really thought of something original that I love.<p>The only correct aspect was usefulness but it failed to mention any other aspects I care about in a gift, two that come to mind are: sustainability and surprise (I feel really fake when someone gives me something I asked them to buy for me; instead I have a construction where my girlfriend collects my wishes over the year(s) and passes those on upon request, then I honestly forget about it and am thrilled to get something I forgot I wanted but that indeed I will love).<p>&gt; Bonus: Nobody Actually Likes Charity Gifts<p>I&#x27;m sure a friend asked for a donation in their name because they didn&#x27;t want that. It enabled me to spend quite a bit more on their present as well because I don&#x27;t mind if some of my own money goes to the cause under another name.<p>Given all this, the conclusion is not as wrong as I was lead to expect, but it also doesn&#x27;t help me. It tells me to either not bother at all, or tells me to do what I already do (ask them what they want and consider usefulness). It offers no advice on one of the aforementioned (true) problems: wanting to give experiences to those that (probably) like such a gift without the giving moment being an anti-climax.<p>Which brings me to...<p>TL;DR of the article: ask people what they want, make the gift useful to them, or if you can&#x27;t come up with anything then just give cash to maximize value to the receiver.')
