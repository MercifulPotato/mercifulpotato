It doesn&#x27;t help that American manufacturers are at least 20 years behind the Japanese and Korean makers on developing these.<p>It generally doesn&#x27;t make sense for the manufacturers that have the tech to make open hardware systems for this market segment when you&#x27;re only talking about $1000&#x2F;ton for residential hardware. The lock in is more valuable than the initial sale is my guess.<p>I think one could likely home brew an open-hardware variable speed system by retrofitting a standard three phase compressor  and variable frequency drive (see Jeremy Fielding&#x27;s youtube channelâ€”linked below) to their residential unit but it is hard to find a small enough three phase compressor and wouldn&#x27;t probably be mass marketable because even single stage units are often good enough for most residential applications.<p>Future building code adoption will probably have an influence on this particularly in the areas where ventilation requirements are tightened.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UC_SLthyNX_ivd-dmsFgmJVg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UC_SLthyNX_ivd-dmsFgmJVg</a>')
