And, for example, you&#x27;ve got multiple boroughs in NYC with hundreds of deaths each that have exceeded a population fatality rate of 0.5%.”</i><p>No, it doesn’t. You’re cherry-picking old data, and ignoring the links I gave you, which <i>tell</i> you the updated numbers:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;hcp&#x2F;planning-scenarios.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;hcp&#x2F;planning-scena...</a><p>ages 0-19: <i>.003%</i><p>ages 20-49: <i>.02%</i><p>ages 50-69: <i>.5%</i><p>ages 70+: <i>5.4%</i><p>The old reported numbers in New York are not a counterargument: we now know that number of cases was <i>drastically under-counted</i>, and the inferred IFR, if you use the right denominator, was a fraction of a percent.<p>You clearly <i>know</i> this, because you’re trying to talk about the rates in “boroughs” which are higher. But sample heterogeneity matters: I’m sure if you compute the IFR in Maimonedes ICU, it’s really high, too. The fact is, the fatality rate estimated by the Santa Clara study <i>has been shown to be correct</i>, and you’re simply spreading misinformation, because these new facts aren’t as scary.<p>These things are <i>facts</i>. Downvoting and brigading don’t change them.')
