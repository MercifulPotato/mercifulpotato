It&#x27;s not used in that context anymore. It&#x27;s the same pitfall as the master&#x2F;slave&#x2F;blacklist&#x2F;whitelist&#x2F;etc. arguments: people have a problem divorcing historical meaning from present-day usage. Meanings change and evolve over time. If we follow this stunted logic, then there&#x27;s going to be <i>a lot</i> of other English words&#x2F;phrases that need to be banned as well. The only people associating them with their historical meanings are those wanting to ban the phrases. These etymological fallacies do nothing but pointlessly divide people. It needs to stop.')
