Item(by='shawnz', descendants=None, kids=[25028988], score=None, time=1604855762, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25027009, text='Right, and so on platforms where sideloading is allowed doesn&#x27;t it make sense to restrict the ways in which apps might be able to see the screen contents of other apps, for the benefit of the user?<p>It&#x27;s the same justification in both cases: ensuring the user&#x27;s data stays private. I would prefer no screenshots over no sideloading if those are the only options.')
