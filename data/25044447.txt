Item(by='jnxx', descendants=None, kids=[25059148], score=None, time=1605004398, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25044383, text='Another advantage of Emacs compared to IDE is\nthat it is resource-friendly, on multiple levels.<p>Foremost, it is friendly to the resource which\nhas become the most precious one, which is\nattention. It has a sparse interface which shows\nexactl;y what is needed. Compare that to a newly\nlaunched Edge browser which will show you totally\ninappropiate and distracting yellow press content\nwhen you start it.<p>It is also resource-friendly to screen real estate,\nmaking a good use of the text space. Granted, large\nscreens did become more affordable in the last ten\nyears, but while attention is still a scarce resource,\nprograms also did become much more complex, and, alas,\nyour eyes are not going to increase in resolution,\nthey will become worse in the course of your\nwork life, which makes the screen space even more\nvaluable.<p>Emacs is also economical in terms of learning\neffort - the basic editing is simple, and\nyou can focus attention to the things that\nyou use most.<p>Compared to that, IDEs are cumbersome. They are\ncumbersome in terms of modification, requiring endless\ndeep menus which are nowhere documented, and not\ngoogle-able, they have built-in build systems which\nwill support only a few languages, they have complex\nnon-textual interfaces, which are just a hassle, they\nforce you to use the mouse, which in Emacs is entirely\noptional.  I also think they support, in part, bad\npractices in coding. If you really need an AI and\nautocompletion to produce working code, I am not sure\nyour code is that good for humans to read - and this\nis the most important aspect of code. It not only needs to\nbe writable, it needs to be well readable.')
