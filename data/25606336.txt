Books and movies are not software and can&#x27;t affect your device in any way.<p>Therefore, there is a very obvious justification for disallowing some apps; that doesn&#x27;t apply for books or movies.<p>It&#x27;s also not &quot;hypocritical&quot; for Apple to choose to have a curated App Store (which is feasible and realistic) but choose not to actively censor books (which isn&#x27;t really feasible).')
