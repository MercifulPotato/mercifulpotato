Item(by='otterley', descendants=None, kids=[25389522], score=None, time=1607713260, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25388973, text='&gt;  What is unfair to assume without evidence is that Apple has some sort of super secret tech no one else knows about to repair them. That is simply a claim without evidence.<p>Apple knows how to do all sorts of things in the manufacturing process that even competing companies having resources similar to Apple&#x27;s scale (Samsung, LG, et al.) can&#x27;t seem to accomplish. iFixit certainly doesn&#x27;t have resources anywhere near Apple&#x27;s. So I wouldn&#x27;t put recycling&#x2F;repair tech past them. It&#x27;s certainly plausible.<p>The rest of your math is largely fictional because you can&#x27;t buy a pair of new AirPods without the charging case. There&#x27;s a market for them (most likely in the black market because they&#x27;re almost certainly stolen), but they&#x27;re certainly going to be less than the cost of the combination less the price of a new charger.')
