The first is what you mentioned - that they _do_ have the option of sideloading an app like Fortnite. The problem being that they lose out on a massive market because they don&#x27;t want to use Google&#x27;s IAPs. This is made worse by the fact that Android gives &quot;scary&quot; warnings when trying to install an app from an untrusted source - which is arguably a good thing for safety&#x2F;security, but at the same time questionable when Google also benefits from it.<p>The other issue is that Google actively makes it harder for an alternative storefront to operate on Android by forcing OEMs to only include the Play Store (though I think OEM&#x27;s own stores might also be acceptable? not sure) if they want Google Play Services (which most apps require). Which means Epic can&#x27;t go out and make a deal with an OEM to add the Epic Store (or possibly even just a single app like Fortnite that doesn&#x27;t use Google&#x27;s IAPs, not sure) to an Android device because said OEM would have to drop Google Play Services.<p>And they can&#x27;t just tell you to download the store - there are limitations that you cannot bypass without being a system app (i.e. something preinstalled). The most notable one for a store being that it can&#x27;t auto-update other applications.')
