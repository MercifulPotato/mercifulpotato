I wouldn&#x27;t say arbitration is the equivalent of my idea which is access to external legal help by default with a fair assessment.<p>There are definitely metrics by which these parties could be ranked but sure there would be issues with gaming these metrics. For example if there as a legal requirement to accurately report across many companies how many times during an internal issue the person not in the superior position was fired vs the superior despite reporting something like sexual assault or racism or something like this, and the company says 100% of the time we agreed the superior did nothing wrong and 75% of the time the complainant magically failed their performance review and is no longer with the company within 6months of this.<p>Well that is a pretty bad metric.<p>There are definitely ways to report metrics anonymously and the results and legally can inquire if they reported the outcome accurately.<p>Carts is stating to do this with money. They are reporting how much money women and minorities have in equity vs white males, and eventually will break it down by position which means yeh if most women work in HR and I&#x27;m a senior engineer yeh probs women will have less equity, but next yr they will expand and show things like all staff level software developers, this is the breakdown of men vs women equity in tech companies....<p>That&#x27;s a number I would love to see. And it would say alot.<p>So there are ways to make this better even if it&#x27;s not an easy fix. Requiring companies to provide healthcare and 401k plans did not happen overnight Im sure, but noone would take a company seriously without these benefits for long.')
