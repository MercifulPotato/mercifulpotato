In the domain of logic, &#x27;sound&#x27; has a very definite meaning, so what are we to make of your use of the word &#x27;sound&#x27; in a discussion of logic, <i>especially given that you explicitly qualify it with &#x27;logical&#x27;?</i> What is the point of phrasing a statement in such a way that it will mislead everyone except those who can see what you actually meant? Those people already know what you are trying to say.<p>I have not &quot;taken [your] phrase <i>logically sound</i> and then switched to <i>sound arguments</i>&quot;. What I did, in the clause &quot;sound arguments have true conclusions&quot;, was to make a statement of fact about the meaning of the word &#x27;sound&#x27; in the domain of logic. On account of that being so, it would have been unequivocally wrong for you to have written &quot;An argument can be sound but with a false conclusion.&quot;<p>Ah, but you say (this is where it gets really pedantic) you did not write precisely that; you wrote &quot;An argument can be <i>logically</i> sound but with a false conclusion&quot; - but how do you think the modifier <i>logically</i> will be taken here, given that &#x27;sound&#x27; has a specific meaning <i>in the domain of logic?</i> Don&#x27;t tell us that (obviously!) &#x27;<i>logically</i> sound&#x27; actually means &#x27;valid&#x27;!')
