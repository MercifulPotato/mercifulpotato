I can give you a few important things to keep in mind (just had a baby..well 5 months now)\n- Prepare for delivery at a hospital that you are comfortable with. Go take a maternity tour by arranging one in advance. This way, you know where to go exactly when the day comes without any confusions. The guided tours are usually pretty good and they show you the Labor Delivery and Post Partem rooms. Since you are a couple of months away, I hope you have already done this. If not, do it asap<p>- Buy an infant car seat or borrow one from your family&#x2F;friends if you can. We use Graco brand for our baby and highly recommend it. For infants, you need a rear facing car seat. This link can give you ideas. [1]<p>- Make sure you get the car seat in advance and learn how to install it in your car. Depending on car models, it could be different. In more recent years, cars usually have a child seat hook&#x2F;harness that you can attach the seat to. Look for it and make sure you practice. Note: Some hospitals are very strict on how the newborn is taken out in a carseat and will supervise you as well.<p>- Depending on the season, ensure you have proper clothes ready for the baby. Cold or warm, prepare accordingly. Our baby was born in March and it was very cold (eastcost). So we prepared accordingly with baby blankets etc on top of the clothes. Shop around for newborn clothes [2]<p>- Strollers, we use Graco again and works really good for us. [3]<p>- Get a pediatrician for the baby. Usually, the hospital will ask you if you already have one. If not, then they will assign you one during the delivery but if possible, get one beforehand so that you baby can be seen by the same during delivery and afterwards.<p>- Diapers and wipes. These will be big items for you to buy all the time. We use Pampers swaddlers diapers. It has wetness indicator (yellow turns blue if diaper is wet). You will probably start witha size 1 for newborn and slowly move to bigger sizes. For wipes, we use Pampers sensitive wipes.<p>- Breast milk and pumping: If the mother decides to pump which we found out to be easier for us, get a breast pump. Sometimes, your insurance can pay for it. I think Obamacare has the provision. So you might get it for free or very cheap.<p>- Formula: Depending on your individual case, you will use formula in addition to breast milk if any. For formula, we use Similac Advance Early shield. It comes as powder or liquid. Powder is cheaper but you need to do additional work to mix it with warm water. I suggest keep both because for travelling, the liquid one is handy while at home, you can use the cheaper powder option<p>- Bottles. Go to a local babiesrus and take a look. We use these [6]. Nipple type and size matters as well. Talk to some friends&#x2F;family to get an idea.<p>- Buy a crib. Don&#x27;t go for something too fancy in my opinion. Just get one that works for your baby. You will see 4-in-1 convertibles etc. Explore and see what works for your baby<p>- Buy a swing. We found it easier to put our newborn to sleep if she was cranky. Sometimes, they dont like to lie in a crib but the swings helps (with light white noise&#x2F;music). It was very useful to us for first 3 months. our baby outgrew it afterwards though:)<p>- Use <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.babycenter.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.babycenter.com</a> and even add your email for updates. They have the best tips, articles and even track your progress throughout including post delivery.<p>- Be kinder to your wife especially as she goes through new emotions herself and can sometimes become what the docs called Post Partem Depression.<p>- Take lot of videos and pictures of your baby for the first 1-3 years as they will grow very fast during that time and you will never get those moments back.<p>- Many more I am sure. But these will give you some insights. All the best to you and your family.')
