For example in Germany, you can&#x27;t be a Nazi or show Nazi symbols.  Why?  Because Nazis murdered millions of people in death camps, not because &quot;Blasphemy&quot;.<p>Hate speech, death threats: these are illegal in civilized countries because these things have been tremendously destructive to society in the past.<p>America&#x27;s First Amendment prioritizes paid lies casually invented and spread by anonymous billionaires over hard-won truths spoken by individuals. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be working out so well.')
