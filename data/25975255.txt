Item(by='dvt', descendants=None, kids=[25975635], score=None, time=1612060935, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25975163, text='&gt; Iâ€™d love to be wrong about this though.<p>You&#x27;re right, and there&#x27;s good reason for it. Negative rights are generally non-interventionist, which tends to be more in line with classical liberalism. However, the fact that the stadium had to shut down, indicates that the protestors were actually infringing on the rights of those that wanted to get vaccinated.<p>So calling this &quot;protesting&quot; is a bit of a misnomer. They were <i>not</i> protesting, just how the folks that breached the Capitol on Jan 6th weren&#x27;t protesting. This can be complicated, because the Boston Tea Party (for example) is often called a protest in history books, but it was pretty clearly an act of vandalism. Not that the two are mutually exclusive (after all, we can certainly have <i>violent</i> protests), but we mostly think of protests in terms of what the Constitution defines as the &quot;freedom of assembly.&quot;')
