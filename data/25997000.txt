If you&#x27;re just talking about avoiding bankruptcy, well you could just buy a car and not replace it the first time if it&#x27;s stolen&#x2F;destroyed.<p>Presumably in this scenario you actually require a car.  That said, insuring it will cover you for any number of losses in the year, whereas setting aside an amount of savings equal to the value of the car will cover you for only one loss.<p>You can&#x27;t just be chasing the positive EV when the variance is potentially large.  For example, if Warren Buffet offered to flip a coin with you for your net worth, plus $100 bonus if you win, the expected value is very slightly positive but I believe you&#x27;d be unwise to take bet that unless your current net worth was very low already.')
