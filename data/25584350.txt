You lose 20% of your <i>pre-tax</i> salary, but you lose much less on your <i>post-tax</i> salary. In europe the marginal tax can easily be close to (or even over) 50% so in practice you work 20% less hours and lose 10% of your post tax salary. The thing that amazes me is why people do not push for this more.')
