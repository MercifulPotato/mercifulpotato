I mean who the fuck spends 7000 at a colo for 40.0000 users. my macbook could probably serve that. also &quot;and then script those older Virtual Machines with some mix of Ansible and Terraform (assuming you want to be in the cloud). &quot; is a fucking terrible advice, been there, done that and it soon is a clusterfuck of stuff cobbeled together.')
