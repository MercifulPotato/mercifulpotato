Item(by='fauigerzigerk', descendants=None, kids=[25202433], score=None, time=1606219169, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25196746, text='All my main devices are Apple, but I also have a cheap Android phone, which I bought because I needed to use an app to read my passport chip at a time when Apple hadn&#x27;t yet opened NFC to third party apps.<p>Android came with some positive usability surprises as well. For instance, the back button does something far more consistent than iOS&#x27;s completely disjointed ways of going back. Also, iOS&#x27;s separation of settings from the rest of the app never made any sense to me. That&#x27;s fixed in Android.<p>But I don&#x27;t think usability is what really matters. A far more important issue is ecosystem tie-in. A lot of great functionality the Apple ecosystem offers is exclusionary. Many Apple services are either unavailable or crippled on other platforms. If your friends, family and coworkers are not all Apple users you lose a lot of the benefits.<p>I can&#x27;t even share iCloud photos with my wife or use FaceTime and Messages (beyond basic SMS). Her mp3 player supports Spotify but not Apple Music. She could easily afford any phone she likes, but she uses a 7 year old Nexus 5 because she just doesn&#x27;t care. The only thing she might care about once the pandemic is over is battery life. But iPhones are nothing special at all in terms of battery life. And on the desktop she uses Linux because contrary to my Mac it supports running PyTorch and TensorFlow on the Nvidia GPU.<p>So we always look for cross platform options and some of the more popular ones are better integrated in Android than in iOS (such as Google, obviously, but also to a lesser degree Microsoft). I&#x27;m not subscribing to any Apple services for fear of not being able to share them with others.')
