You don&#x27;t need to be so defensive by identifying so closely with your gender here.<p>This article is specifically how these women got swindled out of the prestige they should have got and how gender stereotypes pushed women out of the workforce after the war. All the men we&#x27;re mad at here are effectively retired or dead so there&#x27;s no need to identify with them because its unlikely you&#x27;d actually relate directly to their world view because they&#x27;re mostly pre-boomers.')
