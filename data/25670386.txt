The scheme I saw in Applied Cryptography would in abstract permit vote selling, but not simple vote selling -- you&#x27;d need pretty complex security between the buyer and seller.<p>If you&#x27;re trying to buy my vote, and I&#x27;m trying to sell it, I could give you my unique anonymous number, and you could verify my votes. But I could also vote a different way, lie, and give you someone else&#x27;s unique number, and you&#x27;d have no way to know.<p>You could ask for a special ballot too, where, for example, I vote a particular pattern (yes&#x2F;no&#x2F;no&#x2F;yes&#x2F;yes&#x2F;no), to encode things, ideally picking ones that aren&#x27;t likely to come up in practice, or other complex schemes, but these generally have work-arounds.<p>At the end of the day, though, it&#x27;d be cheaper and easier for you to require me to wear a pinhole camera to vote, do a mail-in, or otherwise. Plus, we had open voting for much of history, and it worked okay. If we went back to the risk of illegal vote selling versus the risk of wholesale election fraud, I&#x27;d take the former which seems like the lesser of two evils (and much easier to police too).')
