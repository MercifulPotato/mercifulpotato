It only tracks particles in the air, and not gases. I&#x27;ve been trying to secure an air quality sensor that does PM2.5&#x2F;PM10 + gases, but they&#x27;re all very scientific, and come with a very high price tag.<p>The boat&#x2F;ship tracking is provided by Fleet Mon, I host one of their AIS trackers. Air traffic is provided by Aviation Edge.<p>There are other monitors in the region, but not in my community: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aqicn.org&#x2F;city&#x2F;usa&#x2F;indiana&#x2F;gary-iitri" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aqicn.org&#x2F;city&#x2F;usa&#x2F;indiana&#x2F;gary-iitri</a>, but I have no information about them, their data, or anything. If it was open source, I probably would trust it more than I do now.<p>Thank you, I&#x27;m still coming to terms with it, but life goes on I guess, just gotta take the lows with the highs.<p>edit, just realised I never answered your question, the source code is on github: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kingsloi&#x2F;community-airmonitor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kingsloi&#x2F;community-airmonitor</a>')
