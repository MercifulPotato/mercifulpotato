I&#x27;m unable to remove Chinese sellers from search results on Amazon (I&#x27;m using German Amazon). I have to pay a large amount in import tax when buying outside EU.<p>2. I&#x27;m unable to remove sellers which don&#x27;t want to ship to my country of residence (DK). I don&#x27;t see any value in looking at items which I&#x27;m unable to buy or finding out after I try to buy something that this is not possible.<p>Why is #1&#x2F;#2 not implemented? Does this make sense to anyone?')
