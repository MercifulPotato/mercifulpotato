But when those civilians are the machine that drives the war, they become part of that war. That is why in a total war between nations you send hundreds of planes to carpet bomb relevant cities (incl. their population) to cripple enemy nation&#x27;s ability to keep waging the war against you. They are not sent to bomb ski resorts or villages where nothing happens.<p>Do you consider someone that puts together IEDs for someone else to deploy an untouchable person that your need to leave alone? This person is unarmed, he&#x27;s not a combatant, he&#x27;s no threat to you, he just googled how to put a bunch of stuff together.<p>I know for myself, that if i find myself in the middle of a war i don&#x27;t believe in, i&#x27;d pick my shit up and leave immediately, go anywhere else. I wouldn&#x27;t just stay where i am, coding my web apps next to a goddamn bomb factory or HQ of some kind in complete denial of my surroundings, the current situation, and reality itself, while bombs are being air mailed to said factory&#x2F;HQ next to me. But if chose to stay either because i want to be part of that war or am simply clueless, i can&#x27;t blame anyone but me for the situation i find myself in.')
