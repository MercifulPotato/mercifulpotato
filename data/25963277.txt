But the gameplay has some <i>very</i> complex mechanics. Mechanics where lesser programmers would have ended up with a far buggers and less fun version. Imo it&#x27;s easy to imagine weird bugs that manifest as flakiness slipping into the code that back railroad signals and repeaters, and intersecting tracks.')
