Some of the fasted implementations I have ever done were after spending a bit of time modelling the problem solution. Basic data flows, classes (using verb&#x2F;noun parsing of the requirements doc) and system architecture were all decided before I wrote any code.<p>The implementation itself just flowed, allowing me to focus on smaller details that can&#x27;t be modelled (e.g. error handling). By copying the design of classes and function names, I didn&#x27;t have to backtrack and redo anything, I didn&#x27;t have to think about names of things - which were pre decided and so consistent throughout the codebase and my code dovetailed nicely with parts that other people implemented.')
