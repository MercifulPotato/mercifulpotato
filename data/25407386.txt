Most of the common hurdles (akkusativ&#x2F;dativ, long words, and also number order) are dealt with in the first months of german learning (A1 level) and are not really an issue in real life. I still might misgender objects from time to time, but it can also happen in the other three romance languages I speak. It&#x27;s also fun when it happens and the jokes are a good mnemonic device (&quot;the sun is not a boy, how dare you&quot;).<p>Also I agree with foepys that you can do more in German with a smaller vocabulary. Schlag is also used in sports and music :) Plus, people like to downplay it, but most people here do speak english, so if you have difficulty, it&#x27;s ok to ask in english when you&#x27;re 1:1.')
