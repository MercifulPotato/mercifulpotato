That is not the case. They are just behind the pill in popularity.”<p>Your first sentence makes no sense. You say that I’m implying that pills are more popular yet you confirm that indeed they are.<p>Unless, you’re saying that I was implying that they’re _heavily_ more popular, which is also not what I implied.<p>You’re completely missing the point. I’m gay and on prep myself for several years.<p>The grandfather post mentioned that 2 million people are doing an injection as if that implies that many people prefer that over pills.<p>I could write more and explain more but I’m tired of talking to so many morons for today.')
