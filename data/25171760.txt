My problem is that the U.S. already is bullying too much and nobody pushes back against them, if it takes China to do it, so be it.

You have the U.S. arguing in the open[1] that it is free to kill its own citizens without due process.<p>I&#x27;d like someone to push against that, may as well be China if the EU is not up to the task, as it has repeatedly shown.<p>1 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20201117&#x2F;12384545723&#x2F;government-argues-court-that-it-can-kill-us-citizens-will-with-zero-judicial-oversight.shtml" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20201117&#x2F;12384545723&#x2F;gover...</a>')
