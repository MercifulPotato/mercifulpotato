This observation is also made in the Advanced Virgo GW detector. It is remarkable that quantum vacuum fluctuations can influence the motion of these macroscopic, human-scale objects, and that the effect is measured. This is quantum mechanics at its experimentally most macroscopic scale.</i><p>There&#x27;s some great info in this[2] paper about the detector, sensitivity and performance of Advanced LIGO. And yeah it blows my mind every time I think about it.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2002.01519" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2002.01519</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.aps.org&#x2F;prd&#x2F;abstract&#x2F;10.1103&#x2F;PhysRevD.102.062003" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.aps.org&#x2F;prd&#x2F;abstract&#x2F;10.1103&#x2F;PhysRevD.102.0...</a>')
