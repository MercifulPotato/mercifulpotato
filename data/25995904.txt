There are trade-offs but we think that per-seat pricing (like GitLab, GitHub) actually does make it much easier to budget and plan for monitoring spend. Generally, a headcount plan is more predictable than the data your application generates. For example, a single engineer can add (and maybe should be adding) far more metrics and logs to their applications to monitor it correctly. They should not also be worried about breaking the budget when doing so. Does this make sense to you - what do you think?')
