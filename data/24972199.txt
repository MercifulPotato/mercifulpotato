Your typical server&#x2F;VPS provider gives you that kind of bandwidth allowance for free, because it costs them close to <i>nothing</i>.<p>I have a feeling almost all complaints about cloud costs would disappear forever if they&#x27;d only stop <i>gouging</i> customers on bandwidth.<p>The likes of Hetzner and OVH are starting to offer more cloudy features, like load balancers and block storage. My hope is that eventually they become viable alternatives to the big 3, and they are finally forced to reduce their ludicrous bandwidth prices.')
