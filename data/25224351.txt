It might make sense to look at Julia for future development. You could write something new in Julia to see if the benefits are there for your team. \nAlso, from my understanding you can call Rust from Julia using extern in Rust to pretend to be C. It could act as an escape hatch for performance issues if there are encountered, though I have never tried it.')
