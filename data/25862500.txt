They might even have a fancy graph showing how they&#x27;re optimizing for some unit of productivity per unit of cost, so making employees more productive isn&#x27;t worth it.<p>One of the best pieces of advice I got early in my career was &quot;Whatever you end up doing, make sure the company sees you as a profit center rather than a cost center, because companies are much more free with their checkbooks to the people they think are directly responsible for making the company money,&quot; and though things aren&#x27;t nearly that black and white, it&#x27;s definitely been a good general principle.')
