Item(by='Veserv', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607542840, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25357861, text='My comment is not arguing whether a state actor breached FireEye, but whether <i>only</i> a state actor could breach FireEye as they are implying as nobody else could fund or develop such a &quot;sophisticated&quot; or &quot;advanced&quot; attack. If it is at most $1M as you say, then you are actually agreeing with me as that would hardly constitute something that only a &quot;state actor&quot; could do given that literally any mid-sized business, of which there are millions, could support such an expense. To actually demonstrate that it is so difficult to develop that &quot;only a state actor&quot; has the resources to develop&#x2F;deploy such an attack should require demonstrating that it is out of reach for all but a state actor for which a $1B budget is likely a good bottom-end as only a very small number of non-state entities can actually support such an effort. I hope that clarifies my point.')
