Although I&#x27;m not sure there are enough people concerned about Python&#x27;s performance in this scenario.<p>And yeah, I would be happy to pitch in too if CPython can be 50% faster reliably. It only takes 500 people each pitching in $100 to reach $50k.<p>Edit: somehow got $50k etched in mind when it says $500k. Thatâ€™s more difficult from individual funding.')
