Not only do they marry all the complexity of an ICE vehicle to the electric car, but in the specific case of Volvo (with their extremely high tolerance, low displacement high output motors (YES, turbo <i>and</i> supercharged)) involves even greater complexity.<p>Volvo and their inability to commit to electric (and all of the marketing and advertising to the contrary) is a master class in the reality of incumbent ICE manufacturers.  It also shows how much of the volvo branding and market segment is just bullshit.<p>&quot;Their goal is 50% plugin hybrid, 50% full electric by 2025&quot;<p>Yes, we all saw those press releases but the reality is the actual volvo cars (V60, V90, XC90, S60, S80) will be the hybrids[1] and the space-tron eMobility iDrive ecoTrans &quot;initiative&quot; cars will be the electric ones.<p>Show me an <i>actual volvo</i> (not a space-tron concept car and not their little XC40 golf cart) that is electric and I will happily recant (and go purchase one).<p>[1] With tiny, loud, high vibration lawnmower engines mated to turbos <i>and</i> blowers.')
