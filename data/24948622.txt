The reason a wiki won&#x27;t work for us:  it&#x27;s far, far too loose for describing the things we&#x27;re building and discussing the trade-offs.  We&#x27;re a computer company[1]:  we are building a ton of hardware and low-level systems software that needs to be pretty well described and carefully considered (with revisions formally tracked).  It&#x27;s not aerospace or biomedical devices, but... it&#x27;s also not a SaaS that is amenable to an MVP. So we do need more formalism than might be suitable elsewhere.<p>In terms of newcomers:  I actually think that&#x27;s a tremendous strength of the RFDs:  unlike many startups, we have a <i>lot</i> written down -- and newcomers (and indeed, even prospective Oxide employees) are able to read the stuff that often exists in people&#x27;s heads.<p>All of that said, it&#x27;s definitely not perfect! If we could get a Google docs (or equivalent) in which the underlying artifact were stored as AsciiDoc and every modification appeared as a git commit (and the comments themselves were also tracked via a git commit), that would almost assuredly be better than the GitHub + custom infrastructure we&#x27;ve built.  But already having outrageously broad ambition, we drew the line at not reinventing design document management... ;)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vvZA9n3e5pc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vvZA9n3e5pc</a>')
