Like I enjoy a bit of Irish-Catholic bashing as much as the next Irish person (probably more than most, given that I enjoy complaining about the Council of Nicea) but I don&#x27;t really see how the pre-independence Catholic Church was unethical.<p>To be fair, though I&#x27;m not a fan of the authoritarianism, without the Catholic Church neither of my grand-parents or their parents would have had an education, and indeed the church was the centre of irish social life and community for a very long time.<p>Like, post-independence, the Church did a lot of dodgy things, but I really don&#x27;t think you can blame the one organisation which actually provided some services for Irish catholics for our issues with authority.<p>And it&#x27;s worth pointing out that much of the remaining corruption in Irish life is at the political level, rather than the bureaucratic level. As an example, you might bribe politicians to get planning permission for a large shopping centre, but you don&#x27;t have to bribe the passport office for a renewal.<p>Can you give me some examples of Ireland being horrifically bent?<p>Edit: incidentally, thank you for Kildare Street!')
