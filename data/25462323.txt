They&#x27;re also reposting Wired articles which are often not the best.<p>This stands out as the single worst thing I&#x27;ve ever seen on their site: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;tech-policy&#x2F;2017&#x2F;11&#x2F;this-is-why-ill-never-shop-at-officemax-again-even-if-everything-is-free&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;tech-policy&#x2F;2017&#x2F;11&#x2F;this-is-why-ill-...</a><p>Summary: Author whines about customer support experiences and makes an ass of themselves, then realizes that all their griping wasn&#x27;t even necessary because if they had performed some basic troubleshooting they would have realized the problem was elsewhere all along.<p>As for Pornhubs viewership, I don&#x27;t think it will go down much.
