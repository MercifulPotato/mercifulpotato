Why is university press the worst? If we are still evolving and this isn&#x27;t just about genetic recombination then by definition mutations are involved.<p>Also the publicist writes<p>&gt; This evolutionary trend will continue in those born 80 years from today, with the median artery becoming common in the human forearm.<p>Wat. &quot;Evolutionary intertia&quot; probably has been defined by someone, but it&#x27;s not that.<p>It looks like this is a doubl-wammy misinterpration of the following quote, also from the press release:<p>&gt; “This increase could have resulted from mutations of genes involved in median artery development or health problems in mothers during pregnancy, or both actually. If this trend continues, a majority of people will have median artery of the forearm by 2100.”<p>It <i>could</i> involve mutations and the trend <i>could</i> continue.')
