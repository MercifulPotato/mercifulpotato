It&#x27;s no more easy to cut funding if it comes from the general budget rather than from a ring-fenced dedicated tax, and ultimately people will decide what they want when it&#x27;s elections time (and I can tell you that the majority of people in the UK are very attached to the BBC). This applies for the UK but also I&#x27;m sure also for Germany and Austria.<p>IMHO, TV licences are anachronisms at this point (in the UK we still even have TV licence discounts for black and white TVs...) and it&#x27;s right to at least debate if they are best suited well into the 21st century.')
