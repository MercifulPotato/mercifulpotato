We had a basic laser printer at work and even with 20 people printing everyday it rarely had issues.<p>Even the (5+ year old) HP laser printers are still solid. I&#x27;ve had a little one for 12 years and maybe change the $50 toner cartridge once a year. It would probably be less if i wasn&#x27;t printing research docs to read for school.<p>Basically fuck ink jets. I email files to the local printer if I need a color document.')
