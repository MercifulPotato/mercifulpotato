Apple &amp; Google\nhave widely released bluetooth based tracking capabilities that need an app to leverage them, and in the US these seem to be state based. The US has a disgraceful national failure to have a countrywide plan for most cv19 issues. The Google &amp; Apple strategy we have seems to be that each state makes their own app leveraging the infrastructure. My state (Washington) doesn&#x27;t have an app as of now.<p>Only a few states have released them. Washington State people have been working on an app for a while; commoncircle.us seems to be their website, they have a github site that hasn&#x27;t had a checkin for a couple of months. Is this effort dead? Their twitter account has nothing since July. <i></i>Why isn&#x27;t there an app available or any discussion?<i></i><p>Overview article of the US situation: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gazette.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;people-proving-the-weakest-link-for-covid-tracking-apps&#x2F;article_42a267c4-2aaf-11eb-85d8-cf1d8cde5661.html<p>Salon.com https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.salon.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;20&#x2F;people-are-proving-to-be-the-weakest-link-for-apps-tracking-covid-exposure_partner&#x2F;<p>UW engineering presentation about the effort by prof.
