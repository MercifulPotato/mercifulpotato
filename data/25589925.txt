It turns out, that when the end of the world doesn&#x27;t come, if you&#x27;re by yourself, and don&#x27;t have any other true believers around to help you explain away the miss, then you usually become disillusioned and move away from whatever movement you&#x27;re in.<p>On the other hand, when true believers are around, the feedback loop helps soften the blow and find an excuse.  It blocks out the doubt and you continue in your beliefs.<p>The really shitty thing here is that with the internet, you never have to go through the disappointment of an obvious failed prophecy alone, you can reach out to 4 chan and explain away and justify and find support and reassurance that you weren&#x27;t actually wrong, when the evidence right in front of your face is clearly saying you were wrong.  This is contributing to a snowball effect where these movements are just connecting and growing and never suffer setbacks when the are obviously wrong.
