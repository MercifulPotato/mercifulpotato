It mentions two scenarios: decentralized, uncontrolled money, versus government control.

My country has instant bank transfers between banks and one mobile payment app. And at some point, the (American) smartphone solutions are likely to allow person-to-person transfer. This is all based on existing, privatized banking infrastructure which, while obviously not completely outside government control, is certainly not a public resource like the cash-based infrastructure was.')
