First, you have to gather enough money to actually move. You will need a car and gas, and&#x2F;or a moving truck. You will need first and last months rent (not to mention how will you find a cheap place in a city you have no connections in without being there?)<p>Then, you are leaving your entire support system when you move. When you are poor, your support system is how you live. Friends watch each other&#x27;s kids while they work, they share needed things, they find jobs for each other, they lend money to each other when unexpected things happen, they let people crash on their couch when they lose their house.<p>Telling poor people to abandon their social support system to move somewhere cheaper is really underselling how hard that is.')
