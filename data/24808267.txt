In Xinjiang, many are afforded the opportunity to get additional education and job training to be productive citizens, as those with a bright future are less likely to be disenfranchised and resort to violence.<p>The US&#x2F;western led smear campaign against China is nothing more than a poorly conceived containment strategy to demonize a country that has succeeded against all odds, while in the process, has made western govts look incompetent by comparison--despite their &#x27;democracy and freedoms.&#x27;<p>China is being alienated and used as a scapegoat, largely to distract public sentiment in the west from the failings of their own govts. In the case of the US, China poses a threat to post WWII hegemony which is nothing more than a euphemism for maintaining white supremacy via the 5 Eyes Anglo alliance with CAN&#x2F;UK&#x2F;AUS&#x2F;NZ.<p>The US led west has been indiscriminately bombing innocent civilians suspected of terrorism for last 20yrs, while renditioning known terrorists to offshore black sites where they can mete out any form of torture&#x2F;punishment with impunity and zero consequences. Is it rational to believe theyre sincerely concerned about the well being of Uighurs...')
