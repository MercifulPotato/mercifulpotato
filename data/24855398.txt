None of the orbits of the planets or the space ships follow realistic path. One of the authors mentioned that they didn&#x27;t calculate the positions of the planets or the trajectories between them. So the Expanse isn&#x27;t as realistic as 2001 or the Martian where the orbital mechanics play a key role in the story.<p>This may seem like nitpicking, but if you want to discuss the politics of space, the distance between planets and the travel time between space polities becomes a critical aspect of politics.<p>The Expanse is in an uncanny valley of hard sci-fi. It&#x27;s not as realistic as Kerbal Space Program but use technology as a magical way to explore speculative scenarios like Star Trek did.<p>And a core part of the first arc is a stealth ship which is not hard sci-fi at the Expanse&#x27;s tech level: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.projectrho.com&#x2F;public_html&#x2F;rocket&#x2F;spacewardetect.php#nostealth" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.projectrho.com&#x2F;public_html&#x2F;rocket&#x2F;spacewardetect....</a>')
