Things could look okay pretty much right away, then get sharper if you give it a second. Shorter loading times and a reasonable image pretty much no matter the size.<p>In practice, I never really used it. I toyed with it once or twice, I turn it on every time because with jpg it often yields marginally lower file sizes anyway (in gimp you can preview file size and looks), but never heard anyone say &quot;what was that magic&quot; and whenever I see it on websites I think to myself &quot;yeah okay that 20x20 pixel image, it could have saved a render cycle, this is useless and looks terrible&quot; before it downloads to 100% before the next render cycle.<p>So I&#x27;m not sure it will really be missed, even if you saddened my inner nerd. I really do like the feature, it&#x27;s really neat to just load as much as you wish and get however much &#x27;quality&#x27; fits within that data size.')
