To me, quirks are &quot;yellow flags&quot; in the interview stage because it means that you&#x27;re not able to put your own weirdness aside to fit socially when you arguably need to the most. Invariably these same &quot;quirks&quot; come up down the road in the employment with output problems, copping attitude with superiors, weirdness in internal&#x2F;external meetings, and just general antisocial behavior.<p>I get that we&#x27;re all in hella demand right now but I&#x27;m starting to go back on my, &quot;I&#x27;m just hiring for the engineering skill&#x2F;talent&quot; as an excuse to overlook yellow flags.<p>The other thing is contextually, what are the quirks? If the &quot;quirk&quot; is someone being super shy&#x2F;timid it doesn&#x27;t even register on my radar as a problem unless it&#x27;s extreme... I&#x27;m talking about the stereotypical &quot;oh so cute dev quirks&quot; like: not dressing appropriately for an interview, interrupting me&#x2F;talking over me, talking down to me, comparing their last junior position to being Steve Jobs, being sing-songy, inappropriate jokes in <i>any</i> way&#x2F;shape&#x2F;form, getting in arguments with themselves... etc etc.<p>I&#x27;m at a point that if you can&#x27;t act 95% professional in your first interview you&#x27;re done as you&#x27;re not capable of being &quot;on&quot;.')
