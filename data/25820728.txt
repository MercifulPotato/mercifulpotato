It seems to me they are trying to mostly explain how some galaxies can rotate the way they do (inside part spinning about as fast as the outside) which in their eyes only makes sense if some strong mass keeps it together.\nTo a layman like me it looks more like there is no dark matter but some galaxies are on a “lazy Susan” like part of space - caught in a whirl or eddy in space time where (local to the galaxy) it doesn’t really spin that fast. It is instead everything else on the sky that spins faster than it should from their point of view.<p>I hope to learn enough physics sometime so I can shed my childish simplistic views of the universe.')
