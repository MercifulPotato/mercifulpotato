The entire point of USB-C is for the whole computing ecosystem to migrate. If that&#x27;s prohibitively expensive for a common webcam, then it&#x27;s an utter design failure.<p>But I have a hard time believig it actually <i>is</i> true, since I can also find a bunch of cheap USB-C stuff on Amazon as well.
