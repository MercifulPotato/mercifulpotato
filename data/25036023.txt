My point is that if faker were anything slightly above free, we really wouldn&#x27;t have used it, and our code quality wouldn&#x27;t suffer from not having it. It was more of a &quot;ooh, that&#x27;s kinda nice&quot; thing when we used it.<p>&gt; And I&#x27;m not even going to _start_ on what I think of your attitude towards test tooling vs &quot;central libraries&quot; other than to note that if you don&#x27;t consider test tools central to your development process, I think you have bigger problems.<p>That&#x27;s not my attitude at all and is a bullshit strawman. I actually <i>do</i> donate to libraries that are fundamental to our test framework. Faker is just definitely not one of them.')
