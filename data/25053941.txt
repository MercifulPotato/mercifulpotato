It happens all the time.<p>&quot;Clearly both firms with extensive investment experience did not feel that way.&quot; - no, that they didn&#x27;t &#x27;go after the money&#x27; doesn&#x27;t imply they would be &#x27;squeezing&#x27; if they did. What it implies is that in all likelihood, it probably just wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle.<p>The investors got robbed, but at least they can write it off. Asking for money from someone who is essentially refusing to give it back to you is not &#x27;squeezing&#x27; by any definition.<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Illegality&quot; - in the article Josh mentioned that he had some kind of deal with the acquirer whereby &#x27;not matter what, he would get his $3.7M&#x27;. If the acquirer is agreeing to terms with one &#x27;insider shareholder&#x27; to the detriment of the others, that&#x27;s fraud, and it&#x27;s illegal.<p>Josh has a fiduciary responsibility to represent in good faith on behalf of all of the shareholders. Clearly in this situation, he came out with a nice exit, while his investors got $0. It also seems pretty clear that Josh and the acquirer were going to make sure that Josh was &#x27;taken care of as part of the deal&#x27;.<p>Conrad Black went to jail because he was selling off assets of the company, but also getting a large &#x27;consulting fee&#x27; from the acquiring entity to him personally. The shareholders felt that was defrauding them of what would otherwise be valuation&#x2F;money they should receive.<p>In this companies transaction, it seems pretty clear that the investors were probably into it for $800K (participating) and then 15% or whatever they owned - but they got nothing.<p>He benefited while the other shareholders did not - this looks like it might illegal - but it probably would only be considered so if someone took them to court over it, which obviously they wont.<p>It&#x27;s a fine line between &#x27;negotiating hard&#x27; and simply saying &#x27;I have your money, you&#x27;re not going to get it, so that&#x27;s that&#x27;.')
