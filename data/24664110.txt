There were four that I lived in over ten years and several others that I traveled through. I&#x27;ve heard about it being the case in some prisons, but to present it as a universal truth is wrong. The most strictly segregated prison system I&#x27;ve heard of is California&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s based on alliance rather than race alone. The AB-aligned whites are allied with Sureños (a Hispanic group) while blacks are allied with Norteños, and fraternization is fine within the alliance but not outside of it.')
