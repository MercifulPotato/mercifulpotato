Item(by='reificator', descendants=None, kids=[24915437], score=None, time=1603860398, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24915202, text='You described Dave Allen&#x27;s 2 minute rule as immediately doing things that take under 2 minutes while determining what work needs to be done, instead of marking them as a task to be done later.<p>The article describes taking long and&#x2F;or involved tasks and inventing an artificially limited 2 minute version of them that you can begin more easily.<p>That&#x27;s very twisted along the way, and does not seem like Dave Allen&#x27;s original idea.  It seems like a conflation of two very different ideas of his that are meant to solve different problems.<p>I never said Dave Allen&#x27;s idea was contentious.  I never criticized &#x27;Getting Things Done&#x27;.  I highlighted a facet of the article that I believed people could easily misread and therefore reject as not applicable to their image of themselves.<p>Please read my posts without the assumption that I am criticizing Dave Allen or his work.')
