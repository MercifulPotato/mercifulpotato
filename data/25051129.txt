Wether or not other platforms exist and how much more or less censorship and tokens you get is irrelivant to the discussion on wether it is morally right for twitter to flag tweets it deems &#x27;misinformation&#x27; Twitter as a platform has no register of what they can and cannot judge. Twitter does not replicate ANY evidence on what they call misinformation. Twitter does not even provide proof on what they call misinformation. Just the label at the bottom. Twitter also categorises criticism on mainstream &#x27;facts&#x27; as the same &#x27;misinformation&#x27;<p>How would you like HN if ITT everyone disagreed with twitter censorship and you would be labelled on every post ITT as &#x27;misinformation&#x27;? would you think that constitutes as a usefull HN guideline?')
