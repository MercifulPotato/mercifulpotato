The surprising thing about Joplin was just how much I would really love the Joplin Web Clipper browser extension. I can clip screenshots and web pages and they insert right into Joplin.<p>Beyond that, I use Syncthing (highly recommend if you&#x27;re on Android) and I sync my Joplin notes between my PC, laptop, and Android. It works flawlessly.')
