Sophisticated attackers will go after any soft underbelly or pore they can find, and there&#x27;s no reason not to believe they&#x27;d put significant effort into quietly abusing Jetbrains security just like they did with Solarwinds. I&#x27;m less worried about the &quot;Russian&quot; red scare mention other than it may give non-US organizations a few more opportunities to inject badness that we can&#x27;t get visibility on.<p>Bottom-line is that it would be the holy grail and are we treating it as the high priority target it is? Having worked for dev tool companies in the past, I know they are a lot more worried about innovation than about their own internal processes.')
