I think you are completely correct on all counts, but I think the spirit of your post misses one important facet.<p>I compose because improvising on a single instrument is not <i>enough</i> for me. But it really is like improvising with edits, and being a good improviser will improve your compositions just as your compositions will improve your improvisations. And ultimately, you are doing these things because you love to play and hear music.<p>The appeal of vim is that it encapsulates programmatic thinking into the act of editing. With each edit, you are making a little program: &quot;select these words with these conditions but not those other conditions, and then, for the first (expression x&#x2F;y) of them, transform them thusly. Then, select the parent containers, and pipe each one to this file-descriptor to be processed externally.&quot;<p>But you can do this with a few keystrokes, you just have to think ahead a little. That is, it makes the act of programming and entering&#x2F;editing text one and the same activity, allowing you to do little programmatic improvisations.<p>I switched from music to code when I realized I got more enjoyment out of code than music. That is, I echo your statements &quot;if you enjoy using it, more power to ya&quot; and &quot;playing music and composing are NOT the same,&quot; but also: sometimes playing music and composing <i>are</i> the same, and sometimes the only reason you are composing (or playing music) at all is because it <i>feels so wonderful to do both at the same time.</i>')
