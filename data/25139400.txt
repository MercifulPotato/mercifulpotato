When I read anecdotes that fall out of line with our scientific understanding of the facts (such as the one I posed above), my default assumption is that we&#x27;re witnessing placebo at play. From the outside, I definitely would not trust my anecdote. After my experience though, and now knowing what I know about the drug, I still wouldn&#x27;t chalk my experience up to placebo. I guess that&#x27;s the catch-22 of the phenomenon, eh?')
