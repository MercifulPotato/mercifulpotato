This is very general and includes money, power, freedom, intellectual influence, access to interesting people to work with and discuss, being taken seriously by intelligent co-experts, being a valued and respected member of the community, whose insights people look out for etc.<p>This is taboo to say explicitly of course, one must say that it&#x27;s all internal passion, but people, whether they admit it or not, will have to strive for these things. If they don&#x27;t, they fall behind.<p>This goes way way deeper than grants. It&#x27;s not even just human nature, but a fundamental property of life.\nThe same is true in dating. You have to present yourself in the best possible way, and those who do have better success.<p>It&#x27;s not enough that you and your ideas are good, you have to be able to convince people that you are worth investing in.<p>You can&#x27;t forbid people to associate, to form cliques, to keep tabs on who is good and who isn&#x27;t (and the same for departments and universities) etc, to invite each other to work together.<p>A grant that led to a sexy result will be considered money better spent, than something that leads to no presentable conclusions.<p>And beyond the gaming, there are genuine differences in how good a research vision some people have.
