Comcast (and all coaxial cable spectrum&#x2F;cox&#x2F;...) infrastructure, from what I understand is in a very poor condition due to neglect and even their &quot;gigabit&quot; is actually gigabit down &#x2F; 30mbps up at best. and then there&#x27;s over subscription. Try having everyone in your household on different video conference call.<p>My understanding is once you get fiber installed to the home, the difference in ongoing expense of 150Mbps vs gigabit is not that much. So might as well?')
