The recruiter made an effort to stay in touch with me but for reasons unknown to me I stopped getting replies. I&#x27;d put months of effort into getting positive signals from a company I really wanted to work with, and I noticed that they actively monitored their Glassdoor. I left a detailed message on the situation I was in. I wasn&#x27;t rude, I didn&#x27;t throw a tantrum because I didn&#x27;t know how the situation the recruiter was in. It&#x27;s possible they were in a bad life or organizational spot and didn&#x27;t know what to do. People are humans. But it was my last effort before I moved onto something else.<p>That message was picked up by someone senior in the org, and they explained that even though they wanted to hire me, I wasn&#x27;t as far along in the process of getting hired as I thought. This was a bit sad to me, but they referred me to another recruiter that would be handling my case. I decided to work with them nonetheless, since I really liked that place. It took about 6 months from that initial email to me getting a visa, just as COVID-19 began to impact borders.<p>If it had been another company, I would likely have given up. But, humans are humans and unfortunately recruiting, especially from overseas, isn&#x27;t an area with the best experience.')
