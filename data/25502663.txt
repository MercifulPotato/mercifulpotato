The usual date for this discovery is 1998. This  is like throwing a baseball upwards and instead of it keeping its speed or de-accelarating (because of gravity and friction) the  ball instead starts to move faster and faster. You would suspect the existence of an unknown energy that is powering this acceleration. That is what is called dark energy , which for all intents and purposes it is a giant black box with a question mark right now.')
