That&#x27;s just an artifact of the US&#x27;s backwards intellectual property legal system. It has nothing to do with positive vs negative rights.<p>Bottom line is that laws and ethics aren&#x27;t the same. A legal grant to do something (even if it isn&#x27;t the default) doesn&#x27;t constitute an invitation to do something unethical.<p>And I stand by my characterization. The parent post was literally talking about prohibiting things one doesn&#x27;t like.')
