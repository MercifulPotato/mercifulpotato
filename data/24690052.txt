Never so much where I&#x27;ve had an accident, but bad enough where I&#x27;ve scared myself badly.<p>I don&#x27;t want autopilot so I can actually sleep at the wheel, I want it <i>in case I do</i>. I&#x27;d vastly prefer if the car noticed I was inattentive that it notified me. My feeling is for long drives this would be a safety feature, but I&#x27;m concerned that the way it&#x27;s built it will my worst driving behaviors instead of helping compensate for them.')
