The diagram Maciek puts into the talk and a related blog post is really the key: scale has many dimensions.<p>For OpenAI, they’re making a reasonable choice as operators of a multi tenant cluster (shared amongst researchers). You want to own the other software on the box, do rolling upgrades, and then get out of the way.<p>Many other folks though, really need a much more dynamic system. Watch Maciek’s talk!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;3AAgWBvM5L0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;3AAgWBvM5L0</a>')
