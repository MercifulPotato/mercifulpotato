Because using a gravel-road to connect 5 or 10 village houses is as as good as any asphalt-road, and, more importantly, is a lot cheaper to maintain in the long run. And when asphalt roads go bad they go really bad, with craters instead of the actual road, I&#x27;ve not witnessed the same phenomenon with gravel roads (they do get sort of bad but not on the same magnitude).')
