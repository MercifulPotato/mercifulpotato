I think one top value for me personally is that more time could be spent on hacking the ml algorithms, replicating and comparing with real research work (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.duckietown.org&#x2F;archives&#x2F;63665" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.duckietown.org&#x2F;archives&#x2F;63665</a>).<p>I live in India and find the shipping costs of MOOC Founder&#x27;s Edition Kit (369 USD + 49 USD) a bit expensive. Just the Duckiebot MOOC Founder&#x27;s Edition costs 14 USD to ship.idk what custom duty would the govt put on it :(.<p>1. Is there any alternative to shipping it? \n2. Is there anyway to build similar bot from parts for the course?\n3. I guess, since you&#x27;re non-profit it&#x27;s made such that it&#x27;s cost effective rather than for profit. It would be great if you describe why you chose each of the component for the current bot.')
