Fire all those designers?<p>Of course not. You simply re-design every few years.<p>The re-design will be supported by evidence like &quot;its cleaner&quot; and &quot;it increases visual clarity&quot; or &quot;it unifies our brand&quot;, because phrases like that mean nothing but who would ever vote against cleaning something up?')
