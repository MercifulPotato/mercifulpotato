It&#x27;s something out of psy-ops.<p>ONE demonstrator had zip ties, therefore &quot;they had zip ties&quot;.<p>Sure, many were armed and who fired the sole single lethal shot that day?  Law enforcement.  How is that for peaceful?<p>The &quot;four people died&quot; narrative is also very telling.  One demonstrator was shot by police.  One law enforcement officer died of injuries - although details have been very vague.  The other two deaths?  One heart attack and one unrelated condition.  At this point I expect the US media to attribute every single death in DC on that day to these demonstrations just so they can pretend it was an extremely lethal event.<p>The people &quot;stormed the Capitol&quot; and what did they do once they had it?  They took selfies and then left peacefully.  That&#x27;s not a coup or an insurrection, that&#x27;s a disorganized demonstration that went too far because Capitol police could apparently not keep doors closed.<p>But I understand.  The US media has been priming people for 5 years for this.  They&#x27;ve been running influence campaigns and promoting violence the minute Trump won.  They spent 3 years talking about Russian collusion and then didn&#x27;t say a thing when it was proven false.  Could you imagine if the Russian collusion narrative had been treated the same way the electoral fraud narrative has been treated?')
