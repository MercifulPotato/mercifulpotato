I’ve been hearing and reading a lot of FUD about it, but if you were to take the (self reported) stats in this BBC article at face value it looks like one of the best options.<p>I found eg this Wired article that talks a lot about the geopolitical maneuvering of Russia&#x2F;China&#x2F;India in Africa and South America: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.co.uk&#x2F;article&#x2F;russia-covid-vaccine-sputnik-v" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.co.uk&#x2F;article&#x2F;russia-covid-vaccine-sputnik...</a><p>But really, despite a lot of pejorative language in there -- “Once they have this relationship, they can extort whatever they want” -- it just sounds like the same strategy the UK has been attempting (both politically, and in terms of vaccine development and approval), except the Russian version sounds more successful so far.<p><i>Edit to add:</i> apologies in advance for dragging politics into this! But it seems like politics and vaccines are unfortunately intertwined.')
