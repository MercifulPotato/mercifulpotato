Trees can be planted in deserts without  irrigation using technology developed by a Dutch company called Groasis [0]. They have also recently come up with a new version of their Waterboxx that can use any kind of wastewater to plant trees, even sea water. [1] Looks like it works via solar condensation which then wicks into the soil so the roots can follow it down to the deeper capillary water ~3 meters below. So no need for drip irrigation.<p>This new water filter box will come in handy for ongoing restoration projects in the Galapagos Islands etc where fresh water is unavailable. Will make a post for it when more information becomes available.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.groasis.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.groasis.com</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;dcSnF_AoqgY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;dcSnF_AoqgY</a>')
