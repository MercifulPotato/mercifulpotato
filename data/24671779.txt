He wouldn&#x27;t just <i>blow-up</i>, he would explain in an abrasive manner exactly why he thought discussing this thing was a waste of his time. It was obviously a tactic (if subconscious) to get people to hesitate before proposing something he would think was obviously silly. I think it probably worked; the criticism of his responses were that they were unnecessarily personal and hurtful, not that they were wrong.<p>I can also see why he backed away from it. If you&#x27;re going to hurt people&#x27;s feelings, best to do it through intermediaries so you don&#x27;t get stained.')
