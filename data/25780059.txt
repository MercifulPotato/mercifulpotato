Item(by='mrmanner', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610648703, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25773526, text='&gt; When exactly are those passions supposed to be pursued? When retiring? I&#x27;m pursuing that now. I have had 6-8weeks off in summer the last 10 years. I like to travel, etc.<p>This!<p>I&#x27;m not familiar with all European countries, and not extremely so with the US, but I think this is an important difference: Free time. 5-6 weeks paid vacation is common, and employers expect it to be used. It&#x27;s often easy to get unpaid leave for whatever reason, such as studying or starting a business. Parental leave is paid and the expectation is that it will be used. Employers demanding overtime or &quot;crunching&quot; or whatever is generally frowned upon.<p>Etc. etc. My strong impression is that those &quot;low-paid&quot; European jobs are often a lot more balanced, with more room for life than their American counterparts.<p>(I do live in Scandinavia, maybe we&#x27;re on the extreme end of this, but still )')
