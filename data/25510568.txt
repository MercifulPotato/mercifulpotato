WiFi price&#x2F;performance does not exceed wired connections. Real-world WiFi performance typically falls well below the advertised maximum. You&#x27;re much more likely to get the advertised maximum with a wired connection. WiFi gets more attention because running cable is hard to do. Most people are content with weak signals at the corners of their homes. WiFi is the good enough solution for most people.<p>2. If you can use a wired connection, a wired connection will almost always be better. The 5ghz spectrum doesn&#x27;t suffer from noisy neighbors as much as the 2.4ghz spectrum, but that&#x27;s mostly because 5ghz is much more easily blocked by walls and its effective range is much shorter.<p>When I started working from home because of COVID, I bit the bullet and ran ethernet cable in my 100 year old house. No regrets. I had been looking at WiFi mesh networks, but all of the performance reviews I saw on YouTube showed speeds much lower than the theoretical WiFi limits.')
