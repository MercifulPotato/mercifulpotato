We are talking about human lives<p>I would be great very grateful to other HNers if someone could point me towards a book or resource for how to effectively communicate with people who are in this mental groove. I feel as though my point was missed, and I can&#x27;t think of any more effective way to convey it.<p>(EDIT: I suppose I could say that outrage tends to shut down discussion by inciting emotion over reason. I feel just as strongly about these human lives, which is why I want to be able to talk about them clearly.<p>I do not think saying this will affect the parent&#x27;s mode, and I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s some better way to do that.)')
