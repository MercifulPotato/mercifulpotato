The post that I was replying to seemed to suggest that CBDCs would be decentralized or in some way inherently different from the centralized digital settlement of transfers that exists in many countries today, and I want to understand why that should be the case? Why would CBDCs work more like decentralized cryptographic currencies than the current financial system?<p>I am not passing a judgment on whether decentralized currencies are good, but I do not understand why central banks would move in that direction.')
