Even if I had paid for the doctor, blood tests, and prescription entirely out-of-pocket, it would&#x27;ve been cheaper than self-medicating at a dose like that.  Most of it was out-of-pocket for me anyway because I hadn&#x27;t met my deductible, and the whole ordeal set me back less than $100.  If I didn&#x27;t have in-network pricing, it still would&#x27;ve been less than the cost of one month of health insurance.<p>Obviously, there are plenty of regions and situations in which things don&#x27;t work out that way.  Asking someone to self-medicate with Vitamin D still has the potential to be expensive, and there may be better uses for that money, especially for someone in that sort of financial position.')
