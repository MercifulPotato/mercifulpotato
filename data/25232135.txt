Item(by='kazinator', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606507558, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25227583, text='&gt; <i>Can I shoot myself in the foot somehow with low precision if numbers I&#x27;m using are &quot;too close&quot; to infinity?</i><p>The &quot;number of sig figs&quot; precision will be the same for large values far away from zero, as for values close to zero. E.g. IEEE 64 bit reliably gives you about 15 decimal digits of precision. Any decimal number with 15 digits of precision that is in the range of the IEEE 64 bit double can be converted to that type, and then back to decimal, such that all those digits of precision are recovered.<p>You can shoot yourself in the foot if you rely on floating-point values being able to exactly represent integers, but the values go beyond the range where that is possible. Beyond a certain range, all consecutive integers are no longer representable; some integers get approximated by nearby integers.')
