A human is a very advanced and versatile work unit that is extremely susceptible to control via simple rewards. It would be a terrible waste to destroy such a resource.<p>In fact, it would make more sense to advance medicine and robotics to the point where <i>everyone</i> can operate at near 100% efficiency.<p>The more likely scenario (continued from yours, before the CyberX part) would likely be that all humans would eventually end up working for the AI and possibly not even know it. And then everyone moves on to space heh')
