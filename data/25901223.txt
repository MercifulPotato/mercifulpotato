Then Windows 10 would not be in limbo (in terms of UI and features).</i><p>You have cause and effect the wrong way there: Windows 10 is in limbo precisely because MS have acknowledged that massive new OS rewrites every few years isn&#x27;t cost effective. Not because Microsoft can&#x27;t work out how to ship a new OS. There was a press release about how Windows would adopt a different release cycle around the launch time of Win 10.<p>&gt; <i>I don&#x27;t understand why Apple and Microsoft feel stuck to one OS.</i><p>I don&#x27;t understand why you think Apple or Microsoft fragmenting their install base would be a good thing for business.')
