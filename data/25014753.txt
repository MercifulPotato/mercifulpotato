Trying to shut down criticism is not saying &quot;you are wrong&quot; on HN. That&#x27;s not censorship.<p>I agree it makes you feel aggrieved but it won&#x27;t be a call to arms for the free speech crowd to back you up.<p>But its most likely that I misunderstood. Do you want people to defend your arguments or the ability for you to make your arguments? or perhaps it&#x27;s about someone else? Your comment was a root level one and was not in response to anything specific so I dont have much to go upon except the reference to another comment which read, to me, like an everyday argument on HN and one where you challenged. thus, this comment about free speech seems strange.')
