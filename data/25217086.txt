Item(by='DuskStar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606367827, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25216855, text='&gt; I&#x27;m skeptical a laser can defend against supersonic antiship missiles and ICBMs.<p>I don&#x27;t think lasers are meant to counter high-end threats like hypersonic missiles or MRBM&#x2F;ICBM reentry vehicles. Not yet, at least. That can be done with SAMs - trading a $Xmm missile for a $Ymm missile is acceptable. (Trading that missile for a $Zk drone is not)<p>&gt; these lasers probably can&#x27;t fire frequently enough to defend against those.<p>This comes down to &quot;dwell time to kill&quot; and &quot;duty cycle&quot;. Assuming 1s and 10%, you&#x27;ve got 6 kills&#x2F;minute steady state. (Or 9 kills against a swarm incoming at 200kph with an engagement range of 5km) If the laser could do 50% for 2 minutes before taking 10 to cool down, though, it could handle 45 in that same scenario. And considering that commercial fiber lasers have duty cycles in the 50+% range sustained, I don&#x27;t think this is unreasonable.')
