Bitcoin does not depend on a specific dollar value to ensure nodes add blocks.<p>Nodes that add new blocks earn both new Bitcoin rewards (until ~21 million bitcoins are created) and transaction fees. If hash power drops from miners going out of business, then difficulty adjusts and competition for fees is reduced, reducing the cost of mining until there are miners again. When all Bitcoins are mined, nodes that add blocks are still compensated from transaction fees. They compete for transactions by offering lower fees, and in this way the transaction fee is determined by the market for Bitcoin transactions.')
