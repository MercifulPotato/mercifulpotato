Perhaps you had a &quot;single layer&quot; that made it hard since the droplets&#x2F;water from your exhale got stuck in the fabric, and together with the atmosphere&#x27;s humidity created this effect.<p>In such cold climates I wear an ultra long scarf (2m-2.5m), I wrap my neck&#x2F;jaw&#x2F;ears 3-4-5 times (depending how tight) and I tuck it in my jacket. The outside of the scarf freezes, the inside remains warm. I also try to breathe by my nose, less humid.')
