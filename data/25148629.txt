But a lot of modern warfare is by proxy. Subnuclear force is what matters.<p>More tangibly: Russia starts constructing a base on Greenland. Does France risk nuclear exchange to challenge it? For that matter, would America? Of course not.<p>Sanctions, blockading the construction site and threatening to build similarly near Russian assets would be the game. Each of these, individually, is within Paris&#x27; capacity. (Except, maybe, sanctions.) But collectively, no.')
