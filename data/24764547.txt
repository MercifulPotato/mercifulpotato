There was an opportunity to upset the system by producing a collection of artworks that bucked the trend and opposed the powers-that-be. Simply doing that act had power in itself, bringing the new idea into being, had potential for radical social change. The modern era in particular had a few revolutions of thought and art-style. They were social leaders in themselves. Art history goes over them, like Dada, constructivism, ect.<p>Now anything that breaks the trend is drowned out with money and&#x2F;or censorship.<p>The banana taped to the wall a few years ago inspired people to think about how much art costs to buy, and how art is a money-laundering front for rich people. There was little discussion and sight of the original intent of the piece as a humorous comedy. It did not change how people view society, the world or art. It is seen as a clever man who could sell a $2 banana for $120k, rather than a comment on what art means. The piece has been captured by neoliberal economics (as if it ever meant to be anything else).<p>The video game Hatred [0] was a misanthrophic mass killer who goes on a genocidal crusade. It was banned from steam and panned by reviews. I don&#x27;t endorse the content of the game, though it perfectly demonstrates the stifling lack of power any particular piece of art has to change people&#x27;s minds today. You have to be approved by the internet&#x27;s gatekeepers to be seen and heard. The act of creation has to be matched with the audience interacting with your artwork and a single image of your game does not have the same impact as a Dada artwork did in the 1900s.<p>&gt;And people play them for completely different reasons then &quot;being rebellious&quot;<p>I agree (partly). The advent garde is dead, the power is with the tech platforms to change society, not art. So there are no &quot;free thinking creatives&quot;, there are just technologists who push internet platforms further and further into people&#x27;s lives. That&#x27;s where the &quot;free thought&quot; is. Art is entirely ordered and almost completely chaos-free.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hatred_(video_game)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hatred_(video_game)</a><p>A minor rebuttal, people do like the rebellious aspect of Star Wars, despite it&#x27;s conformity to everyday art production.')
