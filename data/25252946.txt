I&#x27;d be happy to hear why you think so, though. I don&#x27;t really understand the second part of your comment, however: I have no bone to pick with you, nor do I regularly downvote people. Least of all you, since the only interaction I recall having with you is your replies to my comments, which automatically disables downvoting.')
