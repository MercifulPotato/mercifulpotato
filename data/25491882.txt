But the article was published long after all the papers were de-anonymized, so it seems perverse to explain that the submissions were originally anonymous instead of just giving the authors&#x27; names.<p>Furthermore, the journalist managed to write an entire article about a workshop without once naming it, giving a link, or even defining backpropagation.<p>Edit:  I want to say that I understand it&#x27;s hard to cover an area that you&#x27;re not an expert in.  But if the journalist had googled the title of the articles he was writing about, he would have found the authors&#x27; names.  Instead he gave the reader the impression that the articles are still anonymous.')
