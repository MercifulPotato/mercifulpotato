If I&#x27;m trying to quickly find the part I want to modify, the comments do help me skim through quickly and zoom in on the part I care about. It&#x27;s the same reason a blog post is often broken up into section headings. Without the comments, I&#x27;d have to spend a few extra seconds trying to map chunks of the code with my mental model of how linked lists work. Those few seconds can interrupt the flow of work.<p>So I&#x27;ll disagree with the notion that only illegible or unreadable code needs comment.')
