With these rules, it&#x27;s impossible to find anything that would make someone go &quot;oh, that&#x27;s something I want to use TOR for&quot; if you&#x27;re only considering sites that can be easily reached without TOR. In fact, I&#x27;d argue that sites on such a list are not really part of the &quot;dark web&quot; at all.')
