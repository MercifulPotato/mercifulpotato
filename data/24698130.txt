I don&#x27;t think we should choose to work with this these super large exponential numbers just to quotient them out. Better to just us the &quot;Family DAG&quot; from the get-go.<p>What must be done by real demographers, but never covered in these articles from the general public, is some sort of &quot;outbread---diversity&quot; distribution. There is a clearly a conservation law in that genetic variation at larger scales depends on inbreeding &#x2F; genetic homogeneity at smaller scales.<p>While I doubt the phenomenon is scale-free, there is still variation in the possible distributions at every scale. I want to know where humans have lied in that distribution-of-distributions over time. E.g. Europe is very homogeneous but if there was something more egalitarian than federalism would it be even more homogeneous?<p>My hunch is &quot;no&quot; because most of these Eurasian hierarchical societies had tones of elite man + non-elite women illegitimate children who were denied elite privileges, but I&#x27;d still like to see the definitive answer.')
