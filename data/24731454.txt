I admit I have horrible comprehension skills but it sounds like a smart enough statement when you repeat it enough, I just can&#x27;t grep any meaning in this. Do they know the truth? You throw in the conspiracy groups and you have made yourself half a statement.<p>They&#x27;re bad we get it, Id rather be able to hear how bad they are in the light. Who was accountable when we spread lies about WMDs in Iraq? That caused magnitudes of more damage than these groups, yet no one is held accountable even with Public figures. Do you want everyone accountable for misinformation silenced or just those you disagree with?')
