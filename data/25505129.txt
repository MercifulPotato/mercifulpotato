Maybe I&#x27;m wrong since I didn&#x27;t check all hardware but Apple still seem to be the only ones that have rigid quality controls, make sure parallel parts are parallel, mechanical parts stand a reasonable amount of movements. (At least as long they are not testing a new &quot;innovation&quot; like butterfly keyboards... ;)) That said, I buy stuff used if I cannot buy the high quality version. It falls apart anyway, this way there&#x27;s no reason to be upset and it&#x27;s better for the environment.')
