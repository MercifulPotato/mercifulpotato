I understand that software is licensed.<p>I agreed to a license. If that license doesn&#x27;t say that the &quot;manufacturer&quot; can arbitrarily remove features at a later date then I&#x27;m not sure how they get a pass for that.<p>Edit (to your edit): Yeah.

Fat chance that anything would be done about it, but it can still piss me off (and make me try to gin-up pissed-off feelings in other people).')
