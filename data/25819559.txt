Item(by='Freak_NL', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610958886, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25819092, text='Absolutely. My two year old son now wears a pair of second-hand shoes bought in a boutique that also sells used children&#x27;s clothing (but only high quality items). It fits him perfectly. Before that a pair of practically unworn shoes with LED-lights in the soles was worn a handful of times; it fitted right enough, but in the summer a pair of Tefa sandals was much more comfortable.<p>Some pairs of shoes see much more wear than others, and unlike adults, when kids don&#x27;t wear a pair for a while because the weather is more suitable for other things (sandals or wellies) they&#x27;ll often hit the next size up by the time they can wear them. So sometimes shoes will hardly be worn at all.<p>And a pair of kids wellies must see at least twenty pairs of feet before retiring. I don&#x27;t think these actually ever get to the stage that they are worn out: they just get lost somewhere on the way long before that.')
