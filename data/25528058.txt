The only thing which can reset this is for nodes to update to a revised consensus algorithm.<p>The point of this is to essentially force a periodic &quot;vote of confidence&quot; -- instead of nodes passively not updating their software, every few years they HAVE to, or the difficulty bomb comes into play.  Which means when a major hard fork update is proposed, no one can sit on the sidelines, they have to either choose the proposed fork, or propose an alternative for consensus to rally around.  This cycle repeated every year or so, and has gone pretty smoothly so far.<p>The point of this is to encourage active participation, so nodes can&#x27;t sit there and cast &quot;passive no&quot; votes to everything, they&#x27;re incentivized to actively participate in the network&#x27;s evolution.<p>Even if a node doesn&#x27;t update, mining just slows down.  Nothing <i>anywhere</i> in that process will cause the Ethereum network to &quot;implode&quot;, that&#x27;s IMO a rather emotionally charged way of describing things.<p>---<p>As to &quot;requiring Vitalik&#x27;s intervention&quot; -- that&#x27;s just an outright falsehood.<p>Not only is Vitalik not directly involved in the coding of any of the multiple independent Ethereum clients anymore, but there is a very large group of developers (of which the &quot;founders&quot; are a very small %) which work out the proposals for updates.  And anyone can propose an update -- the software and the high level specs are all open source (and most are on github).<p>Proposing a full milestone update of the Ethereum network is complex, and probably more work than a single individual could pull off reliably -- but that&#x27;s the whole point.  There is no gatekeeper (and definitely not Vitalik), and the only way these things are accepted is because the larger community (validators&#x2F;miners, folks running nodes, user community) all feel involved enough to accept or reject proposals.<p>You could remove every single founding developer, every incorporated organization, and the Ethereum network and it&#x27;s developers would keep going.  And the value of the token derives from it&#x27;s use on the network, not on those companies turning a profit (and most of them are non-profits).<p>---<p>All of the above, along with numerous other aspects of the new beacon chain, are designed to incentivize decentralization of assets and control, as well as active over passive participation.<p>I think the SEC was quite well aware of the situation, and made the right call about Ethereum.')
