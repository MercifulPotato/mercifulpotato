There are exceptions, such as Die Linke in Germany, and yeah I find them pretty vile, but they&#x27;re mostly irrelevant.  For example, I am British and our mainstream opposition party is nominally &quot;socialist&quot; but in actual fact fundamentally liberal and not at all about the overthrow of capitalism.<p>&gt; As liberal doesn&#x27;t it bother you that ideas which were the cause of so much misery in the world when implemented in communist countries are still being recycled over and over in parliaments of western countries<p>For the aforementioned reasons, where European &quot;socialist&quot; parties are more about making capitalism a little bit less American&#x2F;cutthroat&#x2F;fuck-you-I-got-mine, rather than literal democratic ownership of the means of production, no, not really.  Europe is fundamentally capitalist and liberal.')
