Never worked, once. There were always just one small missing syntax, function, edge case of handling filenames...<p>Once I inherited code written for octave. Did its job, worked like a charm, mostly. The CLI interface was clunky compared to typical shell tools so I had to do some shell wrappers and incantations to automate what I wanted. I don’t know if this is due to the author or to octave but I suspect its focus is on interactive use to the detriment of developing programs.<p>I keep a jupyterlab docker container running at all times on my win10 laptop, with windows-home mounted. Instantly available notebooks from my browser - works like a charm for interactive use.<p>I much prefer python since it lets you move continuously from one-off hack in a notebook cell to a web scale application, parses any weird file, serves web content in 3 lines, etc.')
