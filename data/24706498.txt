Facebook is so ubiquitous and influential that it can be used to sway public opinion. That&#x27;s scary. But isn&#x27;t it also scary the other way? The fact that the content which can be posted there, the content so wide-reaching it can be used to sway public opinion, is controlled by a private company? In my opinion, a communication platform this large should be governed by the same free-speech laws we enjoy offline.')
