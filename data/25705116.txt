Item(by='kortex', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610228623, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25703437, text='&gt; Any portable build system, that already requires EVERY user to have that build system installed, is DoA for being a viable portable build system.<p>I&#x27;ve voted this post down for this in particular. It is truly an absurd criticism, especially when you refute it yourself when you admit bash on Windows is a relatively new phenomenon (and I still struggle with bash env on Windows). If you use a build system, you need a build system installed, full stop. Cmake is pretty easy to bootstrap on a new host with minimal assumptions. Literally just `.&#x2F;bootstrap; make` on basically any &#x27;nix.<p>Cmake is designed to run truly anywhere, with many backing generators, not just make. It doesn&#x27;t even assume a posix shell iirc.<p>Sounds like many of your complaints are with the library authors not writing with portability in mind.')
