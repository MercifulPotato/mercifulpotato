Item(by='eyelidlessness', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605649938, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25119711, text='I was probably 6-7 years into my career before I encountered such a person. It was my first formally titled “software” role, having spent the years prior making software and calling it “websites”, for a mostly brochureware design firm. I had terrible impostor syndrome. But I recognized that a member of my team was simply not up to the task. And was very well liked by the team, so no one had spoken up.<p>But I was gaining responsibility, including (informal at the time) leadership of this individual. And it was a liability to the team, and to me, and ultimately to the person in question. So I spoke up. I felt <i>terrible</i> about it, I feared alienating everyone, and I feared I was putting the person in financial and career risk. But I didn’t see a way to bring them up to even a standard where their presence wouldn’t be a net negative, and I knew I wasn’t up to the challenge of carrying that weight. So I did what was best for the team.<p>The person was ultimately let go. And they did ultimately find a role that was better suited to them. So all is well. In hindsight I don’t think I should have been so torn up about it. It actually sucks to be in over your head, knowing it or not, and it’s possible finding a more fitting role is a better place for growth into more challenging roles.<p>I’m not sure how to conclude this, I’m not sure if there’s even any value sharing it. But I guess for anyone reading who finds themselves in my position (newish, relatively ascendant, full of self doubt but certain that a peer is in the wrong role), I would recommend trusting your gut. And I would say that there’s a lot of room in tech for a lot of people at almost any skill level. Just not always on your team. And that’s okay. They’ll very likely be okay.')
