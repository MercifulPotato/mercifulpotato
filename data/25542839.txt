Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25543033], score=None, time=1608983067, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25542553, text='&gt; This is only done (or even achievable) for quantifiable &#x2F; statements of fact<p>Those are also the only things which can be unambiguously incorrect. So, the problem isn’t that there are incorrect beliefs that are not due to fallacies, it is that there are beliefs which are not knowably correct or incorrect, which is a very different issue. But even there, if we are to discuss them at all and have a discussion about our beliefs that they are correct or not, the same analytical tools allow us to effectively discuss beliefs and our beliefs as to why and whether they are justified while getting beyond rhetorical trickery. This allows us to pinpoint where disagreement lies, and to either converge on belief rationally, or identify disagreement on premises that are not subject to resolution through logic (which, if they are to be resolved, must be resolved through other means.)<p>&gt; That, though, wont help them determine logically and agree on whether something like welfare or military spending is good or bad, and it’s usually those latter questions that matter in such discussions.<p>To the extent that there is a difference in axiomatic preferences, you can’t deal with that through logic. OTOH, you can <i>identify</i> it through logic, and particularly you can pierce the attempts to <i>conceal</i> it that are common rhetorical tools once an actor has determined that that exists and wishes to manipulate another party despite it using the tools of logic.<p>&gt; Logicians can disagree all they want,<p>But they don’t. Literally nothing you say prior to this in your post (and nothing <i>after</i> it except for the the last sentence) is even slightly controversial. And while there may be people that meet the description in your last sentence, you seem to miss the point of what the understanding of logical fallacies and the application of that knowledge are about as badly as the people you are attacking.')
