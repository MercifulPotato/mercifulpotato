My employer has shuttered three out of their fleet of nine gas power stations because they are no longer peak competitive with batteries. And base load designs aren&#x27;t competitive with solar since they are more expensive and will only be turned on during extreme events, like a snow storm, or an extremely hot night.<p>Sucks to be us when we need electricity during an extreme event though.')
