I saw and did a lot!  And peers who did not have that diversity sometimes found out later.<p>While it is good to eventually know, earlier is often, but not always better.<p>What I did was a balance.  And given my son is in meth hell, am doing again with my granddaughter.<p>That balance was:<p>Take them through things I hope they have an interest in.  I had some familiarity and real skill in many of these.  I brought in other people where I felt I was not the right person.<p>Take them through some rando things!  And frankly, I lived vicariously in this way.  Very highly recommended.  They may benefit and so may you!  Sports was one area where I sucked as a kid, but was able to lean and excel with them as an adult.  Neat!  Major bonding and memories happen this way.  It is kind of terrible sometimes too.  (Hold that thought)<p>And finally, take them through things they are interested in, ask for.<p>Now, the terrible experiences?<p>All good, and here is why:<p>Regardless of how we want to shape our kids, they are their own person.  Some are strong in all this.  I was as a kid, and after major conflict with parents, I was very lucky to have others in my life who understood how people work.<p>Self discovery happens when we have experiences.  How we respond, what piques our interest, latent talents, skills, understanding all present themselves during experiences.<p>Nobody knows who they are, until they have opportunity to respond and interact.  The more diverse the  body of opportunity is, the better of a look we have at who we are.<p>This all moved me as a young person, and as a parent too:<p>I see our job as making sure the basics get done.  Competent, well rounded, civic minded, people.  When the basics are there, one has all the tools needed to learn how to learn, get along with others, follow instructions and all that basic, important stuff.<p>And our job is to seek those diverse experiences, observe, discuss all that with kids and tease out the good stuff!  Most importantly, nobody knows what that stuff actually is!  Or maybe we do, to a degree, by inference or various signs.  Fine.  But I assure you it is nowhere near inclusive enough.<p>Some molding and shaping can and should happen, but some of the canvas gets filled in and we can either weave that into the potential person we are raising, or bodge over it, hoping it all works out.<p>Where they are aware, crave things, themselves looking to contribute to maximizing who they are, parents may see themselves shut out, less relevant when their expectations and efforts do not align well with who their kids are.<p>And in some ways, the die is cast.  In other ways it takes shape, and we can plant seeds, and have some influence.<p>My 0.2 having raised very different kids.<p>Good luck.  At a minimum, give a shit, respect who they are, try hard to get them through to quality adults and it is hard to go wrong.  Just know, despite your efforts, they may be very different people than you may expect or hope for.<p>Celebrate that.  People are amazing.  Try to amplify the good.')
