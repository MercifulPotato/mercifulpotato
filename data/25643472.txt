And that property breaks with SSO data, which is not placed in the dynamically allocated buffer - it is placed directly in the object struct (it&#x27;s an optimization after all), which can&#x27;t be moved.<p>EDIT: seems I was wrong, and SSO is allowed for std::string. A similar optimization is illegal for std::vector, though, for the reasons I gave above.')
