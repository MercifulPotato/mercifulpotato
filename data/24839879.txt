The most succinct way I can put it is: component composition. We&#x27;re making a bet on the idea of components as a composable visual entity that can be used for building websites.<p>By putting the abstraction layer, even with templates, at the component level instead of the page level like most builders do, we believe that all of these pain points Alan mentions in the article will be solved. The component you&#x27;re using should be flexible enough to modify to your heart&#x27;s content. And if it isn&#x27;t, you can just find a third-party component to satisfy that. And if that component exist, then you should be able to make your own by just writing some React (or Vue, etc.), not interfacing with some bespoke API.<p>And becase these components compose, there shouldn&#x27;t be a need for a &quot;rescue&quot;. That&#x27;s the vision.')
