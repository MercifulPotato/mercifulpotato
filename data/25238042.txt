He professes that the wish for the eternal return of all events would mark the ultimate affirmation of life:<p>&gt; What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: &#x27;This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence&#x27; ... Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: &#x27;You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine.&#x27; [The Gay Science, §341]</i><p><i>To comprehend eternal recurrence in his thought, and to not merely come to peace with it but to embrace it, requires amor fati, &quot;love of fate&quot;:</i><p><i>&gt; My formula for human greatness is amor fati: that one wants to have nothing different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely to bear the necessary, still less to conceal it—all idealism is mendaciousness before the necessary—but to love it.</i>')
