Also, proportional voting introduces all kinds of unnecessary problems like not having districts and thereby constituents having their votes diluted and not having a specific representative. Which is one things the American system gets right.<p>What we really need is a switch from &quot;first past the post&quot; to approval&#x2F;score&#x2F;range voting, which would dissolve the two party system by eliminating spoilers and thereby making third parties viable.<p>Score&#x2F;range voting is &quot;that thing the Olympics uses&quot;; approval voting is &quot;that thing the Olympics uses if the only possible scores a judge can give are 0 or 1&quot;.<p>As far as I can tell the biggest impediment to this is a lot of people proposing alternative systems that aren&#x27;t as good (e.g. IRV) and then no change is made because proponents of change are divided on which change to make.')
