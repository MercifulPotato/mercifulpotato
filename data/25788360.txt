I do PT every day for 30-45 minutes - I&#x27;ve never missed a day since September. I eat healthy vegan food and sleep as much as I can (though painsomnia makes this hard.)<p>I&#x27;m doing all the right things, but I&#x27;m still sick. If I didn&#x27;t do the right things, I&#x27;d be sicker. I&#x27;m still quite limited, and have to carefully plan things that my able-bodied friends take for granted. That&#x27;s spoon theory.')
