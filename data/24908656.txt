In my experience, the &quot;recommendations&quot; &#x2F; autocompletions provided by the tool are usually very short (probably less than 20 characters on average), and I don&#x27;t use it for terribly complex chunks of code. Where I like it most is in the initialization of common code chunks like `if` and `for` loops, using variables instantiated in nearby preceding lines. It figures out things like `for(customer in customers)` as I&#x27;m writing `for`.')
