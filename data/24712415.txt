The nickel and dime-ing of the venues are part of it but, as you say, many of the work rules are pretty stereotypically outrageous. Not that everything is entirely unreasonable; at convention center scale, things would descend into chaos rapidly if booth staff and others started winging things. But it&#x27;s pretty bad especially in places like NYC.<p>It&#x27;s not universally bad but, as someone else said, organizations become about themselves and their leadership.
