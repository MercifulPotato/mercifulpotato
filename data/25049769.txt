Open source project built with prerelease Xcode 12.2 with Apple Clang 12.0.0, Ninja 1.10.0.git, and CMake 3.16.5. Performance tests are conducted using specific computer systems and reflect the approximate performance of MacBook Pro.<p>I can&#x27;t find any 2020 model of the Macbook Pro with a 1.7Ghz i7 chip so I&#x27;m wondering if they are comparing it with an even older model. Would definitely wait for these to get in the hands of viewers before taking Apple at their word.<p>Edit: Looks like they are comparing with the Intel 8th-gen i7 version of the A2289 model which was released in May this year. There was a small deal made at the time when they released new Macbooks with both 8th-gen and 10th-gen models. Apparently there is not much difference between the 8th-gen and the 10th-gen chips in terms of CPU performance but it&#x27;s still a bit disingenuous of Apple not to compare with the best of their previous models.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.howtogeek.com&#x2F;671586&#x2F;should-you-buy-the-13-inch-macbook-pro-2020&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.howtogeek.com&#x2F;671586&#x2F;should-you-buy-the-13-inch-...</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-hSOuK7qBgM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-hSOuK7qBgM</a>')
