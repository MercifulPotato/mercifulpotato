Offloading that to DB brings some unnecessary work that needs to be handled on the application side otherwise, and tends to o be bad for performance.<p>What do i mean by application generated?\n1. UUID -&gt; Bad for index, but for some use cases it&#x27;s ok.\n2. Sequential UUID -&gt; Good with index, works most of the time.\n3. HiLo (a server gets a chunk of id range from database, and assign that to entities on their own).<p>This allows for more performant applications especially if you are designing somewhat complex data model.')
