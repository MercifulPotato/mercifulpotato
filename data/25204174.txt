Sometimes you have two sets of tasks where the first set determines how much is done in the second. That means you can&#x27;t accurately predict the overall length of time required to finish everything.<p>You could split up the overall progress into two parts, 50% of the bar each. The first part might take a while to finish and when you get to 50% you determine how much is left in the second half, and if it&#x27;s quick, you immediately jump to 100%. On the other hand, if the second half takes really long, now you&#x27;re sitting there waiting what seems like an eternity to do the second half.<p>With some clever design, you could have a smarter progress bar system where each task is weighted and adding it to the overall progress re-computes how long everything is, but now you have a scenario where the progress bar could shrink as you get more accurate about the work ahead.<p>If the time to complete a task is short enough, a lot of these tricks for more accuracy just aren&#x27;t worth it, and often require fundamentally changing the architecture of your underlying processes, making it more work than it&#x27;s worth. Hence, you end up with funny things like finishing at 75%. Though, to be fair, they should at least jump to 100% before finishing. I think that&#x27;s a common bug that comes up, not letting the full bar show first before dismissing.')
