I&#x27;m saying that if you write a piece of OSS software and your plan to monetize it is just hosting it then you&#x27;re going to get eaten by companies who are better at hosting than you. Your valuable asset and your core business is your software not your ops.<p>Next, if the way you plan to monetize your OSS software is by selling a proprietary &quot;enterprise&quot; version but the features that version includes are easy to clone and your licensing costs are high then large companies will just hire people to develop their own in-house version and they might kill your business by open sourcing their version because they don&#x27;t need to sell their in-house version to make it worth the cost.')
