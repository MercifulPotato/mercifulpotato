I tried it myself, it was really easy to get it going. Unfortunately, using it briefly in the notebook I was using I found it pretty buggy, lots of glitches and big slowdowns in the UI. I would also really love to see the option to drop into an interpreter while debugging.<p>Still, can&#x27;t complain too much about an open source project, thanks to the team for all their hard work.')
