But yeah, I&#x27;m currently on a waitlist for the diagnostic testing and am seeing a therapist who specializes in the condition.<p>The most fascinating part of this journey is finally understanding myself better. I&#x27;ve been spending hours every week reading others experiences with ADHD, watching videos (Dr. Russell Barkley is awesome), and in general just figuring out who I am and why I&#x27;m that way. I&#x27;m beginning to understand that habits I&#x27;ve had, such as being &quot;hyper organized&quot; (actually, being utterly dependent on my calendar) were just coping mechanisms needed to get things done. It almost warrants an entire self-evaluation.<p>Your description of the stress response seems plausible. All my life I&#x27;ve oscillated pretty strictly between hyper-anxious and utterly indifferent, the latter probably serving as a coping mechanism. Suddenly now I&#x27;m able to comfortably live in the middle ground. I&#x27;ll do what needs done today, and know that what needs done next week&#x2F;month&#x2F;year will get addressed when it&#x27;s time.<p>Anyway, I really appreciate the feedback and wisdom. Wishing you the best of luck.')
