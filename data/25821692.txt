Facebook has been operating there for over a decade. Unless you are claiming that Facebook is violating French tax law?<p>It&#x27;s not clear to me what you think Facebook should do differently. It&#x27;s sort of sounds to me like you think they should have put government ministers or their relatives on payroll to win favor, but you can&#x27;t mean that? They should have hired a lot of French workers to do jobs that could instead be automated?')
