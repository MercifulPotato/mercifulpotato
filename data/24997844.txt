There isn&#x27;t such a thing as an European court. There&#x27;s are laws&#x2F;agreements set at the European level that are supposed to trickle down to each country and the process is fairly complicated and messy.<p>It&#x27;s a very strong misconception from US readers to think that there is an Europe court, like there is a supreme court or something in the US.')
