Basically, comparisons of programs written in all the other languages against these three become meaningless. And in turn, hurts benchmarksgame as a resource for comparing languages.<p>If I had to write a performant library at work, I too might rely on CPU-specific assembly wrappers in my code. But IMO, such code has no place in a general-purpose cross-language benchmark site.')
