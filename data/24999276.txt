GUIs aren&#x27;t scriptable (or aren&#x27;t easily scriptable) which, for me and the teams I&#x27;ve been in, has basically been a no-go. If we can&#x27;t script it, we can&#x27;t automate it (easily), so we don&#x27;t want to use it. A GUI + (good) CLI is a reasonable compromise. GUI helps us do some things, explore the tools&#x2F;space, and then the CLI for all our automation.<p>&gt; Finally for those pointy hair bosses a CLI only service is hard to sign a check for, since they can&#x27;t really &quot;see it&quot; even if you send a great invoice.<p>Again, weird to me. But also still the embedded space. We buy tools with no GUI (or an awful one, but a decent CLI) all the time.')
