Item(by='hombre_fatal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609884312, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25646517, text='&gt; Who among regular people are really fooled by the difference?<p>Just about everyone I&#x27;ve ever happened to talk about it with. Regular people don&#x27;t know the difference.<p>One of the most classic complaints in 10+ years of having roommates is how our download speed never matches the one on the tin. And most of the time it&#x27;s at least kinda close, but the person complaining doesn&#x27;t realize they&#x27;re off by 8x and will always feel extremely ripped off.<p>The responses to my comment are sadly predictable. We have a hard time admitting when computing is failing and deceiving people just because us power-users can navigate the confusion.<p>I think the opposite assertion of your post is the more realistic one. The only people who want to see the unit of &quot;megabits&quot; are the niche nerds, not my roommate trying to decide which ISP package is going to be good enough for him by estimating how long it would take him to download a 1gb movie. He thinks a 1 megabit connection is going to take 15-20min.')
