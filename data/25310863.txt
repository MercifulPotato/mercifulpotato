This will reduce the rate of development of new antibiotic-resistant bacteria like MRSA.<p>And lab-grown meat should also use fewer hormones, reducing human intake of animal hormones.<p>Lab-produced milk will be another important product.<p>Our species is slowly entering the bio-tech stage.  How will daily life change?<p>I predict engineered mites that clean your home at night, consuming or carrying away every speck of dust.  They will clean furniture, beds, pillows, and mattresses.  By out-competing common dust mites, they will prevent many cases of childhood asthma.<p>Large-scale deployment of mites will collect pollution dust from cities.  They will remove the metal nanoparticles from vehicle brakes that trigger asthma in children who grow up near highways.  They will collect the persistent lead dust that accumulated in cities while leaded gasoline was in use, reducing childhood exposure to lead thereby boosting intelligence and reducing crime for the next generation.  They will remove the microplastics that steadily fall from our synthetic clothing, food packaging, equipment, carpets, and building materials.  The health problems of microplastics are still unknown.  They may be the cause of declining male fertility.<p>Instead of complaining about vaccines and 5G, ignorant people will complain about the pheromones used to control mites.  They&#x27;ll say things like, &quot;I&#x27;m sick because of the pheromones!&quot; as the mites remove pollution that actually would make them sick.<p>Clothing fibers will be grown in a lab.  Cashmere will become nearly as cheap as nylon.  Once you&#x27;ve worn a cashmere outfit, cotton will feel like something a caveman would wear.<p>Washing machines will have different enzyme options for different kinds of materials.  For example, you will buy clothes made with fiber X and use detergent X which dissolves everything except fiber X.  Washers won&#x27;t need heat or mechanical abrasion, so clothes can last longer or be made more cheaply while still lasting long enough.<p>No more brushing, just chew a dental candy once a day.  It has bacteria that consumes plaque &amp; tartar and viruses that kill acid-producing mouth bacteria.<p>Dynamic balancing of intestinal fauna will solve a myriad of undiagnosed chronic health problems.  Also no more farts.  I also predict a pill that will make feces emerge as small smooth fragrance-free pebbles.  Paper consumption will plummet, but that won&#x27;t affect the environment because paper fibers will already be grown in a vat, using sugars made by algae.  Sugar is the feedstock of the world&#x27;s industry.  Algeria becomes the world&#x27;s leading producer of sugar.  Climate change is reversed by the adoption of a sugar-based concrete.<p>Data storage will become DNA-based. All of Google&#x27;s data will fit in a drop of DNA preservative.  Copying data will be cheap.  But reading is slow, with throughput scaling with the number of reader chips.  Data theft is done with mosquito drones that literally suck data juice.  Surveillance is done with &quot;tick&quot; robots that record their sensor data to a DNA sac.<p>Humans will find an ancient DNA-based data archive in a colony of sea creatures in a deep sea trench.  It contains a copy of Wikipedia from a civilization that evolved from squid many millions of years ago.  They reached bio-tech stage and then disappeared completely.  We prepare our own data archive...')
