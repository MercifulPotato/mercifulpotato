A few weeks ago a hinge broke on my bathroom door. The door dropped and was wedged on the floor so it couldn&#x27;t be opened or closed.<p>My wife&#x27;s answer if I wasn&#x27;t here, would have been to call someone and wait a week for them to come, while just dealing with a broken bathroom door. Maybe if you are on your own thats no big deal, but what if it was a exterior door or window?<p>I spend an hour to swap the hinges around (there are three on the door, so swapped the middle for the bottom one which was broken), and voila, good as new until I get a replacement.<p>I still need to get around to ordering a replacement, but that&#x27;s another story....')
