Or if you are coordinating to have a certain group all sell at an exact same time to leave others holding the bag.<p>I suppose it&#x27;s a fine line, but to me this seems much more loosely coordinated. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s been any particular time to sell that has been agreed on, and all the communication is out in a public forum. And the demand for the stock is all based around public knowledge that it was shorted 140% of its market cap. It seems like the difference between insider trading vs if information leaks to the public about a company&#x27;s plans in which case it&#x27;s completely legal to trade based on.')
