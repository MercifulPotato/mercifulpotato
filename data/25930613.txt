My wager would be that dollars that are currently chasing returns in the stock market may shift to wages resulting in those same dollars now trying to buy consumer goods rather than stock. We might not call that inflation in the economy generally as after all stocks would &quot;deflate&quot; during that time but in terms of living day to day it would be.<p>Another potential mechanism would be if unemployment went up high enough due to a minimum wage increase that productivity decreases so much  that the same number to dollars are chasing the results of less workers.<p>That said, with the exception of very rural areas the wage floor for most moderately skilled or unpleasant work is above $15 an hour already, so this will probably not have much of a impact on poverty or inflation.')
