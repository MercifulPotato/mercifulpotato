Item(by='claudiawerner', descendants=None, kids=[25801114], score=None, time=1610625575, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25775274, text='&gt;This sentence assumes that the state, however it is made up, or perhaps the scientific elite or even clergy, is the final arbiter of truth.<p>Not really; it could easily be the case that when such an issue comes to trial, you can present your evidence and arguments. The issue you point out only arises in the case where <i>undue priority</i> is given to the scientific elite or clergy.<p>But I think the sentence isn&#x27;t implying what you think it is. It&#x27;s only highlighting that the goal of seeking truth isn&#x27;t sufficient to justify the principle of free speech. This is for two reasons: it&#x27;s not clear that all speech does lead to truth (even in the long run), and it&#x27;s not clear that all truths should be revealed.<p>The sentence only argues against people who justify free speech on the basis of truth. It does not propose that lies or discussion to find truth should be prohibited. &quot;Free speech is good because it leads to truth&#x2F;revealing the truth is a good in all contexts&quot; does not stand up as an argument - at least according to this refutation of Mill.')
