There is a schedule for smoothing out the remaining differences and essentially they’ll become identical. The history of osteopathy as a branch of medicine is kooky, but a lot of mainstream allopathic medicine was just as kooky when osteopathy started too. Today I have absolutely no issues whether my doctor got a DO or MD and wouldn’t even know without looking at the initials after their name.<p>Chiropractors on the other hand are indeed completely dangerous quacks that routinely give people severe injuries. I know two people that have been disabled by chiropractors manipulating their necks and damaging the tissues and causes stenosis of the veins which has ruined their lives.')
