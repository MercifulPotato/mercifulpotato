The reason the US has a couple hundred major technology companies and Europe doesn&#x27;t is due to its far superior venture capital market, which Europe almost entirely lacks by relative scale and so it has to try to make up for it with government money (which has been a repeated approach in Europe going back decades now, it hasn&#x27;t worked well).')
