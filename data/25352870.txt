They aren&#x27;t standards, they&#x27;re just a bunch of tools that people have to glue together every time they create a new project. Attempting to put them together into a single binary with no dependencies isn&#x27;t creating another standard, it&#x27;s just creating a single tool (one similar to those extant for other modern languages).<p>I realise you may be being slightly facetious to make a [fair] point, but if not: Yarn and NPM are package managers, NPM comes with Node. npx is a command line tool for npm that generally obseletes most need for globally installing packages, it is a small but nice nice recent improvement to the JS ecosystem.<p>LSP is a protocol implemented by plugins for text editors&#x2F;IDEs, it&#x27;s got nothing to do with a specific language, what do you mean by mentioning that?')
