It is off the radar now.<p>Numerous events were supposed to have reshaped the culture on climate change. I remember that discussion happening with Hurricane Katrina.<p>The &quot;racial reckoning&quot; that the USA would supposedly go through this year has mostly disappeared. Same with the last time it happened 2014 (other police misconduct) and in 2005 (Katrina).<p>Currently the thinking is that this pandemic will fundamentally reshape how we work and where. You will notice that companies aren&#x27;t yet giving up their office space and Facebook just bought a new building.<p>We attach way too much significance to the current moment and companies probably have risk departments that realize that.')
