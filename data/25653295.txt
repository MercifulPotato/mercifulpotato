Professional&#x2F;managerial salaries often lead inflation - if you&#x27;re a financier, engineer, consutant, or CEO you&#x27;ve been raking it in over the last decade.  Public servants, service &amp; factory workers, and other commodity jobs lag inflation.<p>My mom was a teacher and said that when she graduated in college (late 60s), teacher salaries were maybe 20-30% below engineer&#x2F;lawyer&#x2F;professor salaries.
