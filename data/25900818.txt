I was able to configure everything but an editor with golang support.\nThe only 32bit editor I found is Sublime Text 3 and that&#x27;s it.\nAtom and VSCode don&#x27;t support 32 bit images of their app anymore :(\n(and no, I didn&#x27;t want to waste time compiling the atom version - there is a guide but looks not updated)<p>Anyway, I will try this OS now! UI looks beautiful.')
