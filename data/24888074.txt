Blockchain is just used now as the &quot;solution&quot; to anyone that wants a ledger.<p>The issue is, in the financial world, it seems distributed ledger refers specifically to blockchains. So now there is no way to talk about a distributed ledger the way you&#x27;d describe a distributed system, that is, a database used as a ledger that is replicated accross site, but which is still owned by a single entity and administrator. And now people say they want a private blockchain, which is basically them saying they just want a normal ledger but they want the database to meet modern database standards of having multi-site replication.')
