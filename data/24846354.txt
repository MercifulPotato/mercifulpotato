It isn&#x27;t about some abstract ideology. It is a very practical concern and this tendency to focus on shiny tech negatively impacted initial response to the current global pandemic.<p>The initial response to the current pandemic was for a lot of groups to do things like work on developing open source ventilators, which I felt was a bad idea and the wrong approach and I expressed my concerns at the time about it. It eventually became clear that people with Covid-19 were poorly served by ventilators.<p>If everyone had remained stuck on &quot;Let&#x27;s just provide ventilators,&quot; this pandemic could have been even worse than it was. Fixation on shiny tech as a medical solution is a very serious problem with practical real world consequences that directly impacts availability of viable treatment for patients.')
