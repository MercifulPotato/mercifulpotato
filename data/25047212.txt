No regulators has yet been prepared to certify a fixed-wing aircraft that is intrinsically unstable, even after decades of proven fly-by-wire development.<p>The 737 Max has different yoke force during pitch-up than predecessor 737 models, such that at higher angles of attack it does not natively require increasing yoke force to continue to pitch up. That doesn&#x27;t mean it would pitch up uncontrollably. MCAS was designed to provide pitch-down force in these high-AoA cases so that yoke forces would be equivalent to 737 NG models and minimal training would be necessary to fly both.')
