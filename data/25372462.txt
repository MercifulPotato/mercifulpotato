Sure we have a million causalities but is it really a bioerror? The problem is that the definition of bioerror is not in the bet itself. I personally think this bet should either be invalid, someone should flip a coin or the one who submitted the bet should pay because he can always word the bet in a way that favors himself. If bioerror is kept ambiguous then he would win through redefining the terms of the bet by a later date.')
