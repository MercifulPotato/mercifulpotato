From what he&#x27;s told me he prefers it a lot over the traditional model specifically because it allows him to have a subscription based model rather than charging per-visit.  That means that his revenues are more consistent but also has the benefit of aligning the patients&#x27; and doctors&#x27; incentives more directly: the doctor makes more money when their patients are healthy than when they are sick so they&#x27;re incentivized to do a better job.<p>It also meshes well with telemedicine and chat-based consultations.  He was offering both of those options to his patients well before covid because it tends to save both doctor and patient a lot of time, and there&#x27;s no concern over &quot;how much do I bill for telemedicine vs a normal visit, and how do I bill insurance for it.&quot;<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Direct_primary_care" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Direct_primary_care</a>')
