I assume this request from Apple’s side originates from on of the legal teams, who are paid to pre-emotive ensure Apple won’t be sued.<p>I have a story that makes me relate from Microsoft&#x2F;Skype. A few months after Microsoft acquired Skype, a JIRA ticket was opened by one of the compliance teams at Microsoft with a simple request. Remove the mooning emoji from Skype [1], as it could be considered offensive in some countries and thus Microsoft could be at risk of being sued.<p>All of Skype erupted. The mooning icon was a symbol of playful cheekiness at Skype and has always been part of the app, and Skype never got sued for over 10 years. There were about 1,200 Skype engineers at the time and that ticket had more than 500 comments from engineers protesting this change. Some made good arguments. Some voiced frustration. Others called that this is a step towards censoring.<p>It didn’t matter. The icon was removed, the ticket closed.<p>In a similar vain, I’ll assume that not everyone at Apple will agree with this “violation”. But it won’t matter, as long as the legal teams says it’s a risk to have apps with such names and icons in Apple’s store.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=mooning+skype" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=mooning+skype</a>')
