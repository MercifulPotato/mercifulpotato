We have rodent problems, too, and our collection of six-towed barn cats do the best they can. Chickens do an amazing job on rodents, BTW. Chicken and duck eggs fresh from the farm are amazing.<p>We had an opossum get into the barn last night and killed some of our ducks. Normally these aren&#x27;t hard to get rid of but this one was very aggressive and I had to shoot it. Earlier in the year it was raccoons and they were able to break into a cage and do an amazing amount of carnage.<p>Bugs got to our pear and apple trees this year before we did so that was a bust.<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to get bees going but mites are killing everything.<p>Oh, back-hoes. Mine is new but even new farm equipment has problems. I cut the end off one of my fingers working on our tractor&#x2F;back-hoe earlier in the year. Which is fun since my day job is software.<p>So, yeah, farming isn&#x27;t for the faint of heart.')
