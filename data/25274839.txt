Why is that, and how do we fix it?<p>Uh... databases ~~suck~~ have terrible usability issues? And so does SQL? Like, really hard core. I took some DB classes at uni and I&#x27;ve learned a lot since too, but no matter how many times some SQL wizard explains to me the &quot;beauty of null,&quot; I just don&#x27;t get it. Why would you want to use three-value logic when you can use two-value logic? Why doesn&#x27;t SQL have custom types? I avoid almost-programming languages like the plague - if I&#x27;m gonna write a Powershell script that&#x27;s longer than 50 lines, I pull out C#; if I&#x27;m gonna write a bash script that&#x27;s longer than 50 lines, I pull out python; and if I&#x27;m gonna write a SQL procedure that longer than 50 lines, I do it in the application.<p>For a job, I had to write a SQL script that, for each row with some conditions true, check the value of a string column, split it into a list of elements by commas, then split each element into pairs by a horizontal line, and return rows that had duplicate keys. Write a query that does this on MSSQL 2012. Then tell me if it works on the top five other SQL vendors. Now do it again, but instead of a string data with char delimiters, it&#x27;s protobuf data.<p>Other old programming languages like C and C++ have had their usability issues. Conflicting implementations, basic functionality missing (std::string::contains). But SQL feels .. perpetually 20 years behind.<p>PS: Use [Kusto Explorer](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;azure&#x2F;data-explorer&#x2F;kusto&#x2F;tools&#x2F;kusto-explorer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;azure&#x2F;data-explorer&#x2F;kusto&#x2F;t...</a>) for an hour and then tell me SQL has lots of nice features again. I have a Pavlovian reaction just to seeing &quot;NOT NULL&quot;')
