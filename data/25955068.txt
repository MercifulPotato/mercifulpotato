Item(by='forgingahead', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611906657, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25954495, text='@dang, I appreciate all your work moderating here, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s pretty thankless at the best of times, but you do keep this place one of the best places on the internet for technical discussion. So thank you for that.<p>That being said, I disagree with the assessment of my comment. Those of us (and there were many) who warned about this escalating when Trump was censored and deplatformed were downvoted and flagged at the time, amidst lots of crowing and victory clapping from people who fully believed the censorship only applied to one individual and was acceptable.<p>We&#x27;ve seen in the past 2 weeks a huge escalation - the British Socialist pages on FB, other left-leaning sites, and now of course watering holes related to WallStreetBets. We&#x27;re fortunate to see this history happen <i>in real time</i>, so hopefully we can course-correct, as our forebears did, but without the longer timeline and through much more horrible circumstances.<p>Facebook used its power unilaterally to shut down yet another group of people. Whether we agree with the opinions of that group or not is not the point - the fact that this can happen, is happening, and is being supported by large swathes of people who should be more aware of where this path leads us, is very worrying.<p>Reminding people that just a few weeks ago, when concern about the Trump censorship was resoundingly dismissed, that that was the same as the censorship of other groups today, is important.<p>I&#x27;ll continue to do that, because we need to deviate from this path we as a collective seem to be walking down.<p>Respectfully,')
