Well, surely anyone can already guess what happened... After just a couple of days, I came upon a long forgotten enemy: eye fatigue. Blurry vision, trouble focusing it, and a light headache.<p>Like many others here, I wish the technology could have advanced faster and been made more accessible for everyone. Without the obstacles it still faces, I&#x27;m sure we would already have color screens with a good refresh rate. C&#x27;est la vie.')
