The people who failed to protect us and the economy, now are going to &quot;sell&quot; us the solution. Where is their part of the accountability of what&#x27;s happening?<p>I have invested in big-tech and bio-pharma companies, so I should be happy, but I am not. I cannot be happy when so many people are closing their small businesses and so many others die because of how the whole situation was handled.<p>I do not have a problem with the masks or the fact that we eventually will all have to take a vaccine.<p>However, the problem starts before that and doesn&#x27;t end with the first vaccine we are going to get:<p>- Phase 1: Governments fail to protect the people during February-March by not banning travel from the infected areas.<p>- Phase 2: People should wear masks, socially distance, close their shops, self-isolate, etc. At the same time medical stuff should overwork and over-risk their lives.<p>- Phase 3: People should take the vaccine. At a low price initially, but big pharma will increase it at some point, (when they are done with the mass beta testing).<p>- Phase 4: People should keep taking the vaccine (at least that&#x27;s the main story for the moment). They might end up having to prove that with a &quot;vaccine passport&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t have problem with Phase 2. I follow the guidelines, since February, before they were guidelines of any Western government. Apparently, Eastern countries have faced similar outbreaks and there was plenty of information on what people there do.<p>I don&#x27;t have a problem with Phase 3, either. I want to do as much to protect myself and others.<p>However, the current narrative is that people who do follow Phase 3 and then 4 (assuming they can take the vaccine but chose not to) are the &quot;bad&quot; people who do not care about the others. And they should be marginalized and even ostracized from the society.<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Where is the accountability for the governments?<p>They, before everyone else, put peoples&#x27; health at risk.<p>But I forgot. They &quot;saved&quot; the economy (only of some big tech companies and, eventually, the big pharma).')
