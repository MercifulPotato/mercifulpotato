Thx to it, I discovered that my default camera app on my phone was sending data to Facebook and many other quite concerning stuff.<p>Internet access should be a permission (like camera, mic, etc.) unfortunately in Android it isn&#x27;t the case and any app can communicate with any server. With NetGuard you can decide which app can access internet or not.')
