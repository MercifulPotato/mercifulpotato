Slow, crashing, not smart enough but, it&#x27;s very good now from my point of view. It can satisfy my needs and, I&#x27;m happy with it.<p>Heck, I&#x27;ve developed my whole Ph.D. with it and it interfaced the tools that I need to use well, was stable and fast. When I pressed a shortcut, it did the thing I expected it to do. The whole experience was, well, <i>uneventful</i>.<p>I&#x27;ve used Subversive IIRC during my Master&#x27;s and it was uneventful too. Didn&#x27;t lose any data, the plugin didn&#x27;t misbehave or had any problem with it. Was using Assembla&#x27;s SVN + Redmine bundle as my remote repository.<p>The git support was similar. I just installed it and it worked. Still works. As I said before, they&#x27;ve nailed the best logical view for git IMHO. IIRC, now it comes bundled with the Eclipse.<p>They may have done some things wrong in the past but, it&#x27;s a solid IDE and I like working with it. I don&#x27;t think they deserve the strong words you choose, but to each his own.<p>Of course, your mileage, taste and views may vary.')
