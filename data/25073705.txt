By make it, I mean they are still in the profession after 3-5 years. We would like to believe that ultimately the bankers are the ones losing out, but the combination of massive income, very high social status and with it great choices for a spouse, interesting and globally impactful work, etc. The list goes on, but you have to break through the lower ranks, which arent really &quot;investment banking&quot; and are more like a job interview for the real work.<p>What I mean to say is that often times we like to convince ourselves that superior roles are actually inferior, but are blind to just how much better those people have it.')
