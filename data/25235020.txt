Less about their work.<p>Here are some questions the author asks in interviews to get at the quality of shit-givingness:<p>- What’s the hardest you’ve ever worked on something?<p>- How many hours were you working a week?<p>- Why did you work so hard? Why did you care?<p>- When were you the most unmotivated in your life?<p>- What’s the thing you’re the most proud of?<p>- Do you think it was worth it?<p>These are pretty good questions to ask in general, except the one about hours working. Not only will the answer be easy to misinterpret, but asking the question gives the impression that you might care more about hours worked than results. As someone who gives a shit, that would turn me off.')
