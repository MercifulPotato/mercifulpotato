Item(by='azangru', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610921236, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25813836, text='&gt; Because in 10 years nothing you built today that depends on JS for the content will be available, visible, or archived anywhere on the web.<p>What? That doesn&#x27;t even make sense. Javascript and browser vendors are going out of their way to be backwards compatible (to the point of rejecting the perfect Array.prototype.flatten in favor of the ungrammatical Array.prototype.flat so as not to break websites that depend on MooTools). Is the author implying that in 10 years the javascript of today will no longer be executable by the browsers? Why?')
