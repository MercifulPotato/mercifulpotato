That conversation is not one that’s going to come to a conclusion on this website because outside of certain scenarios where you might be forced to choose reference counting or garbage collection, in general, it’s just a tradeoff.<p>Reference counting is generally slower and less accurate, garbage collection uses more memory and has poorer latency guarantees. ¯\\_(ツ)_&#x2F;¯<p>&gt; If you’re finding that as a fault of Java, you’ve entirely missed the idea of the language.<p>I don’t understand what you mean by that. Java is a product of the 90s and “everything is a class, classes encapsulate mutable state, subtype polymorphism” fell out of that. It was a bit of a fad, and the fad got baked into the language.')
