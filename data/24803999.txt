That is, their newer successes are not a result of disproportionate talent or hard work that would make those successes deserved. Instead it&#x27;s just another big company that has big capital. And all a big company with big capital needs to do is keep an eye on early successes elsewhere to get into the game, throw lots of resources at the problem, leverage their big mature sales and marketing channels, and see the Dollars roll in. This is not what a healthy market is meant to reward.')
