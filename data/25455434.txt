However, there is a severe error that popped up on a popular discussion forum of experts for holes for men.<p>As stated here, the German DIN (like the ISO but far cooler) mandates that manhole covers on the street need to be of durability class D400 (for 40 metric tons) instead of D125 (for 12.5 tons). This oversight should be fixed immediately to ensure the playability of this game.')
