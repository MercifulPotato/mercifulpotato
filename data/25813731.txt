For a 1560 rated bot:<p><pre><code>    1. It brings out the queen early attacking the f7 pawn when black plays sicilian.\n    2. So far has gone king&#x27;s indian almost every time against d4 (e.g. catalan) and then has failed to challenge the center, instead going for a king side attack (exchanging bishop for knight to try to open the B file.\n    3. It sometimes drops its queen in complex exchanges and hidden attacks.\n    4. It sometimes drops pieces in complex exchanges (can&#x27;t count how many pieces are covering a square).\n    5. It will exploit mistakes that *I can see*, unlike stockfish level 7+ where it will take you down an insane convoluted path to get you into such a bind to destroy your position (I&#x27;ve played GMs who ?can&#x27;t?&#x2F;don&#x27;t do in this blitz).\n    6. Its attacks are shallow and lack depth, easily defended.\n    7. It sometimes moves a single piece too many times when it should be trying to advance its positional game (e.g. queen&#x2F;knight), basically has very little positional play.\n    8. It sometimes pushes pawns aggresively to its detriment.\n    9. Won&#x27;t resign in losing positions (*lol*).\n       a. Will play to the bitter end to try to get you to stalemate.\n</code></pre>\nCouple things that could make it more human:<p><pre><code>    1. Moves fast! I think it actually moves too fast, there needs to be a better delay factor added in depending on rating. If we could make it think for a longer than usual amount of time after it finishes development, in complex positions, or when it&#x27;s close to mate or about to lose an exchange. Also make it speed up when its getting low on time.\n    2. Make it randomly rage quit in a losing position like an asshole instead of resigning so you have to wait for the quit&#x2F;disconnect detection and then claim victory&#x2F;draw countdown (I jest, I jest, but if we do this, please make it some sort of setting).</code></pre>')
