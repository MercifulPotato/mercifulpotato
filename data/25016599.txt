Either a pro-drug-war politician is already using this as a dog whistle and does not want it exposed (else why not be open about your stance on minorities), or he isn&#x27;t using it as a dog whistle but still does not want this connection made.<p><i>Voters</i> are the ones who need to make the connection. The politicians will follow.<p>Many on the left, particularly on social media, are quick to claim that supporting a particular policy is racist if the policy itself is racist, regardless of the reason an individual supports the policy.<p>My own personal view is that the intent of this definition and behavior is not to &#x27;solve racism&#x27; but to stifle discussion and influence voters. The fact that this definition is seldom, if ever, applied to the war on drugs is confirmation of my view.<p>What I see instead, and is present in some of these threads, are offers of solutions that are ill-defined, untried, and even if effective do not have clear timelines for actually helping people; and very clearly will do nothing to help in the short term. In contrast, solutions that have worked in other places, have immediate effects, and are generally accepted as good ideas are vilified as harmful to minorities with no evidence provided.')
