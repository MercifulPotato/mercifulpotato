The memory is now getting big enough for production geometry, but we still need out of core texture support.<p>We are shipping some (open source) out of core texture loading with OptiX now, lead by Mark Leone. Definitely yes, the idea is that after a few re-launches you’ll have all the mipmap texture tiles you need resident and you can render many samples without a stall.<p>To be honest I’m not sure whether we’re using mmap for this. (I’ve had my head buried in curves.) Mark is calling the high level concept “cooperative paging”, meaning the GPU and CPU work together to handle page faults and fill new load requests. The user can decide &#x2F; define what the page fault behavior is, and whether &amp; how they might want to fill the requests. They’re currently working on cache eviction, which will be a big leap when it arrives.<p>This basic technique <i>could</i> be used in Chris’ Motunui to fill geometry as well - you could use standin boxes for the instances and a ray hit would fault &amp; load the internal geometry. So, obviously, that’s pretty complicated and not necessarily guaranteed to fit in memory, but when it worked it could save a ton of time. I’m thinking about ways to blend what Chris did with something like this to try and get the advantages of both.')
