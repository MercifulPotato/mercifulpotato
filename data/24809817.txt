A model that does not include a confounding variable (of which there are many) cannot give any conclusion about that variable - at most a hypotheses.<p>I&#x27;ve spent some time looking at the models, all of them fail - some spectacularly so (those that inform policy much more so, unfortunately). To the point of being useless, I might say, because their stated assumptions usually apply almost everywhere, but their prediction (and back testing results) match only a small sample (e.g. a few specific countries or cities).')
