For rockets without the heat shielding, you need to do a re-entry burn just to slow down. Interestingly enough, unlike the Falcon 9, Rocket Lab&#x27;s Electron uses carbon fiber wihch doesn&#x27;t actually need a heat shield. The atmosphere can help slow the vehicle down a lot, but the Earth&#x27;s higher gravity has a big impact on the rocket equation.<p>I think China will master Falcon 9 level re-usability in the late-2020s. Given SpaceX&#x27;s development speed so far, by that point the launch market will have moved on Starship super-heavy lift vehicles with full re-usability of both stages.<p>China is blocked from competing in the international launch vehicle market (due to concerns over Chinese military espionage and tech transfer) so the benefit of having a commercially competitive rocket is not actually there. Unlike SpaceX, China can&#x27;t tap into the demand for 100 launches per year on the global market.<p>Perhaps we&#x27;ll see a People Liberation Army version of Starlink being launched in 2030, but the pocketbook of the government of China isn&#x27;t infinite. They are already starting to struggle to provide the aged pension to their people -- culminating in the current push to move the women&#x27;s retirement age back 10+ years.<p>I can&#x27;t see China developing a competitive re-usable launcher for anything other than military payloads. Especially given a United States that will sanction any company linked to the Chinese military (just like they sanctioned SMIC when it appeared to be catching up while being a People&#x27;s Liberation Army supplier).')
