Installed with DOSBox, worked fine; when opened in DOSBox-X, graphics were all screwed up, and all the settings were set upon install, so I would have had to reinstall anyways. This was more than a year ago, so maybe it wouldn&#x27;t happen today given how many new releases they have, but I don&#x27;t feel like testing it out.<p>Still, great project, and I prefer it over the OG DOSBox.')
