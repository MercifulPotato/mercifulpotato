My Samsung 4k LCD has a feature I only a few days ago realized I had jacked up to &quot;Fastest&quot; as soon as I got it (from its default of &quot;Standard&quot;). It apparently does something wonky with the backlight? (And without it I think the published refresh rate is nowhere near accurate, as that&#x27;s like the maximum if you are willing to accept the ramifications of this strobing?)')
