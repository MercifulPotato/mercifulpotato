I still pay off a (small 10k) debt from university. It took me years to get into the industry, working for very little pay. All the while I didn&#x27;t do anything for my pension. Now I have a good income, but income alone is not enough to buy a house near the city. Having a migration background in Germany might not have helped.<p>Do you really think engineers, bankers, administration, lawyers, teachers and real estate agents have it worse?<p>In an industry that&#x27;s created to destroy jobs, why would I work for less?')
