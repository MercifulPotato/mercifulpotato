I think we dismiss &quot;small data&quot; too quickly. I see this all the time here on HN and in other places, where someone&#x27;s experience will be dismissed as &quot;just anecdotes&quot;, as if an anecdote contains no useful information at all. Statistical summaries <i>by definition</i> lose information--it can be incredibly valuable to continuously ask ourselves over time &quot;What information is important to retain in our models&#x2F;statistics, and what information is okay to discard?&quot; To me, it seems obvious when I say it--well duh that&#x27;s the scientific method--but it&#x27;s so easy to become attached to our models and statistics and use those to dismiss important information as noise.')
