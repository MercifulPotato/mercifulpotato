Porting Rust might not be a simple undertaking, either.<p>&gt; Zig also has the same issue with LLVM until the language is fully bootstraped and the original LLVM based compiler no longer part of the build process.<p>Yes, but that&#x27;s expected to happen before 1.0.<p>&gt; However, packaging a C and C++ compiler alongside for the ride doesn&#x27;t make it that much simpler.<p>C isn&#x27;t an issue at all; C++ is. I&#x27;m pretty sure it could be made optional.')
