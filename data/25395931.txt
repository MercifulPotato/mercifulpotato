And by sure I mean, there is enough data to prove this statement to be true? How?<p>Reasonably sure.  Even looking at the low death rate 25-34 population, deaths have been about 4 per 100,000 population with only 15% infected so far; a natural trek to herd immunity will presumably kill 6-12 more per 100k.  There will be even greater amounts of morbidity and hospitalization, too, than outright death.<p>Compare to ~22000 dosed in trials; two of the vaccinated died from causes that don&#x27;t look related to the vaccine, and four of the placebo group died.  This mostly lets us exclude a high death rate from the vaccine.  Several in the placebo group ended up hospitalized from severe COVID; none in the vaccine group ended up hospitalized from COVID or vaccine related side effects.<p>Indeed, the entire judgment call made in emergency use authorization is exactly that: the benefits of the vaccines appear to conclusively outweigh the risks.<p>&gt; This makes, sense, but is &quot;collective protection&quot; a right now thing? Or is collective protection the goal of a vaccination program over the course of 5-10 years?<p>It&#x27;s a &quot;right now&quot; thing.  We can get all the way there in 6 months, and get significant benefit in 3 months.  To be clear, the former doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;cases knocked down to zero&quot;, but instead infections knocked down by &gt;95%.')
