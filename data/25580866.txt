Item(by='cjblomqvist', descendants=None, kids=[25581008], score=None, time=1609328690, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25580790, text='Your source doesn&#x27;t say the same thing you do (unless I&#x27;m missing something). The article talks about the problems at care homes. Aside from a few hospitals, we never maxed our ICU beds (AFAIK anyway). The &quot;implicit&quot; makes it really hard to argue without any source. Most likely you&#x27;re referring to what I specifically brought up in my original comment. Some were not treated properly and sent home because of hysteria - not because of a national health care &quot;collapse&quot;.<p>Did care homes in Sweden (which are separately organized from the rest of the health care system) manage COVID well? Probably not.\nDid some people panic and made they stupid decisions? Probably.<p>Did we dismantle some temporary ICUs without using them? Yes.\nDid we reach max ICU bed capacity in any region (the Swedish health care system is organized by regions)? Not that I know. \nDid we have a national health care collapse? Not as far as I can see. If we did, please provide sources.')
