I use Windows 10 on a PC I built and it&#x27;s fine.<p>I paid $200 for a Windows 10 pro license because I needed to run a Windows application in a virtual machine.  I was very unsatisfied with my purchase.  I would describe Windows as “a nightmare”. Here are my top three complaints about Windows.<p>* There are advertisements built into the operating system.<p>* The operating system often restarts itself, without the users permission.  It will restart itself even if a user launched application is running.<p>* There is still no central repository for useful applications.  Managing and keeping all software updated takes a lot of manual work.')
