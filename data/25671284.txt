Item(by='neartheplain', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610029274, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25668150, text='Let&#x27;s not make light of terrorists who have killed people.<p>Many remain unaware that four city blocks of Seattle were occupied for a month by gunmen with assault rifles [0][1][2], or that those self-identified antifa gunmen shot and killed an unarmed black kid [3], or that antifa Twitter celebrated the killing and their shooter&#x27;s &quot;beautiful shot placement&quot; [4] until it turned out they&#x27;d murdered a black kid instead of imaginary white supremacists. Note the now-deleted tweet&#x27;s many likes and retweets.<p>The murdered kid&#x27;s name was Antonio Mays Jr., and despite or perhaps because of [5] the many antifa eyewitnesses to the shooting, his killer remains at large.<p>That&#x27;s just CHAZ&#x2F;CHOP. I haven&#x27;t even mentioned Michael Reinoehl, Matthew Dolloff, Jesse Taggart, and others. For some reason these incidents rapidly slipped from public view, or were never a focus at all. Fortunately the relevant livestreams, tweets, and video clips have all been archived.<p>Many of the original sources for the CHAZ&#x2F;CHOP shootings are now unavailable. I encourage everyone to use tools like youtube-dl and archive-dot-is. Even if a clip, tweet, or stream doesn&#x27;t seem to embarrass its owner or violate a platform&#x27;s TOS, it may always get deleted for some other reason. If you want to refer to it later, always archive.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foxbusiness.com&#x2F;money&#x2F;chop-shooting-seattle-defund-police" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foxbusiness.com&#x2F;money&#x2F;chop-shooting-seattle-defu...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seattletimes.com&#x2F;seattle-news&#x2F;after-early-morning-shooting-in-chop-occupied-area-returns-to-its-new-normal&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seattletimes.com&#x2F;seattle-news&#x2F;after-early-mornin...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.the-sun.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;980814&#x2F;heavily-armed-leftist-gun-club-seattle-chaz&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.the-sun.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;980814&#x2F;heavily-armed-leftist-gu...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;29&#x2F;us&#x2F;seattle-protests-CHOP-CHAZ-autonomous-zone.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;29&#x2F;us&#x2F;seattle-protests-CHOP-...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;D0fZs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;D0fZs</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;lporiginalg&#x2F;status&#x2F;1282703884721348609" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;lporiginalg&#x2F;status&#x2F;1282703884721348609</a>')
