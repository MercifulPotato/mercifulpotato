We also had a significant shortage of hand sanitizer and soap, and e.g. New York&#x27;s slave laborers were put to work making hand sanitizer, but there was no &quot;hand sanitizer doesn&#x27;t work&quot; PSA, even though hospitals needed it badly too.<p>The fact that they said untruthful information about masks was awful, and it certainly deserves a proper postmortem-in-the-court-of-public-opinion, but I don&#x27;t <i>think</i> it was deliberate lying.')
