Their relative success seems to lend credence to the overall vision of the semantic web and its supporting technologies.  For example, are there really more than surface syntactical differences between SPARQL and Cypher?<p>Even though it was over-hyped, I like the semantic web because it supports a conception for the future that includes something other than neural network black-boxes.  However, whether the ideas deliver remains to be seen.<p>If anyone is looking for an introduction, then I think the Linked Data book from Manning is worth mentioning--it might be a little dated at this point.  The author provides a coherent introduction and helps, especially, in cutting through the confusing proliferation of acronyms that characterizes this field.  As others have mentioned, reliable software is a major stumbling block.  It&#x27;s especially unfortunate that there isn&#x27;t better browser support, of RDFa for example.')
