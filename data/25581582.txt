There exists a set of files, or nodes, contained in GIT repositories, that sum up to a personal wiki, of sorts. These files, in the case of <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;anagora.org" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;anagora.org</a>, are copied from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;flancian&#x2F;agora" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;flancian&#x2F;agora</a><p>2. In those files are links in a specified format to other such wikis.<p>3. A server (Agora Server) renders a the files in a manner far more useful for interaction.  <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;anagora.org" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;anagora.org</a> is running said server.   The actual data being served is (for performance reasons, I assume) a copy of the reference wiki it can them push changes back up to.<p>4. The server also has a daemon that is polling other such sites (presumably the source, not the other servers) looking for more content to add to its repository.<p>Question: <i>Do those other sources get added back to the primary repository?</i><p>5. If we want to add our own, we clone a starter kit, and host our own server. It could be local, or on the internet. The data needs to be public, the server itself doesn&#x27;t.  If this is true, this makes hosting things much easier, as there is no need to maintain a server on the internet, just have a valid GITHUB or other such account in good standing, and valid email for the signup process.<p>Do I have that right?')
