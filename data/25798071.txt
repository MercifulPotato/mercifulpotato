For remote jobs you&#x27;re competing against a ton of professionals that already have experience and moved away for covid. And I doubt data science is the right field you should be targeting, as it&#x27;s mainly a game for people with PhD&#x27;s and tough for entry level. Web dev or mobile app dev would be way easier to crack. If you have the drive I&#x27;d be making as many apps or web apps as possible to build out your portfolio then there will always be a startup that&#x27;d be happy to hire you.')
