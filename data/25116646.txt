I&#x27;ve worked on a bunch of things built this way... as an overall approach it will certainly minimize the chance that you waste time building something totally un-sellable.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;ve seen organizations using this &quot;BVP&quot; approach for absolutely everything they build, which I&#x27;ve come to view as a sort of product development antipattern, reflecting some lack of ambition&#x2F;conviction&#x2F;vision at the top. It&#x27;s like the polar opposite of a moonshot: building things in such tiny increments that you can only ever achieve a local maxima, because the higher summit requires a bigger leap.')
