Arguably, paying for access to the Internet is also &quot;doing business&quot;. Maybe paying for access to public utilities is &quot;doing business&quot; as well (if I don&#x27;t pay my electric bill, I won&#x27;t have electricity).<p>What option do I have then â€” go to the town square and voice my views?
