They arrested the yellow vest folks. The entire leadership have been imprisoned.<p>If you look back as well. Sarkozy barely won. Hollande barely won. Then after martial law had been declared and general freedoms of the French people have been removed Macron won convincingly? Dominated his opponent.<p>Then when covid came around he 100% banned protests. They have issued 500,000+ tickets for &quot;non-essential movement outside&quot; and it&#x27;s currently not recorded how many arrests have occurred under the name of covid 19.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aljazeera.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;12&#x2F;clashes-and-arrests-as-yellow-vest-protests-return-in-france&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aljazeera.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;12&#x2F;clashes-and-arrest...</a><p>The movement is dead because France&#x27;s martial law has banned protests.<p>This amnesty article doesn&#x27;t go far enough. Coverage of France&#x27;s martial law that has been ongoing for 5+ years and practical banning of basic human rights is quite scant.')
