Frankly, I&#x27;m very wary of recommending it to anyone. The job market seems to not be growing (if not shrinking, as Spark-based projects are largely moving to Python now) and the community is focused on complex and esoteric ideas for solving mundane problems (&quot;purity&quot; over practicality). You&#x27;re likely to work with people like that on your next Scala job. It&#x27;s great if you dig it, but sucks if you just want a boring language that allows for getting things done.')
