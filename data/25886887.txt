If necessary, I can look at the disassembled code, because it&#x27;s reasonably feasible to map assembly language to C++ constructs.<p>Python code generally doesn&#x27;t crash that way, it&#x27;s true (unless it interfaces with C modules). But when errors occur, I have to debug them on a Python level. Dropping down the stack is nearly hopeless because the Python interpreter is just too thick an abstraction layer between assembly language and the Python code.<p>And I find myself having similar problems with Swift, for all its elegance. The mapping into assembly language is just considerably more complex than in C++, so you lose a low level debugging tool.')
