Windows 10 looks and feels like an entire commercial. Although, I&#x27;d imagine this wouldn&#x27;t be the case for the professional edition. Of course, there are plenty of (high quality) apps that I miss on Ubuntu that do exist on Windows. I guess having a MacOS, you get the best out of both worlds... But I&#x27;d hate being stuck to Apple&#x27;s ecosystem.')
