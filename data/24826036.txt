Most of my neighbours are leasing at least portions of their land out to a farmer, who then in turn subcontracts most work and just manages things.<p>In that model there is almost no incentive structure for soil maintenance, environmental stewardship, diversification, etc.<p>Most landowners here aren&#x27;t even leasing it for the revenue, which is pretty peanuts for cash cropping on smaller plots, but for the indirect benefit of being able to claim farm tax rate instead of regular residential tax rates.<p>For many years my vineyard, garden, etc. suffered from herbicide drift from next door -- but there was not a single contact I could go to to talk about this, everyone just points the finger, or you can&#x27;t find the party involved. Responsibility too distributed, etc.')
