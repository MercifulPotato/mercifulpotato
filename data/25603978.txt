This is wrong approach.<p>The FSM is not a code but a model and the code is just an implementation of the model.<p>What you want to do is to recreate the process of modelling (or modify existing model) and then recreate the code based on that.<p>What I do is to have an implementation-agnostic model of the FSM that gets translated to code. That code is never modified, it only is called from external modules or calls external modules.<p>There are some cases where I would just hardcode the FSM without the model. Those cases are when I do not expect the state machine to change because it follows from the fundamental description of the problem. For example, I might have some communication protocol and the state machine describes the state of that communication channel. If I do my job well the state machine maps 1:1 to the problem and will never need to change even as the rest of the application changes.')
