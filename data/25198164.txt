If the management layer around you did not structure their communication with you around these, that was their shortcoming perhaps.<p>You could certainly have compensated by putting these in place yourself, which would have shown some initiative and leadership.<p>For example, you could conceptually divide your project into various stages, with milestones in each, then communicate any road-blocks that prevented you  moving to the next stage.<p>You could also create a KPI for your model (or a few KPIs), like a % success-rate for a classifier against some kind of benchmark data-set. Even non-technical people can understand &quot;we&#x27;re at 60% now, and we aim to get to 95% by the end of the project&quot;.<p>Ultimately, people do not care about the unusual edge-case or bug that you&#x27;re dealing with - they care about the output. Perhaps structure your communication to focus on outputs, not the minutia of technical steps along the way.')
