Those are <i>awful</i> odds, and most survivers of falls from that height probably aren&#x27;t landing on the sort of pavement you might expect to be surrounding a high-rise building.  And how many of the survivers ever walk again?  How many can even feed themselves again?<p>Seriously, 50% is worse than even russian roulette, a &#x27;game&#x27; generally recognized as suicidal.')
