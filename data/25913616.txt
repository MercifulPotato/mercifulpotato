The DNA only has to take a causal role in <i>modulating</i> those existing dynamics. It doesn’t have to orchestrate every minuscule interaction, only coordinate things to the extent that the intrinsic dynamics come together to form something with an emergent complexity. It’s like calling into a complex library with a line or two of python. Yes, the top level is compact, but only because it’s built on top of a base of complexity.')
