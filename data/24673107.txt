Maintaining a constant velocity requires relatively little power, and with regenerative braking some energy may be recovered (the primary reason for the Li-Ion cells between the power source and the motor).<p>I don&#x27;t have any numbers on this, high-power electronics was never my field. But I wouldn&#x27;t at all be surprised if cruising power was less than 10% of max engine power.')
