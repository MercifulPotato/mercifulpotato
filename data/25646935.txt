Needless to say, I quit cold turkey.<p>That was over two years ago. I find that I don&#x27;t miss caffeine at all. I am a slow caffeine metabolizer, so I couldn&#x27;t drink too much anyway without getting jitters. I never actually felt awake or focused on caffeine.<p>Now that I&#x27;m on decaf coffee, I can drink as much as I want purely because I enjoy it. It was difficult to find high-quality decaf whole bean coffee, but thankfully I identified a couple. For a long time I used Slow Motion from Counter Culture. Lately I switched to Swings in the DC area because 1) they have at least three excellent decaf roasts and 2) I live a few minutes walk from them.')
