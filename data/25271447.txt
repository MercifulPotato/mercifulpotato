Physical books are reserved for either things that either can&#x27;t be read as well in ebook form (House of Leaves, S.), comics (someday we&#x27;ll get color eink), things picked up third hand for a dollar, or books I&#x27;d like to be able to lend. My family rejoiced when we no one longer packed a suitcase of just books for the beach.<p>But there&#x27;s still something about bookstores, and the ability to browse that is wholely unique. The experience on Amazon, or where ever else just isn&#x27;t the same. It&#x27;s too overwhelming, and the tiny pictures and titles aren&#x27;t as good for quick browsing. If I know what I want the experience of a book store is much worse.')
