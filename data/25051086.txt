Item(by='hackstack', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605038715, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25049844, text='FWIW there are third-party software options for the Touch Bar such as MTMR (my touch bar, my rules), which at least allows you to activate the haptic feedback in the trackpad when touch bar buttons are pressed. I found that it helped dramatically with accidental touch bar presses.<p>MTMR also solves the other main problem with the Touch Bar which is that it hides brightness and volume controls behind a tap (so you can&#x27;t, for example, instantly mash &quot;volume down&quot; when you find it is unexpectedly loud.) With MTMR (and others I believe) you can make multi-touch gestures on the bar to adjust volume and brightness swiftly.<p>All that said, I&#x27;m not convinced that the touch bar adds enough value to justify its cost. If your day-to-day computer use includes tasks it is good it, maybe. As a developer, probably not.<p>Just my $0.02 as a touchbar-skeptic-cum-macbook-owner.')
