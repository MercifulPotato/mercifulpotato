You’re not banking the underbanked who by definition don’t have money if you’re saddling them with $10 tx fees. If they had money they wouldn’t be under banked would they? I’ve spent a lot of time exploring this “underbanked” area, and in my opinion it doesn’t really exist.<p>The issue isn’t that they don’t have access to banking it’s that they don’t have any money to put into the account. That&#x27;s a social issue not an infrastructure issue.')
