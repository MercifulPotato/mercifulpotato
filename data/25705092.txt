It&#x27;s that if they can censor a very power man, then there is no bounds on what they can and will do for less powerful people.<p>For social networks, the root of the problem is their quasi-monopoly status. We wouldn&#x27;t accept Comcast deplatforming people.<p>It&#x27;s a bad idea to set policy based on the worst examples. I can&#x27;t see any harm in kicking Trump off twitter.  He was basically begging for it.  But should Trump&#x27;s extreme actions be used to justify banning BLM protests because they sometimes turn violent?  How about Hong Kong demonstrations? Didn&#x27;t they storm a legislature? How about WSJ? They print people who believe in election fraud.<p>It&#x27;s like using 9-11 to set all terrorism policy.<p>IMO--these actions should be an &quot;emergency only&quot; policy rather than Big Tech deciding it needs to police what we all hear and think. It&#x27;s really not clear which its going to be.')
