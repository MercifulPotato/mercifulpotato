Apparently, since its marketshare has dwindled to 3%, many sites either just don&#x27;t support it, or their fraud detection algorithms view it as suspicious. E.g.: a bank I use has a website that supports Edge, but not FF; I tried to buy something through Amazon with FF a few months ago, and the account immediately got locked for &quot;suspicious activity.&quot; Maybe I would have had similar troubles using Chrome on the iPhone, but I doubt it.<p>Imagine how useless an alternative browser more obscure than FF would be; you wouldn&#x27;t be able to buy or sell anything, do any banking, and even basic, passive web browsing would result in never-ending CAPTCHAs on many sites.')
