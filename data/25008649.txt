I would have easily spent more buying games individually than the cost of Game Pass.   Granted, I have the cheaper $5.32&#x2F;mo version, but I&#x27;ll keep it when it&#x27;s $9.99 as well.<p>Plus, I believe MS is offering a version of the service where the xbox is included in the subscription.<p>I understand that most people don&#x27;t like the idea of not keeping games forever, but I have a library of &gt;1,200 games on Steam, &gt;150 on GoG, and 20 or so on Origin.  Most of those games I&#x27;ll never play again, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all that some are only available for a limited time period.  If I end up trying something I love and want to keep, like The Outer Worlds, I buy it.')
