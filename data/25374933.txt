People weilding the truth don&#x27;t need to censor people. They let the facts speak for themselves, and they let free discussion sort things out.<p>Youtube doesn&#x27;t censor Holocaust denial videos, Chinese propaganda, people claiming Hillary is still the rightful winner of the 2016 election, and a host of horrible things. Nor should they. People should be free to discuss what they want, not what a Youtube CEO things they should want.<p>But people complaining about 2020 election fraud is where they draw the line? This really smacks of Orwellianism. &quot;Say Biden is the President, or we&#x27;ll ban you.&quot; What the hell is happening at Youtube?')
