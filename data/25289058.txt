My prediction is, that yes, there will be a slew of new ARM laptop&#x27;s. And even though the technically run ARM chips, it will only be a marketing selling point for new. They might even cram Snapdragon&#x27;s or other mobile device CPU&#x27;s in there, just to be able to put a ARM sticker on a plastic frame with an folding LCD panel and keyboard. They will sell it as beter than Intel, because that is what people who can afford an Apple will tell them is so great about their new laptop. In the long run, due to this, the Windows ecosystem might adapt to embrace ARM as a whole and then we will start to see competetive ARM PC&#x27;s. But it will take a while.')
