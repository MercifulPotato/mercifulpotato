It&#x27;s easy to mess up or use the wrong escape function, so always use prepared statements anywhere you want to pass user defined data.<p>You can usually grep or even use static code analysis to help find where your existing code is using &quot;tainted&quot; data to construct a query.<p>Also, if you use an ORM, you&#x27;ll generally be working at a high enough level where SQL injection is impossible (unless there&#x27;s a bug or design flaw in the ORM); since you won&#x27;t be directly dealing with text queries.')
