Most companies aren&#x27;t Google as you&#x27;ve described it, and in most cases the person on pager duty is the first human examining the incident.<p>&gt; If there was a sleepless night<p>How about if they get woken up each night for an alarm that turns out to not be a big deal? That is the typical on-call experience, getting woken up for 15-30 minutes each night, cortisol from 0 to 100 in the 15 seconds it takes to get into Work Mode.<p>I guess that doesn&#x27;t qualify as &quot;sleepless&quot; but between it and the general stress of not being able to turn the phone on silent, I&#x27;d call it &quot;shit sleep.&quot; Nobody should be subject to it. How can you expect somebody to produce decent software in this condition?')
