Java at the time was positioned to be a core web technology (originally as applets, then as as backend tech via J2EE) and Apache was interested in ensuring the web ecosystem as a whole wasn&#x27;t locked up in proprietary tech. The ASF was rather influential in working with Sun at the time to foster was eventually became a vibrant open source community.<p>I know the ASF isn&#x27;t as trendy these days, but that&#x27;s never really bothered those of us who volunteer. The focus has always been about a stable, open source ecosystem, primarily, but not exclusively for the internet and its underlying infrastructure. The goal is measured in decades.<p>It wasn&#x27;t about being &quot;enterprisey&quot; or anything like that. The ASF as a foundation doesn&#x27;t really care about the language or tech stack. Being a more mature non-profit, many corporations have found it easier to interface with the ASF than many other open source organizations out there, which does lend itself to seeing a lot of enterprisey donations.')
