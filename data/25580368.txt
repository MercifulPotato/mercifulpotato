In short, he had to be &quot;self made.&quot; The so-called Protestant Ethic then prevalent held that man was a sturdy and responsible individual, responsible to himself, his society, and his God. Anybody who could not measure up to that standard could not qualify for public office or even popular respect.&quot;</i><p>Do you think that large segments of US population (just as an example) would believe that or what Martin Luther King jr. said?<p>&gt; <i>We have deluded ourselves into believing the myth that capitalism grew and prospered out of the Protestant ethic of hard work and sacrifice. The fact is that capitalism was built on the exploitation and suffering of black slaves and continues to thrive on the exploitation of the poor â€” both black and white, here and abroad</i><p>More recently work for Christians has become a means of subsistence but it has become a way to express righteousness, as Weber said &quot;Good works may express our devotion to values of care, compassion, or love for our neighbor, to a way of being that emulates the life of Jesus&quot;.<p>So in a way people go to work for reasons other than simply the salary.<p>To imagine a society without work one needs to also address the social and political issues revolving around it, it&#x27;s not simply a technical solution to a technical problem, it&#x27;s much more than that.')
