After which you can have any wlb you want for the rest of your life. You don&#x27;t even have to work at absolute top companies like FAANG to achieve that, although it helps (FAANG &amp; hitting L6+ you have a decent shot even at FatFIRE)<p>This is nearly impossible in Europe except by extreme luck. Enjoy your 40+ years of sub 40h&#x2F;w work ahead of you with slightly longer vacations. While I can have a life long vacation after my 30s. Perhaps even spending it in Europe.')
