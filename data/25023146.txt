RCA is single-ended, generally not isolated, and, no matter how much you gold-plate it and how much money you throw at silly cables, it will couple to 60 Hz AC, AM radio, and pretty much anything else. The effect in a large system isn’t some mystical loss of “airiness” — its obvious horrible garbage. I have personally listened to AM radio by accident — a theater setup had a little nonlinearity somewhere, and AM radio was being pickup up on a microphone wire, inadvertently demodulated, amplified, and it came out quite clearly from the speakers.')
