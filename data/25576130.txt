To illustrate I will give you an even more confounding example from my own stage of Washington. Here, voters passed by referendum a transit proposal to build extensive light rail in the Puget Sound region.<p>The referendum was a very well put together one. It clearly stated the rail projects planned, how they would be funded and the tax implications involved.<p>All in all it was a good government wet dream. Responsible legislation, necessary for our growing traffic issues without bloat and funded with short term debt paid through clear taxes all passed by direct democracy.<p>Two years later another referendum passed by the voters left the transit projects in place but gutted one of the main taxes that was planned to pay for the project. The transit authority is now spending a good deal of time reorienting its project planning to account for this (on top of COVID concerns).<p>Why? Why would this happen? Honestly because voters are fickle, contradictory and inconsistent.')
