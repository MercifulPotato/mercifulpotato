I can think of three reasons:<p>1) They are worried of bad PR from a headline being published that goes: &quot;Apple encourages drug abuse with multiple apps such as Amphetamine&quot;.<p>2) They are worried of a lawsuit if it is found some app contributed to the sell of illegal drugs.<p>3) They are worried of parents complaints being concerned that they&#x27;ve found an app called Amphetamine on their kid&#x27;s device.<p>And in some way, I can agree that as a Company, I&#x27;d rather not take my chances with any of them. Now, the policy being applied inconsistently is another issue. And ya, I wish the world wasn&#x27;t so that a company needed to worry about these, but it isn&#x27;t, so I&#x27;m not sure I can blame Apple that much for it. This also seems like a silly cause for them to champion.')
