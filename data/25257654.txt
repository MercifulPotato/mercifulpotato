In my (pre-COVID) remote team management experience, the bigger problem was that new remote workers didn&#x27;t really understand what working style suited them best. What people thought they wanted and what actually made them happy were two often two different things.<p>For example, infinitely flexible work hours and asynchronous communication sounds like a dream come true to many people, especially introverted engineers. What could be better than doing whatever you want all day, then pulling some tickets out of the queue to work on in your spare time, at your leisure?<p>Unfortunately, reality is often quite different. Most engineering work doesn&#x27;t operate like an assembly line with Jira tickets coming out of the Project Management conveyor belt and into the Engineering Department to be quietly transformed into features. This quickly becomes obvious after cumulative months of delays from ping ponging e-mails back and forth over the course of a week for something that could have been settled with a 1-hour video call. So now the work becomes a mix of flexible work hours punctuated by exhausting synchronous calls where everyone tries to compensate for working in different directions for the past few days.<p>Younger engineers often also struggle with time management. When we had infinitely flexible hours, it was common for younger engineers to trickle in work for the the first part of the week and then scramble to pull late nights into Thursday and Friday to make up for procrastinating all week. I jokingly called it the &quot;college schedule&quot; because we&#x27;ve all been there before. One of the unspoken benefits of fixed, core work hours is that it&#x27;s more likely to help people avoid procrastination cycles. Obviously not a miracle cure, but it&#x27;s a step above free-form schedules.<p>It can be hard to believe, but switching teams in this situation back to pre-determined core working hours can end up making everyone more happy. Few people will tell you that they want fixed working hours up front, but in my experience most people prefer it after trying it both ways. Teams can still be flexible for running errands, picking up kids from school, going to the gym, and so on. But having some core coordination hours will ease key communication issues.<p>The difficult part as a manager is that you&#x27;re not going to be able to convince people that they&#x27;ll actually be better off with 4-6 fixed, overlapping core hours for the team up front. It&#x27;s one of those things you need to experience both ways before you truly understand it.')
