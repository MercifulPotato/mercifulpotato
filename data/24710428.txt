The vast majority of Kafka publishers&#x27; default settings don&#x27;t even send the data to the broker without waiting for a response (like RabbitMQ without publish confirms); they send the data to a local buffer which is asynchronously flushed periodically&#x2F;volumetrically.<p>When you publish a message to Kafka, it stores the message in a buffer and immediately returns a future that completes once the data is sent to the broker.<p>If you forget to wait on completion of the future that is on you, this behaviour is well documented.')
