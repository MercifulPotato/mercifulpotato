Item(by='harry8', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609656691, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25612187, text='&gt;They are two different things; cscope is a source code browser while YouCompleteMe is for source code completion<p>Not in my experience. YCM does browsing in Vim better than cscope&#x27;s the way i used both. It was an easy switch to make and not look back for me. YCM features seemed to me like a superset of cscope Vim integration. Maybe i was missing something? Jumping to and back to function callers, definitions, variables etc. Clang just seemed to work better. Possibly because it understands C parsing which cscope kinda does some heuristics and hopes for the best? Dunno.<p>But yeah because it parses properly you get tab completion that works too. That isn&#x27;t a negative for mine. Don&#x27;t have to use it, super convenient and fast sometimes when you do.<p>I run Vim in a terminal. Works most places with my vimrc etc that i would edit source code. Includes a mips router, arm phone etc.<p>I used cscope for years. Before that ctags. I consider them obsolete for my uses, but i may have been missing something. Still don&#x27;t know what.')
