IT would be nice to be able to use something like a SQLite file to deliver configuration to this Javascript runtime<p>* There are environments where you cannot install any native code -- like serverless providers that require your software to be pure Java &#x2F; Javascript &#x2F; Python<p>* Cross-language debugging can be very difficult when something goes wrong<p>* Erlang&#x27;s FFI model is either &quot;blocking and fast&quot; (it runs the FFI call inline, and halts preemptive multitasking), or &quot;slow and safe&quot; (dirty NIFs, where it runs FFI calls on a dedicated thread.) This can get really ugly, really quickly.')
