Also, is this a joke: &quot;A non-market socialist system eliminates the inefficiencies and crises traditionally associated with capital accumulation and the profit system in capitalism.&quot; - that&#x27;s on Wikipedia? Seriously?<p>That is the dream version of socialism, not the reality. In reality socialism consistently fails to &quot;eliminate inefficiencies&quot;, rather, it does the opposite.<p>But we shouldn&#x27;t discuss socialism here, that is true.<p>I merely stated what would be the reality under socialism (which has been the case in previous attempts to implement socialism), which is that you would be assigned a job and you would be supposed to gratefully do it for the common good, not for personal gains.<p>I have friends to grow up under socialism. I suspect many Americans simply live to far away from real socialist countries. I guess you could ask Cuban refugees what they think, though.')
