This has a benefit of taming a lot of the political backwash that everyone ends up gargling. And as many have mentioned - this doesn&#x27;t equate to not caring, or being ignorant. Instead, I try trading the quick hit junk food, for material of better lasting value such as research articles, old books, historic writings, etc. (Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m no stoic or saint. It&#x27;s still easy to get dragged into some current affair. But I always feel stressed, and discouraged which encourages me to keep trying to avoid... ;)<p>The funny thing I have found is that there truly is &#x27;nothing new under the Sun.&#x27; For instance, read through some of Frédéric Bastiat&#x27;s stuff from the 1850s: \n<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bastiat.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bastiat.org&#x2F;</a><p>It could have been written this year.<p>Another goal of mine has been, if I get tangled in some current affair, to try and dig into what first principals are being addressed (or ignored) and reflect on my core beliefs in that area (rather than arguing the more surface issue that is being currently discussed). It&#x27;s certain I don&#x27;t have very much correct.<p>And lastly, and most obvious: avoid Teh socialz except where they build up value. Like, I might engage other illustrators through instagram - where we encourage each other, but completely avoid the fomenting and political bickering etc.')
