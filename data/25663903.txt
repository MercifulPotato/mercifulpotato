And at least end-to-end encryption still seems to be on the table, but where are they headed? WhatsApp is so easy to use that most people will just click &quot;Agree&quot; and trade their privacy for convenience.<p>Messaging in the Netherlands almost universally runs on WhatsApp these days. Nobody uses text messages anymore, understandably, but somehow we all ended up on a platform run by Facebook. &quot;Whatsappen&quot; (messaging on Whatsapp) and &quot;appje&quot; (short for WhatsApp message) are even official words now. Need to contact a friend? Send an appje. Need support from a company? Send an appje. Need to send a message to your team at work? Send an appje in the group chat.<p>Has anyone managed to get their contacts to switch to Signal? I can&#x27;t even get tech-savvy people to switch, since they always seem to find some minor annoyance that makes them instantly dismiss the app and go back to WhatsApp.')
