If you care about CPU&#x2F;watt then the M1 looks pretty awesome. If you care maxCPU, the M1 is currently not particularly interesting.<p>That is true today.<p>A very simple way forward for Apple is to follow in the footsteps of AMD with a chiplet design.<p>All modern CPUs so far have been thermally limited, so being really good at CPU&#x2F;watt is a huge advantage. If they can package 2 M2 (next gen) chips in a package for power users and 4 for their Mac Pro, they could be on top of the world in very short order.')
