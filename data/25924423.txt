Make no mistake, that&#x27;s what centralized social media platforms are - private property.<p>Freedom of speech is not protected by the constitution on social media platforms and, frankly, I don&#x27;t want 100% free speech on social media.<p>Take a look at HN.  HN mods do a brilliant job of moderating.  We don&#x27;t have 100% free speech here and the platform is better for it.  The discussions here tend to be much higher quality than on similar platforms like Reddit.  That&#x27;s probably a big reason why you&#x27;re here reading this comment thread.<p><i>However...</i> I&#x27;ve noticed a difference between HN and the likes of Facebook or Twitter.  As far as I can tell, HN mods focus more on <i>how</i> you say something rather than what you say.  If you&#x27;re civil, respectful, and on-topic you&#x27;re seemingly allowed to present just about any idea.<p>Meanwhile, most other social media platforms seem content to let other people be complete pricks to eachother as long as they don&#x27;t present any ideas which the platform have decided are wrong or &quot;dangerous&quot;.<p>I think the HN moderation strategy makes for a much better platform.  I&#x27;d rather talk with a respectful person who I disagree with than a jerk with whome I agree.')
