For distances of around 1000km, they are effectively the fastest way.<p>Imagine two transports:<p>- &quot;fast&quot;, which can be a plane or high speed train. Travel time is around 3h. The plane is faster but with getting in and out of the airport, boarding, etc... it takes almost the same amount of time in the end.<p>- The night train, travel time 9h, let&#x27;s say from 10pm to 7am<p>You want to get to your destination at some time in the morning.<p>With the &quot;fast&quot; transport, you have to get up really early and take the first train&#x2F;flight. Expect a short night, and it may not even be possible without arriving late. The other option is to travel the day before in the evening and book a hotel, not ideal either. In any case, you will spend 3 active hours of your day for travel, or sleep 3 hours less.<p>With the night train, you have a good night sleep (generally, sleeper trains are comfortable) and didn&#x27;t waste the best part of your day. And you may even save a hotel night.<p>Think of it as a traveling hotel.')
