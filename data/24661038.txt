This is especially important with licenses such as GPL, which are full of unclear, secondary regulations. That is why the clear, unambiguous statement of the original Linux author is important.<p>Good software, which is not used due to (unnecessary) legal uncertainties, and thus cannot benefit from the support of potent companies, is of no use to anyone, neither in the short nor the long term. The sooner legal uncertainties are removed, the better. Unfortunately, companies avoid legal disputes, often at all costs; that is why it is so easy to blackmail them with out-of-court, very often unfounded claims from patent and copyright law.<p>When I buy a product, I want it to work well and have good value for money. For this it is irrelevant if the bootloader is locked. If I want to make a system to tinker where I can replace the firmware, I buy a Raspi. The Raspi also benefits from contributions from companies that use Linux in devices where I might not be able to replace the system.')
