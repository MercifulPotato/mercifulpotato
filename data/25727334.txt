Right now this is impossible which makes it impossible to detect if there is a non 50v tolerant hubs between two hubs.<p>- The programming&#x2F;hw implementation for PD and alternate mode would also be non-insane in this model. Currently PD requires stupidly complex state machines, op amps, resistor banks or some autonomous IC to pull off and there are so many screwups because it&#x27;s such an obtuse standard.<p>- Supporting alternate modes, and providing more diagnostic information would be much easier.<p>There should have only been 2 passive cable types - 2.0+PD and USB 3 gen 1 - everything else should require a smart tag on the chip.')
