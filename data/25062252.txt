In Bitwig I can set the DAW to record a set number of bars for each clip and then start looping immediately after recording finishes, which is my perfect workflow for building a track. With Ableton I was not able to do this, and instead I would be required to hit &#x27;stop&#x27; and then manually crop the clip by changing its length.')
