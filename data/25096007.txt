On the plus side, custom emoji are on the roadmap.  On the minus side, they&#x27;re on the &#x27;Later&#x27; column - so you can see where they stack up relative to other work.  Agreed that they would make a <i>massive</i> difference.  We will get there eventually though (or perhaps folks will contribute them sooner :)')
