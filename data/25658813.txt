Personally I try not to be an alarmist about the potential for jobs to be automated away, but how strikingly good this is makes me wonder if we just haven&#x27;t seen AI that is good enough to automate away large parts of the workforce.<p>Seeing the &quot;lovestruck cup of boba&quot; reminded me of an illustration a friend of mine did for a startup a few years back. It would be a lot easier and less time consuming for someone to simply request such an image from an AI assistant. If I were a graphic artist or photographer, this would scare me.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the right answer is here. I have little to no faith in regulators to help society deal with the sweeping negative effects even one new AI-based product looks like it could have on a large swath of the economy. Short of regulation and social safety nets, I wonder if society will eventually step up and hold founders and companies accountable when they cause broad negative economic impacts for their own enrichment.')
