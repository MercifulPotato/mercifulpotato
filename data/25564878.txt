Item(by='lokar', descendants=None, kids=[25564970], score=None, time=1609199907, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25563708, text='Everyone is saying &quot;rounding, duh&quot; but that a bit unfair IMO<p>You should show each integer value second for, ideally, one second (in the case with no display for fractional seconds).  So the question is: exactly what rage of time to cover?  The poster expected that for second N, it would be:<p>[N,N+1)<p>But Apple seems to do:<p>[N-0.5, N+0.5)<p>I think the Apple behavior makes perfect sense when you are displaying the current time (eg like a watch).  It may be a little less obviously correct for the timer case, but still seems fine.  I&#x27;d bet they implemented it for the time of day case and just re-used it for the timer case.')
