Once a company takes a political stance, it doesn&#x27;t matter if what that employee believes or does nor does it matter that said employee might be working for this company because they have a family to feed and don&#x27;t have the luxury of quitting and looking for a new job, the very fact that they work for said company means that they should be treated as persona-non-grata.<p>Make it simple, a company can&#x27;t vote, so a company doesn&#x27;t have a political affiliation (unless of course, it is some kind of lobbying company etc).')
