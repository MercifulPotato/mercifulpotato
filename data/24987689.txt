Dear ImGui is an immediate mode UI library which means that rendering and evaluation happen at the same time. You write for example:<p><i>if (ImGui::Button(&quot;X&quot;)) { &#x2F;&#x2F;pressed handler }</i><p>This renders the button and handles its state at the same time.<p>Qt is a more traditional callback based UI although with their own signal&#x2F;slot system which has nice features like thread safety built in. I last used Qt a while ago though so maybe it works different nowadays.')
