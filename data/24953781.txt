No other environment eager loads a quarter gig of ram to say hello world.<p>This is just hyperbole and you know it. The JVM with the turn of a few knobs is able to accommodate high throughput batch workloads, as well as lower latency workloads, especially with the advent of ZGC and Shenandoah, all while supporting multi-TB heap sizes.<p>Look at what hacks the Discord and Twitch teams had to endure to get around golang&#x27;s workload specific GC for example, and it will show why the JVM is written the way it is.<p>&gt; Weak backend systems are exactly how Fortune 500 systems get breached over and over and over. This was exactly the cause of the Equifax breach and so many others. You should never think that is ok.<p>Those were not JVM-specific issues, and would have happened regardless in any hosting environment or even compiler if we&#x27;re talking about running single binaries.
