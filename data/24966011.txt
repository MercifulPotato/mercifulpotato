Obviously it is not possible to go into details of all in a single post. For one who knows operating system level details, and new to java I thing this is where you start, simply with Thread API. Even if you are using high-level abstraction this is these are basics to know. It is quite popular in the job interviews. And also it is quite common for people uses the Executor framework daily but does not know how to properly stop a thread, or non-daemon threads etc.')
