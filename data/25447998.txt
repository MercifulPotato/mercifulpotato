Give each country 1&#x2F;193th of the world&#x27;s carbon budget? The West would still not be looking pretty under that plan.<p>Or would you prefer that we also account historic emissions? That only seems fair to me (and would put us on track for decades of negative emissions, starting tomorrow, to pay back what we borrowed from the future.)')
