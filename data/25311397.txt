Let&#x27;s see here, the first 10 things on the page are <i>all</i> political, and right-wing or extreme libertarian memes:<p>* A stonetoss comic about the relationship between race and IQ. This was the top post on the page. It was posted by a user with the username &quot;NationalSocialism&quot;.<p>* A comic caricaturing an asexual person who decries Christmas but celbrates a silly celebration of their own, supposed to show hypocrisy<p>* A comic showing a caricature of a fat black woman shouting in a white woman&#x27;s face, and the white woman pushing her away. The title is &quot;At this point if a White woman looks at a Black wrong she is a &quot;karen&quot;&quot;<p>* A post from the &quot;Controlavirus&quot; sub-forum, arguing that lockdowns mean life has lost its color. (One of the only non-caricature comic and reasonable posts I could see on the front page)<p>Even on a bad day, load up the Reddit front page and it&#x27;s nothing like this, even if you were to browse for hours, you wouldn&#x27;t see an endless stream of reductionist memes a 14 year old might find funny.<p>Reddit is a worse version of HN for nuanced and well-argued discussion. Ruqquus seems to be a caricature meme sharing board, and even one which lacks even the pretense of a varied userbase. At least Reddit pretends. When I visit a site that&#x27;s supposed to be better than Voat, I don&#x27;t expect to be greeted with the exact same thing but with more memes and less news sources.')
