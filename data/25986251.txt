This is a really strange situation. Unless these chips are really hard to manufacture for some reason or there’s some kind of component shortage, mobile manufacturers pump out billions of devices annually (meaning so does the supply chain pumping out the CPU&#x2F;GPU SoCs). Maybe a node issue, but lasting multiple node sizes? If it’s crypto and persisted so long, then wouldn’t they have ramped up their pipelines? Is it that sales aren’t as good as they need them to be and artificial scarcity let’s them drive MSRP higher so that their revenues are a bit boosted? Maybe the flagships are way too complicated and expensive to manufacture with sales too few so that it basically amounts to nothing more than an expensive PR campaign? Maybe the real focus is primarily on cloud&#x2F;mobile offerings? I really don’t know the details of the GPU business model so perhaps someone more knowledgeable can provide some insight. I’m really curious.')
