Cyclists are not first-class citizens on roads and they never will be. And frankly I don&#x27;t want to get stuck behind one on a road with a dramatically higher speed limit than what you can pedal at. That shit is just rude.<p>The amount of entitlement that seems to come from the cycling community makes it really hard for others to empathize with your situation. You can make a bad faith argument comparing yourselves to BLMers if you want, but I can see right through it.<p>Appreciate your sitaution as a minority among minorities and plan your moves appropriately. But thinking that cyclists should get higher priority over multi-ton cars and such you are mistaken.<p>&gt; People fearing for their lives are allowed to be agitated.<p>Don&#x27;t forget that by cycling you are choosing to bring a knife to a gunfight.')
