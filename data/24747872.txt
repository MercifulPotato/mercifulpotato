We&#x27;ve built nuclear plants. We&#x27;ve encountered unknown difficulties and overcome them. Our cost estimates for nuclear power are historical estimates. We <i>did</i> built nuclear at scale before, and it <i>did</i> cost less.<p>By comparison, the cost estimates for building things like massive amounts of energy storage are cost <i>projections</i>. These costs represent what we <i>think</i> these projects will cost. But these projections, by definition, don&#x27;t account for unforseen engineering challenges. Historical costs do.<p>Comparing the two is apples to oranges. Historical costs include the cost of engineering challenges, cost projections for new technologies do not.')
