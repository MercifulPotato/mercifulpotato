Item(by='hda2', descendants=None, kids=[24669336], score=None, time=1601690112, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24664919, text='&gt; I pay for Spotify, I get no ads. That’s the way it’s supposed to be.<p>And how long do you think this will last before they decide insert ads into paid subscriptions? Cable TV did it. &quot;Full-price&quot; games are doing it. TVs are doing it. It would be extremely naive to assume that spotify won&#x27;t do it at some point.<p>Besides, my admittedly poorly-expressed objection is not to the ads themself but to the way people are being forced to listen to them by the company. There is no way in hell I&#x27;m supporting companies that engage in crap like this.')
