After a consultation with their lawyers and at some future date, the insurrectionists will likely be given plea deals in exchange for &#x27;flipping&#x27; on other suspected co-insurrectionists. These deals will depend on the information and testimony quality they can provide. The networks built by social media and police work are likely to be exploited by prosecutors to build cases against the suspected insurrectionists that will result in long sentences for many people. Combined with ample digital evidence, the cases are likely to be very tough to beat.')
