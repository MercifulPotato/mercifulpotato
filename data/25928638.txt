This is always the rub. I mean, if you look at the performance of the stock market over the past decade  and also all the ppl getting rich with GME and Tesla options on WallStreetBets, it&#x27;s hardly only the 1% who are benefiting. Maybe the top 20% or more. I think it is more like high-IQ people who are getting rich, and it is people who have low&#x2F;average IQs, who have low-paying jobs and without nice tech jobs or stock portfolios, who are falling behind .So that is probably 60-70% of the country.')
