I also would question any assumption that such data is less prone to racial issues -- see for example volumes of literature on inequities in healthcare access and treatment.<p>It&#x27;s great to be using quantitative measures, and almost a necessity, but as someone in this area who has done clinical work as well as research, I can say from personal experience EHR in mental healthcare has fumbled repeatedly with handling the complexities of behavioral information.<p>Good to see attention in this area though.')
