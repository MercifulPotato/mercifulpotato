Item(by='hntrader', descendants=None, kids=[25884589], score=None, time=1611419270, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25883246, text='&gt; what I _really_ want is to continue on with my pre-existing memories&#x2F;experiences<p>This reminds me of an interesting philosophical question.<p>To state the obvious, even if the clone had an exact copy of your memories&#x2F;experiences, that clone isn&#x27;t you, you&#x27;ve died. If I had a teleportation machine that could &quot;teleport&quot; you to work by destroying you painlessly and instantly at the source location, and reconstruct you particle for particle at destination, how many would use it? I wouldn&#x27;t, however irrational that may be, because &quot;I&quot; would be dead.<p>This bias is pretty interesting since by that definition we all die multiple times, as the particles that constitute our body are literally interchanging with the environment over time. But we don&#x27;t feel uncomfortable about that fact.')
