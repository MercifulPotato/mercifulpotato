If there is one thing I know about the rich it&#x27;s that they won&#x27;t pass up an oportunity to earn more. The reality is prices are driven by supply and demand, someone can&#x27;t expect to magically increase prices just because their tax burden is higher. The market won&#x27;t support that.')
