This is because of a quirk of how Reddit handles subreddit bans, where if a subreddit is banned and a new one is created with a completely different moderation team, different rules, etc. it will still get banned for being a &quot;ban evasion&quot; subreddit. This means that banning  a subreddit effectively bans any hypothetical future subreddit dedicated to the same topic. Because of this, if the community cares enough to start a new website for the topic it&#x27;s highly likely that most of the users will move over there.')
