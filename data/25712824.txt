I&#x27;d be interested to see examples of this bias in Wiki entries though.<p>The removal of the website link to 8kun.top - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;8chan" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;8chan</a> (I have read the talk page, don&#x27;t need it repeated)<p>It&#x27;s trivial to find left wing bias, the question is, is it getting worse?<p>Two articles I would normally mention have recently removed their left wing bias -<p>Split-Sleep has had it&#x27;s page removed (Good)<p>The Lucky iron fish now states it doesn&#x27;t work (Good)<p>Gell-Mann Amnesia has lost it&#x27;s page (bad), to prove this is left wing bias you&#x27;d have to find equivalent articles. I&#x27;m not sure on this one.....<p>&gt; least as objective as any news outlet<p>The internet is getting swamped with (two) decades of archived news and information and now it&#x27;s splitting into camps. This is a weakness.')
