For being an entirely tree oriented format it’s tragic flaw is that XML can’t actually represent nested dicts (or arrays for that matter) which turned out to be the data structures people actually wanted to work with.<p>Oh there are lots of ways to beat XML into looking like it can do it but they’re all bad, break all the actual semantics of XML and turn a nice deserialization story of a tree where each node is a complete thing into mess.<p>Turns out that very few people actually needed a tree of heterogeneous string k-v pairs.')
