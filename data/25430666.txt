To put this in context, whenever you connect to a secure website, OCSP is used to make sure the certificate is still valid (unless OCSP stapling is used, but that&#x27;s another issue). BTW, OCSP checks are unencrypted, but Apple says it will change to an encrypted protocol.<p>And it wasn&#x27;t all appsâ€”unsigned apps are allowed to run, so by definition, there&#x27;s no way for Apple to &quot;know&quot; about them. Many people didn&#x27;t know it was happening because they weren&#x27;t affected.<p>Details: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eclecticlight.co&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;16&#x2F;checks-on-executable-code-in-catalina-and-big-sur-a-first-draft&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eclecticlight.co&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;16&#x2F;checks-on-executable-cod...</a>')
