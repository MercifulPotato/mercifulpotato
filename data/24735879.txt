This is not something that has significant usage.<p>b) Anything. Anything is better for seasonal storage. Methane, pumped hydro, molten salt, flow batteries, etc... all of those are existing, or viable right now, not in some fantasy future where we all have fusion-powered flying cars.<p>c) The free market tends to take care of such things. Power is a fungible commodity. If electricity is seasonally cheaper, it&#x27;ll just be used by industry for power-hungry processes such as smelting aluminium or titanium. You can then store those <i>end products</i> by simply putting them in a pile.<p>In a renewable-energy future, it would make sense to use electricity when it is cheap to make hydrocarbons that require its physical or chemical properties, e.g.: to make industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, polymers, etc...<p>We already know how to store hydrocarbons. You pour them into a simple metal tank. Easy.<p>We don&#x27;t know how to store hydrogen. Still. After decades or research.<p>You keep mentioning hydrogen as somehow superior for long term energy storage when the opposite is true.')
