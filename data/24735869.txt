Obviously you have not bothered to do the arithmetic.  The energy storage for CAES per unit of underground storage volume is two orders of magnitude lower than hydrogen.   It&#x27;s good for diurnal storage, not seasonal.<p>As for pumped hydro.  Let&#x27;s suppose we want to store 10% of the annual US power demand in a pumped hydro reservoir with a 200m head.  The volume required is about 2000 cubic kilometers, about four years of the total flow of the Mississippi River.   I don&#x27;t think this is terribly practical.<p>Thermal storage may be competitive for efficiency, but the capital cost is likely to be higher, as you need more heat exchangers and cooling systems.  Combustion turbines are cheap, especially simple cycle.')
