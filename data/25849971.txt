The problem I see is that state boundaries are pretty arbitrary.  The real political division is between urban and rural, and whether or not a particular state is &#x27;red&#x27; or &#x27;blue&#x27; depends on how those boundaries have been created.  There are a huge number of rural voters in California that share more with Wyoming rural voters than Wyoming urban voters, so why should they be disenfranchised simply by living within the state of California?')
