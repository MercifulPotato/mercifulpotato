Item(by='salawat', descendants=None, kids=[25138403], score=None, time=1605707905, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25136239, text='A seeker is someone without a legitimate reason or medical history nevertheless trying to get their hands on prescriptions for controlled substances.<p>It&#x27;s annoying as hell, because if you make the unfortunate mistake of associating with an onverly nervous doctor and you&#x27;re on a controlled substance, it can lead to a life ruining adjustment of your dosage. (Happened to me right after a job loss.)<p>Showing up with a 20 odd year file of history of successful treatment history on something helps, but you still have to be hyper vigilant about finding a prescriber willing to work with you without being flaky. Yoy can&#x27;t even think of moving or long term visitation somewhere unless you&#x27;re made of enough money to do some recon work ahead of time to find a doc at a new location, or return wherever your old one is for the interim to top up fill your prescriptions.<p>As a person with a valid medical justification, I&#x27;m basically already in a gilded prison created by DEA where I have to essentially mother-may-I either the insurance company or physician anytime I want or need to relocate for more than 30 days.<p>And God help you with tolerance built up. Then you&#x27;re adding a new monthly family member unless you figure out how to nutritionally supplement for your particular body chem to get around it.<p>I will shed no tears over massive fefunding of DEA or restriction of their Draconian scope, but I have the feeling I&#x27;ll never see it, because there is too much self-destructive potential and black market incentuve for illegal trade to ever become small enough without an organization putting pressure on it. That may be some level of Stockholm Syndrome talking though, as I&#x27;m not sure I don&#x27;t just tell myself that to keep myself from wasting my time shouting into the wind.')
