Mongodb isn&#x27;t made for ERM based scenarios, maybe stop trying to push it into that. If people would&#x27;ve wanted that in the first place, they&#x27;ll likely have chosen ArangoDB or an SQL based database anyways.<p>To be blunt, I don&#x27;t understand why they seemingly are so irrational to push the narrative.<p>Maybe they&#x27;ve seen that most of their customers stop using their product after a while?<p>If so, then it might be time to stop promising things you conceptually cannot and should not want to deliver.<p>Also, dear mongodb folks: Web scale is definitely not mongodb as a product. For decades devs have used memcached with SQL based databases and it scaled beyond imaginations, and beyond what a non DDoS testing environment can reflect.<p>If your product isn&#x27;t webscale because you do not want to be held responsible for adapters that you refer yourself in your own docs to, maybe it&#x27;s time to take responsibility and introduce a q&amp;a step regarding a minimum performance standard that every adapter has to fulfill to be recommended?<p>Regarding debian package version: I personally am gonna stop here, because I hate people complaining about shit, not taking responsibility, and expecting others to do work for free. If debian&#x27;s policies annoy you, host your own damn ppa. Or sponsor them to help them work on that. But this... this is not okay.')
