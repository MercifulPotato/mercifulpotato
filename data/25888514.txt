Sometimes I visualize that chefs in the world are all in conspiracy against me â€¦&quot; Nikola Tesla thought chefs were conspiring against him [1]) because I refuse to let anything to go to waste, and I welcome all the energy I can get (fuel for the tractor). I also do not clean dishes after every meal (blender included) because I want to see what nature can throw at me tomorrow. So far so good, although my stool once smelt like sulfur after cooking with boiled&#x2F;stored creek water - duckduckgo tells me giardiasis, waterborne pathogen, which my gut promptly destroyed after one digestive cycle (well rehearsed and diversified, daily probiotic reinforcements).<p>At this point I have an iron stomach, and I was inspired by quite the lean healthy &quot;homeless&quot; girl I met who was eating out of dumpsters. I refused to partake in the dripping salad offering she presented me, but I could understand that because of this lifestyle - she would be far less of a liability to the healthcare system. Meanwhile,  the &quot;housed&quot; people are stuffing themselves with their Precious  TV  Dinners (Tom Green, Stealing Harvard), sanitizing every surface they can think of, and finding it acceptable and even preferable to sit in their favorite chair with their &quot;free&quot; time to fawn over streaming media that depicts other people living their lives.<p>We want to blame it on the food, but the propaganda on phones and public wall-mounted screens is orchestrated by those who themselves are fearful of the world around them. The ones that follow suite are going to acquire a gut, high blood pressure (Why Zebras Don&#x27;t Get Ulcers), and dulled senses.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;garylite.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;21&#x2F;everything-is-the-light-an-interview-with-nikola-tesla&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;garylite.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;21&#x2F;everything-is-the-light-an-i...</a>')
