We played Jeopardy with it, where we would take a wikipedia article about a person and use a snippet of the first paragraph as the prompt and ask GPT-3 who it was.<p>It was very good at guessing the right person.<p>I&#x27;m curious if one can use GPT-3 to do some clustering of people based on their writing.  For example, if I take the writing of several diagnosed sociopaths as a prompt or fine tuning data, could I use GPT-3 to detect same in the wild?<p>I would imagine GPT-5 or 6 will start consuming video as well.  This will be interesting if you start mixing the content from YouTube, TikTok, WSHH, etc. into the mix.  So not only will it be able to generate text, it will generate a convincing video of a person speaking to you with plausible facial expressions and intonation in speech.')
