If the software otherwise does what you want, but you need some particular change, fork away.<p>Obviously one needs to be judicious with this, but I&#x27;ve scored some big wins from this. In addition to bypassing projects who don&#x27;t want to accept the (IMHO) perfectly reasonable contributions, I&#x27;ve also some cases where the upstream project <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> accept my changes and I shouldn&#x27;t submit them. I&#x27;ve got one case where I forked a package and essentially twisted it so hard that it destroys it for its original purpose, even though it now does exactly what I need. A couple of others where the upstream is obviously dead. Another case I can think of where in principle the upstream could accept it, but it adds a subtle and easy-to-misuse feature to the package that I understand fairly well having written it, but would really encourage users to mess themselves up and is hard to document properly, so I probably won&#x27;t ever submit it.<p>It&#x27;s not something I do all the time by any means... the above paragraph describes nearly all the cases where I&#x27;ve done it. It&#x27;s 3 or 4 in as many years. But each of them was a fairly large win.')
