We have customers using clusters with 80+ nodes in production for many years now.<p>Timescale just released their multi-node feature in beta and they follow a different concept then we do. While Timescale uses a leader (access node) - follower (data node) model with a single point of failure CrateDB is built on a shared-nothing architecture. Many features you would want to see in a distributed system are present in CrateDB and still missing in TS:<p>- cluster wide replication\n - automatic rebalancing\n - cluster wide backup\n - shared nothing architecture &#x2F; no single point of failure<p>- Full Text Search\nCrateDB is built on Lucene and parts of ES and includes search capabilities you would typically need a separate product for when using PG&#x2F;TS.<p>- Distributed Query Engine\nYes, PG&#x2F;TS are fast if you query &quot;small&quot; amounts of data (e.g. last days data). But if you have distributed system, you might as well also want to run queries on larger data sets.<p>- Geospatial Queries \nPowered with Lucenes BKD-Trees<p>---<p>Disclaimer:\nI work for Crate.io and I also think Timescale are doing awesome stuff in many ways and give Influx the competition they deserve. I don&#x27;t see us in direct competition (at least not yet), as the focus of Timescale is clearly more on smaller use cases.')
