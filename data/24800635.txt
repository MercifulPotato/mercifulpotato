If the idealized market Turing machine can compute a local optimum to a nonconvex optimization problem in polytime given some inputs, there&#x27;s nothing prohibiting an explicit algorithm that runs through the same steps from doing so. If finding an equilibrium is in some hard complexity class, then it&#x27;s hard for the market and the command system both, given the same inputs. The market&#x27;s computational capacity isn&#x27;t magic. Most likely the market only finds an approximate optimum and a dedicated algorithm can do better, if it has the same inputs.<p>That then gets confused with the problem of getting those inputs. Hayek makes a big deal of the local knowledge of the market in contrast to the hierarchical nature of the Soviet planned economy. But that should cut just as viciously against big corporations, and what it really means, I think, is that the system must be bottom-up in some fashion.<p>You can have bottom-up systems running on top of the market, or on top of some explicit optimization algorithm. But the Austrians have managed to convince people that market = bottom-up and explicit algorithm = top-down. That&#x27;s where the dismissal comes from.')
