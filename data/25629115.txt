Extremely brilliant people like him often either have quirks or are not the greatest speakers (don&#x27;t get me wrong â€“ I don&#x27;t expect a single human to have every skill), but Packard seems to excel at everything: he&#x27;s obviously a brilliant engineer, he&#x27;s a wonderful speaker, he seems to be an all-around pleasant and friendly human, he seems to manage a sane and healthy personal and family life. Just a stellar person!<p>The single fact that he&#x27;s doing RISC-V work at SiFive boosts my confidence in what they&#x27;re doing.')
