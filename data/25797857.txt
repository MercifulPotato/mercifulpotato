That mRNA gets inside your cells and causes the cells to express a protein that is common to the virus. Other cells react to this by creating anti-bodies against that protein.<p>It is a misuse of terminology to call it a vaccine given that word has nearly two centuries of meaning, and if some people have a bad reaction to it then it drags down proven technology along with it. It is closer to temporary genetic modification than it is to regular vaccines.<p>That 95% of the anti-anti-vax crowd I&#x27;ve talked to have no idea about his bodes ill for scientific literacy and will make any possible backlash against it even worse.')
