Seems like a professionally prepared documentary targeting younger Russian generation. Reminds me of a similar documentary by BBC some years ago. For sure a lot of effort has been put into the making of this.<p>I am not a Russian, but it looks to me even if all these allegations were to be true, still Putin remains the person that re-build modern Russia. This documentary can only make people in Russia like Putin even more. I will try to watch the rest next out of curiosity, but I doubt it will change my mind.<p>It is also heroic this guy takes a few months to recover and finds the energy to present so much well-researched evidence. I wounder because, I have seen the pattern in this documentary in some other documentaries before - last in one about Syria&#x27;s Assad I watched - show some facts that are maybe true, then follow by a conclusion that me as someone who has no idea on those details cannot verify but is supposed to trust in context. Maybe these works on weak minds as they say in Star Wars. This is subtle propaganda in the making.<p>Not sure what is expected audience for such level of international manipulative politics here.')
