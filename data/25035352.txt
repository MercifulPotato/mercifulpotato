Typically these types of GPU based fluid solvers use texture maps to store velocity and pressure information. (See NVIDIAâ€™s GPU Gems paper on fluids.)<p>Most GPUs support 3D texture maps, and changing something like this to support 3D should be fairly trivial. From what I remember, the calculations for each dimension are identical.')
