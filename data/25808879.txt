Item(by='Green_man', descendants=None, kids=[25810264], score=None, time=1610867839, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25807086, text='I&#x27;m pretty ignorant of design styles, but what always bothered me about &quot;Corporate Memphis&quot;, and styles like it, was the very weirdly caricatured humans depicted within it. The people usually look incredibly weird, and while it&#x27;s not quite &quot;uncanny valley&quot; or whatever, it feels like a very cheap and ineffective attempt at implying diversity. Maybe this isn&#x27;t the intent at all, but it&#x27;s most noticeable when there are differently deformed people in the art. People in real life come in all shapes and sizes, but not in the same way, with very bright colors and comically different proportions. As a non graphic designer, I appreciate that such a flat, 2D style may require some unrealistic designs, but as a human, I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to depictions of especially unrealistic human imposters. I adore Kutzgesagt, and I think that may be due in part to their predominant use of birds and other animals as agents, rather than strangely proportioned people.<p>&quot;Here we love people, even if they have enormous hands!&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;EbWYR4lWkAEOgAo.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;EbWYR4lWkAEOgAo.jpg</a><p>&quot;I don&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re white, brown, black, orange, or purple!&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eyeondesign.aiga.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;Alegria_Hero-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eyeondesign.aiga.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;Aleg...</a>')
