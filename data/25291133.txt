I&#x27;ve seen people wearing masks and glasses by themselves in cars while driving with the windows closed. In that scenario fogging glasses makes wearing the mask more dangerous to people around you than not wearing the mask...<p>Of course, none of this is to say that in all these cases, even outdoors, that you shouldn&#x27;t wear the mask if you can&#x27;t social distance or need to go indoors. You totally should! But giving people the stink eye when they&#x27;re 30 ft away from everyone else and outside and mask-less seems a bit much. It doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s any justification for that outside of shaming non-conformity.<p>Other commenters here are saying things like - if there&#x27;s a .0001% chance this pre ents harm to you or others, then it&#x27;s your duty to not do it. I&#x27;m a teetotaler; I wonder if these folks drink alcohol.')
