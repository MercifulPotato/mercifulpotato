It supports several chat systems <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.bitlbee.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.bitlbee.org&#x2F;</a> including apparently Matrix.<p>I mostly mention it as a historical note because bitlbee&#x27;s use of IRC as the bridged protocol means that it&#x27;s of limited usefulness on mobile.  It was fantastic for me in the days before smartphones became a thing, but I do at least 50% of my &quot;chat&quot; on my phone these days.')
