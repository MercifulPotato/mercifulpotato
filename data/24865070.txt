They all take an oath to protect the basic premises of the US Constitution and yet here we have direct evidence that they don&#x27;t care about amendments like the 4th or 1st, two very critical ones. I think it should be obvious and not hyperbole. The only agency I can see having any excuse at all to do such things is the CIA when it&#x27;s operating outside of US borders. All the other agencies are basically writing their oath on a piece of toilet paper, using it for it&#x27;s primary purpose, and then flushing it down the drain.')
