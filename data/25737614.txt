When it comes to AGI-related stuff, we are quite literally like contemporaries of Leonardo da Vinci, who have seen his plans for the helicopter and are postulating that helicopters will cause big problems if they fly too high and crash into the mechanism that is holding up the sky above us.<p>Also, this is not the mainstream opinion on e.g. fusion, or electric cars and smartphones (20 years ago), or a computer in every home (50 years ago). Those have been arguments about money and practicality, not about &quot;we don&#x27;t even know how such technology would look or what it would be based on&quot;.')
