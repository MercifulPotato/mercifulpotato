Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601634638, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24660942, text='I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re understanding my point.<p>The &#x27;licenses&#x27; which you are describing may be worthless, in that they have no actual meaning. Some more so than others.<p>Someone could sue over GPL tommorow, goes to the Supreme Court, and the GPL is invalidated and ruled invalid.<p>Then what? The entire software industry turns upside down.<p>So when the &#x27;licence has little meaning&#x27; and it can be overruled in a court ... then companies are very scared of that and act accordingly - with risk aversion.<p>In other words the &#x27;GPL&#x27; is not &#x27;the GPL&#x27;. It&#x27;s just &#x27;maybe the GPL&#x27;. And that is a <i>huge</i> maybe if you&#x27;re betting the company on it.<p>To make the &#x27;GPL&#x27; actually the &#x27;GPL&#x27; and to validate the strategy articulated in your comment - you need to either have 1) laws passed in support of this stuff or 2) have major courts rule on it.<p>The contracts seem reasonable, it would be nice to have them validated in court.<p>Copyright, a similar issue, is being tested right now in Oracle v. Google and it&#x27;s going to have a big impact.<p>To give you some small hint at how big this issue is: Android is switching from Java to Kotlin over this. Literally the #1 most popular OS in the world has to fundamentally shift gears due to IP litigation risks.<p>If the laws were clear then either a) Android would have never used Java to begin with or b) Android would have no problem using Java. Instead, we&#x27;re in limbo. Which is why clear contract laws are good for everyone.')
