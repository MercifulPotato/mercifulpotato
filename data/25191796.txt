If that failed it called the original INT 13h which would try to boot from a floppy.<p>On the software side we had a similar evolution. The first versions of DOS included all the drivers for all devices you might have. If some manufacturer wanted to add some new hardware it would have to ask Microsoft to compile a new version of DOS just for their machine. That didn&#x27;t scale at all and soon the extra drivers were split into their own .sys binaries which could be loaded by autoexec.bat as needed.')
