But, what the US does do that the CCP does not is allow the open discourse of it&#x27;s problems, and to change it&#x27;s policies if people agree.<p>Even the very numbers that come from the CCP regarding their prison population are extremely suspect - they do not allow independent auditing, and we discover new slave labor camps like the ones in this article nearly every other day it seems. Flatly, the numbers put forth by the CCP are not to be trusted because the CCP has done nothing to make the numbers trustworthy.<p>Bringing things up from the US&#x27; past, nearly a century ago or longer, or equivocating paid voluntary prison labor with mandatory forced labor based on religion is flatly wrong.')
