What the fuck for??<p>Parler&#x27;s app was the number one download on the app store &amp; play store after Trump was kicked off Twitter.<p>Then apple and google decided that Parler was not going to be a platform Trump could use, so they kicked the app off.<p>Then amazon decided that Parler had no place on their computing resources.<p>Those 2 tweets were interpreted as they were, to suit the political leanings of those tech companies and their political allies.  And a legitimate competitor was destroyed into the bargain.  This is not reasonable and it is antithetical to the freedoms on which your great nation was founded.<p>If you, dear HN reader, can&#x27;t see the threat to your freedom in this then you are blind.<p>The US democracy may be under stress, so to speak, but it does seem to be working.  The democrats will have their man in the white house.  Trump will leave.<p>Oh, and to call that invasion of the capitol an attempted coup is a real stretch.  What were they ever going to do other than get arrested??')
