As in, &quot;Oh crap, this free market is in the process of unravelling, the only way to stop it is to throw a bailout at it.&quot; So it&#x27;s still a <i>product</i> of decentralised planning (to use your term).<p>The reaction following a bailout is usually, &quot;whoops, we didn&#x27;t do enough central planning beforehand&quot; i.e. the new banking regulations such as tighter loan-to-deposit ratios. So, overall, this supports the parent comment&#x27;s point of the inefficiencies of decentralised planning.')
