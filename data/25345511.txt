I&#x27;m happy to trash Apple where appropriate and I&#x27;ve got plenty of complaints. I think Apple does it&#x27;s best when the integration of hardware and software is really important and there is a very low tolerance for, I won&#x27;t say bugs, but issues.<p>They&#x27;re headphones. I want to put them on and they need to make noise. I&#x27;m not dealing with connectivity issues, battery issues, etc. Sure they&#x27;re $500 but when Apple gets it right I&#x27;m happy to pay $500 for something that works than $300 for the first try that I eventually stop using because of some issue or another then another try at $350 for something a little better only to finally throw in the towel an pay the $500 to Apple that might not be perfect but hits it on enough points that I want to use them.<p>Battery, I need to be able to easily and quickly know what the status is and I need to know that if I plugged them in before I go to bed I&#x27;ll be good to go all day, the next day and I don&#x27;t have to think about charging.<p>Connectivity. When I go to use them I need them to connect and work. No fiddling around with loss of connection or not connecting in the first place.<p>With the spatial audio they&#x27;re actually cheap if you figure I&#x27;m done with any Dolby Atmos, 9.1, 7.1, 5.1 etc stand alone setup. I&#x27;m watching movies with this. I&#x27;m tired of all the speakers, decoder, amp, wires, sub, constant upgrades. Compare this to even the least expensive stand alone 5.1 system and it&#x27;s a very inexpensive alternative.')
