Item(by='dingaling', descendants=None, kids=[25182746, 25182785, 25182553, 25182357], score=None, time=1606085955, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25181452, text='&gt; For me this watch is nearly perfect.<p>The UX is poor though. Once you&#x27;ve finished with the stopwatch, the next mode-button press leads to the time-adjustment mode rather than immediately back to the current time display. Any destructive modes such as adjustment should be protected behind a long-press, not interleaved into the routine mode cycle.<p>It&#x27;s also frustratingly easy to knock the watch out of 24 hour display with a slight mistouch.<p>It is marvellously thin and light though, I wish there were more options of a similar form factor.')
