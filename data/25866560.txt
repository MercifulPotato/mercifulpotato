Unfortunately, math textbook writers bow to the tradtition of writing bloated books where the core ideas get lost in the sea of chaff. The exercises sections usually further muddy the waters with ridiculous number of irrelevant garbage. This makes learning math not only inefficient, but also ineffective. Thus, in the present there&#x27;s probbly no such book or method.<p>However, you can make learning LA massively more enjoyable if you choose the right books (read &quot;books with tons of examples&quot; that clarify theorems, definitions and the like). For example, Linear Algebra: Step by Step by Kuldeep Singh  [0]is an awesome book.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Linear-Algebra-Step-Kuldeep-Singh&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0199654441&#x2F;ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=linear+algebra&amp;qid=1611274283&amp;sr=8-2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Linear-Algebra-Step-Kuldeep-Singh&#x2F;dp&#x2F;...</a>')
