The SSD upgrade done years ago was a life saver for it.<p>In its place I&#x27;ve purchased and upgraded a 2009 Mac Pro over the last few months. The ability to swap out a few parts will give another 6+ years of life to this machine.<p>And I&#x27;ve still got and use (every other week) a 13in 2010 MacBook Pro.<p>Incredibly well made machines.\nSuch a shame the newish ones are non serviceable.')
