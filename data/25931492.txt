First, let&#x27;s look at the opening sentences&#x2F;headlines:<p><i>Electric vehicles are supposed to be green, but the truth is a bit murkier</i><p>To paraphrase John Goodman in <i>The Big Lebowski</i>: &quot;greener than your ICE, Dude.&quot; But the only murkiness is from the shit-stirring of your article, Mr.&#x2F;Ms. I-Had-A-Deadline-to-Meet.<p><i>Mining lithium for batteries, plus how they&#x27;re charged, can affect an EVâ€™s impact on environment</i><p>Lithium not delivered by rainbow-farting unicorns, EV owners shocked at the news and disappointed that lithium mining is not as clean as oil and the snow-like purity of its extraction.<p><i>An electric vehicle may not have a tailpipe, but it still has a carbon footprint.</i><p>At this point I quit reading.
