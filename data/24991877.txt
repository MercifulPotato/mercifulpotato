It does not mean that you talk to nobody and come up with solutions by yourself and then push those through. Ideally, you will be talking with lots of people and get as much interaction and help to solve problems as possible. There are three main reasons for why you shouldnâ€™t solve problems alone: By involving others you get their perspective and a fuller picture of what you need to consider.
