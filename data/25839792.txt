Taste in itself is done on the tongue, and consists mostly of salty, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami. (Though not on different parts of the tongue, as is commonly taught. That&#x27;s long outdated, and was a misunderstanding from the beginning.) There may be some other taste sensations as well, but not many.<p>Flavor is taste on the tongue plus the smell of things going through the back of the throat to the nose. The illusion that the flavor is all in the mouth is very, very powerful -- but it&#x27;s much the same way as looking at something doesn&#x27;t make you think the object is in your eye. The sense of smell has far, far more shades than taste does -- tens of thousands at a minimum, maybe many more.<p>Vinegar (especially plain white vinegar) is almost completely a taste -- you sense acidity with the sour receptors on the tongue, and that&#x27;s all you get. It should taste more or less the same in your mouth, but you might not be able to tell the difference between white vinegar and cider vinegar.')
