Sadly today&#x27;s agile software-world, nobody works hard to know customers and fix deliveries. It is like, you&#x27;r running italian restarunt. But if someone wants indian curries, you will run to market, will buy ingredients, learn recipes and deliver before customer leaves.<p>So Final result -<p>- you delivered food which looks like Indian cuisine but not tastes.<p>- now your customer is unhappy<p>- so your boss is unhappy<p>- you&#x27;re tired after doing long circus but you feel good as you learn little bit about Indin cuisine.<p>- Now let kitchen die (anyway your boss is not happy) and start applying Indian restarunts saying you can also cook Italian<p>- Mean while in next day, you will do same circus for Japaneses cuisine<p>- Now you will start applying Japanese restarunts also, saying you can cook Indian and Italian')
