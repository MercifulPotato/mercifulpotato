Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=[25330552], score=None, time=1607330392, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25327280, text='Growing up, my parents were allergic to most types of the trees sold as christmas trees, so they gave up and bought a fake tree.  They spent a decent amount on it (definitely stretched our christmas budget), and it was actually a really great tree that we enjoyed for over a decade.  &quot;Not very inspiring&quot; is a bit of a grinchy, scroogey way to think about it... really lacks imagination.<p>Now I get a real tree, and honestly sometimes I miss the fake one.  Keeping the real tree watered and dealing with it shedding needles all the time is a pain.  And you&#x27;ll rarely find the &quot;perfect&quot; tree that doesn&#x27;t have some odd misshapen-ness or branches missing in key areas.  Sure, you can say that&#x27;s what gives them their charm, but I guess I just got used to having a fairly symmetrical tree.<p>I also feel a bit bad about feeding an industry that grows a tree only to cut it down so I can stick it in my house for a 6 weeks and then throw it away.  This year I learned about companies that will deliver a potted tree and then take it back and keep it alive during the off season.  Might give that a try next year.')
