Item(by='monocasa', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602356200, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24738469, text='&gt; First of all, wages have not universally been in an inverse relationship with price....<p>First off, don&#x27;t cite unsourced one-off tweets if you want to be taken seriously.<p>Secondly, yes, wages have gone up... since WWII.  This entire discussion has been about the stagnation of median wages since the late 70s.<p>&gt; But that presupposes that all goods &amp; services are delivered purely through unfettered markets, which is not the case.<p>In no case are we talking about unfettered markets, so that has no bearing here.  We&#x27;re talking about the regulatory env of today contrasted with a UBI which is far from unfettered markets.<p>&gt; No matter what, the employer never pays that living wage....<p>Continuing to follow that logic nobody pays for anything.  &quot;Employers don&#x27;t really pay for labor&quot; is an incredibly hot take I wasn&#x27;t expecting to defend today.  If a business transitions from unprofitable to profitable by slashing wages, and sticks that profit in the bank, where did that money come from?')
