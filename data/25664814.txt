I didn&#x27;t vote for him in 2016 because I didn&#x27;t think he&#x27;d do a good job. The last your years have shown me that while I don&#x27;t agree with everything, he&#x27;s done more that I agree with than I think a Clinton would have (or that a Biden would). For example, I like that he&#x27;s signed peace accords between Israel and Muslim nations, and not started major new foreign wars, protected religious freedoms, forced medical transparency, passed criminal justice reform, etc. I don&#x27;t believe Clinton would have done those things, or that Biden will, given that his administration started new wars, used the military against american citizens, tried to force nuns to violate their conscience, etc. So yes, in that I mostly support the past four years of American federal policy, I support Trumpism?')
