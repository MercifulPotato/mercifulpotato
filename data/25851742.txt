It takes huge amounts of resources to maintain that environment. And no it&#x27;s not chemical free. Also yes water is used and wasted. If you ain&#x27;t doing bulk washing your applying huge amounts of product to keep algae blooms out of your systems. Try run that environment for a year. I give it 2-3 month before your first insect&#x2F;pest bloom. Less if your unlucky. An I&#x27;d be blown away if you fix your first pest bloom the first try. Vertical farms are sick on paper...that ignores masses of requirements to actually get the task done.')
