Maybe I&#x27;ve done but I never gave or discovered a name for it. I don&#x27;t know what spark or kafka streams are. Maybe because I&#x27;ve never had a use case for those that wasn&#x27;t satisfied by a tool that was &quot;good enough&quot;, or, more likely, I haven&#x27;t come across anyone recommending those on projects, because they also don&#x27;t know what those tools are. I would have never known what RabbitMQ was if a coworker never suggested we use it to build queues, and it turned out to be cumbersome to use and 100x more complicated than writing a stored procedure that turned out to be &quot;good enough&quot;. Most tools fall into that space where they are marginally better in some regards over &quot;good enough&quot;, but not better enough to accomadate for the learning curve for other developers, changes in maintenance or design, cost, etc. Advertising is pretty general and it&#x27;s hard to say if which of these it&#x27;s doing wrong, and depending on their market none of these might be wrong for them, just the potential market is content with &quot;good enough&quot; and have no need to search for tools like this.<p>&gt;Rust is intimidating?<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the stats on Rust are but I don&#x27;t think its that popular for business developers to where you could point to it for the reason a tool has failed the adoption phase')
