Lockheed Martin probably isn&#x27;t very interested in stealing technology from Sukhoi to clone and put in their own jets.  However it seems quite likely that Lockheed has an interest in the particulars of Sukhoi jets, their weapon systems, radars and EW systems, and airframe capabilities, so that Lockheed may better design systems meant to counter those systems.  Certainly the design of effective stealth aircraft required knowledge of opposition radar systems.<p>As for the American military being top dog by a long mile... that seems true, but you don&#x27;t stay that way by being complacent.')
