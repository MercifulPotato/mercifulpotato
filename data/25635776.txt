You would have to ask Keith for a definitive answer why this is since he wrote both XRender and Cairo. (I assume it&#x27;s because Cairo already included the necessary tessellation steps at the time)<p>Indirect GLX does work great for simple use cases, once you start to add textures into the equation the amount of bandwidth used would probably make it unusable over the network. There has been no serious work in getting indirect GLX working past OpenGL 1.x. I think another one of the main problems is that nobody really came up with a good way for GL extensions to work well there, the server needs to manually add an implementation for every extension you want to use.')
