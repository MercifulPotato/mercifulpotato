My mom suffered a transient ischemic attack last week.<p>To quote the surgeon: statistically she had a 15% chance of issues in the coming weeks. An operation has a 5% risk of complications, so normally we don&#x27;t perform one. But 5 is lower than 15%, so let&#x27;s do it.<p>Not sure of the math, because I assume the 15% is spread (non-linear) over the 2 weeks, and she was operated at the end of the window, but it is still amazing that all of this is possible.')
