This seems like a textbook threat model problem, and one that I&#x27;m not sure how to address as a proponent of federated&#x2F;decentralized services.<p>I used to (and still kinda do, but times change) run IRC&#x2F;TS3&#x2F;Mumble servers for MMO guilds. At least in this specific MMO, DDoSing was a significant issue since gear was lost on death - an attacker finds a rich target, gets their IP somehow, fights them, knocks them offline, takes their stuff.<p>Most&#x2F;many IP leaks were via out-of-game communication services. Since a guild&#x27;s Teamspeak is probably administered by a guild member, it is trivial to pull connection info on a given user. At this point in time, Skype was still largely p2p and it was fairly trivial to obtain the IP of a call participant, so it was also a big vector. There was an IRC network &quot;for&quot; the game, so the situation there was better than Skype+individual guild audio chats, but opers getting bribed to leak IPs was unfortunately common.<p>All of this meant that when Discord showed up on the scene, a lot of people in this community went &quot;finally, a communication service where I can both 1) talk to people I don&#x27;t necessarily fully trust and 2) not have to go full perfect 100% of the time opsec to do it&quot; and gratefully signed up. Anecdotally, this class of IP harvesting has gotten a lot rarer, largely thanks to Discord.<p>Most of these people, despite often having some degree of technical sophistication, don&#x27;t care about Discord privacy-invasion or censorship because it isn&#x27;t in their threat model - they&#x27;ve got more immediate fish to fry. Should it be? It&#x27;s easy for us to sit in our IRC ivory towers and say so, but I think having a communication service where your privacy isn&#x27;t contingent on the local admin whose court you end up in being a good person is an obvious advantage of centralization.<p>Of course, Discord isn&#x27;t immune to issues of compromise (when you&#x27;re the central point of a juicy system, attackers will try, as shown by Twitter&#x27;s Saudi subversion thing and various other examples), but compromising a Discord employee is a higher bar than compromising the person running a 500-person IRC server out of their basement. Likewise, many of these sort of privacy issues in decentralized and&#x2F;or federated services have technical mitigations, but not requiring technical mitigations is an advantage in and of itself.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s how Discord was plausibly a security upgrade for many people I knew who switched to it from IRC&#x2F;Mumble. I dislike closed, proprietary communication protocols as much as the next person, but I think we&#x27;ve got to treat server subversion&#x2F;local corruption as a higher class of problem than it usually is treated as, though that gets into a lot of hard problems all the way down the stack.')
