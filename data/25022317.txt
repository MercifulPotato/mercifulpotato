The right solution is bottom up economic stimulus to create equal opportunity, and it should support poor Black&#x2F;Hispanic Americans <i>as well as</i> poor White Americans (of which there are a sizable and growing number).<p>You need look no further than the failure of Prop 16 - which sought to remove language from the California Constitution that provides equal protections and consideration to all Californians irrespective of race, gender, etc - to understand how deeply unpopular these sorts of strategies to rectify societal imbalance really are.<p>While I am personally largely socially liberal, Iâ€™ve never understood how Democrats unironically adopted a policy agenda that explicitly preferences certain people on the basis of race, which is quite possibly the worst way to address racial injustice.')
