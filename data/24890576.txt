I suppose one of the problems is that SOME of them that have &#x27;used desktops&#x27; were actually using neutered VMs in a shared corporate environment that run really poorly and are pretty underspec&#x27;d in a shared environment.<p>But every time, it&#x27;s actually been the case that not only is the desktop faster and cheaper,  but things usually remained faster on an X year old desktop hardware vs more modern laptops for any serious workload.<p>Edit: and in case it needs to be said, I have both desktops and multiple portable devices in my household because the downside of desktops is clearly portability.')
