A local witness reported their activity to the police as a potential burglary in progress.<p>Yeah, usually when you see people forcing a door open, you should let the police know.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s just racism<p>It&#x27;s just the results of spiritual decline. Obviously anyone who has deeply found religion would know that spiritual decline is the cause of human suffering, and that you only need a belief in &lt;deity&gt; to reverse these problems. If only we still taught the bible&#x2F;koran&#x2F;whatever in schools!<p>Single cause claims for complex phenomenon are almost always nonsense, especially ones without actionable solutions that fail scrutiny. They make great headlines, but they don&#x27;t really hold up. They&#x27;re used to attack the outgroup, not fix the problem.<p>&gt; In college you learn it&#x27;s about slavery.<p>If that&#x27;s all you learned in college about the civil war, you should ask for a refund. Slavery was absolutely one of reasons several southern states entered the war, but it was by far not the only. Most southerners would not have fought purely for slavery because most of the soldiers were too poor to have owned slaves.<p>&gt; Good luck getting any Republican...<p>Ah yes, we all know &lt;purple team&gt; is to blame! If only it wasn&#x27;t for purple team, us green team would have solved every woe and problem. After all, every place where green team is in control is a bastion of prosperity, equality and liberty - and everyplace where that isn&#x27;t true is due to purple team somehow, for some reason!<p>Culture wars are useful for pushing narratives and keeping both sides locked in a relative stalemate. Coke and Pepsi both benefit from these antics (Are you a coke drinker or a pepsi drinker?), but it&#x27;s not an appropriate framework for political decision making where you often need to find compromise and pressure points to move the conversation forward.')
