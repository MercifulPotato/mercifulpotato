You want indefinite entertainment that you&#x27;ll be happy with season after season after season, but the cost is an eternity of risk that the network will cancel the show and you&#x27;ll never find out how it ends.<p>The difference is that I want Photoshop to run forever, but I&#x27;m not as sure I want Walter White to get an exotic new cancer every twelve months.<p>I don&#x27;t watch shows on my own. I know they satisfy the urge to turn on the TV and just have something on, and I think that urge is mind-rotting. If I have to watch something, why not a movie? If I don&#x27;t have the energy to pay attention for 90 minutes, <i>why idly kill time watching anything at all?</i><p>Or what about short films? That&#x27;s a whole neglected format. They have Oscars and a dedicated video network for them.')
