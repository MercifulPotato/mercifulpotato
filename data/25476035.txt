It runs smoothly on his gaming setup, but the game is too linear with pretty much zero replay-ability because of how shallow the world is. It&#x27;s clear they left a _lot_ out of the game. Even features that would seem &quot;basic&quot; for an open-world game, like AI, are apparently very awful (cops just spawning randomly right around you but they don&#x27;t chase you and oddities like that).<p>While the console issues themselves are huge, it definitely seems the game itself is missing way too much for what it costs.')
