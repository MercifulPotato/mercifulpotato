Drug use comes from natural urge to explore consciousness and people take drugs regardless of the law around it. If they are no longer being harassed by law enforcement, then it is easier for them to pursue this and Portugal&#x27;s policy does that. If I recall the drug use is estimated from surveys and people lie when it comes to that (for example there is thinking what if they start to investigate me if I respond &quot;yes&quot;, even if the survey is &quot;anonymous&quot;). Other way to estimate is by looking at numbers of people caught with the system. Now, because the harassment has been relaxed obviously fewer LE will bother going after consumers and from that it is easy for propaganda machinery to tout the policy is working. Well, it is working for those involved in the trade. You sell more if your customers are not being harassed, simple fact of life.')
