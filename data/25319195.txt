The degree to which Indigenous lives are rendered both traumatic but also incredibly <i>boring</i> is shocking. If you&#x27;ve gotten a low quality education, don&#x27;t have a job and your traditional way of life is no longer viable (it&#x27;s quite likely you haven&#x27;t been taught it), how are you going to pass the time?')
