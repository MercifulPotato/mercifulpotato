Typical of penny-pinching bean counters and talentless middle-management chair warmers. But I don’t think Apple has ever understood automation (as any 20-year AppleScript veteran can tell you), so I’m not surprised Cook’s crew has failed to capitalize.<p>Complex automation works best when placed in the hands of skilled humans, as an <i>amplifier</i> of human ability. Let them use the machines to accelerate all their mundane repetitive crap, while retaining the human ability to make reasoned decisions and handle corner cases and errors intelligently.<p>But perhaps a more logical place to start is by automating away the penny-pinching bean counters’ and talentless middle-management chair warmers’ jobs? Dog knows they’re reliably useless at it themselves.')
