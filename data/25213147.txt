I keep going back to it for the customizable workflows and fine-grained access control.<p>Unfortunately, every corporate Jira instance I&#x27;ve ever worked with has been overrun with every possible field possible, an unnecessary and constantly shifting mishmash of plugins and horribly slow access. You&#x27;re paying the price for all of that cruft that you don&#x27;t need and which can&#x27;t be removed because &quot;maybe someone wants it.&quot;')
