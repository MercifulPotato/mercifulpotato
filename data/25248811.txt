Your eyes are constantly twitching and that makes reading slower. You can’t stop that but you can reduce it by moving your eyes less. At least that’s how I understand it.<p>So how to do it? Take a page&#x2F;column of text and break it up into 3 smaller columns. Do this either in your head or physically on the paper. Then look at the center of the first column but read all the words on the first row with your peripheral vision, without moving your eyes. Do the same with the next column and the next until you’ve finished that row of text and move down to the next row of text. Repeat. It took some practice and at first I was slower, but much sooner than I expected I became a faster reader than my wife, who has always been much faster than me.')
