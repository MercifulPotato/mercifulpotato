Modern internet standards are some serious turd-polishing.<p>First you have HTTP2, which goes from a plaintext protocol to a binary protocol. But it&#x27;s backwards compatible with HTTP&#x2F;1.1, because... nobody in the entire world will consider adding a new internet service port (81, 442, etc). In 100 years, we will still be using ports 80 and 443 - not because it&#x27;s a good idea, but because literally every business in the world just refuses to update their software.<p>Then you have HTTP3. Where we do the above, but with a transport protocol. Literally nobody in the world wants to update their protocol stack, hardware, middleware, software, etc to add a new internet protocol. So we clamber on top of another protocol (UDP)&#x27;s back, to create a new protocol (QUIC), and then clamp yet another protocol (HTTP3) on that. So we have IP-&gt;UDP-&gt;QUIC-&gt;HTTP3. Which is backwards compatible with HTTP&#x2F;1.1, because, you guessed it.... nobody wants to add ports 82 and 440.<p>The next step is going to be nobody wanting to update to IPv6. So they will probably implement IPv7, and stick it on top of whatever replaces UDP on top of IPv7. Then add on QUIC, and HTTP4. So it will be Ethernet-&gt;Arp-&gt;IPv4-&gt;UDPv4-&gt;IPv7-&gt;UDPv?-&gt;QUIC-&gt;HTTP4. All because nobody wants to update their software to use an existing, widely supported, network layer protocol. Or transport protocol. Or application protocol. Meanwhile, anything that wants to use the new features of the new protocols needs to implement 4 new protocols.<p>It&#x27;s going to keep going like this until we have some new Apple-ish company come along with brand new everything, and everyone will flock to it, and the only way anyone will be able to use it will be to implement the new snowflake protocols. To even connect to the devices you&#x27;ll need to have a license agreement with them and establish a secure connection that only that company has the keys for (because &quot;privacy&quot;, because the internet standards are so ancient they never adapt fast enough and hackers basically compromise all web security). And those new things will become a de-facto standard. So we&#x27;ll never have, say, a new TCP, but we&#x27;ll have an AppleTCP.')
