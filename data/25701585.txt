I might have my IDE with whatever I’m working on in browser on one desktop while I have all my communication stuff (email, chat etc.) on another desktop and then my random browsing on a third. But as you say running multiple tabs of Firefox and Slack and the IDE when you’re really only using about a third of them at any given time is a pretty big waste of resources.')
