Fundamentally, there is a lot of guesswork (aka parameterizations) but these are all tuned with as much data as we can get.  Projections made in 1980 and 1990 have been pretty accurate so far, and show the warming world we live in now, so it should count for something.<p>But despite all of the complexities in the science, I think people have missed the human element.  The hundreds of thousands of people that have already died from climate change, such as: the increase in tropical cyclones, the crop failures which sparked the Syrian civil war, the mass migration therefrom which has sparked the rise of nativism and right populism in Western democracies, expansion of harmful insects into environments that used to be too cold to support them that cause fires or famines, and the water shortages worldwide which add economic stress to the people.  None of these things are directly attributable to climate change, but collectively they set a story that we&#x27;re already in the middle of a climate disaster.<p>Will we all die?  No.  But the mass death and destruction is already around us.  And if we keep burning fossil fuels, it can only get worse.')
