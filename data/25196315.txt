You start with a capital investment, often times through a loan, and through smart management, make a profit <i>on the margin</i>, that you can choose to reinvest to stay competitive.<p>Proof-of-stake is completely unlike this. People who &quot;have&quot; are not required to exchange any effort to reap new reward. They retain purchasing power while the &quot;have-nots&quot; lose purchasing power.<p>I dunno if I struck a nerve with you with these points about proof of stake or something. I&#x27;m not completely against it - I think it should be tried, and Ethereum is a great network to try it with. But I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s completely perfect. I also think proof-of-work is very defensible and likely to succeed in unexpected ways.')
