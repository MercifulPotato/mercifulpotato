Item(by='pmiller2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603320991, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24848007, text='Yeah, I bought a <i>Mathematica 12</i> license from a company on eBay for $100 recently.  I figured maybe they acquired it in some sort of liquidation sale, or something.  $100 wouldn&#x27;t be an unreasonable price in that context, since it typically sells for around $350 for a personal &#x2F; hobbyist licence.  Turns out they want you to download the app from some shady site that has nothing to do with Wolfram Research, then email them for a license code.<p>Yeaaaahh, no.  I know you&#x27;re asking me to download some pirated shit and then just running a keygen.  I could do that myself for free if I was interested.  No, thanks.<p>All I&#x27;m really wondering now is if there&#x27;s anyone other than Wolfram Research and eBay that I should report this to.')
