Case A is obviously[0] a explicitly-handle error (just like &quot;the data we&#x27;re operating on is malformed&quot;), whereas case B is obviously a just-give-up error (like &quot;the system doesn&#x27;t have a floating-point unit&quot;). But there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any practical way to reliably distinguish the two cases, and it&#x27;s not clear they can be rigorously separated even in principle.<p>0: we might decide to &#x27;handle&#x27; it <i>by</i> aborting, but that&#x27;s not special to allocation')
