Just in the energy sector, we should do a massive build-out of wind, solar, transmission, and, yes, nuclear.<p>&gt; switching to wind+solar+storage and in the process democratizing energy production<p>These have large economies of scale too. While you might want to install a small propeller in your back yard, it&#x27;s much more cost effective to get the energy from the grid supplied by a large scale wind farm.<p>&gt; rethinking mobility (massive expansion of public transport, massive price reduction of public transport, massive investion in biking infrastructure, making outer city districts more attractive), putting a prize on CO₂ with a substantial steering effect (but ensuring that the proceeds of such a tax are given, in equal parts, to the population, so that people who contribute less-than-average to the climate crisis have more money available at the end of the day), transforming the system (because even with a prize for CO₂, there are lots of valuable things which cannot be measured in dollars, and competition pressure in unchecked capitalism deepens inequality and exploitation), ...<p>These may all be good ideas (and personally, I would certainly agree with some of those), but has nothing to do with whether the needed energy is produced by renewables, nuclear, or mass deployment of hamster wheels.')
