While the USA had completely bombed all strategic targets by the end, the decision (rightly or wrongly) to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki was done to force Japan’s surrender. The USA had suffered significant casualties invading other islands on the way to Japan, and did not want to suffer more. Of course there were other options than murdering civilians to win that, and that makes the use of atomic weapons morally unjustifiable.<p>That aside, the USA never invaded Japan with ground forces. The occupation force was “allowed” entry after capitulation, where a number of allowances were made to Japan to make this more acceptable. Germany on the other hand did not capitulate until after Berlin had fallen to a ground assault, and really had no bargaining whatsoever for the shape of the occupation.<p>On top of that, it should not be overlooked that the USA gained an “ally” in Japan at that point, and racism allowed for the horrors to be overlooked in a way that Germany was not. Also, there’s probably some part of this that was effected by the fact that the USA and other European nations did not recognize the Chinese government after the war and therefor demands for repercussions against Japan on behalf of the Chinese were not necessarily something that was “heard”.')
