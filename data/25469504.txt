In some areas, the cost of living is much higher.  The commonly provided solution to living somewhere the cost of living is too high is move.  Unfortunately, moving comes with all sorts of other constraints that are rarely considered.<p>I this case, we&#x27;re talking about a family, so what if one or both of the the spouses needs to work but can&#x27;t find work or is paid much less in the new location?  Is it still a net win if the family income is reduced to a large degree?<p>What if there is family in the current location but not any target location?  Beyond any help they may be able to provide (child care, if not regularly, in special circumstances), they may provide a real tangible mental health benefit compared to living in a new location where you know few if any people.  Or what if you&#x27;re providing help to that family member, and leaving would be problematic?<p>The bottom line is that is that some people are stuck in or around places like SF making very little compared to the cost of living in the area, but also don&#x27;t feel like they are in a position they can leave.  If you made $80k in SF and lived in SF or close enough to commute, you might find that a large portion of that goes purely to housing.  For a family, probably $24k a year minimum, even if you commute in from an hour away.')
