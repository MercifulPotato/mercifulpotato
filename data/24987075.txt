It&#x27;s the same in other languages and it is nice to have some flexibility.<p>E.g. lisp: use whichever type of parentheses you want\nOr Kotlin: use short syntax lambdas fruits.filter(it == apple) or long syntax fruits.filter(fruit -&gt; fruit == apple) or with annotated types: fruits.filter{fruit: Fruit -&gt; fruit == apple}<p>Sometimes brevity is good for the reader, sometimes more details are good for the reader.
