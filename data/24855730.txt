You can’t do it for months (since if it’s all in one direction you will start getting relativistic, one month of 1g gets you to almost 0.1c) but at medium speeds it isn’t too bad. Suppose you have a megaton ship moving at 100km&#x2F;s with 10 m&#x2F;s^2 acceleration<p>Power = m v a = 1e9 x 1e5 x 1e1 = 1e15 W<p>While petawatt is a lot, a megaton ship is also huge. Epstein drive is a fusion drive of sort, the easiest aneutronic reaction would be<p>B+p -&gt; C + 16 MeV<p>So 2.5e-12 Joules per fusion<p>Which means you need to burn<p>1e15 J&#x2F;s &#x2F;(2.5e-12 J&#x2F;atom)*(2e-26 kg&#x2F;atom) = 8 kg&#x2F;s<p>Suppose your engine runs at 10% efficiency, it means you are powering a megaton ship on less than a 100kg&#x2F;s of material. So if your megaton ship starts as 10% fuel you have ~115 days of continuous thrust.')
