He starts off with vector spaces, after providing some intuition, and uses it to drive the rest of the book. He defines matrices in terms of linear maps, and talks about operations on vector spaces, with small sections dedicated to the corresponding matrix computations. There&#x27;s no hand-waving or lack of rigor.<p>Overall, a fine textbook.')
