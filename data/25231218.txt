In other words, if we don&#x27;t account for jurisdiction then any international conflict could be considered &quot;terrorism&quot;, which doesn&#x27;t pass a common sense test.<p>* The Oxford definition stipulates &quot;and intimidation&quot;, not &quot;<i>or</i> intimidation&quot;. There&#x27;s no indication that the aggressor&#x27;s intent was to intimidate (rather, if they wanted to intimidate, they would have attacked the target&#x27;s family or otherwise not been so surgical).')
