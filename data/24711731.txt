I still love his sincere way of playing them, that doesn&#x27;t try to turn them into show-off pieces. I prefer Brendel&#x27;s Beethoven to Gould&#x27;s most of the time. But the limitations of Brendel&#x27;s techinque are sometimes detectable in his playing. From a technical standpoint Gould is on another planet from Brendel, and I don&#x27;t think Brendel himself would disagree with this.<p>On top of his unique approach to everything he played, Gould was one of the most technically adept pianists of all time, in league with Marc-Andre Hamelin, Yuja Wang, and only a few others.')
