Wasting other people&#x27;s resources is bad manners and contributes to a culture where waste is acceptable.<p>&gt; waste of my time :&#x2F;&quot; is really toxic.<p>It was honest feedback. If others feel the same way the product marketing team is making a potentially serious mistake. Give me info, not anime android animations. It wasn&#x27;t toxic.<p>&gt; but you couldn&#x27;t even get past a landing page because it had some gifs is really just your loss, not anybody else&#x27;s.<p>If other people feel the same way, it very definitely stops being my problem and becomes the product&#x27;s problem as people get turned off it. That was a core point you missed.<p>&gt;  could have linked you to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.radicle.xyz&#x2F;docs&#x2F;what-is-radicle.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.radicle.xyz&#x2F;docs&#x2F;what-is-radicle.html</a>.<p>Why in your view was this not on the front page at the top?<p>(edit, and see this link &amp; earlier reply <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25321788" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25321788</a>)<p>&gt; but your comment ... but they aren&#x27;t doing you justice<p>Thanks (genuinely) but I stand by this. It said what was wrong (IMO). it said what I wanted (again IMO), it was honest if blunt feedback the marketeers could use to decide if my point had merit (if they can admit they <i>might</i> have been wrong).<p>We differ but I appreciate your constructive feedback.')
