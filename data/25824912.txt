Distributing it over a greater area reduces the effectiveness proportionally.<p>The problem in the end is launch costs. Yes, we&#x27;re getting better, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we can shoot up a &quot;visible to the naked eye&quot;-sized impactor. Not to mention what difficulties an object of that size would bring for non-garbage that also occupies those orbits.<p>Lastly, I have no idea how much research there has been in containing the fragmentation of hypervelocity impacts. But presumably it would be an important part of the mission to not generate more garbage.')
