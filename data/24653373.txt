Also, supporting the number of languages we do (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repl.it&#x2F;languages" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repl.it&#x2F;languages</a>) is a hard tooling problem -- we have to build generic protocols for all IDE actions like executing, debugging, authoring, running tests, writing files, etc. Finally, it&#x27;s an incredibly challenging frontend&#x2F;design problem to build a fast collaborative in-browser IDE that&#x27;s both powerful and simple.<p>It&#x27;s a great time to be joining us, we&#x27;re still 16 full-time people, we reach millions of coders a month, and we&#x27;re backed by YC and a16z.')
