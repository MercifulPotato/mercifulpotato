The benchmarks come out at about the same per $ (AMD wins by 10-15%).  Sure you could get the 3080 ... or the 6800XT.  Pick your price point and AMD and Nvidia will have something close.  Sure AMD has nothing to compete at the $1500 price point, but the reviews I&#x27;ve seen claim that the $1500 nvidia is just a big waste not close to justifying the price.<p>PS5, Xbox X&#x2F;S, and Apple have been preferring AMD lately.  Even Tesla seems excited by the RNDA2 cards.')
