I notice this when hearing rural Dutch accents, but even worse for me personally is that I notice this when I hear non-native Dutch accents. Just last week I heard someone I have in high esteem from their writing speak in English before, and the disconnect between the image I formed immediately afterwards and the one I already had was disturbing.<p>The thing is: I&#x27;ve got a typical Dutch accent myself - which, probably because I&#x27;ve heard it most often, is the one that sounds least intelligent to me. The result being that I get unconfident when speaking in English, knowing how much of a disadvantage it is in terms of being perceived as intelligent.')
