If you drink water with a non-empty stomach, would that still be a problem? Or is it that pure water has some &quot;magical&quot; property that I hadn&#x27;t thought of?<p>Second, anecdotally, I find distilled water to taste better. I&#x27;ve drunk tap water, boiled water, and distilled water side by side, and I prefer distilled.<p>Third, the longer term changes, can they be remedied if you take supplements or mineral-rich diet?')
