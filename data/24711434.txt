I think the shift to &quot;competing with oneself&quot; is an attempt to move away from the external validation to give one meaning.<p>That said, I think these are issues that are always going to come up in life. I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily describe it as a quarter-life crisis. The crisis part is the realization that these are real issues one has to reckon with, essentially forever. That&#x27;s life.<p>I think with age (being 42 and knowing how much more driven I was in my youth), you do eventually start to realize competing with others or even oneself is not necessarily a great goal. Life is about experiences and living. Sometimes things go your way, sometimes they don&#x27;t. A lot of it isn&#x27;t in your control.<p>Trying to be better than others or yourself a year ago is very hard to sustain. You eventually have to be okay with who you are where you are right now. That doesn&#x27;t mean you give up on dreams, just that you hold them in their proper context.')
