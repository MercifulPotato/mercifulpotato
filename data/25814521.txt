The Big Rip happens in the remote future if the equation of state parameter w is less than -1, where w is the ratio of dark energy pressure to its energy density. If this is true it is only a minor detail of the Heat Death as far as life within this universe is concerned: all biological life and biological consciousness will end whether the Big Rip happens before the Heat Death or does not happen. (If there is non-biological Life after Death as various religions maintain, then consciousness will survive the Heat Death, but otherwise it will not.) The Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC) of Penrose is speculative and has zero strong empirical evidence to support it. They&#x27;ve studied the CMB but it has made no testable and verifiable predictions. The astrophysics community at large sees the observational inevitability of the end of the universe as we know it: the universe is flying apart and cooling, and nothing can change this.')
