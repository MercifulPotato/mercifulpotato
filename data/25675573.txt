These are old accounts and I do have well-behaved IMAP emails from smaller hosts, but it would be nice to manage everything with mbsync. Trashing emails in mu4e and then syncing results in them being deleted from my local [Gmail]&#x2F;Trash while they somehow remain in the remote. I thought Outlook.com would be fine considering they use more standard folders rather than the tagging system which seems to result in duplicates, but I have the same issues there. This is with Expunge None, which I expect would leave emails alone until the server empties them from the Trash.<p>The bizarre thing is that no one online seems to have these issues? The mbsync configs for Gmail just seem to work for people, or something. I do have auto-expunge turned off in Gmail, so I’m kind of at my wit’s end with it. It’s a shame because it is an amazing program. It synced 10,000 emails without a hitch. I only started getting issues when I tried to sync from my maildir to the IMAP store.')
