Think hard about why each solution is good and each decision is bad.<p>- Within each solution, attempt to find common patterns in that problemspace (when working with Sharded databases, this approach brings these results, etc)<p>- Try to match your personal and organization requirements against the various patterns you find and the pros&#x2F;cons you defined previously<p>During implementation<p>- Keep a running list of things that seem weird, or things that seem great, or things that turned out to be untrue<p>- Don&#x27;t stop implementing, but for each thing you found that wasn&#x27;t great in step 1, try to find a better way to approach that thing (while moving forward)<p>Post implementation<p>- Compile all the notes you made in pre&#x2F;during into a manageable list of goods&#x2F;bads.<p>- Use this to drive A.) iterations of your solution, and B.) future solutions<p>If you do this enough times, you&#x27;ll have a pretty decent list of your experiences in a space, and you&#x27;ll start to notice patterns as you try different things and become exposed to problems, their solutions and their tradeoffs. Eventually you won&#x27;t even have to look at your previous notes very often, as you&#x27;ll have built up a pretty decent amount of experience in various problemspaces such that you can predict what goes well&#x2F;doesn&#x27;t go well.<p>Also worth noting, this type of behavior doesn&#x27;t really have to be applied to software, but will also gain you big points with future employers when interviewing. You&#x27;d be surprised to find how many candidates never stopped to reflect on the work they&#x27;d done, why it was sub-optimal, or how it could be corrected moving forward.  Response like &quot;We did it ____ way because that&#x27;s how we always did it.&quot; Which, from a progress standpoint, is basically a none-answer.<p>Note: this is obviously just my opinion, and I&#x27;m no expert in &quot;Becoming a Master of Stuff&quot;, but these are the methods that I have used and seen my peers use (in one form or another) over quite a long time. Sometimes not as obvious (doing these things in your head vs. writing them down), but the shape is always pretty similar. Ultimately I think being reflective is one of the best skills a person can possess (with respect to employment and I guess also relationships). Acting without thinking is reckless, I think.')
