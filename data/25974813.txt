Would be good to get this idea seen by Sanders. RIAA would do just about anything to stop this law. Right now they claim that a downloaded song (without their permission) or a movie makes them lose 10k usd a some fantasy amount in that range. But then IRS could multiply this amount by the number of songs they own and demand 2% - in line with property taxes. Better 3%, since IP rights, unlike houses, are active assets that bring royalties.')
