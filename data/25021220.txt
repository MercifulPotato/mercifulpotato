They didnâ€™t get anything, a neighbour scared them off.<p>She was obviously shocked about it.<p>Rumours spread on the local Facebook group and was picked up by the local paper who ran a story two week later.<p>My Nan then read about how lots of things had been stolen from her house and now believes the paper, not the reality she had lived.<p>If people are willing to believe what they are told third hand rather than what they know themselves, what hope is there?')
