Nor does it account for the fact that it also needs to be overbuilt if its going to supply an energy storage system either. Nor does it account for the energy storage costs.<p>So, yes in absolute KW produced its cheaper, but that does little but create an oversupply problem. Which is why in places like TX the power costs frequently go to zero when the wind is blowing and spike at other times. Making cheap power when you don&#x27;t need it doesn&#x27;t help. What TX needs is lots of power at 3PM (when in theory solar would be useful, but the existing smaller plants aren&#x27;t making money either).<p>The net result in TX has been lots of wind install, but even more gas install. Because the gas plants are actually making money. If big battery plants are economically workable then we would also see a lot of companies arbitraging the free wind energy into $ when the price spikes but we don&#x27;t see that either.<p>So its not a simple&#x2F;sure bet like is being claimed.<p>(for those that don&#x27;t know, TX is one of the largest green energy systems in the world <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wind_power_in_Texas" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wind_power_in_Texas</a>)')
