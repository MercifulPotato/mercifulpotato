They are the reason why such thing as OSHA exists today. They are the reason some laws were passed to protect workers in the US.<p>But once these mandates became law, corporations used the arguments of &quot;why do we need unions if the law already protects workers?&quot; This and following Reagan&#x27;s firing of the air traffic controllers changed the image of unions. They were now corrupt middlemen that charged you a fee to be part of the club.<p>And it worked. Trying to form a union is now news instead of being the natural course of things. I wager that most people in the tech side of Amazon have a hard time grasping why their coworkers are trying to unionize. (we get paid well, what&#x27;s the fuss all about?)<p>I hope they vote in their interest, but I&#x27;m doubtful it will pass (I hope I&#x27;m wrong). These laws that are supposed to protect workers are enforced by the company&#x27;s HR department[1]. The problem is that HR will side with the company before siding with any employee.<p>I think we need to start looking into reforming HR and making it a public service.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;idiallo.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;unions-are-not-coming-back" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;idiallo.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;unions-are-not-coming-back</a>')
