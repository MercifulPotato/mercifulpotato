I don’t think iOS has any of the new virtualization APIs added in Big Sur, either.<p>That said, the userspace APIs need to be made much more robust before kexts are deprecated, and so to me <i>that</i> is what Apple should be pressured to do. Kernel extensions should be a last resort, not the go-to solution, because the reality is that they’re a security nightmare and have been readily abused (remember the mess with Dropbox of all things installing a kext?)')
