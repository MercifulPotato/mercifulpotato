At least no big and expensive ones (don&#x27;t want to waste money for a potential dust collector).<p>- Possible while doing home-office (just a nice to have; but see no alternative to a treadmill anyways)<p>- any science based plan on how or what I should train? I guess moving in general is already the biggest benefit though.<p>Or any other ideas?<p>If it has to be something like pushups it at least has to be a routine simple enough so I don&#x27;t have to watch some fitness dude or gal on youtube and follow them. I&#x27;d rather watch or listen to something interesting in that time.<p>I&#x27;m easily bored doing just sport and also already know every street around the block. If it wasn&#x27;t for covid I&#x27;d try to pick up indoor climbing because it has these nice challenges. I also like cycling, gets me to places I haven&#x27;t been, but it takes 1h just to get out of the city where it&#x27;s fun.')
