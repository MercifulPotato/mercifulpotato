Someone who negotiates down from that number feels like they got a better deal than someone who was negotiated up to it.<p>I admit it&#x27;s not exactly applicable to salary negotiation, but IMO leading with a high number can help cement the counterparty&#x27;s perception of your value. I think it really depends on what type of company (and what level of its food chain) you&#x27;re applying for.')
