If someone comes in to my home with a gun, even if they are a &quot;good guy&quot;, the odds of my dying by gunshot would instantly go up by a large multiple.<p>In comparison, the odds that I&#x27;m going to suffer a home invasion, that I would have been shot without the friendly gun owner, and that person successfully prevents it is vanishingly small.<p>I realize that not everybody lives where that calculation comes out that way, but to claim it CCW makes sense everywhere is unsupportable.')
