It&#x27;s really hard for my mind to visualize what `$0.0000000021 per millisec` actually is.<p>Being billed by the millisecond does not mean that you should give a pricing per millisecond.<p>I prefer Digital Ocean or Heroku&#x27;s approach of billing by the second, but giving the price per month. How on hell is `$0.0000000021 per millisec` better than `$5&#x2F;month, billed by the millisecond`? If I know that my workload will be about 20% of a dedicated CPU, I know that I&#x27;ll end up paying about $1 per month.')
