In your estimation, how many years passed between Growl being technically possible and it actually existing?<p>I was using NeXT OS, which is what later became OS X, circa 1990. Growl apparently launched in 2003. So that&#x27;s a minimum of 13 years that something &quot;obvious&quot; was missed. And it&#x27;s probably more fair to count from the mid-1980s, when GUIs first started becoming popular. That doesn&#x27;t sound obvious to me.<p>Most things are obvious in retrospect. But it&#x27;s a mistake to confuse your after-the-fact perspective for what was going on at the time. (For those who are interested, Dekker&#x27;s &quot;Field Guide to Understanding &#x27;Human Error&#x27;&quot; is a great look at how subtle and dangerous that confusion can be.)')
