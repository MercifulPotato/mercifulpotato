No way! :D<p>The Roland TR-909 is also extremely popular and was considered the sound of techno and house even after the TR-808 started to fade outside hip-hop. In the mid-90s it was one of the first drum machines to start being cloned by new manufacturers due to the demand. The bass drum is still used as the foundation for a lot of EDM. It never went away... while the 808 which is back but was considered pass√© even in hip-hop for a short while.<p>The TB-303 Bass Synth is also extremely sought after. It was <i>the</i> sound of Acid House in the late 80s and was also a mainstay in the 90s for a lot of producers, even though it&#x27;s limited. Today it&#x27;s kind of a novelty but you still hear it in some tracks. More recently Behringer made a clone and Roland reissued it.<p>Both of those two got in the vernacular of EDM fans at the time.<p>Also the TR-606 has some cult status due to being used by artists like Autechre, Aphex Twin and Plastikman among others, which are sort of &quot;musician&#x27;s musicians&quot; among the electronic music crowd, although it wasn&#x27;t as famous as 303&#x2F;808&#x2F;909 among general listeners.')
