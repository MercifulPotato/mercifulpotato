What we got was a <i>summary</i> of what was said and that&#x27;s exactly my issue with the statement - summaries leave wiggle room for people to come back later and say &quot;well, that&#x27;s not <i>exactly</i> what I said&quot;.<p>&gt;Every single article published in any newspaper ever is a journalist claiming a source said something.<p>Yes, and there are conventions to make it clear when the journalist is directly quoting a source (the use of quotation marks) and when the journalist is giving their own summary of what the source said.')
