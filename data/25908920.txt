The story of the man who wore the glasses that turned everything upside down... and his brain just adapted to it and he saw things normally... is fascinating to me.<p>And then there&#x27;s my eyes. I have severe double vision (as a result of surgery last year) and my brain is just like &quot;meh, suck it up&quot;; and I&#x27;m left walking into things on regular basis because there&#x27;s two of everything. How come _his_ brain figured out upside down, and mine can&#x27;t figure out 2 of everything? (I&#x27;m not actually asking, just complaining a bit &#x2F;sigh)')
