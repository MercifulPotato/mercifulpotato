Item(by='academi', descendants=None, kids=[25527130], score=None, time=1608813329, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25526237, text='Could someone add support to automatically test this on an emulator?<p>Or, better yet, put in checks that prohibit future code from including those bad char seqs?<p>This is bigger than the cool pics of nostalgic hardware.<p>It reminds me of other compatibility problems over the years like:<p>1. Microsoft choosing the opposite slash and a different way of doing CLI options via slash vs dash.<p>2. Windows, Apple, and Linux not agreeing on a good filesystem and method of network access and supporting it together. Incompatibilities have wasted a great deal of time, and it’s unreasonable to think that every IT department will make changes to allow everything to work smoothly.<p>3. Microsoft Office, Lync, Skype for Business, Remote Desktop, etc. not including 1:1 functionality in the macOS versions of their products. This is evil since the user can’t do things that others can. Similarly, Microsoft changed menus and where things are located between versions. Should a wooden chair be the Mac version of a couch because they’re both butt-compatible? Should marmite be the next version of strawberry jam because they both spread on toast and are tasty?<p>4. Programming language tools and libraries that favor one OS over another or one well-used database over another.<p>While supporting compatibility can be a timesuck, here we have fish shell spending the time supporting a minority, which is great.<p>But large companies, leaders of small well-used projects, and everything in-between are self-sabotaging the future of all life on our planet by wasting others’ time because they want to do their own thing or want to make people not like some other company’s product.<p>Incompatibility and not working together isn’t healthy competition, beneficial capitalism, or good business. It’s going to kill us.')
