Reduce this number by 90% and we are well below one infection per infected, so it is not sustained. This assumes that everyone would be vaccinated.<p>Currently we are doing something similar: each measure like wearing a mask, social distancing, meeting fewer people, ventilating rooms, finding infected people before they can infect someone else (&quot;contact tracing&quot;) contributes to reducing the number of follow-up infections a bit. (This is why <i>&quot;but masks do not</i> really <i>work&quot;</i> is an ill-informed argument. They do not have to because they are meant to be used together with other measures to achieve reduction in spread)<p>A vaccine will protect us passively instead of requiring us to actively following these measures and will therefore be a lot more convenient.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Basic_reproduction_number" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Basic_reproduction_number</a>')
