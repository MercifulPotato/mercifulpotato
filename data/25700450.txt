That&#x27;s just stupid.<p>And people intent on doing crimes most of the time don&#x27;t really need guns for it, it is just suspicious to carry a gun around and if you are doing something shady you want to bring as little suspicion as possible. And adds charges for illegal gun possession in case you are caught with one.<p>Gun regulation is mostly to stop stupid people act stupidly with a gun they already lawfully own, to stop people who for various reasons shouldn&#x27;t own a gun from owning one legally and also to cool down the police so that it doesn&#x27;t <i>feel</i> it has to shoot suspects on sight. (Notice stress on the word &quot;feel&quot;)<p>I am all for gun regulation, I just feel it is a bad example for regulation.')
