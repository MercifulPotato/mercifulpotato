It is not fun by any means. Not even tolerable.<p>While I never really thought this was a big deal, the Julia devs <i>certainly</i> do, and I&#x27;m a little upset on their behalf that you&#x27;d say this. An amazing amount of developer time and effort has been going into reducing loading times and compiler latency lately. The currently release, 1.5.2 is leagues faster at package loading than the previous version and the upcoming 1.6 release candidate is even faster.<p>They recently implemented multi-threaded precomilation and have been going on a method invalidation crusade doing largely thankless work to deal with exactly this sort of whining.')
