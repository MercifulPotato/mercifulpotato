That is an important distinction.<p>I&#x27;m not saying Trump isn&#x27;t accepting payments for pardons, I&#x27;m saying the NYT article linked above isn&#x27;t reporting that.  They&#x27;re reporting on lobbying efforts, which don&#x27;t appear to be illegal.<p>People pay for the President&#x27;s time quite frequently.  What&#x27;s interesting about this story is that the folks with access are trying directly to solicit from convicts.  I think that&#x27;s fairly new or at least newsworthy.')
