This, our instructor told us, was the MCAS system becoming active or “waking up”. What was happening behind the scene was the MCAS logic took a “snapshot” of the existing trim position when its threshold AOA was reached. It then calculated a maximum amount of trim that could be added. Should the trim ever meet this computed limit, the speed trim and MCAS system becomes inhibited for the remainder of the flight.<p>This seems like one of those overly complex behaviors that&#x27;s indistinguishable from  &quot;randomly decides to just stop working&quot; when someone doesn&#x27;t fully understand (or remember) all the details. Is this common in aircraft, especially for critical flight systems?\nDoes a normal fly-by-wire system do things like this?')
