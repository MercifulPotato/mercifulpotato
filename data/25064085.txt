I haven&#x27;t seen it presented anywhere else, and I&#x27;m not super familiar with the subject matter. It feels a little socially awkward to ask someone to check if it is right&quot;, and I started trying to express it in Lean.<p>However, I found it difficult to get the implicit type parameters to work right, so I had trouble even formulating the claim in Lean. (the claim was a claim in category theory, and the category theory library for Lean has lots of implicit argument stuff, and probably shouldn&#x27;t have been the first thing I tried to use Lean for. Also the claim I was trying to show is probably very simple for category theory people.)')
