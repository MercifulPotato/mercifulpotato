Now, statins were brand new and not used really broadly.  Pfizer did a ton of follow up studies, but looking at the most current label.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.accessdata.fda.gov&#x2F;drugsatfda_docs&#x2F;label&#x2F;2009&#x2F;020702s056lbl.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.accessdata.fda.gov&#x2F;drugsatfda_docs&#x2F;label&#x2F;2009&#x2F;02...</a><p>The two biggest trials, ASCOT and CARDS, which measured improvements in mortality (needed to be big trials to measure any difference), they were ~10,000 and ~2,000 patients each.<p>So suffice to say, Lipitor, which is used in a massive population, has probably been tested, in clinical trials, on a total number of patients comparable to the Pfizer Covid vaccine trial.  Obviously the duration of the Lipitor trials were much longer <i>and</i> there a massive body of clinical data from actual use, but it at least gives you some perspective on numbers.')
