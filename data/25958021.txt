I think too many developers start thinking of testing as the goal rather than as the means.  What this means to me is I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s technically an integration test vs a unit test, I care that it tests _REALITY_.<p>There are times when the isolation given by mocking can be useful, but I submit it&#x27;s useful far far less often than many claim.  And your examples are a good use as well.<p>But imo trying to mock everything is mostly mental masturbation only with long-term maintenance costs.')
