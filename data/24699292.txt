But literally no one has asked us to enable it on their apps. So we never made it self service.<p>I think for most companies, it&#x27;s better to set the expectation that the service costs money, bursts will cost more money, and then forgive outlier charges once or twice. It&#x27;s tremendously difficult to compete against the AWS&#x27;s of the world, putting work into features specifically to minimize how much people spend seems like a good way to fail a company.')
