I wonder if there&#x27;s anyone on this planet that is able <i>to even consider the possibility</i> that understanding is important, maybe even when it seems like it isn&#x27;t.  In any normal undertaking, if what you&#x27;re trying isn&#x27;t working, it would seem logical to try something else.  But when the scope of the undertaking gets too large, this thinking seems to mysteriously change.<p>Enjoy your day as well.  :)')
