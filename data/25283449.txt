I&#x27;m not denying this can be interesting, but I&#x27;ve been thinking for a while to get my hands dirty with hardware as a side project. (I&#x27;m a software eng by profession). I haven&#x27;t really done a lot of research on this yet, but does anyone have any recommended guides&#x2F;books&#x2F;tutorials on how to get started designing and building my own computer? (extra points it it&#x27;s a mobile&#x2F;embedded computer)')
