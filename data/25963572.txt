City is better for meeting people, seaside town for raising children. Remote work is generally good for work-life balance, nobody cares if I stay at home with a sick child or finish early for a school play, but I probably travelled a lot more than I otherwise would have.<p>I thought (and was told) remote work would be a career limiter, but I have still ended up where I want to be (ML research).<p>What I miss most is being around many like-minded colleagues. What I enjoy most is being able to close the door to my office and work uninterrupted for as long as I choose.<p>I think I’m more productive because I can’t just “show up”; if I’m not making a difference I might as well have spent the day at the beach.')
