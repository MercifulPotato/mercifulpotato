To reach the conclusion that the &#x27;harm&#x27; group are reaching, set your move transaction cost¹ to a large value and add a local-relationships parameter that depends on time-spent-at-current-location and weight it very highly as well.<p>Should you so desire, you may want to add in a cost to capture the notion of how a person moving contributed to the improvement. This will usually need to be inflated above the true economic contribution (IKEA effect, etc.).<p>The local-relationships parameter may be effectively quadratic (since a person moving diminishes their relationships and relationships are two-sided).<p>¹ It is clear you know this but for other readers that may not, that&#x27;s not just the monetary cost.')
