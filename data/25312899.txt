At most I may call some argument &quot;stupid&quot;.<p>Mostly when it comes to criticizing socialism or feminism, it doesn&#x27;t last long.<p>I just tried to look up one of the old accounts where dang banned me and we even had an email discussion about it. But as the account is banned, I can not look up the comments I wrote anymore.<p>Edit: I think I remember, often the argument is that &quot;politics are not welcome on HN&quot;. But there are political topics on HN all the time (women in tech, worker unions at Amazon, and so on and so on). I never bring them up, but when they emerge, I sometimes join the discussion. That&#x27;s when I get banned for &quot;talking politics&quot;, even though I only comment on other people&#x27;s (socialist) politics. So it is not usually about &quot;civility&quot;, it is pretense for censoring unwanted opinions.')
