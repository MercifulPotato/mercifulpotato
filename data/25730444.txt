But always happy to have HN debug my fridge, so here we go: turns out the light bulb, when replaced, keeps overheating and even metled the surrounding casing. Some electrical issue I&#x27;d have to take the fridge apart to debug. I might be unfair with this one though, it&#x27;s a 20 year old fridge and is probably serviceable.')
