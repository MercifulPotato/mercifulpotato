An idea I&#x27;ve seen proved true more times than I&#x27;d like to count is that &quot;if you don&#x27;t want power abused, don&#x27;t create it in the first place.&quot; Any power granted WILL be misused and usually almost immediately and because the incentive is always to make it not LOOK like it&#x27;s being abused, people get hilariously creative in how they do it, just making it look even more comic book evil.<p>I&#x27;ve been around long enough to have a fairly strong sense now that the only way to win is to deny it battle - never concentrate power in the first place. But I think that genie has already escaped and isn&#x27;t going back in the bottle without a huge amount of suffering and death.')
