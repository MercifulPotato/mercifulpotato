Usually, turning a profit while moving a product at the cheapest possible price involves maximizing volume, cutting quality to be bare minimum, and ruthlessly eliminating overhead. Like, if there aren&#x27;t thousands of people on the internet complaining about how crappy your quality is, you probably need to cut it further. I haven&#x27;t studied it, but I have a hunch that most of the type of people who surf HN for business advice aren&#x27;t interested in being in a commodity industry where you have to do these things to have a viable business. Or if they find themselves in one, they aren&#x27;t going to be ruthless enough in the right directions to make it. They better find the right place to get advice for that sort of business, or they won&#x27;t last long.')
