And this is a good part of the &quot;real&quot; grievance of both young people and working class minorities, especially in big cities in my opinion.<p>It&#x27;s not working class wages haven&#x27;t risen, they have. But, the costs of housing, healthcare, education and many other necessities have risen at a much faster pace, particularly in cities. These rises in cost are of course profits to someone so the economy is &quot;booming. But it&#x27;s become so distorted that it&#x27;s becoming increasingly hard to keep up for the lower wage earners with no end in site. Of course the owners of assets don&#x27;t see the problem. Their properties and stocks are appreciating nicely. And the fed has been encouraging this.<p>Now, one argument might be that if this wasn&#x27;t occurring that low wage earners would be even worse off with no jobs and and there may be some validity to that point of view but the inequality of this isn&#x27;t just an abstract ethical problem at this point but rather a system threatening problem. I don&#x27;t know that there is an easy fix either. It often seems trying to fix one problem with rent controls, wage floors, progressive taxation etc. results in other problems. But the increase in costs of housing, medical care etc. while wages grow at a much slower rate isn&#x27;t sustainable imo.')
