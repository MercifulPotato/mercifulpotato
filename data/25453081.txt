I went back and forth on the different Sunny bikes to be honest. My biggest issue so far with Fitness+ is that it doesn&#x27;t sync up with the cadence sensor as I wrote about. If you have an Apple TV then that is ideal as you can use your phone for the cadence. I really like the Apple Watch integration, i have a video on the blog. I am enjoying the 1 month trial and hope they improve it.')
