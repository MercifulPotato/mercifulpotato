Those who obtain the new money first are able to spend it before prices have had time to adjust. As that new money propagates, the prices of the relevant goods and services are bid up.<p>As such, inflation gives an economic advantage to those who receive the new money sooner, and the consequent higher prices harm those further down the flow.<p>In short, and contrary to the implication of the above comment, inflation benefits banks and corporations (and by extension, the wealthy and powerful), and harms workers and those on fixed incomes.')
