I&#x27;m now very happy on a System76 laptop running PopOS.<p>With each new release of the OS, getting more and more locked down, I am happier that I moved on when I did.<p>The long term trend with Apple is for their computers to get more and more closed. First hardware, and now software. I get that for a phone, but it is completely antithetical to what a COMPUTER is supposed to be. They really should stop calling these things computers.<p>Huh.<p>After typing the above, I decided to check. THEY DO NOT call Macs &quot;computers&quot;. I searched the pages for MBPs, iMacs, and Mac Pros. They use the word &quot;computer&quot; in connection with trade-ins, (for the thing you are trading in), and they use the phrase &quot;computer system&quot; in fine print, and never to refer to their products directly.<p>APPLE, IN THEIR OWN WORDS, NO LONGER BUILDS COMPUTERS. That explains so much.')
