Not to smear my friends who worked there who must have to work incredibly hard given the conditions and the stress they were under, I always suspected their code must have been absolutely riddled with bugs, and I shuddered to think what it must have been like for the next poor grads who had to work on it after them.<p>And it was always some project where I was amazed there wasn&#x27;t already some mature software out there that accomplished what they were doing anyway.<p>But anyway they seemed to have fun so whatever')
