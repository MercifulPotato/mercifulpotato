For business writing, just consistently considering the active voice would improve many writers’ output.<p>“It was decided that we’d lower shipping prices.” versus “Chris decided to lower our shipping prices.”<p>I don’t know if writers choose the former because it feels fancier, because they notice other writers doing it (maybe because they struggled to read what was written and took notice of the pattern?), or because they don’t know or don’t want to commit to what actually happened, but it’s incredibly frustrating to read a sea of passively voiced sentences about what happened.')
