Item(by='Barrin92', descendants=None, kids=[24884297], score=None, time=1603598586, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24882565, text='&gt;<i>When I was a teen, growing up on a diet of Carl Sagan’s Cosmos and Alvin Toffler’s Futurism, I had plenty of big ideas: spaceflight, supersonic travel, mag-lev trains, geodesic domes, bio-nanotech for longevity, and social organization to provide maximum freedom for all. Cheesy, but optimistic.</i><p><i>Now I am 29 and I have no big, optimistic ideas.</i>[...]It feels like I’m in the belly of the ship, frenetically plugging leaky holes, never even having the space of mind to think where the ship should go. Ostensibly, those decisions are made on the bridge of the ship, which, in October 2020, seems to be populated by well-intentioned individuals, but hamstrung in their ability to make good collective decisions.*<p>So the author turned into an adult. Geodesic domes and flying cars are cool but whether the future is good or not will depend on many people doing boring work over many decades and stuffing those leaks in the ship. Torvalds has said many times that you make the future better fixing one pothole at a time, and what he has built proves that&#x27;s true. Bold visions aren&#x27;t all they&#x27;re cracked up to be and I&#x27;ll take the linux kernel and git over Bezos phallic rockets when it comes to world improvement in tech. What I&#x27;ll take from Bezos is the decidedly non-futuristic idea of putting books into boxes a little bit faster than everyone else. That made the world a bit better as well.')
