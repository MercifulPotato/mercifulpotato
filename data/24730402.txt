This seems to be THE major PROBLEM with covid 19. We lack basic data, and generally because we refuse to collect it.<p>To give one specific example:<p>&gt;Texas reported 1,490 cases among students for the week ending on September 27, with 1,080,317 students estimated at schoolâ€”a rate of about 0.14 percent.<p>Sounds great right? But texas didn&#x27;t test 1,080,317 students did they? They didn&#x27;t actually test anyone. So that 1490 cases could be 0 cases and 1490 kids with flu or over active imaginations. Or literally ever kid, all 1,080,317 could have covid. We have no actual idea.<p>The US system (government, healthcare and media) are totally unable to collect, process and publish basic statistics.<p>That&#x27;s what&#x27;s really terrifying here.')
