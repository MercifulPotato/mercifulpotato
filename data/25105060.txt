Clearly, the esprit de corps is not the best measure for what is best for HN.

It&#x27;s in that niche category &quot;publicizing my issue w&#x2F; Megacorp for traction&quot; and HN has been used&#x2F;abused as a vehicle for it often.  Mods haven&#x27;t stepped in, so I guess it&#x27;s ok?  And as a programmer, I would sympathize with the underdog as well, even it were against my own employer.')
