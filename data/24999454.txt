I just learned to avoid certain packages altogether and I&#x27;ve been living with the results.  Precomputing init() is an interesting idea and I could see it both increasing or decreasing the resulting binary depending on what&#x27;s in it (similar to how running LZW compression on an already compressed value will often create a larger result).  Of course, you also need to consider the init() execution time and I&#x27;ve generally built my &quot;main&quot; application to load really fast and then load sub-applications as libraries in the background.  Note that these are experiments and I don&#x27;t have a major WASM-based UI in production.')
