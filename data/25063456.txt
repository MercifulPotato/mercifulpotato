Item(by='mschuster91', descendants=None, kids=[25065521], score=None, time=1605131432, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25062955, text='Oh, there&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> more stuff that can be done to guns:<p>1) improve aim: embed wind and angle sensors, possibly even battlefield intel (position, weather, land layout) to account for any drift that might impact the bullet. Also, auto-fire if a designated target is in the crosshair (train the AI on human faces, combine with the previous sensoring). I would not be surprised if this technology will be developed rather sooner than later with armed robots, and then made smaller until it fits in a gun or at least a rifle.<p>2) improve&#x2F;rethink propulsion. Right now almost all guns operate by some form of bullet in a casing with explosive propellant (excluding the rare caseless guns and co2&#x2F;pressured gas sports guns). Railguns are already a thing at &quot;ship scale&quot;, it will be only a matter of time until it gets scaled down to hand-held guns.<p>3) improve projectiles. Right now bullets are dumb pieces of metal. Why not have active bullets (e.g. subminiature rockets) or bullets laced with poisons so that even a scrape kills in the end?<p>4) improve... guns themselves, as a concept - think laser guns a la Star Trek, highly focused microwave, sound or other energy.<p>In the end humanity will always improve ways to kill each other, and all the concepts are already there in sci-fi (and in the case of poison bullets, the Russians made it a reality with the Markov murder).')
