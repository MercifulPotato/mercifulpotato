Now, this time it&#x27;s a single screenshot used as substantial &#x27;proof&#x27; to support this Twitter hack. However, it is not good enough to suggest that it is genuine as it can be easily faked.<p>So it seems some choose to believe claims without the actual facts and evidence unfolding over time but what&#x27;s clear on Twitter and in this comments section is the number of users having symptoms of TDS. At least wait a bit until this fully develops rather than believing unverified reports or claims. We&#x27;re much better than this.')
