I haven’t built or bought a PC (had a few MacBooks in between) in probably 15 years, so this puppy is going to be well good enough for me and I’m looking forward to having a proper PC and getting a nice WSL and terminal setup and Scoop etc..<p>Question: any issue with WSL2 and network connectivity to say services such as node running in your wsl2 that you would connect to from your browser?  I’ve heard that in wsl2 there could be issues with this and you may have to do some workarounds or extra config magic..')
