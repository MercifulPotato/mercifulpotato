(don&#x27;t know about kafka streams)<p>Spark is a &quot;product&quot; -- it has extensive documentation, supports multiple languages, and generally is production-grade. It is full of &quot;nice-to-haves&quot;, like interactive status monitors, helper functions, serialization layers, and so on. It integrates with existing technologies (Hadoop, K8S, HDFS, etc..). It has this &quot;finished product&quot; feel.<p>&quot;differential dataflow&quot; seems to be a library. It only supports a single language. The documentation is very basic (it was not even clear if there is a way to run this on multiple machines or not). It is very bare-bones -- there are only a few dozens functions, and no resource monitors and interactive shells. It does not seem to integrate with anything. It has &quot;research software&quot; feel -- there are random directories in top-level repo, academic papers, and so on.<p>(it would probably be more fair to compare &quot;<i>materialize</i>&quot; to Spark...)')
