It&#x27;s pretty privacy focused and has worked well for me for a decent while. They&#x27;ve got a decent VPN service as well (I think it comes bundled with Protonmail at some tier level) and they just recently rolled out a beta for their Google Drive replacement.<p>All in all I&#x27;ve enjoyed their services. Their security&#x2F;E2E Encryption support is nice (could still use a bit more functionality though) and they are definitely a lot more FOSS friendly than Google when it comes to actually using their services.')
