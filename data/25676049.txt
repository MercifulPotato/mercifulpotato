For me, that&#x27;s not strong enough a case to say that Trump&#x27;s social media posts should be censored or blocked. I simply don&#x27;t see it as incitement of <i>violence</i>. His claims of fraud are misleading for sure, but if the standard is around &quot;violence&quot; specifically, I feel that blame cannot be laid at his feet in a provable manner - because this is a highly political, highly emotional situation, I am looking for evidence that would almost meet a legal standard, like beyond a reasonable doubt (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com&#x2F;Beyond+a+Reasonable+Doubt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com&#x2F;Beyond+a+Reas...</a>).<p>I also think the actions taken by tech companies here reflects a double-standard. For example, why isn&#x27;t AOC being blocked for supporting rioting? Why weren&#x27;t Democrats called out for attacks on federal property in Portland, Seattle, and other cities?
