(No grid connection, permanent off grid)<p>Do you need to be off grid UP TO 24 hours, with a grid connection most of the time?<p>Is your grid power cheap? If so, how cheap? It might be worth it only as a weather related backup if it is cheap, or might be worth going full off grid if not.<p>Do you plan on sustaining that 2kw the full 24 hr, or only peaking up to 2kw? If only peaking, for how long?<p>There are lots of potential trade offs that could help a lot in making it cheaper, or make it much more expensive if you canâ€™t do them.')
