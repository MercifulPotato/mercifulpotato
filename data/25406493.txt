On things like finance and gun laws, the Ls would vote with the Rs.  But on things like abortion and drug laws, the Ls would vote with the Ds.<p>The meaningful representation of a single third party thus already throws a wrench in the “conservative vs liberal” ideology.  “Us versus them” might still exist, sure, but it shifts per issue instead of being a polarized dichotomy.  It’s a step in the right direction.')
