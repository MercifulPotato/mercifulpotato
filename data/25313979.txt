I doubt it would be a good idea to run a 4k screen in true 4k if it meant everything became tiny and you needed a magnifying glass.<p>I think there may be some PC manufacturers doing this completely wrong. I&#x27;ve seen some Dells that are downright ridiculous. A high dpi computer should display large and readable fonts by default without any magnification. Look at any MacBook as an example.')
