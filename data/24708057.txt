A medium to large company could totally absorb a 5 figures bill, but that would be a dead sentence to my side project. Also, considering the variable costs of bandwidth of AWS, Azure or Cloudflare, one competitor could simple rent an OVH server and incur insane costs to my business while only spending 1&#x2F;10 of the money.<p>Right now, I&#x27;m using Heroku (with a limited number of dynos and a single PgSQL database) together with BunnyCDN (which allow me to pay for prepaid usage). If I ever get DDoS&#x27;ed, my app will most probably be inaccessible or at least significantly slower, while I&#x27;ll receive an email alert, from which I can decide myself to allocate more resources.')
