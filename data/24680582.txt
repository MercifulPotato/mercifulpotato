Or, it should be.  &quot;Publish or perish&quot; encourages breaking research into &quot;minimal publishable units&quot; which produces gobs of churn for everybody involved.<p>I&#x27;ve known a few professors that publish paper after paper with similar results and similar methods.  I suspect each of having a much deeper theorem, either under their hat, or (more generously) at the tip of their tongue.  If they&#x27;d take a bit of a break from the churn and focus on the deeper theorem, their actual impact on the field would be significantly more value.  We&#x27;d all get to read, write, or review, a small handful of papers instead of dozens.')
