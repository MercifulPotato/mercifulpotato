Especially the PDF link.<p>To anyone reading this:<p>Pages 100 onward, you get to see diagrams of how it was built, and pics of the retrieval system and info on methods.<p>Page 120 onward talks about that return unit in more detail.<p>Page 122 I found interesting, details about measures to prevent the return unit from falling into enemy hands.<p>Page 128 is a good summary image, with some details on the lower right.<p>Page 165 onward, especially 168 have actual shots.  168 looks better than the first Google Earth images, and you can easily make out and identify how many &#x27;things&#x27; the enemy has.<p>Sadly I have no more time currently to read, and more sadly some details are still redacted.  Understandable, when I ponder the nature of some of those redacted parts.  EG, privacy, current contractors still employed, tech methods still used on newer gear, at time of declassification.')
