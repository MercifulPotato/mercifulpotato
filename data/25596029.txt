Item(by='hundchenkatze', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609442070, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25595684, text='Bluetooth does have privacy issues, but again, that&#x27;s no different than a native app. If I install a native app, it doesn&#x27;t get free reign over BT or any other device feature. In order to use any hardware feature a native app has to request permission to use it. \nI don&#x27;t understand how a web app is any different in that regard. A PWA could specify the features it wants to use in the manifest.json just like a native app does with the Info.plist. Then iOS could prompt the user in the exact same way. If the iOS permission system isn&#x27;t a good design (I think it is) then why do they keep using it and expanding it for native apps but not use it for PWAs.')
