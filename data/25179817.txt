Maybe that is the only real path forward, but I dont ever stop into Guitar Center anymore since they usually only have the prosumer-ish gear that Im not interested in. They also seem to have much less used gear in each store, despite the influx of &#x27;sell yer gear here for cash&#x27; emails I get from them.<p>Edit: Another thing- part of the problem for US based retailers in general is MAP. Its price fixing, and in many cases I can go to, say Thomanmusic.com and order something from Germany for ~85% of the best price I can get at major retailers here, including shipping, tarriffs and foreign transaction fees. \nPersonally I think MAP is ridiculous and leads to TREMENDOUS waste of resources. Im buying something that was shipped from China to Europe, then shipping it back to Texas all for less money than US retailers will allow. WHY IS THAT?')
