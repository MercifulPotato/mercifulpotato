Regardless of which inflation metric you use (some include housing prices, some don’t), median income has risen.<p>As for the lower cluster, the most reliable metric to use there is the poverty rate...which has also substantially fallen -&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Noahpinion&#x2F;status&#x2F;1308790816937095169?s=20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Noahpinion&#x2F;status&#x2F;1308790816937095169?s=...</a><p>You can also look at the historic income trends divided up by quintile -&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.census.gov&#x2F;data&#x2F;tables&#x2F;time-series&#x2F;demo&#x2F;income-poverty&#x2F;historical-income-households.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.census.gov&#x2F;data&#x2F;tables&#x2F;time-series&#x2F;demo&#x2F;income-p...</a> (Table H1, All Races, it&#x27;s an Excel spreadsheet).
