Have you? How do you find working with it?<p>[1] I did also ask about selfhosted stuff, but I&#x27;m not willing to host Jenkins for myself. I&#x27;ve heard nothing but complaints about managing a Jenkins install. It&#x27;s been fine as a user (if a bit confusing), but I really don&#x27;t want to admin it.')
