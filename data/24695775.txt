The last one should be very easy to find in the code and if you are migrating to a new system the information should be transferred in some way. \nFor historical things you obviously has to store the data somewhere and then just figure out a nice way to do that. In this case it could just be a table of default contracts with some fields and a startdate. Then you can query for any point in the past and get the default contract that was active at that point.')
