Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606235040, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25199681, text='&gt; This site is made up of people, just like all the other sites out there. As a group, HN is no more or less susceptible to biases and irrationality than any other group of people or any other website.<p>From a binary perspective, agreed.  From this non-comprehensive perspective, you are correct.<p>But the reality here is more complex than a binary.<p>From a continuum perspective, is it actually <i>correct</i> that HN is &quot;just like all the other sites out there&quot;, that they are &quot;no more or less susceptible to biases and irrationality than any other group of people or any other website&quot;?<p>This level of <i>precise consistency</i> across any arbitrary grouping of people seems rather unlikely to occur in reality, and if it was like this, you&#x27;d think someone would have noticed it.  Also, this take on it seems rather contrary to my &quot;feel&quot; for the aggregate self-evaluation that the individuals members of this community have voiced.  I&#x27;m fine with either one, but perhaps it might be useful for us to decide on which it is.<p>If you think about it, if superior rationality <i>is literally impossible</i>, then are we not completely wasting our time on discussing where flaws exist in society, and which groups need to be focused on and improved (which is a very common topic of conversation around here)?  If nothing can be done, why do we not just abandon the entire topic of improving the world and devote the remainder of our short lives to enjoying ourselves?')
