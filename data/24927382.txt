The cursor is often drawn using a special &quot;hardware mouse cursor&quot; feature specifically designed to make a tiny bitmap move around the screen as efficiently as possible. It&#x27;d be easy for a driver to mess that up and cause the cursor -- and ONLY the cursor -- to look garbled.<p>You can see problems today like the mouse cursor not respecting Windows 10&#x27;s night-shift color filter for the same reason.')
