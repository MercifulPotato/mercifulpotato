VPN has time-based OTP so it never gets saved.<p>Sometimes when my MBP goes to sleep it loses wifi connection and VPN disconnects. When it wakes up,  Tunnelblick asks for password, but it doesn&#x27;t restore routes (I guess?). Basically no internet until I either enter password or click disconnect. At that moment I&#x27;m typing in my OS password and pressing Enter.<p>What then happens is that it waits for â‰ˆ30 seconds and then logs me in, as if it made a network request and waited until it timed out.<p>Could it be related to the issue you&#x27;re describing?')
