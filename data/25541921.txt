Item(by='hakfoo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608965919, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25541789, text='Patents support a fairly narrow model of what innovation is &quot;supposed to be&quot;-- the one man in a garage who can scale his product from zero to infinity with little to no outside support.<p>The thing is, for a lot of industries, that&#x27;s a dated pipedream.  It&#x27;s not 1804 and you&#x27;re not Richard Trevithick.  You&#x27;re not going to challenge TSMC with a semiconductor fab built in the backyard shed.  Even if you had huge amounts of startup capital and a laser-focused market vision, there&#x27;s also a lot of innovation that&#x27;s time-sensitive: for example, if you&#x27;re building a better petrol engine or coal-burning generator, will you be able to scale before the product is obsolete?<p>Beyond that, I suspect there are also a fair number of patent holders who just take potshots at the market-- wildly mis-guessing their target market or (attempting to get orders or raise funds) based on promising undeliverables, because they don&#x27;t have the full knowledge of getting a product to market.  After their business fails, they&#x27;ll just spend the rest of the patent term as legal unexploded ordnance-- useless by themselves but waiting to blow the leg off of some poor sod who happened to step in the wrong place.<p>Reducing the term from 20 years to 10 or even 5 would tend to prioritize partnership development rather than the &quot;one man in a garage&quot; mentality:  with the clock ticking that fast, your best chance is to license broadly, hoping that someone will get product to market before the patent expires.')
