So if you have a service defined in an IDL like gRPC or OpenAPI, with a backend in python and a web front-end in JS, and API docs, etc, a tool like this can stitch together changes really efficiently.<p>Please is a lot more lightweight than Bazel, so it’s easier to get deployed and work with different projects. The new maintainer has been shaving off a lot of warts lately and it’s getting a lot better.<p>If the above doesn’t describe your situation, then a tool like please, pants, buck, or bazel is probably not for you.
