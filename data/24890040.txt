Stripe might provide an IBAN for the publisher to provide a payto URI with. It seems like the whole point of this setup is for the user agent to decide which app to open to initiate a transfer to the destination.<p>For Stripe, this scheme is sort of irrelevant. If Stripe wants to offer the ability for someone to transfer money to an IBAN (or any other account identifier) through a webpage, they can just...do it. They don&#x27;t need a URI, they just have a JS function which triggers a payment flow.')
