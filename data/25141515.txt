(And testament that the customers are VC-gorged price-unconcious baby gremlims.)</i><p>Your analysis is incomplete which is why it looks like insane high-profit margins.<p>Amazon AWS (and MS Azure, Google Cloud) also sell <i>high-value services</i> on top of raw datacenters.  It&#x27;s not just commodity rack servers.  Amazon keeps iterating on <i>new value-added services</i> (e.g. see new announcements at annual AWS re:invent conference[1]).  E.g. AWS DynamoDB service was announced in 2012 and Netflix is one of the customers that use it.<p>In contrast, other datacenter companies that don&#x27;t have the same higher value-added portfolio like Rackspace and DigitalOcean are <i>losing money</i>[2] or not even profitable yet[3].  Yes, the lower-tier datacenters are also adding value-added services but the breadth of their product portfolio is not in the same league as AWS&#x2F;Azure&#x2F;GCP.<p>Rackspace was losing so much business to AWS that they&#x27;re trying to sell the idea of customers paying their RS employees to manage AWS.[4]<p><i>&gt;(And testament that the customers are VC-gorged price-unconcious baby gremlims.)</i><p>Most of the revenue comes from non-VC businesses.  A lot of old Fortune 1000 companies where IT is a cost center shrank their self-run datacenters and moved the workload to the cloud vendors.  Another example is AWS winning the big $600 million contract from the CIA.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;results?search_query=amazon+re%3Ainvent+2012+2013+2014+2015+2016+2017+2018+2019+keynote" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;results?search_query=amazon+re%3Ainv...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=rackspace+%22net+loss%22" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=rackspace+%22net+loss%22</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sdxcentral.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;news&#x2F;digitalocean-inhales-another-50m-toward-profit-quest&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sdxcentral.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;news&#x2F;digitalocean-inhale...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rackspace.com&#x2F;managed-aws" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rackspace.com&#x2F;managed-aws</a>')
