It&#x27;s frustrating how behind, how stagnant, computer displays are. I don&#x27;t want to sit in front of a 48 inch OLED tv, too big, not high enough dpi, but I feel like I&#x27;m throwing money at bad products trying to buy a computer monitor. At least there are some fair budget options (Pixio PX275h 95Hz 4k, $250, doing ok).')
