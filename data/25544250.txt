The rose colored glasses or gtfo policy.<p>I also hate Steam for this reason where you can&#x27;t voice your opinion or you&#x27;ll get banned. I&#x27;ve reached a 1 year ban now just for speaking my mind. Valve and its double standards or rather anti consumer mods have absolute power and Valve won&#x27;t do anything about it, even if the mod banned someone by mistake.<p>And finally my bank. They decided to up the price from 3€&#x2F;month to 8€ in 18 months. Without any additional benefits to me. That and  since PSD2 I can&#x27;t check my account anymore via FinTS 3.0 api without providing a OTP for each single action.<p>And now really finally the state mafia and their corrupt regime, esp the EU that sits on top of it stealing our money and creating insider laws and regulations.<p>Oh yeah Google Adsense... don&#x27;t get me started')
