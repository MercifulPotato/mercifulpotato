Item(by='blunte', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609813677, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25640217, text='Here on HN we see articles and posts on a regular basis of how the big tech companies have squashed or simply blackholed users.  There are two common issues in these stories: 1. it&#x27;s vague or entirely not stated why the event occurred, and 2. there&#x27;s nobody to contact in the big company to discuss the situation.<p>Google seems to behave like a hybrid Borg collective which spawns mini collectives, isolates them from the hive, allows them to go explore and mature somewhat, and then either absorbs them (assimilate!) or kills them if they don&#x27;t fit back in.<p>While surely there are some humans at the top making strategic decisions, it feels to an end user that they are utterly soulless.  The collective works to observe processes and outcomes (based on metrics which don&#x27;t include human concerns or at least weight them very low), and then it makes changes and iterates.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there are already elements within the Google-beast which are unknowable to the humans working there.  The concepts or goals and results may be knowable, but the path taken may not.<p>It should be obvious that the current &quot;internet&quot; (easy name for the state of online-anything these days) system is unsustainable.  Perhaps it will go the way of the AI operating system in Her (2013 film), simply ignoring humans (whereby the humans will be able to use whatever of the services are accessible until they become inaccessible or non-functioning); or maybe it will determine that the best path which results in the best outcomes is to do absolutely nothing - thereby ending all operation.  Naturally the humans with access to the source and the systems can attempt to correct the errant course once it is recognized, but short of a complete rewrite with a new approach, it will fail.  They will go the way of all giant companies (and countries) who have sat at the top of the hill for too long and lost the values which led them to the top.<p>Facebook will hopefully go the way of reality TV (or is that still a thing?).  How or why?  Who knows.  Perhaps another few rounds of global lockdowns will make everyone so desperate for actual human contact that they eschew social networks and take up dancing, casual sporting, dinner parties, and other great life activities.  (Or more likely, their ads will get worse and worse until the stench is so bad that no respectable company would be caught with an ad on Facebook; the money would vanish, the talent would bail, and eventually they would get bought by a Comcast and rebranded as AhOLe or somesuch.)<p>Amazon will eventually ONLY sell cheap knockoff products up until the original creators stop creating, and the copycats are left to try to imagine and make their own unique products (the result of which will be a physical form on par with the nonsensical text they currently put on boxes and in instruction booklets).<p>Microsoft will still make and sell Office and Windows, forever and ever, because humans will never collectively choose to get educated on technology; it&#x27;s easier to just keep using what you&#x27;ve always used.  (Not to say that Windows or Office is bad, but it&#x27;s often not the best choice.)  Still, MS will outlive Google.<p>Apple will continue to exist and maybe hold a high place until eventually the designers, wild-thinkers (there must still be some there) get replaced with stock market drones with one monitor dedicated to the current quarter revenue projection spreadsheet.  Then it will be a slow decline.  MS will outlive them.<p>Almost forgot Twitter.  The orange monster will fade into the history book which nobody wants to read, and the followers of orange monster will predictably be so poor as their local economies dry up (except for the private prison jobs, but there are only so many positions to fill) that they won&#x27;t be able to afford the shoddy Comcast internet that is the officially sanctioned local monopoly internet.  Besides, words will have been replaced with PopTop or whatever the latest 3 second video service is.  They&#x27;ll be too late to pivot to GIFs only since Imgur has been lying in wait for this moment.<p>Well, what a bit of fun this was.  Might be that we&#x27;re worrying about nothing, or perhaps worrying about entirely the wrong thing.  Surprise, asteroid!')
