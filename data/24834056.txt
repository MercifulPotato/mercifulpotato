A mistake I&#x27;ve made in the past was to think about &quot;controlling&quot; emotions, as if emotions and logic were mutually exclusive, opposing forces. For example, take your excellent example about how a maladjusted fear response can make you afraid of things that aren&#x27;t actually dangerous. The solution to this problem is not to try to &quot;control&quot; the fear, e.g. by telling yourself &quot;there is nothing logically to be afraid of&quot;. The solution is actually to experience <i>more</i> of that fear - in a controlled, gradual and safe manner, which is what exposure therapy is all about.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not saying that this is what you meant by &quot;controlling&quot; or &quot;moderating&quot; emotions, but just want to clarify that learning how to express emotions in a constructive way usually makes an argument that much more forceful that trying to &quot;rein in&quot; your emotions and make them subservient to logic.')
