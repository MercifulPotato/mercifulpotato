I started having to manage remote employees and found out that it was vastly harder than I imagined.  The whole team had to essentially train ourselves on how to handle remote workers.  We did this by forcing each of us to be remote part of the time, so we could learn what worked and what didn&#x27;t.<p>It&#x27;s sad really.  I worked at another company where there were a few remote workers that all ended up getting fired for performance reasons.  When I pointed out that it seems that all remote workers have performance problems and maybe it isn&#x27;t them, management looked at me like I was fool, and clearly if the remote workers just &quot;worked harder&quot; it wouldn&#x27;t be an issue.')
