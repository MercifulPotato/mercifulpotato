In addition to that I recently sold my house which means I literally have $1M in my bank account right now.<p>For so many on here that is not too much money, but for me and my bg, I feel more fortunate than I ever could have dreamed of being.<p>I like my job, but it’s stressful. My dream is to use this nest egg to make investments that will grow the capital and allow me to live off of it.<p>Am I jumping the gun? Is $1M not enough? I’m sure I could get way more money if I endure more years of my job, but I so want a break. What are the chances of taking $1M and investing so that I don’t <i>have</i> to work anymore?')
