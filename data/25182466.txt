Deciding how the technology will be is politics to me.<p>For example, say a tech startup is creating a crypto-currency like Bitcoin, choosing to create it like Bitcoin conveys anarcho-capitalist values. That is politics. Choosing to design consensus differently than on competition for something of value (PoW, PoS) like what FairCoin does might convey different political positions. Choosing not to create crypto-currency technology at all is also another one.<p>Technologies after they exist will favor the world becoming closer to some political ideas, tech startups like Uber convey liberal values with their driver recruitment model. iFixit another tech company rather choose to empower people to repair their things or open their own repair services, that&#x27;s another political position. They could&#x27;ve started a very successful repair shop franchise and earn lots of money with some kind of monopoly on repair, yet they choose to share knowledge and encourage people to do so with their website.')
