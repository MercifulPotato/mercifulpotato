AMD Ryzen 4900H<p>2. Apple M1, though the Intel 10875H is pretty much the same perf (though at 3x the power usage)<p>3. Only Intel uses this, so whatever Intel&#x27;s fastest chip on this process is.<p>That said, it varies by use cases, and M1 leans heavily on accelerators so has big wins in some and big losses in others when compared the 4900H or 10875H, which are closer to each other in single threaded benchmarks.')
