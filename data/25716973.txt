Almost all of these countries are outliers - in England, the US, Sweden, Iran and the Netherlands, the government spent a long time advocating AGAINST any measures and claiming that they are not necessary, before doing some kind of abrupt turn. South Korea has the worst case spread out of all the east-asian countries, and it is known for the remarkable detail of its contact tracing and testing - probably the best in the world. The data from Iran is also very hard to trust. Germany has relied a lot on its hospitals and chose to implement rather lax lockdowns compared to many smaller countries. Italy, France and Spain are harder to question, but they were the worst hit countries (except Belgium maybe?) on the continental EU, so they may have special factors that I&#x27;m not thinking about.')
