Nothing more.<p>That value is not a SaaS. You don&#x27;t need build out a &quot;teams&quot; feature or &quot;multiple accounts&quot; feature; you don&#x27;t need to even build out recurring billing, seat management, or whatever combination of tiered usage you can think of.<p>You need to give the ability to receive value for something.<p>I see so many people burn themselves out on doing so and they never talk to customers because all they&#x27;re doing is fixing edge cases in their billing features.<p>Once you have your idea&#x27;s guts, build out the most bare minimum payment model: accept their credit card, store it, charge it, and make a reminder that you need to go into Stripe&#x2F;Braintree&#x2F;whatever and charge their card again in a month. Manually create an invoice if your provider can&#x27;t give you an invoice for them for some reason.<p>Once managing your customers manually becomes a chore, you can then start to invest in automating it and building out the &quot;boring&quot; infrastructure that has nothing to do with your core idea. Granted, there are SaaS starter kits all over the place for many languages and frameworks. There are also platforms that handle all the recurring billing&#x2F;seat management stuff for you, too.<p>But the odds are you might even not get there. The time you would spend building out that infrastructure is not valuable to a customer, and so it&#x27;s not valuable to you.<p>Your chances of succeeding are not as closely correlated with subscription management as they are learning about your customer&#x27;s needs. Take the time you would otherwise invest perfecting a SaaS setup and invest that into talking to customers.<p>Build your idea, forget that you&#x27;re building a SaaS. Build the SaaS-y part of the SaaS after you have a customer. Without customer, you&#x27;re missing the S in SaaS: service. All you have is software.<p>Build the software.')
