But the people who are performing the acts, aren&#x27;t compensated highly (unless they &quot;win&quot;).<p>Frankly I think that many of these highly paid SWEs are really not worth what they are paid, and that many people could be doing their jobs.<p>I think this is part of the reason of my struggles in the job market since being laid off in June.  There has become an obsession that if you&#x27;re not in the &quot;top 1% of SDEs&quot;, you are in essence, worthless and shouldn&#x27;t be hired.')
