Are you working when you&#x27;re commuting to the job?  No?  What about when you&#x27;re at the job, and putting on or removing your personal protective equipment?  Or when you&#x27;re walking to the job site?  Or hearing the instructions before you begin?  Or looking at the work and thinking what the best way to go about it is?  Or when you actually make a to-do list in order?  Or when you move around the site?  Or when you&#x27;re not moving, but don&#x27;t have a hammer in hand?  Or when you do have a hammer in hand, but aren&#x27;t swinging it toward a nail?  Or when you are swinging it, but it hasn&#x27;t hit the nail yet?<p>I would argue that if the concept of real work shifted enough there would be people who thought only the milliseconds the hammer is pushing a nail through the wood, aggregated throughout the day, is real work.  Likewise, you could only count the time the keys are on a rising edge between 0 and 1.<p>My rule is if you wouldn&#x27;t do it if you didn&#x27;t work, and it&#x27;s necessary for the output of the work, it&#x27;s work.')
