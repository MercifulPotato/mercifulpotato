The infrastructure had to handle massive spikes because registrations for big races would open all at once, so scalability was everything.<p>They explained to me that they&#x27;d intentionally slam the production website with external traffic a couple of times per year, at a scheduled time in the middle of the night. Like basically an order of magnitude greater than they&#x27;d every received in real life, just to try to find the breaking point. The production website would usually go down for a bit, but this was vastly better than the website going down when actual real users are trying to sign up for the Boston Marathon.<p>Slack probably should&#x27;ve anticipated this surge in traffic after the holidays, and if <i>might</i> have been able to run some better simulations and fire drills before it occurred.')
