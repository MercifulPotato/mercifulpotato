In the ED I work at, we recently &quot;upgraded&quot; our monitors for vitals in every room. The new system has insanely ill-thought-out defaults that cannot be changed - the settings revert with every new patient. A patient moving a little and thus creating artifact in his&#x2F;her cardiac rhythm frequently triggers a &quot;v-tach&quot; alarm. It sometimes signals the v-tach alarm even if the patient is in normal sinus rhythm with a <i>slightly</i> widened QRS. If a patient removes the pulse ox for just enough time for the machine to alarm, but then puts it back on, the machine will continue WAILING until somebody can shut it off. Unfortunately, if that patient happens to be a COVID-suspected or positive patient, we do not just walk in the room and fix the issue. The respiratory rate measurement takes its measurement from the cardiac rhythm signal. It works sometimes, but I never have found it to be reliable or accurate. However, the machines default to sounding the exact same loud alarm if it thinks somebody is apneic (nevermind an SPO2 of 100% with a good waveform). Since there are so many rooms being monitored at the staff station all at once, the exact same alarm goes off almost every minute for one thing or another.\nOk, here is the point of my agreement with parent - the usual alarm tone went off on a patient with an all-too-familiar &quot;V-Tach&quot; message. I hit the button to silence the stupid thing and found a button to &quot;view event&quot;. I hit that button (feeling very annoyed again) just for the sake of never having seen that function yet (like I said, the system is new). What do you know... the patient was in a run of v-tach for several seconds. Pretty useful diagnostic information (and if they never converted, pretty damn important to know to keep them alive).')
