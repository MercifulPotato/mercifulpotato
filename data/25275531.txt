What was different about newspapers, pamphlets, magazines and journals is that the written form encouraged the presentation of evidence and the construction of arguments with a logical foundation, often prefaced or buttressed with historical context.<p>Television news is different in three major ways:<p>1.  Articles are 30 - 45 seconds long, then the topic changes to something unrelated, or a word from our sponsor.<p>2.  Each article requires no previous knowledge of a topic. An elephant tipping over a tourist bus is featured as its own spectacle, without any consideration of how the land was used for the previous millennium.<p>3.  The actors are personalities with images.  Contrast this with print and radio where the main information that was transmitted about a news actor was his or her argument, actions, and the consequences thereof.')
