I built a landing page now and I&#x27;m trying to validate the idea. It&#x27;s still hard as I don&#x27;t have much experience in this area.<p>The app attempts to modernize recipes applications. Most of the existing apps for recipes you cannot easily share them. Like I want to &quot;clone&quot; your recipe and adapt it to my taste.<p>I also want to create a community around it, where people can discuss and decide based on the latest research. This would translate into feedback for your meal plan.<p>Let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s a discussion about the recommended protein intake. Once everyone agrees on the amount based on a proper discussion, I would add a feedback rule telling you if you are meeting your goal or not.<p>I don&#x27;t want to claim it&#x27;s based on science because it&#x27;s an ever evolving field, but I thing it would help bridge the gap between diets and research. And of course you&#x27;d be able to disable a rule if you don&#x27;t agree.<p>I would kindly ask you if you think the landing page reflects those ideas well.')
