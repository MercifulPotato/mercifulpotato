Both of the A studios I worked in had a big set of Genelecs in the bulkhead and two or three more mid and near field monitors just above or behind the console meter bridge.<p>Each served it&#x27;s own purpose and all the mixing guys I saw wound swap between them fairly regularly. In that situation it was about emulating different scenarios, from the 4&quot; block speakers to get a feel for what someone would hear on an old car stereo to mid field Dynaudios that were more flat than hyped to get a feel for what the home audiophile might experience.<p>That&#x27;s not a practical approach for a small studio (either in size or budget) but having been out of that world for a long time it makes me wonder if someone would be better served with two or three pairs of reasonably priced pair of speakers rather than trying to perfect the sound of one pair that aren&#x27;t going to reflect (no pun intended) other playback environments that aren&#x27;t acoustically optimized.')
