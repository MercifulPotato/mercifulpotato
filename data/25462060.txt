But this information is a diff.<p>In this particular example you need the new folder and the what changed information. That&#x27;s what I was referring to.<p>Rebasing...is far more advanced to explain, yes.<p>Edit: or you can paste your folder into theirs, but still you need to know what you changed, your diff, so it&#x27;s the same.')
