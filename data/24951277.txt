I don&#x27;t care what Harvard has to say about Ethics!  Harvard!!  The educators of the master administrative class.  That ethically outsourced all of the jobs to the rest of the world.<p>It says:<p>Code of Ethics\nAs an ACM member I will ....\nContribute to society and human well-being.\nAvoid harm to others.\nBe honest and trustworthy.\nBe fair and take action not to discriminate.\nHonor property rights including copyrights and patent.\nGive proper credit for intellectual property.\nRespect the privacy of others.\nHonor confidentiality.<p>Fine words!  But take a look at the first - &quot;Contribute to society and human well-being.&quot;  Contribute to &#x27;society&#x27;.  &#x27;Society&#x27; is a fiction.  Its not a real thing - its an idea in people&#x27;s heads.  You could just as easily say contribute to stones.<p>People are the only thing doing the experiencing.  Individuals.  You can say &#x27;society&#x27;, but this just a way of avoiding talking about and to individuals.<p>Ethics questions are for the individual to work out.  And it takes work!  And the worst thing is that everyone thinks they know what they mean.  That they are ethical.  That its others that need the educating!')
