One of the biggest nuclear issues today is using them way past their lifespan because they are so expensive to build.<p>Let&#x27;s assume molten-salt is cheaper to build and less dangerous (from a radioactivity point of view). Why not make expendable designs? Make them smaller so the building requirements are easier. Make them easy to remove and replace. Ease up on the restrictions a bit so they can be replaced every 5-10 years instead of decades.<p>Long-term mass production has tons of advantages. Costs per unit decrease. Defects per unit decrease (this is part of cost per unit usually, but not if a defect gets through inspection). Recycling used units should radically decrease material costs when getting close to peak reactor count (chain of custody paperwork from mine to installation in the nuclear plant is why an otherwise $0.15 screw winds up costing $50-100). Constant employment will build experience over many years and further decrease errors. Once the site design is finalized and enforced, the reactor design can be gradually improved and given the short lifespan, efficiency will increase a minimum of every decade. Likewise, design mistakes (once caught) will only be around a decade at most instead of a half-century like we see today.')
