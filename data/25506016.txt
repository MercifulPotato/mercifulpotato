The problem of obese passengers encroaching on fellow passengers &quot;space&quot; is because airlines have consistently reduced that &quot;space&quot; over the last 2 decades or more.<p>However, either obesity is a disability, in which case, perhaps the ADA or equivalent could be used to force airlines to provide accomodation, or it is not a protected class, in which case, airlines should force them to purchase two seats.<p>In sports, there are leagues and classes of competition that attempt to provide a &quot;minimum platform&quot; for teams to compete.
