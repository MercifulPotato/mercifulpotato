Turn on anyone who doesn&#x27;t support the narrative. So sad to see someone who has been so principled for so long on all the modern topics we should care about get viciously character assasinated so readily by people without a moments hesitancy. I have had my disagreements with GG, particularly in his naive taking on of PO for the money, but this refusal to acknowledge both his dedication to truth (which often makes him look contrarian) and how correct he has been on those topics just speaks volumes about how deeply ingrained the crazy is for those who decide he&#x27;s persona-non-grata due to not supporting their favorite conspiracy theories.<p>The same kind of people now openly railing against GG are the same kind of people who will do everything they can to not acknowledge Ray McGovern because his professional and personal past make him a harder target on the topic. Of course, it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me to see plenty of them try the same charater assasination on him, but it&#x27;s an obvious marker of complete rejection of truth in favor of tribalisms.<p>Disgusting seeing so many turn on GG et al so quickly. Ya&#x27;ll should be ashamed of yourselves.')
