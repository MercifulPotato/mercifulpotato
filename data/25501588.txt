I don&#x27;t think we are absolutely certain yet&quot;</i><p>Everything else is speculation. He says that founder effect is not likely because the virus is spreading widely, nationwide: this is a <i>hypothesis</i>, not a statement of fact. He says that there are reasons to believe that the mutations are associated with structural regions known to be important to transmission: this is a <i>hypothesis</i>, not a statement of fact.<p>He then says that because of these two unproven hypotheses (which he implicitly believes), one should &quot;change your priors&quot; on how likely it is that this strain is selectively advantaged. Certainly, one can &quot;change their priors&quot; based on personal opinion, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that other informed scientists don&#x27;t have different opinions.<p>What this guy is doing is citing the (limited, non-definitive) evidence that we know, and then saying he has an opinion about what it all means. That doesn&#x27;t make it factual.<p>Without well-controlled cell-culture or animal studies that show that this strain is out-competing other strains <i>in vivo</i>, we don&#x27;t have solid evidence either way. Trying to predict the organism-level impact of point mutations is a fun parlor game, but no more or less definitive than asking a sports fan which team is going to win on Sunday.')
