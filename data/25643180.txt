Even with less sensitive quick tests it should be possible to suppress ~50% of new transmissions this way, which could bring case numbers down to traceable levels in 1-2 months.<p>I agree it&#x27;s a good idea, but doubt that it would bring case numbers &quot;down to traceable levels&quot;...we know that the vast majority of transmission (&gt;70%) is happening in the home, and the vast majority of interactions (&gt;90%) don&#x27;t produce more than a single infection.<p>You essentially have to catch the connecting edges on a sparsely connected graph -- you don&#x27;t have to miss very many for the problem to be unsolvable.<p>I do think it would go a long way to making life more normal. It&#x27;s completely idiotic that we&#x27;re killing restaurants (for example) when we could be making mandatory rapid testing a pre-requisite to indoor dining, instead.<p>The same goes for nursing home and hospital staff -- nosocomial infection has been a huge problem, and most fatalities are out of nursing homes. I get why you don&#x27;t want to depend entirely on quick tests that have an elevated false-negative rate, but when it takes <i>days</i> to get back a PCR result, it&#x27;s useless for screening staff.')
