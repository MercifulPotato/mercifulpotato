(Initially, supply was low, and it was selling over MSRP as high as ~$570.)<p>But they came with coolers... I have a Ryzen 2700X that I got for $230, and I still use the stock cooler. To jump to a Ryzen 5800X plus a cooler would be a huge expense. I will definitely be on the sidelines for the next six months, but then I&#x27;ll revisit the pricing situation (once motherboard manufacturers release updated 400-series firmware.)')
