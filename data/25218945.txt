Rotate the Apple logo on the back and move the iPad’s front-facing camera on the side beneath the Apple Pencil charger to better reflect how most people actually use their iPad Pros.<p>Hell no! I&#x27;ve been using iPads since the first one, and I love them — if I wanted a laptop, I would use a laptop.

Don&#x27;t try to reduce it to the common denominator.<p>I do agree the iPad should be less restrained: software has been holding this platform back for years now. It&#x27;s an incredibly powerful computer that is only 6mm thick. Those of us who use it for things like audio production or 3d modeling realize how powerful it is, but it is being held back by Apple&#x27;s obsessive control and neglect.')
