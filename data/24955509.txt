It should not be when machines do. Otherwise, what is the benefits of using them? Driverless cars can, must and will be held to a higher standard.<p>But it is not a lofty ideal, it has been done before. And in the field of transportation. Trains used to crash all the time. Driverless trains don&#x27;t. Why? Because fail safe systems have been added on railroads that nearly totally prevent this.<p>Don&#x27;t take my word for it, the bar for rail safety is defined in well documented standards (namely, EN 50129, EN 50126 and EN 50128). It is 10-9 hourly probability of fatal failure. You can also look up &quot;CBTC&quot; on the Internet. This is the reference bar for driverless.<p>The real reason Tesla and friends don&#x27;t want to go there is because fail-safe systems like a CBTC requires some form of collaboration with devices installed on the ground infrastructure, meaning Tesla should accept to become part of a system, and not &quot;the&quot; system. Obviously a paradigm change for the car industry.<p>How long will the public authority require to understand that they must step in to force a systemic collaboration and standards between infrastructure and cars to ensure driverless safety, I don&#x27;t know, but I think it&#x27;s time to call <i>bullshit</i> on the concept that you can have an acceptably safe driverless car system without it.')
