My point is that the type of insurance doesn&#x27;t actually matter that much if you&#x27;re the one paying for it (versus having premiums covered by your employer). If you get a bad accident on the low end company insurance you pay your $10k out of pocket max. On the top end insurance you pay $4k but also paid $8k more in premiums during the year. The insurance companies did the math to make sure they come out ahead no matter what you choose.')
