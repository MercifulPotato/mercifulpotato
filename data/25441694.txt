It&#x27;s just laziness.<p>Learning C++ this way is how someone would end up with a buffer overflow every 30 lines of code they write. It&#x27;s the reason some self-taught developers can&#x27;t give you the fuzziest definition of the difference between O(n) and O(n^2).<p>The closest approximation of this is how kids learn to speak, but this is incredibly inefficient, and they receive many years of formal education anyway.')
