Because it&#x27;s totally non-political to influence international trade policy to give yourself an advantage in buying your oranges and labor in waaaaaait it totally is.<p>IMO Coinbase is &quot;doing it pretty well&quot;, not by saying &quot;we&#x27;ll be apolitical&quot;, but by saying, &quot;we&#x27;re going to be political ONLY about X &amp; Y&quot;.<p>My read is that they&#x27;re not discouraging their employees from being political (unclear to me ATM if they&#x27;re still doing donation matching regardless), and they&#x27;re not stopping work-place diversity programs... they&#x27;re just limiting their lobbying to, you know, their own issues.')
