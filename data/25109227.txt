I&#x27;ve been running brushless systems in RC cars for the last 7 odd years. The only motor failures has been when It&#x27;s been subject to extreme abuse, as in the rotor reaching 100+Â° (internally), going from ~55-60K RPM to 0 in fraction of a second or the rotor being forced through the bearings.<p>For unmanned flight i do agree on multicopters being the best option. See this[1] video for an example of a multicopter flying with disabled props.<p>However, as you see this flightmode isn&#x27;t appropriate for human beings, humans should keep flying helis for now. The swash plate design even though more complex than a prop mounted on a shaft is still a rather simple design, litterally a bearing mounted on a 2 axis system and rods attached to rotate the blades. Multicopters with swash plates are interesting too as they can be simplified not to tilt the plate but only offset it up and down to alter pitch the same way all around the rotation. If. This exerts less force on the bearing, but considering there&#x27;s still 4 of them rather than one might increse failure rate. With swash plates on multicopters we could have two motors driving one system that drives the props, and do many amazing things with computer aided controls in case of failure.<p>Idk why i keep on going, TL;DR: Being able to control pitch is key, multirotor or not.<p>I&#x27;m not really with Elon Musk on alot of things, but personal human flight is one thing where i agree with him, It&#x27;s not going to happen.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=w2itwFJCgFQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=w2itwFJCgFQ</a>')
