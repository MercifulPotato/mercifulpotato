The Tab interface is unusable. new FF opens lots more new tabs than the old one. But the list is less readable, less usable, and closing tabs is a chore (!) because there is a list-slide-animation that makes you miss the next X to close and you have to wait for the f-ing animation to finish. Bookmarks are inaccessible, you only see a few on the new-tab-page or in an unordered mess as search results when typing something in the address bar. A loading indicator is missing and loading often hangs for a long time or clicks don&#x27;t register. I&#x27;m seriously researching alternatives, the status quo is hell.')
