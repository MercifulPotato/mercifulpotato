We can make children feel good about a paycheck by paying them to go to school if we&#x27;d like.<p>I can&#x27;t verify they feel good about getting a paycheck. I have generally been happy to have a bit of money, but I&#x27;ve never cared that it came from a paycheck and realistically, despised that I had to work while going to school (mine was later, in college).
