In my several years there, most people didn&#x27;t take full advantage of it, and that was as true in 2011 as it was in 2020. Most people just didn&#x27;t come up with anything a technical project they&#x27;d rather work on than their core project. (I was one of those.)<p>I think most who took advantage actually worked on improving and facilitating employee training &amp; learning programs. Google has great internal training material -- mostly for internally-used technologies, but sometimes for external technologies people are curious about too, and also for soft skills, and even not-work-related skills (e.g. fitness classes).<p>Overall I think the 20% resulted in more &quot;community&quot; work than most other companies have, and I think it was a positive for company culture.<p>And for the few people that actually worked on technical projects, the existence of 20% time seemed highly motivating for them.')
