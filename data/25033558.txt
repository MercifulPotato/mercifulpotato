I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has ideas on how to market such a service in the early days and attract the first clients.<p>A bit of background:<p>- I have a finance background with 15+ years working in the financial services industry\n- I subsequently co-ran a consultancy where we did a lot of development work, amongst other things, mostly finance&#x2F;data heavy stuff in python (development work was for internal projects though or as part of bigger non-dev projects, so existing client contacts wouldn&#x27;t help)\n- I&#x27;ve also been developing web apps for &gt; 10 years, various technologies incl. RoR, JS, React, SQL, etc, so generally have quite a technical background<p>I think to start with it makes sense to focus on a niche (hence python, finance, data science) rather than offering full stack development.<p>I think I have the right background (finance &amp; dev work) but no existing client relationships. I&#x27;m trying to avoid platforms (Upwork, etc) and generally prefer the idea of setting up an agency rather than freelancing work (for various reasons, incl. better rates etc, being able to take on larger projects, more professional appearance in front of potential clients, quite enjoyed running a consultancy previously, etc).<p>If anyone has ideas on how to get a venture like this started, I&#x27;d be really keen on having a chat (contact details are in my profile). And of course if anyone would be interested in teaming up let&#x27;s also have a chat!<p>Thanks\nMarkus')
