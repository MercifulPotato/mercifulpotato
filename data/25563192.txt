It&#x27;s entirely appropriate to send a follow-up e-mail, from your own e-mail account, asking about the status of a job opening.<p>However, using anonymous tools like this is extremely unprofessional. Leaning on anonymity to vent frustrations is a bad habit to get into. Furthermore, it&#x27;s usually not hard to figure out which candidate sent these things. Don&#x27;t think that this is a way to communicate anger without burning bridges.')
