In game development and simulations we use numerical computing most of the time, a domain where templates come in handy. The rest is just C. Modern C++ for highly efficient systems is not C with classes anymore, it is more like C with templates. And also functional constructs for specific components (physics) where it makes sense to use it. I have high hopes that a language like Zig will prove less complex and as powerful as C++ for game dev. It won&#x27;t be a replacement for C++, just an alternative, hard to believe that anything will dethrone the king.')
