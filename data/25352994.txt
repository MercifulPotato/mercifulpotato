Item(by='mft_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607469900, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25347585, text='1) BMJ is rabble-rousing. Endpoints for any pivotal trial will be agreed with regulators in advance. In this case, while I don’t know the numbers themselves, I suspect that given the low rate of serious complications of Covid overall, waiting for sufficient numbers of outcomes such as hospitalisation, intensive care visits, or death, would increase the duration, size, and cost of the trial, and maybe significantly so.<p>2) Bitching about skipping the peer-review process in the face of a global pandemic is self-important nonsense. Peer review isn’t necessary for the drug approval process, and takes a significant amount of time and effort that the people involved probably didn’t have. If it’s between writing a regulatory submission versus a manuscript, in this situation prioritising the activity that will likely directly save lives is reasonable. The manuscripts and ever-so-important peer review will follow soon.')
