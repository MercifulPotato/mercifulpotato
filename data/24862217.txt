(Maybe it does let you access iOS&#x27;s filesystemâ€”it&#x27;s not clear to me at a first glance.)  I have the jaded feeling that this has to do with how it got approved.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ish-app&#x2F;ish&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mounting-other-file-providers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ish-app&#x2F;ish&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mounting-other-file-prov...</a> says: &quot;Additionally, if jailbroken or using the psychic paper exploit (not available through TestFlight nor will we help you do it), you can also mount using real, absolute paths. To do so run &quot;mount -t real &lt;src&gt; &lt;dst&gt;&quot;, where &lt;src&gt; is the absolute path from the root of iOS and &lt;dst&gt; is the location in iSH to mount the file.&quot;  Which suggests that you can <i>only</i> touch the underlying iOS if you&#x27;ve done an exploit.')
