If you demand more and you&#x27;re better than someone in an expensive area, they&#x27;re not going to hire the shittier candidate. They&#x27;ll see what they can get away with given your apparent leverage, and offer that. If you have multiple offers, they&#x27;ll bid you up to the budget for your skill level. Where you are is irrelevant (except for legal issues). At least, that&#x27;s how it seems to me.<p>Can anyone on the other side of things chime in? Is this how it works, or is there more going on? Is it a <i>&quot;we-don&#x27;t-negotiate-with-terrorists&quot;</i> policy to stop negotiation from propagating?')
