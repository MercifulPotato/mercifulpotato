I have a small button above the wheel which changes the pointer speed, but nothing I can see that puts the wheel into an accelerated more.<p>Honestly if the &quot;2s Anywhere&quot; had had the setup you described I would have kept it. Logitech tried to explain that middle slick was still there, on the button further back towards the palm rest, but it felt so unnatural and inconvenient. The 502 looks like a nice piece of kit.')
