The inspiration is a blend of how open source projects recruit developers, and how the 20% Google side-projects used to work.<p>I work for company A, I&#x27;m starting to get slightly bored or interested in doing something else. <i>Without</i> quitting my job, I contribute a few days of code to company B, whose project I find interesting. As I contribute more to company B, I eventually quit company A and join company B full-time.<p>Benefits of this approach: no interviews. Know what you are getting into. Try different things and what works for you.\nHow can we make this work: legal framework. California, if you are listening, pass a safe-harbor law that prevents companies from exclusive work arrangements, so I can always do a side-gig with company B even if they are competitors. Have company B compensate me, so we don&#x27;t end up in a situation where company B is abusing job seekers by getting free work done. Maybe a law could say that I&#x27;m safe as long as my work for company B while employed by company A doesn&#x27;t exceed 5% of my salary or so (so I worked for company B for a few days or weeks, not months).\nWould that work?')
