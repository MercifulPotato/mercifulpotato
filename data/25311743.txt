In other words, if a line needs to be split into 2 &quot;virtual&quot; lines to fit in the window, VS Code inserts a &quot;virtual copy&quot; of the line&#x27;s initial whitespace before the second virtual line. By &quot;virtual copy&quot;, I mean that the copy of the whitespace is never inserted into the file, but is added during the rendering of the contents of the file into the window.<p>Emacs on the other hand, has the problem you describe, and probably always will because of how hard xdisp.c is to modify and because the maintainers of Emacs probably do not consider the problem important enough to justify a big change to xdisp.c.<p>I was never a vim user, but my cursory investigation led me to conclude that vim, too, has the problem you describe.')
