The first time I ever had vicodin (which isn&#x27;t really <i>that</i> strong a drug in the grand scheme of things, I guess), I felt <i>good</i>.  Not just no pain, but more relaxed, carefree, happy than I can remember ever feeling naturally.<p>My immediate reaction was to say out loud to my girlfriend &quot;Umm, not taking any more of this, because oh my god this is way too good.&quot;  Oddly enough, since then (it&#x27;s been 20 years now, I&#x27;ve had vicodin a few times) it doesn&#x27;t ever have the same effect.  Just that once.  Now it&#x27;s just pain relief.  Which is a relief.')
