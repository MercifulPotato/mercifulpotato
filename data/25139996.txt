This sorta seems to be similar but much shorter. But at least I was paid for that.<p>I also graduated Lambda School (I&#x27;m no longer in their slack). I can see how this is pitched internally to students. There used to be a large project that was the last thing you did before you graduated. It was always a bit of a mess, as most school group projects are. This is replacing that, and I assume the students are pitched that these companies could potentially hire them afterwards.<p>The Lambda curriculum is rather rapidly iterated upon, or at least was while I was a student. This can be good, as it lets them do things like add React Hooks relatively soon after they came out. It can also make things inconsistent, I went through one of the programs that also taught C, which was taken out at some point. I also notice they have the length of the program as 6 months again after having previously moved to 9 months. The last three were job hunting from what I can tell, it personally took me 4 to find something.<p>This actually looks similar to what the current company I work at did with me. I got hired and they paid me for 2 months to work on fake projects in their code base with all the other new hires. I assume this was super helpful for techleads as it means the person who&#x27;s starting on their team has at least a passing familiarity with the code base and languages used. Pretty much everyone who entered with me had to learn PHP, and 95% of them were bootcamp grads (of the remainder only one had previously worked software, and the others were fresh out of college) But this is super expensive to do the way the company I work for is doing it and I can&#x27;t see many wanting to.<p>If anyone is considering know my least favorite thing about Lambda was the way the ISA works. The 17% is calculated pretax, but charged posttax.<p>PS Hi Austin')
