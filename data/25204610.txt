Personally I think it would be fascinating if the new &quot;desktop&quot; form factor for appliance running devices[1] looks simply like a desk. The biggest challenge I see is the keyboard. A lot of variability there that might be difficult to support.<p>In an adjacent category, something like this for electrical engineers would be pretty awesome. A lot of instruments have gone &quot;USB connected with computer as display device.&quot; I could easily see a workbench that had &#x27;tilt-up&#x27; bays that would expose oscilloscope ports, or powwer supply ports, etc. With the instrument displays on maybe three or four displays across the back.<p>[1] Not general purpose &quot;computers&quot; which often have slots for different peripherals that would not work well in such a configuration, but I digress.')
