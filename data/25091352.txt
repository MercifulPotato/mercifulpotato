There will always be some package with a C extension that doesn&#x27;t compile on your platform (for example).<p>As a non-Mac user (and someone who develops for ARM targets of all sizes) I&#x27;m really happy about the situation though. Apple is forcing developers to not be able to assume processor architecture any more, just because what they&#x27;re developing is aimed at desktop. Lots of software is going to become more portable and we&#x27;ll all benefit. In the meantime though, I&#x27;m going to keep developing on x86&#x2F;64.')
