My workflow in this case is to checkout a new branch and commit the work-in-progress there, then switch back to the previous branch to check the commit.  I&#x27;ve seen numerous pre-push scripts that do exactly that.<p>I wish git didn&#x27;t use the disk at all!  It gets in the way of parallelizing work.  For instance, I&#x27;d love to be able to make a bunch of trial commits, then in parallel verify that none of them breaks the build.  Or while a build&#x2F;test loop is happening on one branch, switch to another to continue working.')
