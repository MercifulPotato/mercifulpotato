People in general do try to use fewer words when possible, and to understand the meaning of a sentence, you have to not just consider what was said, but what was <i>not</i> said.<p>An example is the sentence &#x27;<i>Yesterday, I tried to fix my bike</i>&#x27;. Did the speaker manage to fix their bike? A naive parsing of the sentence would say it&#x27;s unclear. However, if you heard a friend tell you this, you&#x27;d probably assume that they <i>didn&#x27;t</i> fix their bike. Why? Because, if they had fixed it, surely they would have said &#x27;<i>Yesterday, I fixed my bike</i>&#x27; instead: it&#x27;s shorter and simpler.')
