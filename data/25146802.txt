Item(by='loosetypes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605767291, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25146532, text='&gt; One great thing about biology is that it is easy to understand because everything makes sense and &quot;works&quot; like you think it should. Human created systems often times dont make sense at all.<p>Interesting. I tend to view it as the opposite.<p>Someone else’s system might not be created using the abstractions I would have chosen but with enough head scratching you can generally at least surmise causality.  And with computer systems, you can test and re-run until there’s a grain of certainty.<p>With biology there’s so many independent moving pieces that it feels, to me, like our explanations of molecular and cellular processes are almost certainly lacking an encompassing view.  And using them to explain macro biological phenomenon borders astrology.  Sure our, experiments tell us something but we interpret results as rules while neglecting the wider context.  I don’t want to project onto others but I don’t think my brain is equipped to understand the emergent processes at that scope of nested, interdependent, hierarchies.  If you thought object-oriented programming was bad!...')
