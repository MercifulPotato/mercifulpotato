How about value drained by Google, esp. privacy and advertising.<p>About the only value produced by Google being Google Docs and Android. Well, and the rare FLOSS improvements related to these.<p>Facebook? Similar. Taking over culture is not value. We had better services at around time it was created, but the huge money combined with network effects did the number on them.<p>Netflix, well. Let&#x27;s say we had VoD services before them, some even better. Their major cultural win is making exclusive series with the huge money they got invested.<p>Amazon has one improvement in their sales systems with the remote warehouses. Plus AWS.<p>Apple at least designs phones.<p>All of the companies benefited hugely from big cash investment, somehow EU companies don&#x27;t get these. It&#x27;s not a matter of culture either, there&#x27;s plenty enough startups around. But US money is always more and bigger.')
