Can&#x27;t they just move there? Or perhaps to a host in Europe or Asia?<p>GitLab, unlike Github, offers a self-hosted plan. In theory, youtube-dl could self-host, as long as they found a hosting provider that isn&#x27;t subject to the DMCA <i>and</i> is willing to ignore DMCA notices (even many non-US providers will respond to them) <i>and</i> doesn&#x27;t have any DMCA-like laws in their own country that could affect youtube-dl (many others actually do, although they&#x27;re less publicized on places like HN).')
