An electron is a mathematically different sort of entity, all the time and under all circumstances, and it has to be accepted on its own terms.<p>&gt; The universe is not wavering between using particles and waves, unable to make up its mind. It’s only human intuitions about quantum mechanics that swap back and forth. The intuitions we have for billiard balls, and the intuitions we have for crests and troughs in a pool of water, both look sort of like they’re applicable to electrons, at different times and under different circumstances. But the truth is that both intuitions simply aren’t applicable.<p>&gt; If you try to think of an electron as being like a billiard ball on some days, and like an ocean wave on other days, you will confuse the living daylights out of yourself.<p>&gt; Yet it’s your eyes that are wobbling and unstable, not the world.<p>This also applies to light.<p>IMHO, light is light. When we view it as a particle, we are wrong. When we view it as a wave we are also wrong, but in a different way.')
