Regarding the issue that, in addition to alcohol, there exist a large number of drugs potentially diminishing one&#x27;s ability to drive: it could be approached using <i>Pareto principle</i>. Either focus just on alcohol (which most likely is responsible for 80% of road accidents) and ignore the other 20% (distractions, lack of attention, drugs, etc.), or apply Pareto principle again, now to the drugs class, and identify most frequently used ones and&#x2F;or most potentially impairing ones and design relevant sensors to cover the 20% that causes 80% of issues.<p>While I certainly recognize potential benefits of autonomous driving (and automation, in general), relevant global or nationwide deployments are still a very long way to go; it&#x27;s not &quot;a bit more time&quot;, but most likely decades. Imagine how many lives could be saved with simpler sensor-based solutions (which, by the way, could very much help with the problems of &quot;tiredness, distractions, and simple mistakes&quot;) <i>in the meantime</i> ...')
