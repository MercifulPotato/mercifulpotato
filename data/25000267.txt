Figuring out how a Spring application actually works (or why it doesn&#x27;t) can be difficult. Upgrading the framework, or switching to a different one without breakage is often a non-trivial task.<p>The best codebases I have touched, in any language ecosystem, either didn&#x27;t use a framework, or kept the framework firmly isolated from the other code.  If you build your code &quot;inside&quot; a framework, it will eventually become an obstacle to change.<p>Furthermore, the best Java codebases I have seen avoided annotation-driven-development, reflection, classpath scanning, DI frameworks, AOP, etc. Anything that feels at all magical should be handled with great suspicion.')
