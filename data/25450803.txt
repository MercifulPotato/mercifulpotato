To use your logic (at least how I&#x27;m interpreting it), we should also abolish driver licenses as well, because look, there&#x27;s a database of people! With addresses, etc!<p>And that would be a bad idea because untrained drivers may cause injury to others. The same logic applies to disease tracking, we have to know because someone might harm someone else. It&#x27;s being measured so we know if prevention methods like lockdowns and masks are working. And just like a driver&#x27;s license is not something you can volunteer to have (or not), neither should the knowledge of your virus status be optional.<p>Imagine running a country and being asked &quot;So, how is your country coping with the virus?&quot;, and answering &quot;I don&#x27;t know, we don&#x27;t have the numbers.&quot;...')
