For QUIC if you want a connection to seamlessly move when the device&#x27;s address changes then you&#x27;re going to either need to tell the server what your new address is (which wouldn&#x27;t really work in practice) or have a non-ip identifier.<p>But this really doesn&#x27;t matter all that much to Google since regardless of how your browser session resumes you&#x27;re probably still logged and&#x2F;or are loaded with tracking cookies.<p>And IPv6 is... well IPv6. Nothing is really stopping you from NATing at your firewall if you want -- in fact, I highly recommend it for your private networks so you can use your ISP public-allocation as a pool of public addresses while having the whole IPv6 private address space to yourself.')
