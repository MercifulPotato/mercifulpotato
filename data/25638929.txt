I&#x27;d commit, for example, to 1-2 year auto-renewing contracts.  Probably would need a few conditions:<p>* If I am terminated without breach of contract I still will receive full compensation (at least for some months).<p>* Contract may not be broken related to any unexpected health issues.<p>* No arbitration requirement if one side accuses breach of contract.<p>Of course this would benefit me more than the employer :-)')
