And how can you tell me that others of equal mental capacity are misled, while you yourself are untouched by misinformation?  If that&#x27;s what you claim, your hubris is impressive.<p>You&#x27;ve effectively insulated yourself from any counterargument.<p>In the chance you&#x27;re willing to consider that I&#x27;m not misled, this is why I&#x27;m skeptical of the vaccine. mRNA vaccines are an extremely new technology, and very different from any previous type of vaccine; there has been no time for extensive testing, and we don&#x27;t know the long-term side effects.<p>&gt; Given the novel nature of the mechanism of action of RNA vaccines, and their drug delivery vehicles, little is known about the medium and longer-term side effects....Up until December 2020, no mRNA vaccine, drug, or technology platform, had ever been approved for use in humans, and before 2020, mRNA was only considered a theoretical or experimental candidate for use in humans.

Last time I read or quoted from it was prior to those alterations, so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m citing. No reason to think the data has changed since then, just the interpretation.')
