Watergate cost Nixon his presidency.<p>I was against impeachment (I still think it was stupid), because it was a political stunt with no hope of actually removing the president. But just morally, Trump richly deserved investigation. &quot;Where&#x27;s there&#x27;s smoke, there&#x27;s fire&quot;, and Trump&#x27;s campaign and administration put out a burning oil well&#x27;s worth of smoke. He lost his National Security Advisor to a foreign agent violation within weeks of taking over. Senior members of his campaign coordinated with Julian Assange. I don&#x27;t think you can pretend like this was all fake.<p>(Just to calibrate: I also think Clinton <i>should have</i> been impeached).')
