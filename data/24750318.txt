No matter how you spin it and whatever benchmarks you show - Julia is a very slow fast language. :)<p>The UX of Julia needs major work - everything is just <i>slow</i>. If you&#x27;ve used Python for 10 years and it is like running through molasses. Benchmarks are meaningless for the most part. This is what bothers me about Julia&#x27;s marketing - it claims to be fast, but in reality, precompilation time alone is a no go unless you&#x27;re doing high-compute large batch processing. Julia cannot be come a general purpose language unless you fix these issues.<p>&gt; These &quot;conflations&quot; sound suspiciously like excuses.<p>I think you&#x27;re the one conflating total end-to-end time spent between given a task and going home early to see my kids if I used Python.')
