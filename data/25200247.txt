I was simply giving examples of the part of legal system that I know of. Pardon my English, what I call &#x27;local&#x27; is meant to be &#x27;civil cases&#x27; like business and personal cases. And yes of course the legal system delineates those cases from national level cases. My original argument was that civil cases largely work well (unless you prove me wrong by statistics).<p>I didn&#x27;t make any assumption of your information sources nor did I assert any influence of social media. It was only a general statement, not about anybody in particular. It was you who &#x27;assumed&#x27; I didn&#x27;t read any news etc. I fully respect all users&#x27; opinions here and would genuinely be interested to read any reference&#x2F;articles to prove your points. I&#x27;ll be surprised that the imprisoned lawyer cases were happening all the time in the lower courts.')
