When it comes time to deploy these new features, they can gradually be rolled out to users. If the feature starts triggering exceptions, it&#x27;s very easy to scale back.<p>Once the beta feature becomes stable, often the feature is removed (along with all logic in the source code guarding this feature).<p>Similarly, for A&#x2F;B testing, the feature flagging and logic is removed once a test is deemed to have either passed or failed the A&#x2F;B experiment.<p>Like anything else in software, feature flagging can incur technical debt if not properly maintained.')
