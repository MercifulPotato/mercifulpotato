We bought it kind of as a gag. I&#x27;d not heard of it before I saw it at the supermarket and I just couldn&#x27;t resist something called &quot;instant hot pot&quot;. I didn&#x27;t even know that it was self-heating =P<p>Oh, something I should have stated was that the hotpot was heavily supplemented with other food (and was also split between me and my girlfriend). It&#x27;s definitely just barely suitable for a North American male single serving.<p>At 9 bucks, I definitely think it&#x27;s too much for everyday consumption for my tastes, but I can see why it&#x27;d be attractive. It&#x27;s absolutely a premium option. I&#x27;d definitely try again, especially with the broth options available.<p>I feel like the &#x27;at home single serve hotpot&#x27; market isn&#x27;t quite fixed. I&#x27;m certain somewhere in China someone is already selling versions without heaters, designed with increased broth volume to be cooked in a pot, so that people can toss in some amount of their own extra ingredients. Or maybe I&#x27;m just articulating my dream =P')
