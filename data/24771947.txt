They could have just revoked the exemption for telemetry data without any of this platform nonsense.  I don&#x27;t want to get too off in the weeds here but I have zero expectation that the legislature doesn&#x27;t have more nefarious  things in the works for later.  Cracking down on the backyard mechanics who keep the shitboxes of the greater Boston area running and forcing the poors onto the T would be their wet dream.  If the goal is to give owners and manufacturers more access then why not just mandate that the OEMs provide the access, why go through the trouble of a platform if it&#x27;s not part of a bigger picture that you don&#x27;t want to tell people about just yet?')
