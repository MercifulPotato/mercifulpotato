It&#x27;s less convenient, because you have to park, go to the cashier, give them cash, go back to your car, fill up, go back to the cashier, get your change, and then go - versus put credit card in pump, fill up, go. It&#x27;s ultimately a consumer choice and some choose each option.<p>I&#x27;d love to have something similar for online payments. Give me a price, then charge transaction fees for credit and lower fees for debit or ACH, etc.')
