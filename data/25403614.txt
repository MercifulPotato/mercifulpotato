Such eyes witnessing an essentially isotropic and homogeneous CMB would be Eulerian observers of the CMB.  (In contrast to observers who see a dipole anisotropy because of acceleration along one spatial axis, for example, or observers immersed in the gravitational field of a massive system like a galaxy cluster or a planet).<p>Such Eulerian observers see a clearly peaked spectrum, essentially identical to a that of a blackbody radiator that is cooling.   If such observers are in deep inter-galaxy-cluster space and equipped with instruments to augment their CMB-sensitive eyes, they&#x27;d detect plenty of bright spots with frequencies much much lower than the peak in the CMB.    As an example an <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Radio_galaxy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Radio_galaxy</a> will be much brighter in wavelengths longer than that of the CMB (spectral radiance peak of CMB is ~ 160 GHz and falls off quickly away from the peak).<p>That -- correcting for proper motions and atmospheric effects -- our view of the sky is pretty uniform in the CMB (cf. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;BOOMERanG_experiment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;BOOMERanG_experiment</a> and beyond) but far from uniform in VLF, radio, IR, UV, X-Rays, gamma rays, and so on (as known since roughly the 1930s thanks to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Karl_Guthe_Jansky#Radio_astronomy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Karl_Guthe_Jansky#Radio_astron...</a> ) just like it is in visible light, <i>and</i> that the bright spots at different frequencies aren&#x27;t coincident in our sky, are important pieces of evidence which must be dealt with by any prospective model of physical cosmology.')
