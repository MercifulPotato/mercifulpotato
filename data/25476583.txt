Most people just equate my worries to those of an antivaxxer and move on.<p>These new vaccines have a 90% efficacy. It&#x27;s probably a no-brainer to give them to someone in their 70s or 80s with a high likelihood of having an adverse covid case. But a 20-year-old?<p>Out of a purely selfish wish of having a more normal world, part of me wants to suppress these thoughts and think &quot;I&#x27;m probably excessively cautious, it&#x27;s a good thing that the economic pressures will probably ensure that most are vaccinated in a year or two&quot;. But I do worry that many healthy people don&#x27;t have a complete view of the potential for unknown unknowns when they decide to take it.<p>The selfish part of me is thankful that someone else does the dirty job for ensuring that those thoughts aren&#x27;s spread wider. I&#x27;m really hoping that the authorities know what they&#x27;re doing, and I&#x27;d definitely be lying awake at night if I was in that role.<p>I probably won&#x27;t take it myself - there, I said it - but rather wait and get more data, or maybe go as far as seeing when one of the protein-based vaccines are ready.')
