That is game changing.&quot;<p>Man, I wish my headphones did this.  I <i>constantly</i> have to fiddle with my bluetooth settings, have audio come out of my mac or iPhone, sometimes in inappropriate places, even after I&#x27;ve tried to tell the OS to play from headphones.  The worst is when switching <i>between</i> my Mac and iPhone, usually I have to unpair one, put my headphones into pairing mode, or at the very least turn bluetooth off on one device.<p>My headphones are...Apple AirPods.  They did this when they first launched, so I even got the pros.  Now none of my pairs ever work.<p>I really wish Apple would figure out how to make stuff just work. I think there&#x27;s opportunity for someone to figure it out! No clue what happened to this company, but the AirPods are undoubtedly the most frustrating Apple product I&#x27;ve ever owned')
