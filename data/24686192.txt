Meaning: if you hire someone on a non-compete and the person cannot find work in another field (or lower salary) the previous company has to make the employee &quot;whole&quot;.<p>Non-competes are also meant to not be applied to everyone. Only certain employees should have these. This as having every employee on a non-compete is too restrictive for the employees.<p>All of this is&#x2F;was mentioned on various Dutch sites. It&#x27;s a bit weird it&#x27;s not explained on this English one.')
