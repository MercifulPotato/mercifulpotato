I don&#x27;t know but I know from another effort that was at Sun way back in the day it is really difficult to create curvature in a system that wants flat optical masks and flat processing.<p>There are at least two challenges, one is curve itself, and the other is laying out the sensor to be linear across the curved surface. I&#x27;m wondering if they are going to do a Hot Chips presentation, that has been where most of the coolest advances in chip making have been detailed.<p>A friend speculated they might be doing a mems sort of thing where they make a &#x27;thick&#x27; chip and then etch down to the layers of sensors, perhaps polishing, as a glass lens might be made, but for me that seems like it would be too risky. Thinning and bending is a possibility of course you need to account for the final topology in your layout.<p>Definitely a fun puzzle to speculate about.')
