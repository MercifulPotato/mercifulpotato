Item(by='rahimnathwani', descendants=None, kids=[25418137, 25413653, 25413843], score=None, time=1607920283, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25413198, text='&quot;Risk is measured by volatility&quot;<p>Consider a hypothetical security issued by the central bank. In one year&#x27;s time, the security will be redeemed. An official will roll a pair of dice. Snake eyes means the holder gets $3600; otherwise, the holder gets $0.<p>How would the market value such a security? The expected value on the expiry date is $100, so let&#x27;s say $98 today to account for the time value of money.<p>How volatile would the price of this security be over the next 1 month, next 3 months, next 6 months? Very low, right? The price would edge up slowly from $98 to $100, with maybe some small fluctuations due to changes in interest rate expectations.<p>This security has a greater than 90% chance that you lose 100% of your initial investment. If volatility is a good measure of risk, how can volatility be so low when there&#x27;s such a high risk that you lose your shirt?<p>EDIT: Corrected the payoff: should have been $3600, not $1200.')
