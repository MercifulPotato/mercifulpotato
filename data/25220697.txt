One oddity is that the usually communicated figure is only that emittted &#x27;at the tailpipe&#x27;, which is obviously zero for full electrics. Often people try to compensate by taking the kWh-per-km figure and multiplying by the CO2-per-kWh figure for their environment. This is however still misleading if compared with the tailpipe CO2 for an ICE, because the production of gasoline or diesel are also fairly CO2-intensive.<p>The official term of use is well-to-wheel efficiency or emissions; there is no doubt at all that electric vehicles beat ICE vehicles easily, basically on account of the ICE being relatively inefficient because of size&#x2F;performance constraints.<p>Obviously the actually interesting figure of merit is the lifetime emissions (and the &#x27;useful work&#x27; gained from those emissions) and while methods and tools to compute this exist  computing this in a reasonable way means making a lot of assumptions (such as the miles-per-lifetime), assumptions that will be easily attacked on internet fora, and assumptions that can easily be tweaked to show what you want to show.<p>The reality is that (full) electric vehicles are practical and efficient for most of the population today, if not in the very near future, and that it&#x27;s hard to imagine that the current dependency on oil will last very long. Ten years is a long time.')
