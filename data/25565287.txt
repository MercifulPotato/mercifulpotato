Apple has the culture and cultural force to sell you a laptop with ports you don&#x27;t like or a weird keyboard. Part of buying an Apple product is being on a certain cutting design edge and being someone&#x27;s beta tester. Its not a sharp edge and its a very mature beta, but there&#x27;s a sort of agreement you sign your name to when you buy a Mac.<p>In the PC world, the consumer space is dominated by anti-design nerdy guys who demand every port imaginable, and for good reason, and the business end is similar with their own legacy demands. Big changes in any way, be it features or lack-of are frowned upon and mocked (no wireless less space than a nomad -lame).<p>No one is going to win here because no one else can have Apple&#x27;s market. The incentives to win on the PC side are just too different. And even then, you can just bootcamp Windows or Linux and buy the &#x27;real&#x27; Apple you want anyway. Honestly, its a small miracle something like Apple even exits in the tech space. Its usually a race to the bottom on half-cooked features, general cheapness, and terrible UIs. Somehow Apple broke free of that and never looked back.')
