That has some implications<p>- risk - bank can go out of business (though it&#x27;s insured. But then again the cost of the insurance is baked into the system even though you might not see it directly)<p>- bank can invest your money on your behalf without you having any say in how it&#x27;s invested (say in a coal plant in India)<p>With digital euro private individuals will gain ability to open accounts directly with the central bank which solves both problems. Central bank cannot go out of business (by definition), and they are not in the investment business. So digital euro would really be a digital version of the bank notes under the mattress.')
