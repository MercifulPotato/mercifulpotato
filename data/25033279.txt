Item(by='AshamedCaptain', descendants=None, kids=[25034574], score=None, time=1604917304, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25031483, text='&gt; It&#x27;s all too easy these days to have a clear intention only to be sidetracked by the whirlpool of apps and services clawing for our attention on our devices.<p>I have to admit I&#x27;m a bit baffled by these remarks. It is very easy to have a &quot;apps and services&quot;-free experience: just kill notifications. Why would the paper make a difference? It&#x27;s not like your &quot;attention-clawing&quot; misconfigured device is not still at your reach.<p>That said, I am a big fan of &quot;digital writing&quot; ever since tablet PCs were a thing, and I have yet to find anything that even approaches the convenience of pen and paper. In fact, my current preferred &quot;digital writing&quot; method is to use one of these digitizing pens, with my favourite tech being Anoto&#x27;s&#x2F;Livescribe (if only the company was not actively user-hostile).')
