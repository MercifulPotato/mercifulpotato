If you have constant traffic you&#x27;re better off using a small VM.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t understand this.<p>The entire point of Lambda&#x27;s is to offload the overhead and complexity of managing severs - and - to allow for large occasional spikes in traffic.<p>Even with the limitation of &#x27;5 second warmup per concurrent&#x27; Lambda - that&#x27;s not a big deal. It means maybe 100-200 users have to wait a few seconds while 100-200 Lambdas warm up - and with 1.5 user spike ... you really don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re going to get, but with Lambda&#x27;s at least you&#x27;re pretty much guaranteed it will work.<p>For cost efficiency, with stable tech, stable&#x2F;predictable traffic, and enough scale that you have the right team to be able to manage your EC2&#x27;s properly - yes that makes sense. But you need some scale to get to that point wherein that cost efficiency is worth it given that Lambda&#x27;s &#x27;just work&#x27; fairly well fairly easily.<p>But I definitely could be missing something.')
