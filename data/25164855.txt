I&#x27;ve been using Linux for almost 20 years now, and I remember all the gymnastics and research that was required to get things like audio and wifi working. In 2020, the only reason I dual boot windows and Linux is for video games, which are becoming less and less important to me, and less of an issue with the work Valve is doing.<p>And, while Linux has gotten considerably more stable and hassle-free, at the same time, Windows, in my experience, has gotten _worse_. The start menu is slow, and makes network requests for some reason. The UI is so flat that I can&#x27;t tell anything apart, and I&#x27;m frequently pestered to link my install with my Microsoft account or enable cortana. I wish I could have used Windows 7 forever :\\')
