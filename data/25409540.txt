Item(by='harlanji', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607889138, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25409223, text='I always have to throw in the homeless angle, but when people expect me to be able to produce out of the back of a Honda Civic with a ghetto rigged 15A&#x2F;120W circuit + 30W solar and no tint and priviously no license or insurance (anxiety, ducking cops)... I just smiled and said let me write a book with reasons you’re out of your mind—poverty reduces to physics. I’m doing my best and overcoming obstacles, but yea, there is a cognitive dissonance between universally accepting things like this and then expecting a homeless person to be producing as though they have office space.<p>Good list tho.')
