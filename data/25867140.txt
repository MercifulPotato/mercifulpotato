Item(by='DaiPlusPlus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611279547, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25863442, text='&gt; but you&#x27;re forced to be in a union (and pay dues) against your will...<p>If it&#x27;s a &quot;closed&quot; union shop, then I&#x27;d consider the union-dues as simply part of the job-offer and treat it the same as employee-side health plan copayments: a minor unpleasantry but nothing worth raising a fuss about - assuming the union dues were in the typical range of $300-800&#x2F;yr - obviously the more they cost the more I&#x27;d be inclined to ensure they&#x27;re being spent responsibly and that I felt like I was being represented well.<p>Though I want to say the sentiment (or mental-connotation) you&#x27;re expressing with language like &quot;against one&#x27;s will&quot; w.r.t. union membership hints of a reductionist Ayn Randian influence on your opinion. That statement is not an incorrect assessment, but it&#x27;s overstating the problem - it reminds me of sayings like &quot;taxation is theft&quot;.<p>Sincere question: what do high-quality surveys of union membership (across all industry sectors in the US) suggest about opinions held by closed-shop employees of their unions - and their employers? I feel there&#x27;s too much reliance online on anecdotes about the excesses of certain named unions when it comes to forming opinions about them, so I&#x27;d prefer to see some &quot;big data&quot; about union membership.')
