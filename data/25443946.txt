Item(by='throwaway894345', descendants=None, kids=[25445089, 25444450, 25447201], score=None, time=1608133672, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25441698, text='There&#x27;s lots to criticize about other Western countries and how they&#x27;ve managed their own resources (and especially for any outsourcing of environmental harm to which they contribute), but we don&#x27;t need to be dishonest by arguing that they&#x27;ve depleted their own resources. North America has some of the most abundant forests, oil fields, and coal deposits in the world, and that without accepting payment to compensate for not consuming them. Similarly, Europe has many resources of its own. And (especially in Europe) most of the consumption of natural resources in these countries predated our modern understanding of environment.<p>If the US demanded a check from Brazil in order to halt the creation of some oil pipeline or coal mine, they would rightly be laughed out of the room--the US shouldn&#x27;t contribute to worsening environmental issues because it&#x27;s every country&#x27;s moral responsibility to create a sustainable future.<p>&gt; especially when they buy meat and soya from Brazil.<p>I&#x27;m a big fan of economic solutions to economically-derived environmental problems. I want as many countries as possible to have a carbon tax, and I want those countries to have a border adjustment so China or whomever can&#x27;t out-compete other countries by polluting (externalizing the cost of production to the environment). Maybe the analog here is a border adjustment for Brazil and other countries that aren&#x27;t managing their environment to some accepted standard, so that other Western countries aren&#x27;t contributing to Brazilian deforestation (and other environmental issues).')
