This is about Twitter&#x27;s obligation (or lack thereof) to broadcast your thoughts to others.<p>They are not burning you at the stake like a vengeful Catholic church during the Inquisition or outlawing your thoughts like &quot;wrongthink&quot; in 1984.<p>Two, the printing press analogy is highly flawed. Twitter is like the owner of one specific printing press, not some entity that controls <i>all</i> printing presses. If <i>you</i> owned a printing press, would <i>you</i> want to be obligated to print things you find factually and harmful?<p>I assume you&#x27;d certainly want the freedom to turn down printing jobs. Or do only certain freedoms matter?')
