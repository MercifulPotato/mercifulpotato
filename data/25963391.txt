And if it is very slightly accidentally gerrymandered in some places, that works <i>against</i> the Conservatives - Labour MPs often have smaller constituencies.<p>So no that’s not relevant or part of what is being talked about here.<p>The reality is that 43% popular vote for a single party in a system with four major parties, 10 percentage points more than their nearest rival, <i>is</i> nothing but an enormous popular vote landslide. The Conservatives are popular amongst broad sections of society, incomes, ethnicities, regions. All other parties serve limited niches so are fundamentally constrained.<p>Why don’t they form a coalition? Well I’m not sure they really have deeply shared values to do that. Many struggle to share values internally!')
