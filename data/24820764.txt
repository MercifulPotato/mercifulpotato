You can identify the onset and offset not just of noise but different types of noise. If you mix blue and brown noise and listen to it for a while and then drop one of the noise channels you definitely notice it. You aren&#x27;t learning the specific values of any part of the noise (as you say this is unpredictable) but the frequency components are consistent enough that we constantly subtract them from our sensory streams all the time.<p>Noise tolerance is one of the most fascinating aspects of biological intelligence IMHO :)')
