I have a 12 year-old Toyota with 200k+ miles, and the only parts that have ever worn out have been suspension and brake parts (wheel bearing and brake rotors&#x2F;pads), which of course an EV will have as well. It&#x27;s never had problems with the engine or transmission. There are oil changes, and it&#x27;ll be nice to skip that once I have an EV, but it&#x27;s also like a 20 minute thing twice a year or so.')
