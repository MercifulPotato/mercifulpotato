Any article that calls workers with the right to quit is hyperbolic and already made me doubt other &quot;facts&quot; that are written.<p>&gt; The DoL was a known problem in 2010.\n&gt; One of Trump&#x27;s last-minute regulations was a rollback that protected workers from being misclassified as contractors. The Biden admin could reverse that regulation.<p>Well that wouldn&#x27;t fix the exact issue being described as happening in 2010.<p>This article (if true) has a lot of powerful things to right. Such as the cost for training and quiting or how businesses can decline to pay fees. As an article talking about misclassifying workers it does an awful job of misclassifying slavery.')
