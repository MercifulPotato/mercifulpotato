I&#x27;m denying your currently provably false claims about the extent of their awesomeness, and I&#x27;ve linked to the proofs and specified exactly what you have claimed but what&#x27;s provably not supported at the moment. I see you don&#x27;t try anymore to claim what you initially claimed, and that&#x27;s good.<p>Your claim &quot;you should be wearing a mask around them anyway, because they&#x27;re very vulnerable to a hell of a lot more bugs that you could be toting around than just SARS-Cov-2&quot; is also wrong. It&#x27;s also provable, and was easy to read in the press for months, that many people who would otherwise live decades longer, without people around them wearing masks, already died form SARS-Cov-2. There are still many such who have tried to protect themselves in these months but who will be more exposed to those who would wrongly believe in &quot;sterilizing immunity&quot; of the vaccine if there is no such.<p>So it&#x27;s important to be scientifically accurate. At the current moment, all we know is that the vaccines protect the vaccinated from getting sick. We still don&#x27;t know that the vaccinated can&#x27;t transmit the virus to the vulnerable, and until we know that, we <i>must</i> say that we don&#x27;t know that and protect the vulnerable!<p>As Lawrence Rifkin MD writes, also at the moment on HN: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25287076" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25287076</a><p>&quot;So when facing loss of innocent life in a house fire, cry openly. Allow yourself to hurt deeply. Comfort the bereaved. But don’t say “it was meant to be” or “they’re in a better place.” Go out and promote stoves with smoke-sensing, automatic shut-off valves. The fact that we have the ability, through conscious choice and action, to change the world and make it a better place is a fundamental wonder of being human. It’s what being good is. Not for the benefit of some other world, but for this, our one world; not for some supernatural being, but for our fellow beings.&quot;')
