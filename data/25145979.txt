She took their picture, posted on a public forum without addressing the people or anyone else locally.<p>This is why this type of call-out culture is bad.  You attack first, the damage is done, often excessive damage, without addressing the issue locally.  It would have been different if they had done something wrong, she gets ignored by the police, THEN calls them out.<p>The other issue with these public witch hunts is they are random.  Some people get no traction, others hunted down.  This lack of consistency is a horrible way to enforce rules which may or may not have even been broken.')
