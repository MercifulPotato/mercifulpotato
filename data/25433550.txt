They have the links and self-referential details in their particular json schemas that you seem to imply are necessary and unique for that.<p>If the argument is that json can&#x27;t be rendered, isn&#x27;t it arguable that xml equally has that problem, we just have a program with a common syntax reader format that renders pages equivalently, and something equivalent could be written for a particular json schema?')
