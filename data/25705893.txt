The limitation it will probably have compared to ELK&#x2F;Splunk is that since there&#x27;s only a single recipient node and it uses SQLite for storage, the upper limit to how quickly it can ingest logs will probably be lower compared to ELK&#x2F;Splunk. So Logsuck may not ever be suitable for large deployments that are logging huge amounts for sustained periods of time.<p>I haven&#x27;t really tested what the limits are yet so unfortunately I can&#x27;t put a concrete number on it, but my vision is that Logsuck should at the very least work for a small-medium sized company with &quot;normal&quot; logging needs.<p>The current state is that it&#x27;s got quite a few bugs and is lacking many features you would expect from an ELK&#x2F;Splunk alternative but the basic concept is working. If what you need is a GUI for grepping across logs spread out on multiple servers it can be used for that today, but it&#x27;s not doing much beyond that yet.')
