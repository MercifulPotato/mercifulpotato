If you’re rural, or in less expensive parts of the world, their salaries were well above market.<p>Tax domicile is a real concern. The BigTech firms are smart enough to know and care where your actual legal residence is, and presumably they’re not going to let you pretend to be in SF to collect SF-adjusted wages while actually living in Michigan and collecting their legal benefits.')
