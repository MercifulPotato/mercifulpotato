The challenge I&#x27;ve found is mostly running into indoctrination, lack of critical thinking, lack of willingness to accommodate to read long-form explanations of what I write out for my experience to get doctors or professionals on the same page of understanding. I have mostly given up and am winding down my hopes or fantasy of a capable, productive, rewarding future now though - planning to return &quot;home&quot; to an unfinished, untidy, cluttered house that no one should live in, where my mother has been mostly alone the past 5 years since my father passed away horrifically - so I&#x27;m no longer paying rent anywhere nor have any obligations and will quietly disappear from the universe as barely anyone will know that I will be gone.')
