It’s pretty hard to audit cloud services that claim to have isolated dbs, but it seems like such a massive breach of contract if they were actually doing this.<p>It’s the same risk if Microsoft cracked open all the sql dbs to analyze and train AIs. Or if AWS tried to use data stored with them. I’m sure it would be useful but would break every contract they have and since they are trying to make money off cloud services that’s a big risk for minimal return.<p>So unless there’s more evidence just saying something is possible is a rabbit hole for every cloud provider, right?')
