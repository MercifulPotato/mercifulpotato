I was working on a project for a robotics class and my team could not figure out why our object tracking went from 30fps to ~5fps seemingly randomly. It turns out the USB3 cable wasn&#x27;t fully plugged in and couldn&#x27;t make full contact so it was running on USB2 and didn&#x27;t have the bandwidth to send the video at 30fps.<p>It took a while to debug because I was absolutely convinced the slowdown was a software or GPU issue. After all, wouldn&#x27;t you expect most digital ports to be binary: either be plugged in or not? It turns out with USB3 there&#x27;s a third state.')
