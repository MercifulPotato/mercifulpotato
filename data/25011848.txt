Instead of just having Rogue, Nethack and Caves of Qud we&#x27;re getting some games that dip their toes in the water to grab a few features those designers appreciate (i.e. permadeath a mechanic lots of devs have used to make their games less stressful by keeping expected lives rather short - a usage of a mechanic for a purpose far different from original rogue-like&#x27;s intentions)...<p>I think this is just like music genres - nobody owns a genre and games will come out that do different things with that genre... the market is open and new games just add to the collection of choice - it might be that rogue-lites end up stealing some community support and income from more classic rogue-likes but nothing has destroyed Rogue or any of the other games people have fallen in love with along the way.<p>I have my own classifications for what roguelike would be and Diablo (even in permadeath mode) wouldn&#x27;t fit into it - it&#x27;s far too fixed and predictable of a game and quite easy to initially get into - I&#x27;d consider a lack of accessibility to basically be a rogue-like requirement.')
