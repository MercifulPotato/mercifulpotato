Let&#x27;s analyse it one by one:<p>&gt; Confidence doesn’t just feel good; it’s the pillar of success. It pushes you to try new things, take on challenges, and persevere in the face of adversity.<p>I guess most people would agree with these if we assume he refers to inner confidence, not something you show to others.<p>&gt; A University of Melbourne study found that confident people earn higher wages and get promoted more often than their less confident counterparts.<p>Of course the study is not linked, but again, this is not surprising and in line with common sense.<p>&gt; Sleeping naked makes you more comfortable in your own skin.<p>And now he makes this giant leap inserting his own opinion, right after he mentions the study, without providing a grain of evidence.<p>&gt; As your comfort with your body increases, so does your self-esteem and confidence.<p>Now he is using modus ponens. The problem is, he never proved  the antecedent is true.<p>This kind of cheap tricks is typical of snakeoil salesmen. For the sake of people who read only HN headers, I&#x27;d even go as far as to edit the title here to &quot;There is no proof sleeping naked makes you healthier and wealthier&quot; (or: &quot;Benefits of sleeping in lower temperatures&quot;).')
