Well my theory is that legal fees and help would be higher (that&#x27;s right higher) if a longer time period was given. Seems counter intuitive but that&#x27;s my way of looking at it. (I guess in short maybe a version of &#x27;work expands to fill the time available for completion something like that).<p>That said I don&#x27;t feel bad for these companies at all. They have plenty of resources and plenty of money. And no reason they can&#x27;t ask for and receive extensions of the time due there is no &#x27;train leaving&#x27; at that time the info needs to board.')
