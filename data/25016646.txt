It can punish you pretty hard[1] if you don&#x27;t follow proper patterns, or the architecture you decided.<p>For instance, I think the issues were more pronounced with the project using Mongo precisely because of the flexibility Mongo offers, which allows to delay deciding on schemas, and thus means that the architecture itself can change constantly.<p>[1]: Such as making coupling and code repetition to balloon pretty fast.')
