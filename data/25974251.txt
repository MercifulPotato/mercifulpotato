Most of the apps that I use run natively on Wayland and scale perfectly: Firefox (with some extra setup), Telegram Desktop, Alacritty, all GTK and KDE apps.<p>The apps that do get blurry are the ones that are made by big companies for which Linux experience is not the first priority (thus they don&#x27;t care about native Wayland support). Zoom, Chromium, Google Earth, Discord, Steam, Skype. I don&#x27;t use them much, and when I do I try to keep them on my big (non-scaled) monitor, and it works fine.')
