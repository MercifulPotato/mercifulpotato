I only link to my own site in threads where it&#x27;s directly and precisely relevant, such as this one.<p>If you found it valuable, you should submit it yourself.  I&#x27;m not interested in the accumulation of updoots, feel free to get &#x27;em. :)<p>I&#x27;d rather other people decide what subset of my writing is relevant to HN, as I&#x27;m no good at it: I&#x27;m too close to the work.  (I only write about things I care a lot about.)')
