The results are totally expected and if anything demonstrate the market is competitive, not anti-competitive.<p>Users don’t want an “alternative App Store market”. They want a place where they know the apps they download won’t steal their data or crash their device, where the billing policies are  clear and predictable, where you can set parental controls and get refunds on accidental purchases.<p>Apple doesn’t have customers because they are the only one who you can buy water, electricity, or internet from at your home address. Apple has customers because people willingly and happily shovel their hard-earned money at them because their products are freaking amazing.<p>In no universe can anyone say that the progression &#x2F; advancement of smartphones and smartphone applications indicates a stagnant market or one in need of forced government intervention.<p>From what I can see iPhone 1 with its 400MHz Samsung CPU and 320x480 display and its half dozen apps -&gt; iPhone 12 with its 8 core 3GHz A14, 2532x1170 display, and millions of apps demonstrates conclusively that consumers are winning out tremendously over the last 13 years due to a highly competitive market driving truly massive R&amp;D investment in this space.<p>I think the problem that people actually have with Apple is that they are so far ahead of the pack, and people  don’t see where the inevitable disruption is going to come from just yet.')
