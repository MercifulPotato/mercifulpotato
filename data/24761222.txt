The only area where you can even have indentifiably top performers is in sports, where you have a contest that someone is going to win, and you want to pay up for the guy who is marginally better than the next guy.\n<i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><p><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i>*<p>I&#x27;ve worked at one of the trillion dollar companies, at a smaller company that sold for $4 billion, and now run my own startup<p>In each case I saw examples of this<p>For the company that sold at $4 billion, the top two developers were at least 100x developers<p>at the trillion dollar company, there were many developers in 10X to 100X range, not just a few<p>and in my startup I&#x27;m lucky to have two 1000x developers<p><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><p>Of the examples given, I&#x27;d say<p>Linus and Carmack and Simonyi for sure<p>I&#x27;d also say Stallman<p><i></i>*\nI also had 2 college friends who were somewhere between 100X and 500X<p>one of them coded an entire stock trading platform as a project for a one semester college course. The Professor was astonished and so was everyone else\nIt was fully working<p>the other worked on making a mobile version of an enterprise product. His team freaked out because he did more on his solo project than a 200+ developer team that was the &#x27;official team doing it&#x27;<p>seems they gave it to my friend&#x2F;college mate just to see if he had some new approach. They didn&#x27;t expect he&#x27;d do more than the official team<p><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i>*<p>People don&#x27;t understand mindset<p>we had one person in our college, this was back in 1999, he coded a FULL multi person chat software (like ICQ, but not as polished) in his first year summer vacation AS A HOBBY<p>If you really think someone like that is &#x27;only marginally better&#x27; than people who clock in for 30 hours and then run back for &#x27;work life balance&#x27; then you don&#x27;t really understand coding<p>Coding is an art and a science<p>and you need practice and you need a sort of neural network in your head that keeps learning stuff specific to coding')
