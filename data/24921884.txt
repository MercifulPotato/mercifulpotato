I&#x27;m not a developer on any of these projects and you aren&#x27;t my project manager. If you intend to try to step up to manage this as a work project  then that&#x27;s fine but this is not the place to do it. Save it for your own employees that you&#x27;re hiring.<p>Re user confusion: If you know enough to write scripts using xdotool you can probably figure out how to use a package manager and switch a machine over to X.<p>Re global hotkeys: I still don&#x27;t understand your complaint. You just described two applications that didn&#x27;t work and then went on to explain how one of them was made to work on Wayland. Yes, applications need to be ported, no solution on the Wayland side will ever change that. If the complaint is that the chosen method adds latency, or that the config setting has moved, those are vastly different than your original complaint which is that it doesn&#x27;t work.')
