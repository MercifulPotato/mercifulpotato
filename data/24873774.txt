If I work 3ft from where I sleep, I never &quot;turn off&quot; work.<p>So this means I needed either find space in the rest of my house (the kitchen table or rent a larger place).<p>Assuming I don&#x27;t want to reduce my quality of life by working WFH, I&#x27;m now spending an extra $300&#x2F;mo on food, equipment, and sq footage. If I was freelancing, I could write off these expenses on my taxes and my prices would reflect these costs. As a W2 worker, I am not able to write off these expenses from my taxes nor have I been able to negotiate better pay from my employer.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buffer.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;work-bed&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buffer.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;work-bed&#x2F;</a>')
