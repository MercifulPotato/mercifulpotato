Item(by='boogies', descendants=None, kids=[25434614], score=None, time=1608062615, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25432077, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t know many people who care about the hardware except for the camera.<p>These phones are not for many people.<p>&gt; How is it?<p>In development. The pinephone can take still shots. The Librem 5’s camera isn’t functional yet AFAIK.<p>&gt; Can it compete with the current phones from Apple and Google?<p>No. It’s not playing the same game. I would pay money not to have one of those.<p>&gt; Does it do all the standard things like include filters, portrait mode, night mode, etc...?<p>AFAIK, no.<p>&gt; Can I search for &quot;dog&quot; and get all my dog photos or search for a city and get all the photos taken there?<p>I don’t know of any apps for them that do that at the moment.<p>&gt; And how&#x27;s the app store? When some random game goes viral and I want to play with my friends, am I going to be able to?<p>Probably not. It probably has about 6 orders of magnitude fewer users, and 5–6 orders fewer devs. You can virtualize Android, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it was a much worse experience than Proton on desktop (it doesn’t have Valve behind it. Anti-cheat might get you banned).<p>&gt; Are the apps vetted for security and safety?<p>Yes, in some repos. Most of the distros will let you use Debian’s, which IIUC have had z-e-r-o zero malware (not counting systemd ;)) in their decades-long history.<p>&gt; Does it integrate with my car? One of the primary uses of my phone is for navigation. Being able to plug it into my car and say &quot;navigate to 123 main street&quot; as I drive is pretty key.<p>I’m confused why it needs to integrate with you car to give directions. Do you mean connect with Bluetooth to use your speakers?<p>&gt; Is their store only online?<p>Yep.<p>&gt; If they don&#x27;t have their own retailers can I at least see them at a carrier store or BestBuy?<p>Nope.<p>&gt; Will Verizon activate the phone on their network? A decade ago they wouldn&#x27;t approve the Nexus 7 tablet, so this is something I think about.<p>Nope, not as far as my crystal ball can see. The pine wiki says you can activate a SIM on a burner phone and swap it into the pinephone, and Verizon shouldn’t care.')
