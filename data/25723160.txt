Trolls and Trump play by different rules, truth and facts are inconsequential -- all that matters is the reaction of their victims.<p>I have sympathy with Trump supporters that are not in on the &quot;joke&quot;. It&#x27;s not stupid to believe the president of the United States will be honest with them (at least on issues of national importance like &quot;massive&quot; election fraud), but he won&#x27;t.
