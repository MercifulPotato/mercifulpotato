Who knows that you did so?<p>Well first of all, the person who was supposed to get the mail-in ballot in the first place.  In Michigan, you can check to see whether they&#x27;ve received your mail-in ballot.<p>Don&#x27;t you think that if 100k Republicans in Michigan didn&#x27;t receive their ballot at all, but checked and found that they had been registered as having voted, we&#x27;d be hearing about that?<p>&gt; I personally find it very implausible that in both elections that Trump was in he produced results about 3% better than polls indicated he would.<p>I find this highly suspicious too.  In 2016 it might have been the &quot;Shy Tory&quot; effect, but the Trump voters in 2020 didn&#x27;t seem at all shy to me.')
