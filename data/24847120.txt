People who&#x27;s job requires thinking don&#x27;t have much to worry about.<p>Most forklift drivers have duties that include a non-trivial amount of getting off the lift and doing some amount of moving things and a good amount of planning (often specific to the business situation that day) as to where stuff will go.  Same goes for someone operating a front end loader or excavator.  Anyone can hold a steering wheel.  The reason they&#x27;re not paid min-wage like delivery drivers is because they&#x27;re paid to think and plan ahead.  It&#x27;s really hard to outsource that kind of stuff in a manner that is actually cheaper in the long term.  I suspect that just like in IT, the companies that successfully outsource will be the big ones that heavily invest in profit to the point where any given person is just following process, not really thinking and planning (think mines, major manufacturing operations, large food distributors, some LTL freight, Walmart, etc).')
