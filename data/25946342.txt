Item(by='esoterica', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611858089, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25941689, text='&gt; Whether the investments being made are responsible or not, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it should be their place to intervene.<p>The entire history of the retail investing is unsophisticated investors shooting themselves in the foot and then turning around and suing everyone who allowed them to shoot themselves in the foot. It&#x27;s obvious to everyone watching that for every retail investor who buys in at $10 and cashes out at the top there are going to be 20 other traders who FOMO in at $300 or $500 and then hodls all the way down to $10. People have a stated preference for Freedom to take risks but a revealed preference for paternalism (they start suing everyone around them for not &quot;protecting&quot; them from themselves when risks go bad). You can&#x27;t blame companies for rationally responding to the legal liability they think they will incur if they let more retail traders pile onto meme stocks.')
