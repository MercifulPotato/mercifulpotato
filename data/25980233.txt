We use TeaVM for our web platform, and it has been fantastic.  It was the first solution to provide support for threads in JS.  (i.e. Your java programs can use synchronization, and they will work properly when deployed to the web).<p>The performance is very good (we tried other options to get a web port working before we found TeaVM, and none could compare).<p>The developer is responsive to bugs - but it has been rock solid for us.  At this point the JS port is one of our most stable platforms.<p>The development environment is also nice to work with.  I work with all of the native SDKs that we deploy to, and TeaVM is my favourite.  In particular, the JS&lt;-&gt;Java interop is smooth and easy with minimal boiler plate.  On most platforms, using a native API is at least a little painful - with some boiler plate necessary.  On TeaVM it has annotations to be able to &quot;drop into&quot; javascript without a lot of fuss.')
