I think C214 is the current version.<p>I really love the hardware. It is indeed rugged and water resistant, it had to endure much on my travels, fell down a lot or things on it. Moisture, sand, heat, ice and snow - and is also made for maintaineance, I could quite easily replace the touchscreen, the only thing that broke, which was really my fault for stepping on it (but getting the replacement part, I had to order from china)<p>And how much coding I get out if it, well depends on the situation. If there is strong sun all the time, then forever. Also with just 1 panel and batterie.<p>The batterie on its own last 10+ hours (now after 4 years of intense use obviously not anymore)<p>Meaning if you code during the day, your power bank gets charged in the meantime. Can get charged full from empty in the right conditions in some hours and one power bank gives me around 1.5 laptop, charges. More power than you need.<p>Meaning just with 1 extra batterie I get 25 hs of coding. Meaning on short trips of limited time and unstable sun, I just bring a second power bank and have 40 h of work without needing to recharge.<p>But since the sun does not shine all the time and I spend weeks and at times, months off the grid, I upgraded to 2 panels and 3 batteries to really not care about power anymore.<p>Before I learned to be energy efficient.\nWhich also lead to interesting results, like I only opened up the lid, if I really knew what to do. \nSo intense short burst of coding and then stop and thinking about the next step, or the current problem, that showed up.\nIt is efficient and also healthy, giving your eyes only limited screen exposure with lots of rest, but still getting stuff done.<p>edit: about device, before that one I had a cheap windows convertible. For 200 â‚¬ you get already 10+h of work, lightweight and USB charging. But I really can&#x27;t stand windows. And stock linux drivers are too buggy in that segment.\nWhen I open up my chromebook, it is immediately awake and I can resume exactly where I closed it.\nOn my bigger powered manjaro laptop, I have to wait at least 10 seconds, which disturbs my flow.')
