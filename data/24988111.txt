It&#x27;s unfortunate that most low-key UI libraries don&#x27;t support them, partly because those OS API are so complex and for a non-user it is hard to understand them (much like for English users it is sometimes hard to understand what&#x27;s needed for localization).<p>A pragmatic way to see it - and arguably it&#x27;s an issue I don&#x27;t have answer for - is that the sum of all desirable modern features (incl. but not limited to accessibility features) are growing the scope so complex and large it is also - very unfortunately - hindering innovation. Everyone agrees accessibility features are desirable. Yet if every experimental or hobbyist project needed to implement all accessibility features, those projects wouldn&#x27;t exist. So two steps forward is costing us one step back here :(. There are _so many things_ dear imgui doesn&#x27;t do at this point, it can&#x27;t handle full internationalization and right-to-left text. Maybe it&#x27;ll catch up. Maybe other solutions will solve this. For now as I don&#x27;t have the resources to do it all myself. But the more people use and work with a given software the more likely it is to evolve and improve. I would gladly surrender to a much better product than dear imgui that implemented this while also solving the problems dear imgui aims to solve.')
