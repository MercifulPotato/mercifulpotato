I had a lot of fun modeling shortwave antennas and putting them into real world use. Since I had decent antennas I also did SWL and things like oddity signal analysis, DXCC, antennas for lightning storms on Jupiter.<p>I still listen to Radio Habana Cuba english some nights on shortwave on my cheap chinese loop.
