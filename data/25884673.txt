He just needs to tell me what it&#x27;s about and ask when I&#x27;m free. I&#x27;ll be happy to carve out time in my schedule and offer up, say, 30 minutes at 2pm. If he needs to talk sooner than that, he can make a counter proposal and say &quot;this is really urgent, can you talk sooner?&quot; and I will weigh it accordingly<p>Overcommunicating is better than undercommunicating.')
