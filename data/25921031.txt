Before Mozilla detected the in-between update state there it was common to see spikes of crashes that were related to process spawning.<p>The choice Mozilla has is to allow the user  randomly crash with a chance of profile corruption or alerting the user about the state and asking the user to trigger an orderly shutdown.')
