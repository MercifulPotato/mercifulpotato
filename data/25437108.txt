Sales wants new features and new products, and they want them yesterday.  Finance people want everything to be cheap, but since most engineers have no idea how to prove to them with actual hard data that it&#x27;s cheaper in the long run ship features more carefully and slowly, and build things with reliability and robustness in mind, finance people go in the opposite direction and think that hiring inexperienced developers from the cheapest places on the planet is the way to go, because &quot;cost of R&amp;D per head&quot; is a very easy number to quantify.<p>Unfortunately very few companies have an engineering department that can overrule all of product, sales, and finance.  In general even one of those three being stronger means engineering never has the buy-in to take the time to do things the right way.  And if you&#x27;re the engineer who consistently pushes back product and feature releases because you want things built correctly, you get fired, or at best marginalized.<p>Interesting that you mention Google, since it has a reputation for being more engineering-focused that most companies.  From what I read on HN (perhaps not a representative sample, but...), it seems like Google has a culture of &quot;build something cool to get promoted and then stop caring about what you built because maintenance doesn&#x27;t get you promoted any further&quot;.  If true, I think that very easily explains Google&#x27;s &quot;hot messes&quot;.')
