Item(by='quietbritishjim', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609840881, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25642635, text='I was disappointed to search through the comments and not find the phrase &quot;two slit experiment&quot;. [1]<p>The first half of the article is clealy about quantum mechanics, although it doesn&#x27;t name it explicitly. The author seems to be arguing that there is something specific really going on below the quantum level, regardless of whether we can measure it, and scientists refuse to acknowledge that only because of philosphical dogma (logical positivism). They seemed to think we only use probabilities to reflect our uncertainty, and ought to come up with a more fundamental theory that avoids that uncertainty.<p>But the two slit experiment shows that there is no more fundamental theory (at least not in that sense). If two paths have probability of 0.5, then it&#x27;s not the case that only one or the other took place, we just don&#x27;t know which is which. Instead, they both took place in some sense, to the extent that they <i>interact with each other</i>; that&#x27;s not possible if there was one true path that we just couldn&#x27;t deduce. It&#x27;s maybe better to think of 0.5 as a weighting rather than a probability.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Double-slit_experiment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Double-slit_experiment</a>')
