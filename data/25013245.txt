You need to ensure:<p>1. DynamoDB IAM permissions are correct.<p>2. EC2 IAM is correct.<p>3. The nitroenclave attestation is securely written, so as to avoid proxy-attestations from the main VM (and other attacks)<p>4. KMS IAM permissions are correctly written, to avoid direct decryption.<p>The additional complexity of writing this beast, managing it, making sure that your setup remains maintainable and scalable might be worth it, but you need to compare it to the ROI:<p>&gt;The salt for any hash cannot be accessed by the attacker to perform a brute-force attack.<p>Using bcrypt with a high cost factor pretty much guarantees the same.<p>I&#x27;d be more interested in seeing a SGX-like solution using NitroEnclaves.
