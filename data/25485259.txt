Have you been doing the side quests?<p>I want to add that Deus Ex is hands down my favourite franchise, I&#x27;ve played every installment multiple times (except Invisible War). So I didn&#x27;t make the comparison lightly. I&#x27;m not suggesting it&#x27;s exactly like Deus Ex, but I think calling it a luke warm copy isn&#x27;t doing Cyberpunk any justice either. It&#x27;s got elements from Deus Ex, but it is a very unique game with it&#x27;s own approach to the genre.')
