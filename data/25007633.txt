I&#x27;ve never even had to think about chunk size when using sftp. It has always &quot;just worked&quot; for transfering files.<p>What scenarios are you talking about where chunks are important and you have to be concerned about ordering? Is this strictly for applications that perform large sync&#x27;ing jobs where &quot;to-the-limit&quot; performance is important?<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem like a huge deal to deprecate scp and start using a short stanza of sftp for simple file transfers.')
