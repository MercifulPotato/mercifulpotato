This should be running at module level.<p>A better approach, if the micro you are using allows it, is to have an interrupt when (for example) the I2S buffer is empty. I would then point the DMA to fetch the next buffer (already processed and mixed) and fire the DMA transfer.<p>&gt; at least 100ms<p>This calls for huge latency problems. But I understand the approach if your buffer-filling&#x2F;reading procedures are slow or unreliable.<p>I disagree with the timer thing. There are systems that provide precise timers for media (for example Win32 multimedia timers[1], that I never used but I know they exist).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows&#x2F;win32&#x2F;multimedia&#x2F;about-multimedia-timers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows&#x2F;win32&#x2F;multimedia&#x2F;ab...</a>')
