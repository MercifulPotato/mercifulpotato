Item(by='fouc', descendants=None, kids=[24807860], score=None, time=1602912054, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24805971, text='The cochlea is like a snail-shell shaped organ, lined with hairs. When the sound wave - or more specifically the vibration - reaches a bunch of hairs, they in turn fire a bunch of neurons.<p>The distance the sound wave travels into the organ is related to whether it is a high pitched or low pitched sound. The hairs are essentially &quot;dumb&quot;, they only trigger the neuron firings when they detect the vibration.<p>So regenerating the hairs in the cochlea definitely won&#x27;t change one&#x27;s &quot;natural&quot; hearing, but for those that have had missing or damaged hairs for a long time, there&#x27;ll definitely be an adjustment period where the brain has to re-learn how to interpret the new input.  (About 2 weeks or so)')
