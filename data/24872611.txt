Maybe it&#x27;s more historically accurate to say that they are more likely to be tasked with this work. But they do not appear to be rewarded for taking it on.\nI think low-status is a complete red herring here. Someone with the right background can spend years tinkering on a project without suffering too much status loss, because they have other reserves of capital.
