O&#x27;Neill cylinders have already been mentioned here.<p>There&#x27;s no scientific reason we are aware of that would make living in artificial habitats worse than living on a planet, and a lot of reasons that it would be better. It&#x27;s just that those of us talking now live on a planet, and find the idea of continuing to live on a planet comforting.<p>Someone born on an O&#x27;Neill cylinder or similar will likely have no such compunctions.')
