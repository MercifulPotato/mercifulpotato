Then I discovered otherwise ... but only after ingesting a certain substance forbidden to all but certain religions. Gotta speculate that many of us have the capacity but just need to get a handle on it.<p>There are many remarkable (probably widespread) mental phenomena that are completely overlooked&#x2F;unvalued (at least by most materialist cultures). Partly because they don&#x27;t have names that are ever mentioned. &#x27;Qualia&#x27;,&#x27;synesthesia&#x27; (which I had when young and sadly ... lost? before I ever knew the idea). &#x27;Audiation&#x27; ... the term&#x27;s entirely new to me ( I began playing when I was 5) and (says WP) was not even coined until 1975. What else goes nameless, unseen, unheard?<p>How many kids have such abilities that are completely-overlooked, like the kid some writer (was it Huxley)? saw scratching an advanced math proof in the sand? How was it that Mozart could &#x27;write entire works in his head&#x27;? Probably because as a prodigy he was taught the value of such skills. We can only speculate about all the horsepower going to waste - while young minds are stuffed with sugar and advertisements.')
