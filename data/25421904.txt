Item(by='feralimal', descendants=None, kids=[25424372, 25424642], score=None, time=1607973620, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25420192, text='I would like to hear too.  But I think I know.<p>Most people when they hear an opinion that they dislike (possibly because its challenging or worse, true) would rather that opinion disappeared.  I think I am downvoted and flagged because I am prepared to voice my personal opinion that has a basis that I am prepared to defend.  I am even prepared to change my opinion if I&#x27;m corrected!  (Shock horror!!)<p>Most people do not want to engage with that - they would rather say that I am undertaking hate speech.  So they would actually rather take a minor act of hate against me (even though I have not taken an act against them) - to quash or silence my opinion - than consider an alternative.  Consensus is everything, even in a discussion about philosophy!  Its sad, but it does tell you much about the world we live in.  That people are highly educated to think according to what their authorities tell them - they do not&#x2F;cannot discern things for themselves.<p>It used to be a popular thing to say &#x27;I don&#x27;t agree with you, but I will fight for your right to say what you like&#x27;.   Those days are long gone.  Now, its I don&#x27;t like what you&#x27;re saying, you&#x27;re challenging me and as that causes me psychological harm you are inflict hate speech on me.  And that I feel threatened, rightly or not, means I am empowered to try to hurt they person I perceive to be threatening me..<p>Worst to me, is that HN facilitates teeny, tiny acts of violence against me.  I can only post a reply once every hour or so at the moment because of downvotes and being flagged.  Perhaps that surprises you?  Sure, youtube, hn, facebook, etc are private platforms and they can do what they like, but where exactly is the free speech?  The effect of the measures these platforms take, is that some thoughts are not allowed - to most, I am committing thoughtcrime and deserve to not have a voice.  Its amazing.<p>TLDR - people are a bunch of babies and can&#x27;t co-exist with opinions that differ to their own.  They feel threatened because their worldview is a stack of cards - a small gust or comment could bring it all crashing down.<p>PS - this is a great video from Larken Rose that touches on some of the points I raised, from a different angle:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=JoPRLeXEzE0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=JoPRLeXEzE0</a>')
