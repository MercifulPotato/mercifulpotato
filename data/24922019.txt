I get that they&#x27;re mad because they think big tech is out to get them. And I don&#x27;t even expect a policy proposal or bill at this stage. But is there even a paper from a think tank, or a right-wing law professor, who has put forward a coherent framework for how to regulate social media?<p>My understand is that if you repeal section 230, social media sites would either have to be completely unmoderated (like 4chan) or really heavily moderated (as they&#x27;d be liable for everything people post). Is that their goal here? Or if they want to replace 230, what would they replace it with?')
