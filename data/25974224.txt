There are systems already (like Wayland) where default access to input only gives you input when the app is active, and entire different process is required for global hotkeys or key logging.<p>There are no nice GUIs to manage that AFAIK, but this is not an impossible problem to solve anymore.<p>&gt; The same of course applies to giving it access to the file system.<p>uh, what? no.\ngiving a browser access only to &quot;~&#x2F;Downloads&quot; will work great and will make it much more secure.<p>The modern Linux is much more than capabilities and user-based permissions. A mount namespace with selectively bind-mounted dirs can do wonders for security. And things like &quot;bindfs&quot; which can translate UIDs on the fly can give even more isolation.')
