I have never seen a dog wearing eye protection in the UK ever. Yet the reasons for eye protection make a lot of sense if you believe the marketing claims.<p>The market could be manipulated with advertising so that it is perceived to be grossly irresponsible to let your dog off the lead without eye protection. Random strangers could tut-tut as they see your dog bereft of eye protection. Think bicycle helmets all over again where everyone who doesn&#x27;t ride thinks they know best and demand to be listened to as they have the moral high ground.<p>So if you are in this climate of mandatory dog eyewear then you might as well have AR dog goggles. You could text your dog when it is food time - not that he or she wouldn&#x27;t know anyway. With geofencing you could have your dog&#x27;s goggles flash up no entry signs when they get too close to the road. Of course the goggles could be cheaper than their Oculus Rift equivalents as dogs only &#x27;need&#x27; mono.<p>I look forward to the world where all dogs are wearing cool shades.')
