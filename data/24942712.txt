Of the original.<p>For example, take the result listed in table 1 in the paper, where the\noriginal lyrics of Micheal Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Beat It&quot; are parodied by Weird Al\nYankovic (with a lower-case &quot;L&quot;) and the paper&#x27;s system (Weird AI Yankovic,\nwhich an uppercase &quot;i&quot;). Jackson is first, Weird Al is second, Weird AI is\nthird:<p><pre><code>  They told him don&#x27;t you ever\n  come around her\n  Don&#x27;t want to see your face, you\n  better disappear\n  The fire&#x27;s in their eyes and their\n  words are really clear\n  So beat it, just beat it\n\n  How come  you&#x27;re always such a\n  fussy young man?\n  Don&#x27;t want no Captain Crunch,\n  don&#x27;t want no Raisin Bran\n  Well, don&#x27;t you know that other\n  kids are starving in Japan?\n  So eat it, just eat it\n\n  The best part is that each taco\n  contains a small\n  To medium sized piece of sliced\n  chicken nepal\n  I don&#x27;t think the food in question\n  lasted awhile\n  I promise, just promise\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ll spare the HN readership an erudite analysis of why Weird Al&#x27;s parody is a\nparody- basically, it&#x27;s funny and it makes one laugh. The Weird AI&#x27;s &quot;parody&quot;\nis just a bunch of text that rhymes and sounds nonsensical, but it&#x27;s missing\nthe point of coming up with nonsensical rhymes; namely, to make you laugh. Or\nin other words not all nonsensical rhymes are funny and you can&#x27;t call\nsomething a &quot;parody&quot; just because it&#x27;s nonsensical and it rhymes.<p>But maybe this is a bit of a joke and I missunderstand it? I have been told\nthat I miss a humour module, at times, so maybe it&#x27;s my fault for\nmisunderstanding why this system is interesting? &quot;It generates nonsensical\nlanguage that rhymes, surely that&#x27;s an achievement&quot;, that sort of thing.<p>Oh, apparently the author contemplates a fart mode, following user\nsuggestions. Maybe I really am misunderstanding this.<p>Maybe all of arxiv is really a big joke and I&#x27;m just not in on it.')
