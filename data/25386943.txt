The « scientific evidence » we’re governed with is frequently grossly manipulated, and yet it routinely passes peer review, journal publication and makes its way on TV channels and then into law to « curb this unprecedented situation that disenfranchises [place this politician’s favorite group here] ».<p>Politicians have very well understood that <i>modern</i> civilization is governed by scientific beliefs rather than religious beliefs, and masquerading science for political gain will give you power for a very efficient cost.<p>The problem is not Facebook, but that our science is as vulnerable to 51% attacks as Bitcoin.')
