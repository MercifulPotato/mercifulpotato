Python is everything matlab the language could hope to be and more, if you just want to crunch matrices python beats matlab as it&#x27;s own game (just the broadcasting features in numpy alone are an amazing step up from matlab&#x27;s approach, let alone trying to ingest data which isn&#x27;t a csv). But, some of those toolboxes are pretty damn good and don&#x27;t have an equivilent in python. For example, if you&#x27;re doing almost anything with control theory then there&#x27;s some pretty killer toolboxes that don&#x27;t have any real competition, especially in the open-source space (there&#x27;s some basic stuff but it&#x27;s not particularly usable).')
