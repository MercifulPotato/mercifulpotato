If it is a &quot;bad&quot; year, and the crops fail, you don&#x27;t get money and might not be able to afford to keep going next year.  If it is a &quot;good&quot; year <i>and</i> a &quot;good&quot; year for everyone else, it becomes a &quot;bad&quot; year again -- overproduction means that your prices drop and you might not be able to afford to keep going next year.<p>But while both situations are equally bad for the farmer, it&#x27;s <i>really</i> bad for civilization if you don&#x27;t produce enough food -- in fact, you want to ensure that even in multi-sigma off-years, with flooding everywhere that floods and drought everywhere else, you <i>still</i> produce enough food to feed everyone.<p>That means that you have to build in a <i>lot</i> of overproduction -- <i>every</i> year should be a &quot;bad&quot; year for the farmers.<p>(As an aside, you&#x27;ll never see more concealed glee than a couple of farmers in one state talking about a flood in another state that produces a similar slate of crops, knowing that&#x27;s going to bump crop prices by 20-30% while also not wanting to be happy about others&#x27; misfortune.)')
