The former do not get demonetized and lead to innocent content being demonetized accidentally. The addictive nature of Facebook and Youtube are partially to blame, but even if that ended, that would only slow down the culture war, which suggests that the root cause is elsewhere. They&#x27;re making lemonade out of lemons, which may incentivize more lemons, but it&#x27;s not the source.<p>I agree with you about Twitter as their stock had been stagnant until Trump&#x27;s election and people started equating tweets as news.')
