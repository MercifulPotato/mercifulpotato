I do statistics in a software program designed basically to do all that stuff for you by clicking stuff.”<p>Yeah, that&#x27;s the data scientist to hire: someone who &quot;clicks stuff.&quot;<p>Additional quote from article:<p>&quot;In an affidavit signed by FDLE investigator Noel Pratt on Dec. 3, he concluded the email message was sent to approximately 1,750 accounts before it was discovered. Pratt said in the affidavit that he tracked down the IP address of the computer associated with the email and it directed him to Jones’ home address, which he said was probable cause to conduct a search of her property and seize her computers.&quot;<p>This person is not trustworthy, or qualified as a source.  None of her colleagues have corroborated her claims.  She was put on a pedestal by a media that desperately wants to attack any governor, especially a Trump ally, who wanted to open their state back up rather than go the lockdown model.  It&#x27;s that simple.  I&#x27;m not a DeSantis fan at all, but if an anti-vaxxer was crusading against him, I wouldn&#x27;t give them a platform just to get to him.  I&#x27;d think about the implications of putting an alarmist with no scientific credentials to speak of on a platform as a weapon against him.  She&#x27;s a GIS specialist with no coding skills.  How exactly does that make her qualified to talk about infectious disease data publicly, and to unilaterally change the dashboard she was tasked with maintaining without consulting her boss and&#x2F;or team? (that&#x27;s why they fired her)<p>We can talk all day about the appropriate police response to this kind of crime, but she&#x27;s not credible as an expert.  She&#x27;s a click jocky who is skilled with Tableau, Qlik, and ESRI.  And she&#x27;s engaged in a deceptive charade of labelling herself a whistleblower, down to the tweets leaving out key information.')
