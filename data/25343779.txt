When you request an Uber ride, your request is advertised to drivers in the area, who can choose to accept it. There is no routing happening.<p>Sure, the driver then drives a route given to them to by the app, but so does everybody else, just in that case, the app is Google Maps.<p>AFAIK, the only routing cleverness is that the end of a shift, drivers can request to only take passengers who are heading in the direction of their own home. That&#x27;s useful.')
