From the perspective of language learning I think it&#x27;s extremely helpful to be able to intuit from the phonetic component that they will sound similar. I would also say that the tonal pronunciation differences are not that significant as the main distinguisher in Mandarin is the usage of compound words (2+ hanzi). Consider the fact that in China there are very few people who speak in the &quot;proper&quot; correct CCTV way. Most people will have large tonal variations from dialect etc. Compound words are the key to intelligibility.')
