He then says that most learners balk at being told they are made in the image of &quot;homo economicus&quot; (our Lord and Saviour). He is cruel! He is nothing like me, or my family!<p>If learners can&#x27;t accept the orthodoxy, if it causes them cognitive dissonance, then where does the problem lie? Is it within the student -- unable to grasp the fundamental Truth revealed in the gospel of &quot;Good Old School Chicago Economics&quot;? Or are they (unconsciously?) rebelling against indoctrination into a death-cult which is worshipping the antisocial, careening towards an apocalypse, and telling them &quot;There Is No Other Way&quot;.<p>I dunno, it&#x27;s probably because undergrads are dumb.')
