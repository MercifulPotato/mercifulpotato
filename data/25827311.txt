Item(by='NationalPark', descendants=None, kids=[25827415, 25827916], score=None, time=1611008026, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25823475, text='Sigh. I am <i>unbelievably</i> tired of people setting this up as &quot;pro free speech&quot; vs &quot;anti free speech&quot;. It&#x27;s inflammatory (who proudly calls themselves &quot;anti-free speech&quot;? It&#x27;s bad faith just to say that. Anyway.) and it&#x27;s misleading.<p>Most critically, almost everyone fundamentally agrees that censorship is a good thing, in principle. Even the most extreme &quot;free speech&quot; oriented websites remove spam, illegal pornography, and deliberate impersonation. Therefore, we both agree with the proposition that sometimes website operators <i>should</i> exercise their discretion and remove content. We are now discussing what should be in the set of things it is acceptable to remove and what is not. But we are not having a disagreement about the concept of censorship.<p>Another thing to think about: Is a website operator that uses their discretion to remove content not, by that action, exercising <i>their</i> free speech? Would you have the government require website operators to host content they don&#x27;t want to host? Because that is definitely a First Amendment violation.')
