Advertising is a cancer on society, by itself its purpose is to waste some person&#x27;s time by showing them something they haven&#x27;t asked for, sometimes in hope to drive a purchase. We&#x27;ve basically normalized intentionally wasting people&#x27;s time (in aggregate this time can be expressed in human lifetimes) for the benefit of a select few (the advertisers). Advertising also has secondary negative effects where it perverts the incentives between service providers and their users (social networks&#x27; objective is to make you look at ads, <i>not</i> facilitate communication with your friends&#x2F;family), sometimes up to the point where said service providers promote harmful content to drive ad views (&quot;engagement&quot; as they call it) where said content then leads to mental health issues, broken relationships and crime (like the radicalization of the right-leaning Trump supporters that ended up storming the Capitol).')
