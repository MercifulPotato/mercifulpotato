If you think Parler should have the right to allow their users to continue to threaten violence to people, well, that&#x27;s still not a slippery slope, because there is no precedent being set here other than &quot;Amazon will not allow unmoderated calls for violence on their platform.&quot;<p>Amazon always will, and always has, had the ability to terminate users for just about any reason. This is not them doing that, since they&#x27;ve provided a clear solution for Parler which is &quot;stop allowing your users to make violent threats&quot;, and they&#x27;ve provided apparently an abundance of examples. Examples which Parler has not taken action against.')
