Someone had to supervise him (there are two crew members in the cockpit for a reason), someone gave him a medical, there is automation in the cockpit that could have at least caused an alarm, etc.<p>So even when the accident is ultimately caused by a pilot&#x27;s actions, there is always a chain of events where if any of the segments were broken the accident wouldn&#x27;t have happened.<p>While we can&#x27;t prevent a bonkers pilot from crashing a plane, we could perhaps prevent a bonkers crew member from flying the plane in the first place.<p>Aka the Swiss cheese model. You don&#x27;t want to let the holes to align.<p>This approach is widely used in accident investigations and not only in aviation. Most industrial accidents are investigated like this, trying to understand the entire chain of events in order that processes could be improved and the problem prevented in the future.<p>Oh and there is one more key part in aviation that isn&#x27;t elsewhere. The goal of an accident or incident investigation IS NOT TO APPORTION BLAME. It is to learn from it. That&#x27;s why pilots in airlines with a healthy safety culture are encouraged to report problems, unsafe practices, etc. and this is used to fix the process instead of firing people. Once you start to play the blame game, people won&#x27;t report problems - and you are flying blind into a disaster sooner or later.')
