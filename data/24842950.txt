Item(by='jtolmar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603232787, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24842857, text='Shoutouts to whoever named themselves &quot;&lt;b&gt;corn&lt;&#x2F;b&gt;&quot;, that&#x27;s a much kinder way than usual to probe at whether I have HTML injection vulnerabilities.<p>edit: Un-shoutouts to whoever named themselves a racial slur.
