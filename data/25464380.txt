I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever worked at an organization that hasn&#x27;t been hacked. And all but one were hacked multiple times, though I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s because I just wasn&#x27;t privy to the other incidents (the company may not have been, either). For criminal organizations it&#x27;s just a numbers game--penetrate as many organizations as you can and then look for monetization opportunities. For many nation-states the calculus probably looks much the same, and in any event the techniques are similar.')
