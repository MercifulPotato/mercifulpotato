Item(by='gnramires', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610416519, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25738829, text='Indeed, and the Schrodinger equation is well behind Quantum Field Theory (the most modern quantum theory).<p>In QFT, particles can be interpreted to not exist, only fields -- particles are just a fuzzy (imperfect) abstraction of &quot;field excitations&quot;. Particles may exist in the path-integral formulation of QM however. But it known among physicists that particles or fields don&#x27;t define what is real -- what it matters is that the models predict observations. It is irrelevant which model is &#x27;true&#x27; -- if they give equivalent results, both can be said to be [indistinguishably] correct (in their relevant domain). The examples go back a long way too, e.g. with the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations of classical mechanics (wildly different but compatible mathematical formulations) -- so the &#x27;model paradigm&#x27; has been known to physicists for a while.<p>I think in physics &#x27;truth&#x27; is understood to be a (possibly non-unique) model that in principle would provide an exact prediction under ideal conditions, for a limited experiment. In our reality the ideal conditions are never going to be met. For example, we cannot ensure that a system has every atom in a certain position before performing an experiment (in fact the known quantum principles of physics themselves would contradict this); we might in theory know of a generalized state of a system (quantum superposition), but even then there are too many other assumptions (about experimental devices, about the individuals reading the experiments, about science as a whole) that go into the experimental paradigm.<p>I still find truth (as given) a useful concept, as a metaphysical principle that reality exists and has some working real mechanism (defined as being mathematically describable) -- we may never we able to write it down or discover it entirely, but it exists. Try to imagine an universe that is indescribable in principle (yields contradiction). There must be a rule.<p>It also sets the standard for our models.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chem.tufts.edu&#x2F;answersinscience&#x2F;relativityofwrong.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chem.tufts.edu&#x2F;answersinscience&#x2F;relativityofwrong.ht...</a>')
