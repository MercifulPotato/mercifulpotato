There are people in the world approaching adulthood who likely never experienced what it was like to take a picture and wait hours or days to find out if it turned out.  There is something unique about film that goes beyond the image itself.  It is an entire experience from taking a photo to waiting to get the photo processed and printed.  The experience is what makes the image special.<p>One thing I really dislike about digital is the churn of the technology.  Every year new sensors are released and the old ones become obsolete and eventually useless.  I have film cameras older than me and some even older than my parents that are still capable of creating great images.  Digital cameras are not likely to enjoy a second life like this.  I appreciate digital photography for its utility but for me film will always be &quot;real&quot; photography and it will always be better.')
