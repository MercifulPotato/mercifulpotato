Item(by='outsomnia', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606995427, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25283848, text='&quot;PINE 64 is not a business&quot; is a bit of a red flag for me... it has a store, takes money and ships product, it&#x27;s a business.  It&#x27;s on the hook for various things including 1yr mandatory warranty in the EU.<p>This two price idea is a mess... just price the things how they have to be priced to be sustainable and allowing for some reseller percentage if that&#x27;s the plan.<p>The support thing can eventually be eased by picking the most evolved distro, supporting that and shipping the phones with it, and making it clear the others are unsupported.<p>Pine model is certainly effective, but it&#x27;s not the same results ecosystem-wise as Librem 5 premium cost paying for long term contribution to upstream projects and development (which Pine inherit).  There should be room for both hopefully.')
