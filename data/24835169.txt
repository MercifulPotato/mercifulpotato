For those old enough to remember, picture the computer interfaces of yesteryear - say, the 80s - and ask the people who had to work with them back then how many of them enjoyed the experience. And I&#x27;m not talking about computer scientists and the likes, I mean your average office worker.<p>Fast forward to 2020, and you cannot throw a rock with closed eyes without hitting some kind of &quot;computer&quot;. Smartphones, tablets, laptops, everywhere. There is not just one factor that made this change come about but a lot: arguably, computers are generally more useful today than they were back in the day, and this is part capability and part usability.<p>Both seem to still lack quite a bit in today&#x27;s chatbots. I think a big hurdle has already been taken, though, by turning to voice rather than typing as the primary input modality. This wasn&#x27;t possible just a decade ago because automatic speech recognition just didn&#x27;t work well enough. But there&#x27;s still lots to be desired today.<p>Using a conversational UI where a simple button or a few clicks would suffice is utterly useless. As is, say, having your bot read out to you a long list of movies when you ask &quot;what&#x27;s showing in the theater tonight&quot;? Traditional GUIs are much superior here.<p>No, voice based interactions shine when they are about complex matters. Stuff that is too difficult or too cumbersome to express with other means. Perhaps because there a lot of different options combined in your query. Or because some inference is required on the chatbot side. Or because it&#x27;s not a single query at all but -- shock! -- an actual <i>dialog</i> that will get you to your goal.<p>A small and completely made-up example:<p><pre><code>    User: I&#x27;m meeting Dana for dinner at 7, and perhaps we&#x27;d like to go and see a movie afterwards. What&#x27;s on tonight?\n    System: Where are you having dinner?\n    User: In the West End.\n    System: Super Marvels is playing in the Broadway at 9.\n    User: Oh, no, Dana hates super hero movies.\n    System: I see. What does she like?\n    User: I don&#x27;t know - comedies, I guess. Thrillers, maybe.\n    System: Well, the Broadway is also showing Dark Waters at 9.\n</code></pre>\nSo, this is obviously your standard ticket purchasing scenario, and you can do this perfectly fine today using any standard form-based app or website. But the point is that you don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of setting all the right parameters, such as time, location, genre etc. by hand -- especially when you&#x27;re not really sure about some of them.<p>Compared to a dialog like the above, today&#x27;s conversational UI&#x27;s are very simplistic. We&#x27;re still with at least one leg in the stone ages. But there is real potential here but there&#x27;s also a real risk that we&#x27;ll never get there because once conversational UIs get a bad rep, then it&#x27;s over.<p>Like with any technology, if it is over-hyped with respect to what it can actually deliver (currently), it won&#x27;t last. I think that is what the author of the above article has experiences. High expectations, low delivery.<p>I, for one, hope that we can hold on and that conversational UI&#x27;s won&#x27;t go the way of 3D TV (goodbye...) or VR (niche), but at this point, I wouldn&#x27;t know which way to put my money on.')
