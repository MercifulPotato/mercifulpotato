Their machines are still far more expensive than Windows and can&#x27;t use high-powered GPUs like AMD&#x2F;Nvidia. The people who choose PC, still have the same incentives to do so. For most users, the faster performance will probably not be very noticeable. The reduced power consumption is the biggest draw in my eyes.')
