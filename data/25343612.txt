It&#x27;s actually about one &quot;universal vaccine <i>candidate</i>.&quot; In the media, that shouldn&#x27;t be called a &quot;vaccine&quot; in this phase of development. The authors of the paper used: &quot;vaccine approach&quot; in their title which is also not misleading. That title is also more informative (but also longer):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41591-020-1118-7" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41591-020-1118-7</a><p>&quot;A chimeric hemagglutinin-based universal influenza virus vaccine approach induces broad and long-lasting immunity in a randomized, placebo-controlled phase I trial&quot;<p>Even that seems quite readable, as today there&#x27;s much more awareness what &quot;randomized, placebo-controlled&quot; means and also what the phases of the vaccine development are and what &quot;broad and long-lasting immunity&quot; means.<p>The title I&#x27;d suggest would be: use &quot;vaccine approach&quot; or &quot;vaccine candidate&quot; and just use &quot;passes first clinical test&quot; instead of: &quot;shows promise in&quot; it. And it seems the candidate passed it, from the abstract: &quot;Vaccination was found to be safe and induced a broad, strong, durable and functional immune response&quot;')
