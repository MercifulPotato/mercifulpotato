How is this better? They&#x27;re losing everything they own, their house, and getting $600 from the government? Many would take a chance of corona over that.<p>&gt; What about all the nurses who die in the line of duty treating all these new infections? Should they be allowed to opt-out of infection risk?<p>Nurses (along with all healthcare personnel) should always receive priviledged treatment. One nurse dying is not a person dying, it is <i>many</i> people dying.<p>&gt; but so long as there is community spread the lockdown can never end, and the virus would never go away.<p>Vaccines will hopefully change that.<p>.. all good points though, and I thought of them too as I was writing out my thoughts. I&#x27;m not fully satisfied with these answers, but I do not believe the direction we&#x27;re headed in right now is much better.')
