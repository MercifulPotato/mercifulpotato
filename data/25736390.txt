But it&#x27;s not just UUIDs, it&#x27;s also required for seeding systemd&#x27;s internal hash tables, which would degrade from O(1) lookups to O(n) should an attacker exploit known RNG flaws.<p>So, a PRNG with a semi-decent (not perfect) entropy pool is required at boot time, and systemd needs to run in environments where seeding that pool in software could take on the order of minutes. This is why RDRAND is used to seed the pool during boot.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;systemd&#x2F;systemd&#x2F;blob&#x2F;61bd7d1ed595a98e5fbfeb75b530539c4834f6a4&#x2F;src&#x2F;basic&#x2F;random-util.c#L40-L98" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;systemd&#x2F;systemd&#x2F;blob&#x2F;61bd7d1ed595a98e5fbf...</a>')
