Or impose economic sanctions, freeze assets and so on? Sorry, I&#x27;m just spitballing here. Have I fallen prey to &quot;it&#x27;s easy, just do X&quot;?<p>I agree this would still require a fair amount of coordination between the countries that do the tariffs. But less so than deciding tariffs on individual products based on their pollution.')
