You don&#x27; need to have employees creating accounts on forums asking for &quot;feedback&quot; or &quot;describe for me the steps needed to re-create the issue&quot;. You already know the issues with a list of work arounds. FIX THEM!!! This &quot;hey look at us asking the users&quot; is just a sham as they are not even fixing the most basic of things. Why would I believe they are going to fix some thing that needs help re-creating before being noticed by their devs?')
