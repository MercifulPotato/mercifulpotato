Facebook is a Silicon Valley company with a young staff that leans significantly to the left.<p>As a right-leaning individual this makes me uncomfortable because I know that staff aren&#x27;t going to separate their politics from decision making surrounding vetting&#x2F;choosing who gets to do the vetting. Here&#x27;s a concrete example: Facebook staff, being left-leaning,  do not view the &quot;fine people hoax&quot; as misinformation  - their echo chamber wouldn&#x27;t even bring it to their attention as something that could be misinformation, even though it is.<p>The only solution would be for a politically balanced workforce to be making these decisions, ideally a satellite office in a purple state&#x2F;city with quotas for political leaning, set up only for the purposes of vetting. If we lived in a less polarized society, this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue.<p>Would you feel comfortable if oil and gas workers who lean 80-90 percent Republican are &quot;vetting&quot; the information you&#x27;re seeing (or are choosing who gets to do the vetting)?<p>As Naval says, you have a good system if you can hand the keys over to your opposition and things don&#x27;t go wrong.')
