There is a different version of history where Macromedia&#x27;s two biggest products, Flash and Dreamweaver took a different route, and neither died an ignominious death. Flash <i>could</i> have become an open web standard, driven by a programming language that isn&#x27;t javascript, which we&#x27;re all now forced to use due to browser support. Instead of using CSS for layout, we could be using something else. The cross-platform smartphone app ecosystem would look a whole lot different if iOS and Android both had built in Flash interpreters.<p>Does this all sound like a fantasy? It should, because it is. Absent the history of it actually happening and being able to point at that, the question is akin to comparing two sports teams across history, eg the 2014 Golden State Warriors to the 2002 Mavericks and trying to talk through which team would win.<p>Could an independent Macromedia have been better stewards of Flash than Adobe, leading to a world today where Flash wasn&#x27;t deprecated? Absolutely. Would it have? We&#x27;ll never know. Flash had a number of issues that lead to its death today, and it&#x27;s not clear if an independent Macromedia, with a different internal developer and business culture from Adobe, could have fixed all of them resulting in a different future, or if they even needed to be fixed for that future to happen.<p>Looking at Adobe&#x27;s poor stewardship of PDFs, however, it&#x27;s hard to see positives to Adobe-owned Macromedia and Flash.')
