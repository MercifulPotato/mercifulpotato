You could choose between a barely running Windows XP or a well running Linux back then. People mostly bought the Windows version because that&#x27;s what they knew and where the illegal copy of software X from their neighbour ran.<p>A similar thing happened with the city of Munich trying to convert their systems to Linux. The workers complained that OpenOffice&#x2F;LibreOffice didn&#x27;t work like their (most probably illegal) copies of Word and Excel at home and thus they couldn&#x27;t work with it. When that didn&#x27;t help, they complained about &quot;missing software&quot; and other strange reasons about why they absolutely couldn&#x27;t work with Linux. So they rolled back to Windows and Office and started sending our tax money to Microsoft again. [1] (Also Microsoft promised to move their German HQ to Munich to bring wealth into town. But that&#x27;s toooootally unrelated.)<p>At least, they&#x27;re trying again...
