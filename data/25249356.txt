Item(by='dan-robertson', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606694753, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25248305, text='From reading the blog posts&#x2F;source code, I can explain how it works.<p>Here’s a simple way to give a set of changes (a state) an id:<p>1. Take the hashes of each change<p>2. XOR them together<p>3. This is your state ID.<p>The problem is that because of the way you’ve made it (basically adding a bunch of vectors in a vector space over F2), one could use Gaussian elimination to construct any given ID without it being of the intended set of changes. Therefore pijul uses a process which works similarly but in a more cryptographically secure way which makes forging state IDs harder.')
