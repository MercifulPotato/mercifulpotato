The HN guidelines are all about <i>not</i> responding in kind. Why? Because it always feels like the other person started it and&#x2F;or did worse. Rightly or wrongly, everyone feels this wayâ€”so if we&#x27;re all going to respond &quot;in kind&quot;, that&#x27;s a recipe for a downward spiral and eventually for scorched earth. The reason we don&#x27;t want that is that it&#x27;s not an interesting outcome for anybody.<p>This means that, regardless of our views, we all have to work on learning to keep a certain standard even when the other side isn&#x27;t keeping it. We don&#x27;t do that because the other side necessarily deserves that from us. We do it for ourselves, and to help take care of the community we all belong to.')
