Item(by='alblue', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611428832, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25881704, text='I was involved using Java right from the very start, in 1995 while it was still available as a beta.<p>I remember being distinctly annoyed that the Java 1.1 broke the model introduced in Java 1.0, in which a JVM which had no Windows showing or Threads running would terminate automatically. When Java 1.1 was created, the event dispatcher thread was created (incorrectly, in my opinion) as a non-daemon thread, which meant as soon as you loaded the toolkit the JVM would never close until you hit System.exit. Here&#x27;s the bug I proposed a fix with in November 1998:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.java.com&#x2F;bugdatabase&#x2F;view_bug.do?bug_id=4030718" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugs.java.com&#x2F;bugdatabase&#x2F;view_bug.do?bug_id=4030718</a><p>The shutdown hook never got fixed; these days there&#x27;s convenience methods to add a shutdown hook to the (J)Frame so that on close it would call System.exit for you.<p>I&#x27;ve written a bit more about my history here if you&#x27;re interested:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alblue.bandlem.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;java-1.0-turns-25.0.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;alblue.bandlem.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;java-1.0-turns-25.0.html</a>')
