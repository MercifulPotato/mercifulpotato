Because this attitude is how you get f2p with mtx bullshit.<p>Software has a marginal cost of zero. In a supply and demand world we add arbitrary restrictions (copyright) to constrain supply to incentivize the creation of new supply.<p>Be careful what you wish for. You just might get it.<p>Also, GameStop would sell a used disc for $55 while a new disc was $60. Because they get 100% of $55.  Then their associates HEAVILY pushed used on gamers who don’t give a shit and just want to save 5 bucks.<p>Sony has been making big story heavy games. There’s nothing wrong with a $60 narrative experience that lasts 20 to 30 hours. The Last of Us 2 is exactly that. Some gamers will buy that game on Tuesday and finish by Friday. Should GameStop sell that disc for $55 and collect all the proceeds when the game hasn’t been out for a week? Avoiding the used sale is why devs tack-on all kinds of bullshit the game doesn’t really need.<p>Fuck GameStop. Garbage company that has caused more harm to gamers than people will ever know.')
