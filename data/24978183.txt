Luckily they are good eating and not too clever so you can flush them out and shoot them cleanly and you can honor them by eating them. As sad as the hunters would be there could be a more humane way of culling large introduced bird species like this... the way swans are culled is absurdly dangerous and inhumane imo, for instance.')
