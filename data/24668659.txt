Closing rings is like crack.<p>I second that. I have had my Series 4 for 514 days. I currently have a 514 day Move streak and 72 perfect weeks (All Activity).<p>My one major complaint would be exercise minutes during outdoor walks. I will sometimes do, say, a 40 minute walk and only get 32 minutes of exercise credit. It will be giving me one minute per minute of walking for say 25 minutes, then go 8 minutes with no credit, then give me one for one for the remaining 7 minutes of the walk.<p>I&#x27;m frequently checking heart rate and pace during all this, and the 8 minutes of no credit portion matches the rest of the walk on both of those. Checking the map of the walk afterwards, where it color codes sections where your pace was above or below average shows no slowdowns during where it drops minutes. Checking the detailed heart rate data afterwards in case there were slowdowns that I just didn&#x27;t notice during the walk shows that there were none.<p>I wish they would add an &quot;explain exercise minutes&quot; option that would look at a workout and tell you why you didn&#x27;t get credit for some minutes.')
