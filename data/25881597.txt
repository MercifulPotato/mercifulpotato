Other comments here are underestimating the power of a group. An average bounty on an issue might just be between $10-$100 but there can easily be 50 people putting up a bounty for a popular issue (have you seen issues with hundreads of upvotes and are still open for years). If we start seeing (collective) bounty on an issue in the range of a few thousand $$ then it&#x27;s decent money for maintainers or anyone else who&#x27;s motivated enough.<p>My guess is this is eventually going to be built into GitHub (via acquisition or otherwise).')
