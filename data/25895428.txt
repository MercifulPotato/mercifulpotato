But it seems to me that you are using (and paying for) N units from your regular provider. And then your community solar operation is selling S units to the grid and giving you a monetary credit (the result of the sale) instead. Some customer (due to fungibility, it could be you or anyone else) is getting those S units, and paying the community solar project (indirectly via the grid). And those S units are displacing some other set of S units that were previously generated by fossil fuels, which is (presumably) one of the main goals of this entire exercise. So maybe the answer to your final question is actually &quot;only N units were actually generated, because the fossil fuel plants ran less and produced S fewer units&quot;.')
