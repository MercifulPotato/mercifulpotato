They are used to deal with calculations that involve magnitudes and phases, such as modeling qubitâ€™s internal state.<p>-- The fact that an n-qubit quantum computing system is significantly powerful than classical system (...)?<p>Due to the physical phenomenon of entanglement quantum computers allow a coherent superposition of multiple states. Quantum algorithms sort of operate on all superposed states at the same time. Classical computing can only handle one state at a time.<p>A while ago I wrote a blog post explaining how quantum computing works, from a programming perspective, in case you&#x27;re interested:<p>- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thomasvilhena.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;quantum-computing-for-programmers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thomasvilhena.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;quantum-computing-for-prog...</a>')
