Before uninstalling, I went through the settings and actually &quot;deleted&quot; my account, but after letting one of my few WhatsApp contacts know I had done so, he mentioned I still show up in chats.  So let people know if you&#x27;re leaving, because it seems WhatsApp won&#x27;t prevent them from messaging someone who doesn&#x27;t exist.')
