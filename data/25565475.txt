Maintenance of software is about 2&#x2F;3 of programming costs. It&#x27;s counter-intuitive, but has proven true over time. Tools that make it easy to create the original application often make maintenance worse. They only help 1&#x2F;3 of the total cost pie, pumping up the other 2&#x2F;3.<p>Learning how to write maintainable code is actually harder than learning to code. You pretty much have to be burned by maintenance trial and error on your code AND others&#x27; code to learn this skill. There are plenty of books that teach &quot;principles&quot; of maintainable designs, but the principles often conflict with each other such that it&#x27;s a balancing act between competing factors such that a simple list of rules fails.<p>I can give lots of anecdotes of people getting carried away with specific &quot;principles&quot;. The necessary principles are a piano keyboard, but they play only a few favorite notes, making even cats cry. Knowing when and how to use which note is still an art.')
