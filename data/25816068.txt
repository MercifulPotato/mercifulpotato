To me, there’s very little point to life besides buying things. It passes the time and sometimes makes me happy-ish.<p>I mean why else do I work and make money? Ultimately my answer is to spend it on things. I hate traveling so the idea of buying “experiences” has never appealed to me.<p>Environmental benefits don’t matter to me either. I have never driven a car, don’t fly, eat a plant-based diet, live in a tiny apartment, and will never have kids. My impact is low enough as it is.')
