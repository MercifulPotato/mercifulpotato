You&#x27;ve gone from 7 hours of free time a day to 1, and you sure as hell aren&#x27;t going to spend it learning about the latest iteration of Angular&#x2F;React&#x2F;Vue&#x2F;Svelte&#x2F;whatever the fuck is next. So you start losing your technical edge. Meanwhile at work you have some dipshit in sprint planning that wants to have the 57th discussion about how story points do not represent time. Oh, by the way, it&#x27;s December, so we need you to watch that 45 minute security training video again so you don&#x27;t accept USB flash drives from strangers in the parking lot. Now it&#x27;s 4 PM and you didn&#x27;t get anything done today and you start thinking about how pointless all this shit is because all we do is make an app that helps people schedule dog massages...<p>So, yeah, there&#x27;s a reason mid-life crises are so cliche. It&#x27;s like teenage angst. It&#x27;s not completely justified, but it&#x27;s not exactly unwarranted either. I mean, what kind of dumbass doesn&#x27;t wonder at least a little bit if all this bullshit is worth it?')
