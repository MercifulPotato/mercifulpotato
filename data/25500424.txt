It&#x27;s just that most of the phones or laptops of tons of manufacturers have cheap plastic body. But there are also plenty of less cheap but really nice products from other brands, and there are plenty of consumer electronics devices that have nice mechanical build quality. You can even easily found really cheap objects, compared to premium phones or laptops, with a nice build quality. You don&#x27;t see that often for computers and phones because low cost models are low margin and the market for a nice mechanical design but otherwise low end specs is too small.<p>Instruct an engineer to design something that is not crap and they will do it, and it will be mass produced with tight tolerance if specified like that. On the manufacturing side... Apple does not manufacture anyway.<p>And that brings me to: a car is not exactly the same thing as your small household appliance. Like we saw with Tesla, it is not trivial to do with a good build quality, both on the design front and on the build front (way more difficult than small and mostly static objects) -- and it is harder to reject a car with a not stellar build quality because that&#x27;s more expensive and a huge part of the value is in the mechanics. And quite related: for now Apple does not manufacture, if they start to do cars, will they? Otherwise who will?')
