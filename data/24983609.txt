I plan on wearing masks until I have personally been vaccinated and test positive for antibodies. But not after that.<p>Where it gets weird is when 30% of people won&#x27;t take a vaccine in the future, the vaccine is somewhere south of 70% effective, and none of the current phase 3 vaccines are seeking approval for use by children either. So what if COVID-19 sticks around for a while as a result. What if you can&#x27;t tell who has had a vaccine and who hasn&#x27;t?<p>Do you plan on wearing a mask everywhere for the next 5 years long after you&#x27;ve tested positive for antibodies? Because I don&#x27;t.')
