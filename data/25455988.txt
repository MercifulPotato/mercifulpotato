Citing that situation, the employees called for a company vice president, Megan Kacholia, to no longer be part of their reporting chain. “We have lost trust in her as a leader,” the researchers wrote, according to a copy of the later obtained by Bloomberg.<p>&gt; “Google’s short-sighted decision to fire and retaliate against a core member of the Ethical AI team makes it clear that we need swift and structural changes if this work is to continue, and if the legitimacy of the field as a whole is to persevere,” the letter reads.<p>&gt; “This research must be able to contest the company’s short-term interests and immediate revenue agendas, as well as to investigate AI that is deployed by Google’s competitors with similar ethical motives,” the researchers added.<p>As I understand it, the demands themselves are not directly ethical, but in order to do their job (dealing with ethics), they need the VP to stop blocking them in order to make money. As for Gebru receiving a higher position, my take is that, as is with most companies, being a higher-level in the hierarchy allows one to affect more change within the company (or, perhaps in this case, even just to get the job done?).<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-12-16&#x2F;google-ai-researchers-lay-out-demands-escalating-internal-fight" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-12-16&#x2F;googl...</a>')
