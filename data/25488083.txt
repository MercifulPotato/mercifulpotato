But, without hardware codec, DMA buffering and interrupts, I feel it’s a lot less useful to me as my embedded projects are already pushing their limits with hardware communication.<p>Still, while it’s not good for me, I do see utility in a bit bang format for LED, IR, simple RF, etc. This makes sense and seems well thought out.')
