The reason was mostly for bad mouthing every single engineer as well as the CEO behind their backs and sometimes even to their faces when you were in a managerial role.<p>You constantly power harassed the engineers to the point where we all decided to completely ignore you and some of us even thought about leaving the company. One time you even got into a screaming match in the middle of our open office with an engineer in front of all the other employees in the office.<p>Also you cannot call someone a “control freak”. You would monitor every engineer meticulously and complain to the CEO over any little thing anyone did. You are a complete narcissist who would only talk about himself. Things always had to be your way. You absolutely would not want to hear any “new thoughts” or “opposing perspectives”. You were so bad in fact we would call you the “dictator”.  There were so many complaints against you that CEO himself had to demote you and put someone far more experienced from our team in charge instead. However due to you being such control freak you protested with the CEO and HR and refused to even attend the meeting discussing it and started to bad mouth them on slack in the public channel.<p>During your last few weeks at the company every single employee avoided you like the plague. Having you at our company was a miserable experience and I would not wish it on any other start up. We almost threw a party when they finally kicked you out.<p>Since I hurt the narcissist, I fully expect a long reply about how you “worked” in many other countries and how you were an engineer at Nokia that one time etc. I also want to say I’m in no way defending the person you are replying to I just find the whole comment you made extremely ironic.<p>If you are an employer in Tokyo stay far away from Gergely Nagy.')
