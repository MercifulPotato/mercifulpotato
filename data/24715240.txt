(With her knowledge and full support!)<p>Edit: Actually, time fogged my memory a bit. She didn&#x27;t know I was buying it beforehand, but we knew each other well by then, and I knew she&#x27;d be on board with it, and in fact wouldn&#x27;t want me to waste money on a big retail diamond. And indeed, she loves the ring, knowing it came from eBay!')
