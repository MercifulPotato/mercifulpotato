So why aren’t marital rape laws not enacted in India?<p>Or for that matter how come there was such a furor when the court decided that all Hindu pilgrims regardless of gender could visit Sabarimala?<p>Do note - the vast majority of Indian laws have moved progressively <i>despite</i> political pressures. The divorce laws in India were regularly opposed by political parties for example - including the BJP.<p>Any progressive movement in laws have been by your vilified liberals.
