In both years, they hold up better than I would have thought, at around 50%. That would fit with, for example, commuters using the bike year-round, with the other half in summer consisting of tourism, generally increased activity, joyrides, etc.<p>As to Giffen: people are shifting public transport -&gt; car &amp; bike.
