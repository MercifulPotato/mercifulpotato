It&#x27;s gotten to the point that you can&#x27;t google a programming question without running into at least one. Some copy the questions and answers verbatim, some use machine translation to (crappily) translate them into my native language. Sometimes they even rank higher than the real StackOverflow.<p>I really wish there was a non-hacky way to ban sites from Google search results. I also feel like Google&#x27;s ranking algorithm is utterly broken since it&#x27;s amenable to this kind of exploitation.')
