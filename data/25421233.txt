It seems like incorrect optimization passes could result in bugs&#x2F;security issues that are a byproduct of the compiler rather than the language itself. I wonder how big of an issue this is for Rust (relatively probably a bigger issue than for C&#x2F;C++ where basic resource ownership bugs are more common).')
