The WHO and all western countries were claiming contrary to those studies that masks do not work and should not be worn. Then when things got more critical, EU countries did a 180 and started making masks mandatory or recommending them. Finally the WHO commissioned a meta-analysis and lo and behold in June it turned out that masks do work.<p>The Swedish public health agency&#x27;s quite lonely in the opinion it holds now. But even so, I don&#x27;t see why Sweden&#x27;s or its health agency&#x27;s opinion should count for anything in all of this. If anything I&#x27;d rather listen to what Taiwan, the KCDC or CCDC have to say, since they actually have some results to show besides empty words and opinions.')
