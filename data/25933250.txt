Item(by='jart', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611778177, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25927555, text='The -fsanitize=address flag is orthogonal to the runtime library. All -fsanitize=address does is each time the compiler uses memory at address x it generates a few extra instructions which check a bit is set at the shadow address ((x &gt;&gt; 3) + 0x7fff8000). I use a simplified runtime intended to support just that in a few hundred lines of code. Overlaps aren&#x27;t possible since no shadow address can exist outside the range 0x7fff8000 ... 0x100080000000. Even if you use the stock runtime, I&#x27;m not convinced local escalation is possible through having the ability to write foo.PID files. I don&#x27;t understand how that clobbers files like &#x2F;etc&#x2F;shadow.')
