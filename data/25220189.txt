Building a nuclear reactor just with existing tech can easily take a decade. Building a nuclear reactor that has never been built before with a completely new concept will take at least another decade to develop from a concept to a real working thing.<p>Even in the case that any of the concepts discussed as 4th generation nuclear will work at all (there&#x27;s a whole number of previous &quot;new nuclear&quot; concepts that have been tried and never went anywhere), it won&#x27;t matter in the time most crucial for climate mitigation.')
