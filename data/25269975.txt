I&#x27;ll never understand the biases of theorists. They act as if all theory isn&#x27;t deeply indebted to practical learnings. You don&#x27;t commit to a project like ITER because you believe it will turn out a cutting edge solution to a problem. You do so because you believe that whatever happens, in the end you will harvest many learnings that are widely useful.')
