It was cool and fun and my parents only let me buy a limited amount of these, not like every day a new one.<p>How do you think about toys for example? Are they the baddies? I mean, I can see how digital goods don&#x27;t have real production cost, but someone turned a song into a midi or a Nokia compatible ringtone. I actually made a few myself in the ringtone editor based on music sheets I found online, but they weren&#x27;t as good. And it&#x27;s not like these were expensive things.')
