The main work started remotely during the ebola epidemic and focused on building anything that helped getting it under control. Funding came mainly from CDC and bill and melinda gates foundation. After the epidemic was under control the Idea was to take as much of the momentum from the ebola response and channel it into a) polio eradication, b) malaria control&#x2F;outbreak insights and c) preparing for the next ebola or ebola like epidemic that would surely come. It became apparent that remote work would not work out without more hands on experience, we also wanted to train local developers to be on the project and also it was impossible to really understand the mixture of local politics and frontline situation of the endusers in hospitals&#x2F;villages and the ministry. I was asked to go to help get a health dashboard project on track and show our commitment to build a local team. It was also a matter of team dynamics as the Lead Dev there was slowly loosing his mind (after 2 years there) feeling rather isolated and overwhelmed with all the work. As the situation in north Africa was really worrying me after around 12 or so of our frontline workers were killed by boko haram, i was really happy to be asked to Liberia instead, where i could show commitment but also be free from that form of terrorism.')
