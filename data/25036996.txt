I print approximately 20 pages a month. I have been paying $1 every two months for it. Now I’ll be paying on average $3 every two months. I hate HP for doing this but this is not enough of an impetus for me to move now. I paid $30 for the  printer. I prefer inkjet because I print photos and recipes. I’ll be moving to an EPSON tank when I decide I’m done with HP. But for now it’s actually a great service for me. (It’s just my preference)')
