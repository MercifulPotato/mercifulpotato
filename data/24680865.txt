The net result is that there is a lot of work and fluff that interested readers often have to put up with that exists solely to get the paper through review and serves little other purpose.<p>&gt; The rest of the post aside, this particular bit of the &quot;rant&quot; just feels like a defense of lazy writing. An academic paper isn&#x27;t just a blog post, and it shouldn&#x27;t be.<p>If your point here is that blog posts are &quot;lazy writing&quot;, then I assure you I have read many blog posts that are much more thorough, well-researched, and worked-over than academic papers. I do agree with you that the two are separate things, but blog posts have a number of desirable qualities that academic papers have difficulty optimizing forâ€“either because they are not prioritized, or because they would actively hurt the chances of acceptance.')
