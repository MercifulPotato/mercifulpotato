I had a shitty experience at Apple, manager&#x2F;team lead treated me as a beginner despite me being in a senior engineer role and I was highly experienced from some other major companies. He thought time at Apple was the only metric. \nHe constantly questioned my code, despite it being actually much better than his, and more Apple style. Would give me no latitude to implement features independently that I could do in my sleep.<p>But I had “fuck you” money saved.
