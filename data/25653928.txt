Things like a few random messages from a prior day that are funny out of context all by themselves.<p>If I open signal on my laptop sometimes it does this ridiculous “time lapse” where it strolls through messages one at a time.<p>Sometimes all the messages just randomly wiggle on my screen. No idea why.<p>I get that security verification thing all the time. All the time.<p>Got a new phone late last year and it wouldn’t sync.<p>Sticker packs will rearrange themselves at random.<p>I could go on for ages. It is hilariously buggy.')
