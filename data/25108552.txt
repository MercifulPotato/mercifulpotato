I don&#x27;t think they were talking about an actual web host, because given context it sounded much more like they were talking about a platform that is &quot;hosting&quot; users. E.g they say ```Trying to censor all of the &quot;bad&quot; stuff is a huge can of worms and is not something huge platforms should even try to be doing.``` &lt;&lt; clearly talking about social media platforms<p>Yeah obviously a company providing server resources has &#x2F; should have nothing to do with user moderation. Same with ISPs. They couldn&#x27;t do anything if they wanted. I guess some webhosts have policies against hosting adult content but it&#x27;s probably more about avoiding legal issues (e.g with CSAI) than anything else.')
