They are not proper OS threads scheduled by the OS. Kotlin&#x27;s co-routine implementation does something very similar and will  just use a Loom thread when that becomes available.<p>It will also use executors with multiple threads if you use the right dispatcher.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I get your point about colored functions. Under the hood the compiler generates what is basically a callback structure not unlike what you get in javascript (i.e. a promise). It gains features like callback hierarchies, cancellation, etc. Loom fixes this by forcing you to wrap things with a Thread. Same kind of mental overhead.')
