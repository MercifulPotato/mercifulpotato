This would’ve caused China to invade. Damned be the consequences or cost of lives.<p>At that time, the PLA was in a poor state. China simply did not have the ability to invade Taiwan or even get air superiority. They&#x27;d have lost, badly, so long as the US kept supporting Taiwan, quite likely the US wouldn&#x27;t have had to even get involved directly. That&#x27;s a consequence the CCP can&#x27;t afford, they&#x27;d have had to get used to nukes. Of course, now the balance has changed and that&#x27;s not practical.<p>E: You&#x27;re assuming China always gets stronger over time. <i>Recently</i> that&#x27;s true, but at the time China was picking itself up from the Cultural Revolution, while the US was rearming after Vietnam. US had a far bigger advantage in 1975-1985 over China than in 1950. This scenario would have also required the PLA to make an air or amphibious assault without (at the time) sufficient airplanes or boats, while 1950 was just a land assault.')
