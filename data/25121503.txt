Getting my mind to use the english word tripped me out, and using the greek pronunciation didn&#x27;t make sense to anybody.\nSince trying to say &quot;kubernetes&quot; just trips my mind, I say kubernet (coobearnet). And use the same term  &quot;kubernet&quot; for both &quot;kubernetes&quot; and the &quot;k8s&quot; shortcut.<p>Kubernet = &quot;k for graph (eg k-anonymity, k-neighbor search), uber for awesome, net for network!&quot; It&#x27;s a very descriptive and easy to pronounce&#x2F;memorize name that frees my mind from the greek pompousness.<p>PS. k0s, I would pronounce &quot;Cause&quot; or maybe... (to make a silly bloodborne reference)  Kos, some say Kosm')
