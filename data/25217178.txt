Most EC systems tend to be multi writer with async replication. This means clients get acks immediately and reads to other nodes for those values can contain various values. The speed of the network doesn’t matter from a theoretical perspective. Network speed only affects potential convergence times. Time is time regardless of the unit of measurement.<p>See my other comment above for distinguishing between EC and Sequential.')
