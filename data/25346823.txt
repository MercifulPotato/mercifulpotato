They all get a signal and a task: make this sound the way the listener wants.<p>&quot;Just make it sound as it did when it was (live) recorded&quot;? That&#x27;s not going to happen even assuming some &quot;perfect&quot; speakers (not headphones), unless you can also supply the room, audience, humidity, and appropriate level of inebriation.<p>Apple has done a lot of of work on adjusting AirPods to your head and ear, IIRC. That&#x27;s all software, and exactly the sort of thing they&#x27;ve been good at, even in the last few years.<p>It&#x27;s basically iPhone camera vs. Canon &amp; Nikon, the sequel. How many times did people on HN insist phone cameras will never be as good as SLRs, because the latter have the five pound of glass it takes to create good photos?<p>Turns out software and sensors are a pretty good substitute.
