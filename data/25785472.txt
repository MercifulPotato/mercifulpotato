This is short sighted, arrogant and encourages similar problems with superiority complexes. TDD is still controversial in some circles, but engineers who have a deep understanding of both tests and implementation are far more valuable than those who only understand one side. Anyway, sorry for the somewhat off topic rant, but a lot of what you said resonated with me')
