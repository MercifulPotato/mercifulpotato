So, there must be something else at the root of that feeling.<p>It is, however, something I’ve heard from others as well.<p>In general though, it is a great keyboard. It is expensive, compared to off the shelf Logitech and Microsoft boards, but seen as a the main tool I use for getting my job done, it’s no cost to pay.')
