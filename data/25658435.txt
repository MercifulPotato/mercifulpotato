Of course there are less information collected but at least you don&#x27;t have to display a form as soon as a user enters your website.<p>The French data protection authority issued a piece of code (JS) which must be used to avoid collecting the user&#x27;s consent. I don&#x27;t know about other data protection authorities in the EU but it shouldn&#x27;t be much different.')
