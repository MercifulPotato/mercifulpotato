If you are inclined to be anti-Apple-at-any-cost, then you will agree with the blog post.  If you are a happy Apple user, you are inclined to go for the latter explanation.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s the strongest example of consumer cultism. Absolute in their exceptionalism and ignorance.<p>Now you&#x27;re being ridiculous, snobby, and insinuating that you are of course immune to such motivations.  Sucks to see this on HN.')
