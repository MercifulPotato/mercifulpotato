Item(by='MaxBarraclough', descendants=None, kids=[25269350], score=None, time=1606820504, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25263698, text='&gt; I had someone arguing against me that it&#x27;s not a good indicator since only approx 20% of competitors get a PhD in Math<p>As lordnacho says, that argument doesn&#x27;t hold up at all. 20% seems really high, to me. A PhD in math isn&#x27;t like scoring highly on an IQ test, it&#x27;s not purely the result of being mathematically capable, it&#x27;s also the result of undertaking a PhD in math. Plenty of smart people apply their abilities elsewhere. Perhaps in finance, for instance.<p>Also, I&#x27;d guess that the Olympiad winners who started a math PhD were more likely to succeed than the average math PhD student, and more likely than average to eventually get tenure.<p>&gt; not being food at the competitions<p>I rather like this typo ;-P')
