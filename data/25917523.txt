I think that&#x27;s what people are upset about.  If they felt it had its day in court, they would feel differently.  Instead, they have the media patting their heads explaining that &quot;it&#x27;s all fine.&quot;  Fraud didn&#x27;t have to be proven; it simply had to be shown to have been possible.  The question is whether protections were breached that keep fraud from not being possible.<p>Listen, I&#x27;m a &quot;Bernie Sanders&quot; Progressive.  I didn&#x27;t vote because both candidates were too conservative for me.  I don&#x27;t really have a horse in this race.<p>That said, this clip shows that the US didn&#x27;t take its electoral systems seriously.  Georgia hasn&#x27;t applied a security patch since 2012?  Really?  And you and the entire media are telling me that it wasn&#x27;t possible when this clip is pretty clear that it wasn&#x27;t just possible but fairly easy.<p>It reminds me of when a blockbuster film comes out and it&#x27;s a stinker, but a lot of money was dropped on it.  So there&#x27;s an effort to make up the opening weekend by having the media sing its praises.  &quot;&#x27;Cats&#x27; is an amazing film!&quot;  But it doesn&#x27;t work.  Your strategy isn&#x27;t working and won&#x27;t work.  The only way forward is to let it have its day in court.')
