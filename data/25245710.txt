He gains something when he promotes Nebula, in hopes to gain even more than what he makes on YouTube.<p>Now about the promoting, it is my bad, I thought that YouTube wasn&#x27;t showing it in frontpage, not that it was literally removed from search. I tried searching for the video and it indeed doesn&#x27;t show in the results. That&#x27;s a negative point for YouTube.')
