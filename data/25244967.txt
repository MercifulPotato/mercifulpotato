Do you want to get a couple of VPS severs to run a cluster? Forget about it or install Nginx and manually do reverse proxy to appropriate web app. I was hoping that MetalLB would solve it but these tools are written for service providers with their own routing etc. There is nothing for a small guy just wanting to deploy his blog and don&#x27;t want to pay Amazon or Google for setting up a cluster.')
