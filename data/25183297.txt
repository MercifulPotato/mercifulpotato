When creating identifiers like this it&#x27;s very important that they be non-reproducible. The article nearly touched on this with random patterns, but the important distinction is that the process must not be reproducible by the manufacturer even if they wanted to.<p>In [1], they propose timing artifacts in FPGAs as a means to achieve this. I imagine that some of the random material embeddings in the article may achieve this in practice, though it&#x27;s important to actually quantify it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;citeseerx.ist.psu.edu&#x2F;viewdoc&#x2F;download?doi=10.1.1.297.5196&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;citeseerx.ist.psu.edu&#x2F;viewdoc&#x2F;download?doi=10.1.1.29...</a>')
