I&#x27;m a few years removed now, but I had the priviledge of getting to admin most major sequencing machines and their data output, and it was a great learning experience for how much the scientific community stands to gain from modern tech stacks imho.<p>One of my favorite examples, I was doing some fastq munging, and had written about a page of perl as per some existing documentation. I kept failing, and eventually just emailed the researcher who wrote the relevant paper... and he said something like &quot;why not use awk, something like $oneliner?&quot; With a few modifications my huge glut of perl became a one line awk...<p>Of course that just means I&#x27;m bad at perl, but for some reason it sticks in the mind. I still get invited to bioinformatics conferences... too bad I didn&#x27;t take them up on it pre-pandemic.')
