Item(by='jancsika', descendants=None, kids=[24796290], score=None, time=1602810008, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24793219, text='&gt; I grew up during the late 90s (born in late 80s) learning about the internet and its philosophies.<p>And with this specific case, I&#x27;m with you on your hill.<p>But more broadly we&#x27;re usually not talking about the web from the late 90s. We&#x27;re talking about a handful of modern social networks most of which use of anti-democratic dark patterns. And algorithms that are known to push a given percentage of users down a rabbithole, who can then be weaponized for who knows what purpose by who knows which nasty actors.<p>In essence, we&#x27;re talking about factories which-- if there were a market for it-- could produce a version of the internet from the 90s with the slight difference that a sizable proportion of your 90s internet acquaintances happen to spout racist rhetoric and becoming walking, talking bioweapons this time around.<p>I know that&#x27;s not the topic here. But <i>that</i> is a much bigger problem IMO and the answer of &quot;more speech&quot; is at most helplessly incomplete wrt it.')
