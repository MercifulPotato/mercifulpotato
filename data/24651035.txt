Item(by='falcolas', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601561723, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24650873, text='&gt; but if you are, you can charge all your devices with the same plug<p>I have expressly found this to not be true. I have a bluetooth headset that has a USB-C plug, but it <i>only charges from a USB-A to USB-C cord</i>. It also won&#x27;t connect to a computer using a straight USB-C cord, but it will with a USB-C to USB-A adapter and a USB-A to USB-C cord.<p>The Switch won&#x27;t always charge from every adapter (and some folks have reported damage from trying to use a generic adapter).<p>I tried to use an Apple USB-C charger with a Lenovo chromebook, and the chromebook would flash as if you were plugging and unplugging the computer every second.<p>I have a USB-C dock (Anker brand) for my work computer, and it works (mostly) but the power is so noisy that I have to use a separate port with a USB-C to USB-A for my USB headset.<p>So, yeah, USB-C is a real shitshow at my house.')
