So it was never really the hardware that held back gaming on Mac, but the fact that from a game-development perspective it&#x27;s an esoteric platform that has limited or no support for the main industry standard APIs (DirectX, Vulkan, etc).<p>I think it&#x27;s more that gaming wasn&#x27;t held back on the Mac. It was just bootcamp was much more common than people think.<p>&gt; If you&#x27;re going to port your game to iOS (and why not? It&#x27;s a huge platform with powerful GPUs and a huge, &quot;spendy&quot; market)<p>Because mobile gaming and desktop gaming have very little in common. Note that Nintendo didn&#x27;t port their titles when they released iOS games, they made new games. Users want different experiences, and flat ports of successful console gaming titles to iOS tend to fail. There are, all told, very few ports of successful PC&#x2F;console games to iOS, and those that exist tend to be brand reuse rather than literal ports.<p>&gt; then you basically get Mac for free with close to zero additional effort.<p>Not even remotely. The way you secure your service has to be totally different, the UI paradigm is completely different, you have to cope with totally different aspect ratios etc etc. It&#x27;s significant effort, and it will be very hard to justify for most game studios. It&#x27;s certainly more work in most cases than porting a Windows game to MacOS was when using a mainstream engine, and that was not a huge market.')
