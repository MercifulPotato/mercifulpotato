If the former, I agree that it seems like a dumb feature but if people want to pay for it, so be it. However if you are talking about electronic systems in general, they are not overengineering for the convenience of the manufacturer nor wow factor. Components like solid state relays are chosen because they are safer and simpler than their mechanical counterparts - the fact that you can do more with them and they are cheaper is just further evidence of their overall superiority for most applications.<p>I think what a lot of people are forgetting here is that in the vast majority of situations you don&#x27;t want random people to be able to easily open up your doors from outside. What failed here was not the door handle - which operated exactly as it should under normal circumstances, but the emergency override that should unlock the car when the airbags deploy. However, it&#x27;s completely reasonable for some systems to fail when you crash at extremely high speeds - you can&#x27;t make things indestructible. I see no evidence that a mechanical failsafe would have performed better.')
