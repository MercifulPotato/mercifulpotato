They are slated to phase out at the end of 2021 and 2022, but I really wouldn&#x27;t be too surprised if they reinstate the running-time extensions that were revoked after the Fukushima disaster.<p>The nuclear phase-out, that was decided and ratified back in 2001&#x2F;2002, was backed by the first green electricity feed-in tariff scheme in the world. In major parts responsible for Germany&#x27;s massive renewable capabilities because it also utilized Germanys leading position in renewable tech back then.<p>Germany is also a major player in nuclear fusion research, being home to the largest and most advanced stellarator [1] and a major contributor to ITER [2].<p>It&#x27;s also been at the forefront for hydrogen research and application, which has very real potential to be the green fuel of the future: Using the abundance of renewable energy for electrolysis of hydrogen, which can then be stored.<p>Yet whenever &quot;German energy&quot; comes up, all that&#x27;s brought up is this flat out wrong &quot;Germany doesn&#x27;t do nuclear!
