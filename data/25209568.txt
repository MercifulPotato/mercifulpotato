Attack competition by forcing tech companies to ban or downgrade them, all to re-assert their traditional status as social gatekeepers ... and profit! And every single mainstream &#x27;news&#x27; outlet that is pushing this social media censorship is backed by a multi-billion dollar corporate conglomerate. Thanks but no thanks.')
