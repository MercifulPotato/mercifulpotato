I literally mentioned that &quot;civil torts&quot; encompasses &quot;hate speech&quot;. Maybe you should Google what &quot;civil torts&quot; means.<p>Quoting verbatim from the Guidelines: &quot;Parler will not knowingly allow itself to be used as a tool for crime, civil torts, or other unlawful acts&quot;<p>DEFINITION of a &quot;tort&quot;: A tort, in common law jurisdiction, is a civil wrong (other than breach of contract) that causes a claimant to suffer loss or harm, resulting in legal liability for the person who commits the tortious act. It can include <i>intentional infliction of emotional distress</i>, negligence, financial losses, injuries, <i>invasion of privacy</i>, and many other things.<p>In fact a &quot;civil tort&quot; is more accurate term than &quot;hate speech&quot;. It is more broader than all the specific hate combating policies that social media companies have in place. There is a complete paper on how torts can be used to combat &quot;hate speech&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholarship.law.uc.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?article=1235&amp;context=uclr" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholarship.law.uc.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?article=1...</a><p>&gt; You haven&#x27;t meaningfully replied for several comments, so I don&#x27;t mind if you save your breath after your replies being dismantled over and over again.<p>I have meaningfully replied. You don&#x27;t have the patience to read what I wrote causing me to repeat myself ad nauseam. You can start your learning process by understanding what &quot;civil tort&quot; means. Then come back here once you learnt the definition.<p>&gt; And on the Twitter front, you just admitted it right? Twitter removes left wing content, you linked it yourself. Case closed.<p>Linked what myself? Twitter hasn&#x27;t closed prominent left wing accounts. I am still waiting for you to provide one. All the accounts that it has closed are bots&#x2F;fake and some fringe accounts with hundred followers or so. The day Twitter bans Kathy Griffin I&#x27;ll say Twitter is not biased. Else they are hypocrites. As simple as that.')
