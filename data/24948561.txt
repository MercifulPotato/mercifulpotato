Most of this year’s propositions are poison laced candy. They offer you one thing and take away something far more valuable.<p>Go read the whole proposition. They supposedly let you do it 3 times. That is the candy. Too bad many counties already let you do it once. So you haven’t gained much if anything. The poison is transfer to children resets the property tax for anything over a million. Now read each proposition and find the candy and then find the poison.')
