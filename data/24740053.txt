If I enjoy reading tech articles and programming, then I&#x27;d still enjoy that if it was a faithful simulation. For social behaviors, presumably you&#x27;d be able to interact outside and&#x2F;or with other simulated people.  \nFor physical activity, you would lose that, which would be unpleasant. Though, hopefully you&#x27;d be able to make some form of physical simulation that is controlled by the brain even if it can&#x27;t match reality perfectly.  \nFor sensations like taste, air temperature, and smell, well.. while those can be enjoyable&#x2F;unpleasant it is not <i>that</i> enjoyable.  \nSo, you&#x27;d do just as you always have? If we don&#x27;t have any form of physical simulation within it then you do lose some activities, which is unfortunate.  \nI&#x27;m curious why you think what gives our life meaning and joy is tied to our physical bodies? Like, the most enjoyable aspects in life for me are things that I could do from a &#x27;&#x27;mental&#x27;&#x27; textbox. There are certainly things I would miss, but hopefully simulation-esque aspects of that would also pop-up as time goes on.')
