I&#x27;m okay with that, but otherwise I don&#x27;t wear branded clothing.<p>My employer got everyone jackets one year, nice ones actually, you just had to submit your size. I didn&#x27;t, and it&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t like my employer, I absolutely do, but I don&#x27;t feel that it&#x27;s necessary for me to advertise where I work. I also quietly ignored the dress shirts, polos and t-shirts that was handed out recently.<p>People can wear whatever they want, I don&#x27;t really care. I just don&#x27;t see the point in paying for branding, or using myself as an billboard.')
