You’re not also responding to the actual studies I posted from a lab. I’m not trying to be flippant here and I see your argument as being that until studied we “just don’t know”. Your characterization of all people using MDMA outside a therapeutic setting as singularly a party&#x2F;recreational drug and irresponsibly is just rather ignorant to me.<p>I want more studies, certainly. IMO it has huge amounts of promise for getting people to emotionally open up and reconcile with themselves in a way therapy alone can be less effective.<p>Also to repeat myself, I did not say that people suffer from depression afterwards. Feeling “drained” is part and parcel of the experience of MDMA and supplementation absolutely reduces that negative side effect.')
