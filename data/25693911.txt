When they haven&#x27;t, it literally means: &quot;I <i>really don&#x27;t care</i> how you solve this, just give me the best solution you can however you want, and stop making excuses.&quot;<p>And for the record I <i>could</i> propose better solutions but clearly you don&#x27;t want them because that&#x27;s too much &quot;magic&quot;.\nIn fact, one bit you might find fun: try plugging in the proposed solution <i>as a new guess</i> and see how well the algorithm had even converged. You&#x27;re literally advocating for an algorithm that produces wrong solutions it <i>doesn&#x27;t even claim to converge on</i>. It it even <i>possible</i> to be more wrong than this on such a basic problem?!<p>Lastly: I&#x27;ve found <i>far milder</i> bugs in Mathematica that I <i>didn&#x27;t</i> expect them to fix, and they actually fixed them. So I think, moving forward, this is probably going to be my exhibit A for why expecting open source software to achieve the quality of commercial solutions might be fundamentally just expecting too much. When you don&#x27;t have customer money to tell you your wrong solutions are wrong, people will jump to the defense of the most insane behavior, telling you you&#x27;re &quot;not fundamentally right&quot; to expect programs to have even the most trivial sanity checks to prevent wildly wrong outputs for the most basic problems.')
