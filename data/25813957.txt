The OP on this thread did not specify what kind of project. Make may be completely appropriate. It might also not be and just what they are used to. The proverbial hammer.<p>If someone came in and tried to build my Java project with Make, I would definitely call them crazy and not use it either. If someone came to my Java project and tried to put Gradle on it to build it, I might also not use it but at least its appropriate for the language and if everyone on the team&#x2F;project was OK with it, I would probably be OK with it and use it.<p>If someone tried to build my FE Javascript project with Make, I would not use it. If they used yarn instead of npm that would be a Gradle vs. Maven situation as above, so either&#x27;s fine if there&#x27;s nothing yet.<p>If there&#x27;s a set of bash scripts that are perfectly adequate to build the project you have, fine, why use Make?<p>And let me tell you from experience, conventions are great but don&#x27;t always work, i.e. no $CC and $DESTDIR are definitely not something every user of Make does appropriately. I&#x27;ve had to add that to a few back in the day. You install like you&#x27;re used to with DESTDIR only to find that it just installed itself into your system. You swear, fix it and learn to _always_ check a newly downloaded project for whether they actually have the &#x27;standard&#x27; features implemented before you build something.<p>Contrast that with many of the newer build and packaging tools, that basically take this choice away from the user, which is a great thing if you ask me. Sure you have to get over the &quot;but I want to do it my way&quot; defiance reaction but in the end it is awesome when each new project you come to you do _not_ have to check and learn how exactly that project does things because every Maven project has its stuff in the same place (unless someone re-configured it, which unfortunately does happen). But maven is bad nowadays, coz it uses XML :(')
