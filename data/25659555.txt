Item(by='AlexandrB', descendants=None, kids=[25659932, 25663886], score=None, time=1609952400, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25658339, text='I&#x27;ve been using WhatsApp without giving it contact access for a few years and it&#x27;s <i>possible</i> but <i>annoying</i>. Since WhatsApp still shows you recent chats you don&#x27;t have to type phone numbers each time, you just select from the list of recent chats. You also get to see people&#x27;s WhatsApp profile photo so it&#x27;s generally possible to know who you&#x27;re talking to even though their username is their phone number. This works ok for me with around a dozen frequent WhatsApp contacts but I could see it breaking down if you have more than 20 frequent contacts.<p>&gt; What if they previously didn’t have WhatsApp installed, but have since installed, so you also need to check again every time you want to message someone who formerly didn’t have WhatsApp.<p>Why is this important? I use WhatsApp instead of SMS for contacts who don&#x27;t have (free) SMS or who want the extra security. It&#x27;s pretty intentional. Why would I want to use WhatsApp with <i>everyone</i>? That concept seems aligned with Facebook&#x27;s goals, not mine.')
