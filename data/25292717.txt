I hope and expect that it&#x27;ll help create a new generation of ARM-based laptops and maybe even desktops that will run cool and smooth.<p>Be careful what you wish for. X86 is the most open architecture right now. ARM, on the other hand, has locked bootloaders, messy device trees and so on. You can see that virtually every Linux distro running on an ARM SOC needs some specific tweaks.')
