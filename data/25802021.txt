This is the &quot;I don&#x27;t want to lose my wedding photos because I dropped my phone in the toilet&quot; scenario.<p>Telegram addresses this in the following manner: &quot;Anything you want backed up and aren&#x27;t too worried about existing in the cloud, goes on our cloud, encrypted, enabling you to access it from a new untoileted phone if necessary. Anything you don&#x27;t want going in our cloud, you can be in control of, either by chatting in secret, or by backing up and deleting bilaterally.&quot;. Telegram has been audited frequently enough to be trustworthy that this in fact is true.<p>Signal addresses this by .. well, they don&#x27;t. They hope that you will have the good sense of transferring the backup from your phone to an external disk before dropping your phone in the toilet. Which means the only reliable way to back things up automatically if you&#x27;re an average use is? You guessed it. Dropbox &#x2F; Google. So effectively exactly back to the Whatsapp leaky backup model.<p>I&#x27;d rather we convince people jump the Whatsapp ship first, before we start dividing into factions that will hurt that message. You can have your civil war later if you really want to.')
