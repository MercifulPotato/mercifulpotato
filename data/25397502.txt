So far very impressed with the language.<p>This also uses my own frontend web framework Prism. Prism is a new web framework which has the ability to &quot;prerender&quot; pages in Rust. Kinda of like something like NextJS is but the render functions are native&#x2F;pure rust code. There is no other frontend web framework (React, Vue, Svelte) which has this ability, Prism is the first.<p>Maybe you are writing are site which does rendering through a server side templating language. These are purely server side rendering solutions and miss out on some of the progressive benefits of client side rendering, routing and runtime JS. Using Prism you can get those benefits but can build backend and server side rendering in Rust rather than have to shell out a slower JS server.<p>It also has a special technique for hydration that is much faster than partial hydration as does not require any JS state blob or rerender on load. You can read about this here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.to&#x2F;kaleidawave&#x2F;jit-hydration-4b62" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.to&#x2F;kaleidawave&#x2F;jit-hydration-4b62</a><p>I have a full article more about the development here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kaleidawave.medium.com&#x2F;hacker-news-clone-with-prism-rust-b4c681fe07af" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kaleidawave.medium.com&#x2F;hacker-news-clone-with-prism-...</a><p>And the site is public here: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;40.115.126.159&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;40.115.126.159&#x2F;</a><p>This is very experimental at this stage , if you are writing sites that do SSR in a language other than JS, Prism is working on enable compilation for other languages such has been done for Rust. It would be great to hear your opinions on it!')
