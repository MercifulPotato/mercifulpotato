But the planet will continue to get sunlight, and it will continue to have gravity.<p>These 2 key things, are found nowhere else in this universe.  Except for Venus, which has a similar gravity, but it’s so hot, the surface can melt lead.<p>And we still don’t yet have a high probability of the closest extra-solar planet, that can sustain life with earth-like gravity and a magnetic field.<p>Even an asteroid that eliminated the dinosaurs was still not able to eliminate life on Earth. Why? Because of this water world, its gravity, and its magnetic field.<p>So the best solution to having a backup for humanity, is to probably (1) dig a hole deep in the ground, and establish a deep mine colony there. Or (2) build a deep ocean habitat, and establish a deep marine colony there.<p>That way, if an asteroid hits land, then the deep ocean colony can survive.  Or if the asteroid hits the ocean, then the deep mine colony can survive.')
