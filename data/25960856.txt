The problem with what you did post is that it was snarky and unsubstantive, as well as a partisan provocation. Certainly that breaks the site guidelines—more than one of them, in fact.<p>It&#x27;s fascinating to me how common it is that people&#x27;s <i>second</i> comment (e.g. after a moderation reply) will give a detailed substantive expression of what they actually meant. I think we all assume that what&#x27;s in our mind will come across in our comments, but actually it doesn&#x27;t come across by itself—it needs to be formulated explicitly, as you did in your follow-up. If you don&#x27;t share it explicitly, but only give a quick pointer to it, people will fill that in with what&#x27;s in <i>their</i> mind, which is a huge range of possible interpretations, many of which are inflammatory or even attacks, whether you meant it that way or not. Commenters will respond to what they perceive you as saying (and feeling, and thinking, and doing), and it&#x27;s your responsibility to minimize the gap between that and what you actually mean. (I don&#x27;t mean just you, of course. We all need to do this.)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment&amp;query=disambiguate%20burden%20by:dang" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;so...</a>')
