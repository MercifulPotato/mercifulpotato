While I understand the practicality of Docker and facilitating development using it, I wouldn&#x27;t call it &quot;forward&quot; progress.<p>The fundamental problem, as you say, is that our dependency ecosystems don&#x27;t meet our requirements. Docker is one way to avoid the problem without fixing it since it&#x27;s easier. Forward progress would be to fix the problem.<p>On one hand, Docker removes some pressure to fix the problem and encourages perpetuating it. On the other hand, maybe it gets people to think about the problem more. I don&#x27;t know which influence is stronger.')
