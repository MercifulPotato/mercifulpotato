Just like cocaine has applications such as a topical anaesthetic.<p>But it&#x27;s completely disingenous to suggest that the app is using the name &quot;Amphetamine&quot; as if it were under the context of a doctor&#x27;s prescription. It&#x27;s <i>obviously</i> in the recreational context of healthy people staying awake. And exactly the same as with &quot;cocaine&quot;, when most people hear &quot;amphetamines&quot; they think of illegal drugs, not prescription ones.')
