This article focuses on the risks of &quot;megadosing&quot; vitamin D. I&#x27;m not sure how you interpreted my pointing out that vitamin D supplementation can lead to magnesium deficiency as a recommendation to &quot;megadose&quot; magnesium. I&#x27;ve certainly never taken magnesium in any quantity that gets close to toxicity and I&#x27;d never advocate anyone else do that.<p>(Incidentally, I&#x27;ve felt before that Gwern&#x27;s approach of experimenting with supplementation of a single nutrient and looking for a single change is of limited value, as it doesn&#x27;t take into account the complexity effects of that supplementation. His list of self-experiments includes a magnesium&#x2F;sleep trial and a vitamin D&#x2F;sleep trial, with negative results in both cases. But for the reasons discussed above, a trial involving both magnesium and vit D, and perhaps other nutrients as well would likely yield very different results, and probably ones that are far more useful).<p>Your comments about the efficacy&#x2F;cost of higher bioavailability supplements are worthy of consideration. Though it seems contradictory to warn against &quot;megadosing&quot; in one paragraph but then recommending increasing the dose in another.<p>The particular benefit I&#x27;m interested in is passing the blood brain barrier, as the biggest issues for me are mental - e.g., anxiety and memory, for which magnesium l-threonate is said to be particularly beneficial. I would expect that increasing the dosage of a different form, which doesn&#x27;t cross the BBB so effectively, would potentially lead to an excess elsewhere in the body.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not primarily focusing on magnesium; the main target of my approach to healing is currently the thyroid, and I&#x27;m cautiously taking tyrosine and iodine for that, as well as working on gut&#x2F;microbiome health to improve uptake so that ultimately all nutrients can be attained from the diet so and no supplementation is needed, which is ideal as you point out. But I&#x27;m not there yet; several years of testing and work has confirmed that.')
