And not just because of the reasons you listed. Everything surrounding computers has become so focused on making money that it really, really bothers me. There isn&#x27;t a single thing on my computer anymore that hasn&#x27;t been optimized to the n&#x27;th degree either to weasel more money out of me (F&#x27; you, Apple TV, Apple Music), or built in a way which optimized as much money out of the process as possible (F&#x27; you, Mozilla, every single one of you Electron apps out there).<p>We&#x27;ve become so utterly focused on money and optimizations that the fun and value has been sucked right out of the software - both front and back.')
