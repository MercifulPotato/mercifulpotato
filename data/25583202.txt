A lot of financial opportunities---particularly job offers---come through one&#x27;s social network, and things like dining out are important elements of maintaining social connections.<p>Others, like fitness, clearly have the capacity to pay off financially in the form of reduced health expenses and increased capacity to work.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean it should be your sole reason for doing these things---enjoying a fine meal with friends, or having a good workout are gratifying in their own right, and if you&#x27;re engaging in them just for the possible financial benefit, you&#x27;re missing out on life. But they are not the financial drag they may appear to be at first glance, either.')
