Many people also swear by the iPad &#x2F; Apple pencil combo, though that&#x27;s a step up in price.<p>I&#x27;ve had a few of the non-screen Wacoms in the past, but could never get on with the &#x27;drawing down there -- appearing up there&#x27; disconnect between tablet and computer screen, so I cot rid of them and adopted the Android tablet + stylus approach.<p>The advantages of using a tablet:<p>1: Small, portable, self-contained. The Wacom &#x2F; Huion types need connected through a computer.<p>2: Some surprisingly good full-featured software available for ridiculously low prices [or free]<p>3: The Samsung Galaxy S-pen has 1024 pressure levels --just like the Wacom pens. So it&#x27;s actually a very sensitive drawing instrument.<p>The disadvantages of using a tablet:<p>1: Small screen size. It can often feel pretty cramped on there. Good graphics apps will allow you to hide all the interface panels and menus, so you&#x27;re using all the screen to draw. But a lot of the time, I&#x27;m having to zoom in and work on an image in sections.<p>2: Plenty of good bitmap image manipulation and drawing apps about, but I still can&#x27;t find an Android vector drawing app I like.<p>3: Can be bit more of a faff passing files around between apps on Android than it is on desktop. Though, unlike iOS, at least Android does allow filesystem access, so you can manage it, with a bit of juggling [and using Google Drive as your save destination helps a lot].')
