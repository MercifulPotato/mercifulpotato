Tapping techies on the shoulder and asking &quot;what&#x27;s up with your task?&quot; is a widely disliked management technique. Or you meant something else?<p>&gt; <i>You can&#x27;t as easily come in and check-in when you need too, you need to formally setup meetings or reviews.</i><p>Good. I am glad there is more tension for you when doing that now. Most meetings are disruptive for the creators so the increased barrier to entry for setting them up is a welcome correction and a reality-check mechanism. You do rely on those people to produce artifacts that lead to the company&#x27;s bottom line and it is known that creators utilize flow state for their best productivity, thus their time shouldn&#x27;t be sliced and diced so easily. Bureaucracy is not an universal virtue, let&#x27;s all acknowledge that.<p>&gt; <i>And it&#x27;s not as engaging or easy for you to understand and ask questions in those meetings either.</i><p>What do you mean by &quot;engaging&quot;? That you felt an informal bond with your underlings while having status meetings in person? If so, fair enough alright but how is it stopping you having it now during virtual meets?<p>&gt; <i>Also it&#x27;s unpleasant to be on Zoom all day long, and since your job is just meetings all day, that&#x27;s your new reality.</i><p>Also good. Should hint you to do less of those then. Find other formats: collaborative editing of documents &#x2F; spreadsheets, to-do lists, milestone calendars, email + ticket tracker hooks, all of it. There&#x27;s basically tooling for every need out there and most is leagues cheaper than JIRA. Use managers-only Slack channels or internal forums. There is a plethora of viable alternatives.<p>&gt; <i>This becomes truer and truer the higher up the chain. [sic] ...</i><p>This might sound a bit cold and I apologize if it&#x27;s taken this way but... that&#x27;s really not my problem as the techie and the creator. At all. You need my services, I need the pay, we both agreed to the terms, and we are so far both happy with the transaction. If you decide to start changing the deal due to factors I cannot fully appreciate or sympathize with then that new situation now becomes your problem, the VP&#x27;s problem, the various CxO people&#x27;s problem.<p>They do, after all is said and done, get their money&#x27;s worth out of the employees, no? Why should I be worried that they rented or bought a mega-expensive office somewhere?<p>---<p>I suppose the gist of what I am saying is: the current full remote work situation highlights problems with the previous process that were always there but were never seriously challenged.<p>I view that as a good thing. Old processes need refreshing every now and then.<p>What do you think?')
