Marx popularised the term and he implicitly defined it as an economic-political system and &quot;that which we are fighting against.&quot; Most of his writing and communist contemporaries was about corruption and cruelty of this newly described system. In marxist capitalism, when a monopolist bribes a government official this is capitalism par excellence. The premise of the term is that &quot;capital rules,&quot; so regulatory capture is assumed<p>The other meaning is pro-capitalist. These mostly riff on Adam Smith. David Ricardo responded directly to marx and provides some technical ammo. By Ayn Rand, &quot;capitalism&quot; it has a full blown utopian definition like communism. Regulatory capture is seen as a corruption of &quot;true&quot; capitalism.<p>Anyway... the two frames are highly related to eachother.')
