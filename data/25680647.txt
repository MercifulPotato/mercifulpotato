So your check of $100 out of your checking account gets split into 3 different places, e.g. expense accounts.<p>Your actual representation of chequing accounts should really represent the bank account,so you shouldn&#x27;t do what you describe (that lead to a wrong balance), your actual budgeting is done elsewhere.<p>If you weren&#x27;t doing envelope budgeting, you might just mark things into expense accounts, so they keep a running track of what you&#x27;ve spent.<p>I haven&#x27;t used it for a while so may get details a bit mixed, but the gist of it is right, If you want to do envelope style budgeting, you have a few possibilities. One is to do regular expense accounts but change your reporting period to say 1 month, and you use the report tools to see what is happening.  In this way if you overspend in one, and underspend in another, it all rolls up into the same total.  Another way would be more explicit, you would allocate a liability account 1st of each month for each &quot;envelope&quot; and then spend against that.  You could freely transfer between these, and you can carry over etc. This would give you an up to date view easily.  There are other schemes, depends what you want to make easy and what you make hard.<p>By the way I&#x27;m pretty sure I remember gnucash has a built in budget tool also, but I&#x27;ve never used it; might be close enough to what you want to be the least effort.')
