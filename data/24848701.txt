So, yeah, naming is not great and your assertion is not entirely correct.<p>The first few hits I got were:<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metalevel.at&#x2F;prolog&#x2F;web" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.metalevel.at&#x2F;prolog&#x2F;web</a><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Anniepoo&#x2F;weblog" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Anniepoo&#x2F;weblog</a><p>* <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pathwayslms.com&#x2F;swipltuts&#x2F;html&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pathwayslms.com&#x2F;swipltuts&#x2F;html&#x2F;index.html</a><p>And no sniff of this new framework.')
