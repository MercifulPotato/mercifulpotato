The comment to which you are responding covers quite a bit more. The jax documentation specifically says &quot;standard Python containers&quot;. Zygote.jl and other less stable Julia auto-diff libraries go far beyond the built-ins and can work with structures defined by packages never designed to be used with automatic differentiation. Of course, there are limitations, but quite a bit less severe than the one in jax (and again, I am saying this while being a big jax fan).')
