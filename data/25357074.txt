Some random thoughts, I am not an economist and have armchair knowledge of the whole thing at best so take these with a few kilos of salt:<p>- Europe lowered interest rates on loans by a lot, going into the negative [1]\n- This allowed mortgage interest rates to be lowered by a lot as well, because competition.\n- Mortgage interest rates are linked to savings account rates, so their interest went way down as well - going into 0% or negative rates here and there.\n- This de-incentivized saving money; that plus low mortgage interest rates mean people are buying houses or putting their money into the stock market.\n- Low mortgage interest rates + people buying houses as investment = rising housing prices. Housing prices in NL have gone up by a lot. Brexit, international companies and expats didn&#x27;t help (mainly around the big cities).\n- The pandemic and pressure &#x2F; encouragement to work from home more has caused a lot of people who live in the big cities (in shit circumstances because of the ridiculous cost of living) to scratch their head and consider moving to the countryside, raising housing prices there as well.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ecb.europa.eu&#x2F;press&#x2F;key&#x2F;date&#x2F;2020&#x2F;html&#x2F;ecb.sp200826~77ce66626c.en.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ecb.europa.eu&#x2F;press&#x2F;key&#x2F;date&#x2F;2020&#x2F;html&#x2F;ecb.sp200...</a>')
