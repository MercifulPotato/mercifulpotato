You&#x27;re still querying the database for elements that come after a value from a data type for which there is an order. You don&#x27;t need that element to exist to run a comparison. For example, consider a timestamp-based query: you don&#x27;t need an element with that specific date to exist to search for any element whose timestamp was taken after an arbitrary moment.')
