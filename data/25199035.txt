CCS must be accomplished or the existential risk is we and almost everything else dies.<p>1. CCS has to be accomplished using biological processes, not mechanical or chemical industrial processes.<p>2. The best way to accomplish 1. is to use oceanic organisms such as kelp and phytoplankton. Recall the enormous kelp forest between Mexico and Africa that dumped many, many tons of material on Canc√∫n&#x27;s beaches.<p>3. Sequestration of 2. requires either sinking material to the deepest depths of the ocean, or minimizing and injecting carbonaceous material below ground.<p>4. 350 ppm can be achieved for under $20T USD, but the desire, intent, and coordination must occur rather than looking for excuses or shouting &quot;It&#x27;s impossible!&quot;')
