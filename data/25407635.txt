I&#x27;m not interested in one for obtaining jobs, but mainly situations that have a hard requirement for a degree (ex: obtaining a work visa).<p>I&#x27;m not familiar with the differences in degrees between countries, but assuming a person is already competent in German, I don&#x27;t see the downsides (barring that &quot;obtaining a first job&quot; mention earlier, I&#x27;m sure employers wouldn&#x27;t like it) to this path versus a degree from the USA.')
