This could be used to e.g. circumvent activation lock, allowing stolen iPhones or macOS devices to be reset and sold on the black market.<p>&gt; Since sepOS&#x2F;BootROM is Read-Only Memory for security reasons, interestingly, Apple cannot patch this core vulnerability without a new hardware revision.<p>Crouching T2, Hidden Danger (2020-10-05) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ironpeak.be&#x2F;blog&#x2F;crouching-t2-hidden-danger&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ironpeak.be&#x2F;blog&#x2F;crouching-t2-hidden-danger&#x2F;</a>')
