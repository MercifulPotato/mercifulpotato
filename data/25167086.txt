You are throwing around with the word &#x27;moral&#x27; around a lot and it seems to me that you don&#x27;t even understand the basics of moral philosophy.\nYour usage of &#x27;moral&#x27; seems to be merely a rhetoric device to give more weight to your opinion, but what does that even accomplish when you fail to deliver any evidence for your morality?<p>You just make a lot of claims, but you fail to back them up, so they are and remain nothing but that, baseless claims. It&#x27;s basically just your opinion, which you are trying to wrap in the garment of &#x27;morality&#x27;.
