The point was about ascertaining the impact of a mathematical breakthrough .. which is harder than a scientific one, because the idea of what is a &quot;breakthrough&quot; is usually defined within the domain of mathematics itself. A good example is all the number theoretic work, elliptic curves etc. which underpin much of secure communication today, but started off as &quot;pure&quot; in the sense of &quot;won&#x27;t find applications&quot;. That was easy. Now what&#x27;s the impact of the breakthrough proof of Fermat&#x27;s last theorem by Wiles?')
