Depending on the model they have sensor buttons where you can raise&#x2F;lower the temperature in 10 to 20째C steps.<p>Mine have 10째C steps, where with water in a pot at 90째C the first few small bubbles start to rise, like in soda&#x2F;mineral water. When at 100째C the big boiling bubbles start after about 2 to 3 seconds.<p>Mine are rated at 2500 Watts each, have segmented induction coils where the outer segments switch off with smaller pots, are plan like a mirror and thus very easy and fast to clean.<p>I&#x27;m such a fan! :-)')
