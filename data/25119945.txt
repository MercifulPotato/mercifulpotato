Most of the work is done by others. &#x2F;head nod to Timsort.<p>You need to know how to avoid common pitfalls (i.e., yeah, maybe nested for-loops with millions of elements per level of iteration, maybe some alarm bells should go off)<p>Advanced algorithm knowledge is not needed for developing typical business software.<p>Bad security is a disaster for any public-facing software projects. A product you didn&#x27;t ship because you hired the wrong people can&#x27;t be reverted, but neither can a data leak.<p>Or the company who goes bankrupt because you leaked highly sensitive data.<p>Etc. etc. ad nauseum.')
