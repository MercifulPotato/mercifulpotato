I legitimately found it amusing that they used, or appeared to use, rhetorical methods like the one in the article.<p>But look at half (or more by the time I click &#x27;reply&#x27;) the comments here. They&#x27;re discussing whether or not there is a War on the War on Christmas, they fell into the same rhetorical trap the article itself is discussing. This is great entertainment and a wonderful way to clear my mind at the end of work on a slow Friday.')
