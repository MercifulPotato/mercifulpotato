Currently, there actually _is_ a large-scale rewrite in progress to bring the various SDKs up to a consistent level of quality and python standards, since it&#x27;s no secret the original batch of SDKs grew rather organically.  As such, this is a VERY APT time to hear this sort of comment. (And yes, I&#x27;m taking it totally deadpan even if it wasn&#x27;t necessarily meant that way :P)<p>Do feel encouraged to file issues on the azure-sdk-for-python github as well as things come to mind; there are more formal triage processes there than &quot;I happened to read this over lunch&quot; :)')
