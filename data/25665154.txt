If you disagree, please cite the exact standing.<p>&gt; Moreover, similar challenges to PA law by PA voters, PA candidates, and Trump himself were dismissed also for standing.<p>The cases along this line that were dismissed for standing were on the basis of challenging the state constitutionality of state laws (or actions of state officials) in federal courts. You&#x27;re supposed to challenge them in state courts, which did hear some of the complaints and ultimately <i>disagreed</i> with those cases on the merits. You don&#x27;t get to run off to federal court just because you don&#x27;t like the state answers, especially since federal precedent is <i>overwhelmingly</i> along the lines of &quot;we cannot question state courts&#x27; interpretation of state laws&#x2F;state constitutions&quot;--this deference is the very definition of federalism.')
