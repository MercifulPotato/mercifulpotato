Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=[25656680], score=None, time=1609931111, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25656042, text='Not OP, but when my dad had cancer in Poland, the national health fund covered his entire treatment over 8 years. Few operations, monthly dose of Glivec(google the cost of Glivec treatment in the US to see how insane that is), hospital stays, and like OP said - he would get reimbursed for travelling to the hospital and back. And this treatment was never tied to his employment, he never had to prove to anyone that he definitely has cancer still, we&#x27;ve never seen a single bill for any of it, I simply have no idea how much this treatment has cost over the years. Which is the point of it all I think - if you need treatment, you simply get it, a regular person never has to worry about billing, dealing with insurers or anything like that. The only interactions you need to have are the doctors telling you when to appear for the operation, and the pharmacy calling you to let you know your drugs are ready to pick up. That&#x27;s about it. I know there are outliers in that system, but for my dad&#x27;s entire 8-year long treatment I&#x27;d consider the way this all works as 10&#x2F;10.')
