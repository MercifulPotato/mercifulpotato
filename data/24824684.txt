Silver lining is Iâ€™m unbreakable and persistent, so my sales skills are improving in order to eat and hold to that (eg. Justifying $9 tacos as 45 mins of min wage work and vs. $9 of comparable Taco Bell both vegan), and most of the stuff has lasted insanely long relative to wear, to like cents per use.')
