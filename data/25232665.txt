What was common knowledge or specialized in different trades was replaced with ignorance. They didn&#x27;t know how to farm in the same way or manufacture the same goods, they didn&#x27;t understand the principles behind the infrastructure that was now crumbling around them, etc. They lacked the engine of broadly perpetuating knowledge we call civilization. Sure, there were individuals in certain places that possessed a fair amount of knowledge, but that knowledge was not widely distributed, and thus it was fragile.<p>For those collapsed civilizations, it was only that there were sufficient remaining resources in the earth and that their civilization was geographically limited that after centuries and many injections of knowledge from elsewhere that they were able to slowly bounce back, to rediscover what they lost.<p>The risk today is that we&#x27;re so interconnected, we&#x27;ve extracted so much of earth&#x27;s resources, and we&#x27;ve set ourselves on a path towards permanent environmental change, that we may not get another chance at civilization. It may be we recede back to ignorance permanently.')
