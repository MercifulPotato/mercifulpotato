If you develop native desktop software or edit video (maybe even audio) all day, those numbers are impressively optimistic.<p>I believe my mini-ITX system is rated 160W TPU. A full quad-core sustained compile would pull about 12A DC, or about 140W, but that included the monitor, voltage regulator and 40W audio amp. At idle, the same setup would pull about 2-4A, or 24-48W.')
