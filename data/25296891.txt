UBS Securities is a Swiss investment bank which owns 24.99% of UBS Securities Co LTD, a Chinese Investment Bank. The remaining 75% of UBS Securities CO LTD is owned by the Chinese government,‚Äù states the report.&quot;<p>Er, among other errors, that has ownership backwards.<p>UBS Securities, the Swiss bank, and the entity named on the State Street Capital Form D, is not owned by the Chinese government at all. It owns 24.99% of UBS Securities, a chinese investment bank, and the other owners  of that Chinese investment bank are reportedly government and government-connected &quot;private&quot; firms in China. So, even if the &quot;received $400 million from&quot; was correct (and that is also a misreading of the Form D[0]), the entity that they dealt with is a Swiss bank that owns ~25% of a Chinese bank of which the remaining 75% is arguably controlled by the Chinese government, but the Chinese bank, whoever controls it, isn&#x27;t involved in the transaction at all.<p>[0] UBS Securities was the &quot;Sales Compensation Recipient&quot; on the Form D, which means that they receieved some money (commissions, finders fees, etc., as I understand) connected with the sale of thesecurities whose offer was identified on the Form D, but it doesn&#x27;t mean that the $400 million identified as the amount offered came from (or even through) them, though it does mean they had some role in facilitating at least some of the sales.')
