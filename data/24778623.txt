Then I never got around to putting them back in.  Like, a webgl version of this could probably have a hundred times more hexagons and you wouldn&#x27;t lose any FPS.  But in SVG, it&#x27;s weird.  Biggest surprise, Chrome is finally slow at something - SVG renders - whereas FireFox blazed right through it.<p>Then a very polite Canadian kid I met on a minecraft server helped me with it, tracing the fundamental issues (thanks, BubbyMK2!).  Apparently using rectangles (svg:rect) is particularly slow in SVG, because it forces a redraw outside its clipping boundary.  But if you draw a rectangle as a path, no sweat.  Or some such.')
