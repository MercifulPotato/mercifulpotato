Not all explicit rules are good and not all implicit ones are bad, and it depend a great lot of how enforcement is made.<p>Good formalized set of rules and rule enforcement focus on conflict resolution and deescalation, assumes good faith and give benefit of the doubt. Most legal system does this, but also community rules like Wikipedia.<p>From the article I don&#x27;t see any attempt of conflict resolution between Joel Grus and Jeremy Howard. I don&#x27;t see any process by NumFOCUS towards deescalation and refocusing towards a common goal. The process seem to have been opaque, the accusation hidden, purpose unclear. The authorities (the Code of Conduct committee) not held accountable. As a result it seems that their explicit rules did not serve a purpose of creating a professional environment.')
