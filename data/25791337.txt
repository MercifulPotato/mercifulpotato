You get the cycle of poverty, no healthcare, petty crime, criminal record or prison, round and round. Many Americans who are well off fail to realize that in the end they&#x27;re paying for all of this. They&#x27;re paying for the prisons, subsidies, etc. Many I know call the poor&#x2F;homeless drains on society but do not want to do anything to help them become a positive on society. It&#x27;s spiteful and not pragmatic.')
