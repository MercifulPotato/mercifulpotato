Item(by='xyzzyz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608867617, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25533937, text='&gt; As for the cancer patient survival, in the US, 42% of patients lose their life savings within 2 years and the amount was typically around $92,000. That alone screws American cancer patients over long term, and it can cause them to die.<p>If you have insurance, and 80-90%+ of Americans do (and probably more among cancer patients, as they are usually older so they often qualify for Medicare), it’s extremely rare to spend $92k in 2 year. Even in the plans with the highest  out of pocket maximums, these are almost never  more than $10k&#x2F;year. That might drain people savings anyway, but a lot of people have very little savings.<p>I really don’t know where your data is from, but it doesn’t match the reality lived by most Americans. The US healthcare system has a lot of problems, so many that you don’t really need to make ones up.')
