Even if they take every update, the notification of an update pings the hope that there may be something useful or fun. &quot;Bug fixes and performance improvements&quot; means &quot;you need this update but there&#x27;s nothing you really care about&quot;.<p>So there are least two kinds of updates, those with user-facing features and those without. Currently both come in the same stream. We could come up with a better way of differentiating the two, including not notifying users at all when the boilerplate &quot;fixes and performance improvements&quot; comes on. Just update the app and what the user doesn&#x27;t know (hopefully) won&#x27;t hurt &#x27;em.')
