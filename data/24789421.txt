This bankrupts people who can&#x27;t pause their unprofitable campaigns. My business partner was being billed ten grand daily via a banned&#x2F;restricted account for weeks on end.<p>Why would you not just call your bank up, and get it charged back&#x2F;refunded at that point? Thus Facebook would probably &quot;ban&quot; you (like most merchants when you do a chargeback), but since you&#x27;re already restricted, who cares. At least you aren&#x27;t losing money from them.')
