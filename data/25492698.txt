Learned the hard way that you definitely want to make sure you have emerged another version of glibc first! Hardly anything works without it (can&#x27;t even auth as root)<p>Unfortunately unlike the cool cucumbers in this story, I hastily rebooted, and it took a fair while for various reasons to get hold of a boot disk and get it repaired and running again. I love Gentoo but it does take a lot of patience generally, and this kind of thing seems to happen fairly continuously (which teaches you a lot but requires that you want to learn and solve the problems yourself).')
