You aren&#x27;t going to solder stuff only by eyeballing the component packaging either.<p>&gt; On-line information? That&#x27;s another question entirely. This would be a more interesting test: can you make a basic webapp (or other type of app representative of your experience) without Internet access?<p>I would suggest that the type of information is important, rather than the medium.  It is not that solving the issue yourself is better than talking to other people.  It is a matter of ensuring the validity of the information as well as it&#x27;s suitability to the task.  That is more difficult to do without referencing language or library documentation, and I suspect that it is not being done at all by most of the people who rely upon searching the Internet.<p>While the quality of books is better (on average) than online information, one still has to be selective.  The market is flooded with books that offer shallow explanations or are simply a rehash of what dozens of other books have discussed.  Not only does the latter limit the breadth of knowledge, but the nuggets of insight offered by any given author are usually so deeply buried that they are easy to miss.  Sometimes it is more productive to scour the Internet because of that.')
