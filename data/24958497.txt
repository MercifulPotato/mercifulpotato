Even a few thousand geographically distributed full nodes is enough to offer resistance to network shut down, and there are more than a few million people that are capable of running a full node of a hypothetical Bitcoin with 1 GB sized blocks, which only requires downloading 1.67 MB&#x2F;s of transactions to keep up with validation. That&#x27;s a 1000 expansion of Bitcoin&#x27;s throughput, letting Bitcoin become the world&#x27;s most widely used currency.<p>The entire small block narrative is built on a shaky foundation that ignores the massive benefits of enabling more people to transact directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.')
