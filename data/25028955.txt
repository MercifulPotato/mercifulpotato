You’re not replacing Trump with a pure and just candidate like Sanders, but rather with another racist (if you believe Trump deserve to be labeled a racist) who’s been on the wrong side of history for the majority of his political career. The only difference is that the mainstream media has abandoned all journalistic integrity in order to protect Biden and attack Trump at all costs. They’re really no better than FoxNews at this point.')
