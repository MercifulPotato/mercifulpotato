Reaching out for philanthropy is well and good and a positive thing, but the hostility and demands runs afoul of &quot;minding your own business&quot; essentially. It is one thing if they were say polluting or being an attractor of crime would be fair enough but complaining about high paying jobs seems downright spoiled and unpleasable.
