The value-add over Amazon was always the warm atmosphere, personalized recommendations and the sense that you might discover a great book you didn&#x27;t know about while perusing the shelves.  Very hard to recreate that online, and independent shops can&#x27;t compete with Amazon&#x27;s shipping speed - so you&#x27;re left with no value-add other than the store still being there in the future.  Sad state of affairs.')
