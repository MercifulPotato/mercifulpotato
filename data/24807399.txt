Solaris at least historically did the latter.  The heavy lifting of determining which physical page you would get, and actually mapping it, was generally still deferred until a fault required it.<p>While paging out to rotational media is a tremendous latency issue, paging out to an NVMe SSD or something like Optane doesn&#x27;t seem like it is nearly as bad.  One could imagine a tiered system of paging also: first by compressing into another RAM location, but then evicting the tail of that compressed page set to SSD as required to make more room in RAM.')
