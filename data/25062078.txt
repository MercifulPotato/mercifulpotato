Even if the M1&#x27;s graphics units only used 50% as much power as an equivalently-powerful Nvidia or AMD dedicated GPU, putting enough graphics power onboard to match even a midrange GPU would immediately overwhelm the cooling abilities of the computer.<p>Apple could absolutely choose to make better cooling, but they&#x27;ve demonstrated time and time again that they&#x27;d rather just let thermal throttling happen and trust that their users will continue to buy a product that doesn&#x27;t live up to its spec sheet&#x27;s promises.<p>Any cooling that could support dedicated-GPU-level performance would require making the chassis dramatically thicker - take a look at some of the gaming laptops out there today with desktop-class GPUs, they can get be like 2 inches thick in pursuit of cooling good enough to support a full-power GPU without massive throttling.')
