There are a reasonable number of airfields in the UK and I can usually rely on there being one within a reasonable distance of where I want to go. That &quot;reasonable distance&quot; is still going to be some miles though. The ability to fly most of the way, land at an airfield and then drive the last bit makes a lot of sense.')
