Well done to author on this one. \nAs a trained teacher, I believe this is one of those soft skills (or aspects of tacit knowledge) that is notoriously difficult to teach or train someone.<p>I often say to people that the difference between an average person and an expert is that an expert knows which shortcuts&#x2F;compromises you can make that will only have a small effect on the outcome, and which shortcuts will come back and to shoot you in the foot (and thus should be avoided from the outset).  I like that the author&#x27;s concept of data intuition neatly covers this scenario.<p>One might say that the author&#x27;s definition is a negative definition, inasmuch as it is the ability to identify&#x2F;avoid mistakes, but I think an equally important component of data intuition is the (positive) ability to identify implicit strengths and insights within the data (or data processes) that is presented.<p>I believe this skill is also very closely related to the ability in identifying which paths of data&#x2F;statistical&#x2F;scientific exploration are more likely to produce results than others. And as other commenters have said, this in turn is related to the ability of &#x27;second-order thinking&#x27;. That is, connecting the dots where the there is no obvious or explicit connection.<p>As the saying goes, &quot;sophistication is subtle&quot;.')
