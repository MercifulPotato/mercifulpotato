From there, I usually look for relevant subreddits and see if they have active wikis. Generally you just need to find an &#x27;in&#x27; to where the community in question is most active (or was before it died) and links will snowball until you&#x27;ve covered most of what&#x27;s available. Either way there&#x27;s often a lot of &#x27;I am now on page 104 of 321&#x27; on a github search, itch.io list, etc. so there&#x27;s still a large amount of manual labor.<p>There&#x27;s also a bit that comes just from having varied experiences and thinking about how things are related, for example, the aforementioned ORCA has an entry [1] on Esolangs.org, so knowing that I can also add the term esolang to my keywords for searches and mix-and-match relevant keywords until I&#x27;ve covered most things.<p>Of course, the best resource is someone that&#x27;s already passionate about whatever you&#x27;re looking for. I run a chat on Telegram mostly about Modular Music [2] (VCV Rack, Eurorack, etc) but we talk about tools like ORCA, Pure Data, FoxDot, SonicPi, etc. and that&#x27;s led to finding a lot of links too.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esolangs.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Orca" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esolangs.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Orca</a> \n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;vcvrackchat" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;vcvrackchat</a>')
