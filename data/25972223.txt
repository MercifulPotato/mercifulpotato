You can disable these. Disk cleanup wizard can help here too.<p>Edge hijack has never happened to me, although a handful of links inside windows apps&#x2F;services&#x2F;docs do force edge to launch (which itself causes a confirmation to make it default, which I decline)<p>Windows is famous for backward compatibility, especially compared to Linux or MacOS, so I&#x27;m not sure what issues you&#x27;re running into there. There are some strange system dependencies that I&#x27;ve seen cause issues; cortana search powering the start menu search feature and disabling the swap file causing numerous invisible failures come to mind.<p>Faulting anti-malware is frustrating because on windows you basically have to run it, and the default one is pretty okay. Most commercial options like symantec, norton, mcafee, etc are absolutely terrible.')
