I hate to put it this way but for practical reasons it is far safer to live in China than in India. CCP also takes the pains to make sure Children are not out on the street begging. I could go out at midnight without worrying about being lynched - to me this is a more fundamental freedom than freedom of political expression. Believe it or not China does allow their authorities to be criticized. If I wrote this comment online in China, I would not actually be censored. Yes there are topics that are considered taboo. But such topics are fairly limited.')
