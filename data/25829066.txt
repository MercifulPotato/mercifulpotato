The website uses the &quot;average color across the approximately 25 image results&quot;.<p>And for that purpose this site works fantastically, and I would say it&#x27;s a pretty hilarious idea.<p>For example searching for Dolphin doesn&#x27;t return grey but instead a shade of blue, because most dolphin pictures are dolphins in water.<p>I think the website takes our expectations and instead shows us the reality. And I think it does a fantastic job.<p>What I would like to see is an option to maybe increase the number of images to average from, maybe to 50, 100, etc. I would also love to see the source released so I can this instance locally.')
