You can only slow its progression, with techniques like:<p>- Pupil dilating eye drops<p>- Wearing corrective lenses as little as possible<p>- Wearing glasses with fogged edges&#x2F;rims<p>- Reducing the time you hold objects close to your face<p>The major factor behind all of this is to reduce the over focusing of light on your retina and fovea. The more light that focuses back there, the more your eye is told to grow longer.<p>Every parent should know this and how it works. And so should your ophthalmologist, most of which are clueless.<p>You can&#x27;t, in any way, undo this growth once it&#x27;s happened. This is terrible reporting.')
