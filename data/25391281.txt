They&#x27;re saying going after almonds is scapegoating. Calorie density will tend to come up in that context because the premise is that vegans are increasing demand for almonds which is squandering water on poor nutrition. This plays on memes about vegan diets being insufficient nutritionally<p>As it turns out neither almonds nor wine are really to blame for California&#x27;s droughts. So yes, ferment some alcohol &amp; be merry')
