That sounds way more productive.<p>&gt; that tech unions shouldn&#x27;t exist at all<p>I don&#x27;t have any problem with a union existing, as long as they are not using labor laws to require people at a certain company to join that union, or require them to pay fees.<p>You can form whatever social club that you want, but the moment that you try to use the law to require me to pay your fees, or accept your contract, under penalty of losing my job, as per labor laws, then we have a problem, and I will fight your efforts to unionize.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re going to get banned or anything<p>A union shop would ban me from working at a company, if I don&#x27;t join that union, or pay their fee.  That is how it negatively impacts me.<p>&gt; they currently consist of about 100% of software engineering workplaces in the US.<p>Yep!  Anti union efforts are winning.  And as long as union advocates are attempting to creation union shops, which use labor laws in this way, I hope that anti-union efforts continue to win.<p>&gt;  There are a lot of &quot;other unions,&quot; which ones are you thinking about?<p>Yep!  And there are problems with most of the ones that you brought up.<p>Any union that takes into account seniority, and negotiated based on that, is a union that I have a problem with.<p>Any union that puts up barrier to entry into the industry, by required certain standards, or doing the things that for example the film industry does, is a union that I have a problem with.<p>The film industry union, for example, has very serious barriers to entry, that make it difficult for new actors to join certain film productions.<p>Other examples of bad unions would be things like the pilots union.  It might be fine for the piloting industry, but the problem with the pilot&#x27;s union model is that it is literally entirely based on senority.  If you leave Fedex, for example, and join Delta, then you start at the bottom, and lose all of your pay raises and benefits that are strictly determined by the union.<p>(And please don&#x27;t even try to argue with me about this, regarding piloting unions.  Both my parents work for fedex, and are in the pilot&#x27;s union.  I know how they work.)<p>This situation might be fine for the piloting industry, but I would absolutely hate it if I were defacto required to work at the same company for my entire career, in the tech industry.')
