Item(by='DougBTX', descendants=None, kids=[25300442, 25300419], score=None, time=1607072242, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25300165, text='Org mode is something that I&#x27;ve always thought I should look at, but never quite have. One thing I like to do with my notes is to keep a short &quot;todo&quot; list at the top, listed in the order that I&#x27;m planning to work on them.<p>Something like:<p><pre><code>    Todo\n    ====\n\n    - Fix Widget\n    - Extend Screen\n    - Profit\n</code></pre>\nThen if I need to re-prioritise, I re-order:<p><pre><code>    Todo\n    ====\n\n    - Profit\n    - Fix Widget\n    - Extend Screen\n</code></pre>\nand mark tasks as completed:<p><pre><code>    Todo\n    ====\n\n    + Profit\n    - Fix Widget\n    - Extend Screen\n</code></pre>\nOnce there are too many completed tasks at the top, I move them down into a &quot;Done&quot; section.<p>Is there a way to manage that in Org mode (linking tasks to further notes would be great to have) while keeping items in relative priority order without explicitly setting due dates or priority &quot;scores&quot;?')
