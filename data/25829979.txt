New Internet protocols plus secure boot chains plus legislation will make it all moot.<p>The past decade I learned to lose hope in these ideas of freedom, thanks to my friends.<p>Just like copying VHS and cassette tapes (easy) led to copying DVDs (more difficult) and HDMI (difficult).  Every tech makes it more difficult.  The same will happen with distributed systems.  More work for the users of those systems.<p>And the discussion over the past decade shows that public support will be lost too.')
