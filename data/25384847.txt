Item(by='gjulianm', descendants=None, kids=[25384936, 25384948, 25384923], score=None, time=1607688406, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25384779, text='&gt; This is just a fancy way of saying &quot;people saying things I don&#x27;t like&quot;<p>Not just &quot;I don&#x27;t like&quot;, but things that &quot;aren&#x27;t true&quot;. There&#x27;s a difference, and it&#x27;s important.<p>&gt; How so? Like GP said, you can just not use facebook and freely exchange ideas with your peers through other channels.<p>The how is that the constant exposure to lies makes people doubt everything. A lie is easy to fabricate, will create controversy, and social media will reward that controversy and show that lie to even more people. A truth usually requires more research, and given that more people agree with it it will create less controversy, less engagement and the platforms will not reward that content.<p>That&#x27;s how you end up with what you have now: people living in completely different realities because the things that spread the most are lies. You can&#x27;t have a free exchange of ideas if people don&#x27;t agree in basic facts of reality.<p>We really can&#x27;t ignore the damage that social media is doing to society by dismissing the concerns as &quot;well it&#x27;s just that people have different opinions&quot;. It&#x27;s not about the opinions, it&#x27;s about the type of content that gets rewarded now.')
