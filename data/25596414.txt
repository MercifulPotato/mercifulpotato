While people are terrible at shifting at first, they can learn to get better. Automatic shifting never improves.<p>It&#x27;s meant to be simple, but basic maintainability is a nightmare. Changing a tire requires 3 tools and about 10 steps just to pull the tire off. Thats bonkers. Pretty much eliminates any chance of roadside tire fixes.')
