The world is passing both of these by, because Apple messed up their developer relations and creative pro relations for years, all to try and push the iPad as a viable alternative to desktop computing.<p>Sketch and Nova only exist because there is the Mac user base who wants to use them.<p>At this point it doesn’t matter how pure Sketch or Nova is, the party is already over. People started leaving years ago, and there is now this operating system diversity among dev and creatives that wasn’t so brazenly there ten years ago. Not having a Windows client, and doubling down on it, seems like a really really bad idea.')
