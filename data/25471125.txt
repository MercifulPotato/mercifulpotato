Any cell that activates in that safe environment is destroyed, as it recognized one of your own antigens.<p>The other mechanism is that the immune system doesn&#x27;t react only to foreign antigens, there also needs to be some general activation of the immune system in that area for a real response.<p>The full answer is that this is really, really complex like pretty much everything involving the immune system. And auto-immune diseases indicate that the immune system doesn&#x27;t always get this right.')
