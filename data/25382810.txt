I&#x27;d really like some advice right now.<p>I&#x27;ll be starting a new job at a great company working on robotics, as an intern! It&#x27;s an area that I am really interested in working in, but never got the chance to. I&#x27;ve always worked on robotics but never in this area. The team that I will be working with has already given me a list of things that I should be well versed with before joining (in about 3 weeks) which I have no issues with, I mean sooner or later I have to learn these things.<p>But the main reason for my anxiety is this: I will be working on a very small team (3 of us in total, including me the intern), with a client. Unlike the traditional research roles that I was working in so far, this is a stark contrast. The team has already told me that the project will be fast paced and I will be expected to know the stuff that we will be working on.<p>This is my first job after working in research labs at unversity and I&#x27;m daunted by it. I am slightly anxious by nature and I feel I&#x27;m pushing against my threshold here. My main intention with this experience is to get relevant industry exposure before joining grad school (joining in the Fall 2021, already enrolled).<p>I would love some adivce on what the folks here maybe did when they were in a similar situation.<p>Thanks HN! All comments are appreciated.\n-roboticsGuy')
