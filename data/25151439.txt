And I noticed many other travellers were using it too. It was basically expected that people use Maps.me there. \nI guess it helps that it&#x27;s also integrated with booking.com data so you have a lot of hostels there if you are looking for a place to stay in new cit. However it&#x27;s a shame that it&#x27;s not actual POI data from OSM. I had situations where there were two hostels on map, one from OSM and one from booking.com. booking.com was usually wrong by couple of meters, I guess because only owner with booking.com accound could change it...<p>* Mapy.cz - I mostly dumped masp.me for this app (it has good website too <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.mapy.cz&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.mapy.cz&#x2F;</a>). This app is also using OSM data, but shows information more helpful for tourist&#x2F;biker. Bike paths are superbly displayed, hiking trails often have proper colors (I still need to check if it&#x27;s OSM tag&#x27;s data). I highly recommend it.<p>I tried OSMAnd and IMO this is really mainly for &quot;OSM enthusiasts&quot;, not for causal &quot;normal&quot; users that just want to have good map and know where to walk or bike to.')
