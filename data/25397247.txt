Its sad how this nonsense gets repeated even by people on HN.<p>His father was made money from being an engineer. With that money he bought a small stake in a mine, making it out that they were some billionair mine owners is total nonsesne. However Elon had very bad relationship with his father and his father did not want him to go to Canada&#x2F;US and refused to pay for his education there.<p>So if you want to call everybody that is not born into abject poverty &#x27;not self made&#x27; that is of course simply a expression of your (appallingly bad) politics, but its not how the rest of the world uses that phrase.<p>PayPal was merger between two companies doing the same thing.<p>Tesla was not a &#x27;growing company&#x27;, Tesla was 2 guys who had a business plan written on a piece of paper and nothing else, they were certainty not growing. Elon and JB both wanted to found a company and somebody told them that these two were also working on the same thing. So Elon agree to get together with them rather then start a separate company.<p>Elon financed Tesla basically by himself, without him Tesla would have never existed and it would certainty not be nearly what it is now. There is a reason that all 5, were officially named founders, and not just the 2 guys who came up with the name Tesla.<p>SpaceX, Boring Company, Neurolink and Zip2 were all created by Musk.')
