In Hinduism there&#x27;s some mythology around astronomical cycles that have similar spans to those mentioned in Bible. I&#x27;ve a far-out theory that Bible is actually referring to the same cycles.<p>Side track: there&#x27;s a serious argument that parts of Bible are translated pretty badly (which puts into perspective people quoting it verbatum). I&#x27;ve been told of a specific example where (excuse the paraphrasing) Eve is said to emerge from the side of Adam, as in from the interior of his torso, and it&#x27;s popularly taken to be a metaphor. Some interpret it to mean that a woman is somehow a byproduct of man, and thus lesser. Anyway, someone actually took up checking the translation and concluded that it&#x27;s not that Eve emerged from Adam&#x27;s side, but that she emerged <i>at</i> his side, as in stood by him. Going by what&#x27;s written in a super old book that&#x27;s been translated and altered many many times is, well, adventurous.')
