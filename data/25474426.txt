I&#x27;ve found that my M1 Mac Mini has completed replaced my Window desktop (an old i7, 16GB RAM, TB of SSD&#x2F;HDD, nvidia 1070).<p>I mostly use my Mac for personal projects in TypeScript, Swift, and Java, and for browsing the web. I also play video games occasionally, and I&#x27;m surprised at how good the performance is.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly fast, and at $700 it&#x27;s a steal.
