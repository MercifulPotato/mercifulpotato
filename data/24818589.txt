Temporal is not container orchestration and is not an infrastructure management tool. In most cases users run Temporal on top of Kubernetes.<p>Temporal provides a distributed experience which is decoupled from the reliability of any specific piece of hardware. We provide a programming model for writing distributed applications without needing to code around all points of failure. We still are working on what to call the tech exactly, it’s not something that is widely known by any name today. It’s sort of like virtualized distributed computing.')
