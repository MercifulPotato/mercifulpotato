I would get one every time I heard a catchy word.  I&#x27;ve been letting some of them expire, but I did find a good use for about a dozen of them.  I pointed them to fastmail for family members to use in combination with aliases so that when a company sells their email address or gets owned, they just simply delete the alias.  Some of them still come in handy for little projects now and again, but I will probably whittle the list down to a dozen that I hold on to.  This is of course just my preference.  People should do whatever works for them and suits their needs or wants.  If you are going to let a domain expire, check its value first.')
