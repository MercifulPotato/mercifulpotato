Hereâ€™s what it says&quot;<p>The paper <i>DID NOT</i> force her out of Google. Her subsequent behaviour - submitting without approval, rant, ultimatum, and resignation - did. And she wasn&#x27;t &quot;forced out&quot;: she resigned of her own volition. She could have chosen to make improvements to the paper based on the feedback she was given, resubmit it for approval, and then get on with her life, but she went the other way.<p>The headline from the last discussion on Timnit&#x27;s exit[0] was awful as well: &quot;The withering email that got an ethical AI researcher fired at Google&quot;. So bad in fact that it was changed on HN to more accurately reflect what actually happened: &quot;AI researcher Timnit Gebru resigns from Google&quot; (much more neutral and factual in tone).<p>Seriously, what happened to journalistic standards and integrity? Why are the actual events being so forcefully twisted to fit a particular narrative? No wonder the general population struggle to figure out what&#x27;s true and what&#x27;s not, and fall victim to all kinds of nonsense, BS theories, and conspiracies.<p>I wish I had a good idea on how to change this behaviour by journalists and publications.<p>(Clearly this is a problem that goes far beyond Timnit&#x27;s story.)<p><i>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25292386" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25292386</a></i>')
