It can be &quot;you claim facts that are demonstrably false&quot;, &quot;you claim facts that I cannot demonstrate are false, but I have strong doubts and you do not provide sources&quot;, &quot;you cite correct facts but your interpretation of them is demonstrably wrong&quot;, &quot;you cite correct facts but I interpret them differently&quot;, etc. And those are just factual disagreements, without getting into &quot;you&#x27;re making a strawman argument&quot;, etc. Thinks probably shouldn&#x27;t be <i>this</i> fine-grained, but I hope you get the idea that there is reasonable room for more helpful feedback than &quot;I disagree&quot;.')
