His theory of consciousness looks at these quantum microtubules that are found in proteins ... so what he&#x27;s saying is that maybe there is some sort of computational power within &quot;wet brains&quot;, in how those brains relate to the broader environment that is difficult to precisely characterize. Silicon AI is fundamentally incapable of tapping in to these forces due to the lack of such a connection.<p>The point is that the computational power of the brain may be non-local and non-constrained to the physical dimensions or neural capacity of the brain.')
