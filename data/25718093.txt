You definitely don’t see the really ambitious stuff, like SpaceX or OpenAI and stuff like that. I suspect that if you looked at the whole distribution it would be shifted towards “low risk &#x2F; low reward”. That can be said for most of the world though, so I admit it’s not a very strong argument.')
