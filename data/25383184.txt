Inequality shouldn&#x27;t matter if people&#x27;s purchasing power and quality of life has improved significantly regardless. Life expectancy in the US has improved dramatically over time (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;1040079&#x2F;life-expectancy-united-states-all-time&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;1040079&#x2F;life-expectancy-...</a>). The US also has one of the highest GDP PPP per capita in the world despite being one of the largest by population (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)...</a>). And worldwide, extreme poverty has also gone down significantly over time (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fee.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;extreme-poverty-rates-plummet-under-capitalism&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fee.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;extreme-poverty-rates-plummet-under...</a>).<p>The tendency of younger generations to demonize America&#x27;s economic systems and conditions really seems to be the result of widespread envy as well as ignorance to how poorly alternative systems function. Perhaps this is because socialist&#x2F;Marxist nations were once the subject of recent history, but now are turning into forgotten ancient history. My feeling is that this envious focus on inequality is also a symptom of the relative luxury of this time period. A populace whose needs are met can afford to attend college for years, getting degrees that aren&#x27;t valuable, then argue that they are victims, and then spend excessive time on manufactured outrage in a life that is remarkably easy.<p>Real poverty is incredibly rare in America. Anyone who has traveled to developing countries knows this. We have a system that innovates remarkably well and has lifted quality of life worldwide. This focus on relative inequality does not make sense.')
