Heating, cooling, filtering, cycling outdoor air... none of it is as straightforward as you&#x27;d hope. I noticed a substantial improvement in my health when I started putting HEPA air filters all over my house, and another jump when I moved away from a major road. Now COVID-19&#x27;s airborne spread has bumped this issue from annoyance to life and death.<p>It seems like this is an area where IoT should really deliver the goods. I should be able to cheaply add networked sensors, fans, filters, and vents to my home to automatically monitor air quality and temperature, then take appropriate action. Sadly, we&#x27;re basically stuck with smart thermostats that spy on you and deliver little benefit over a local solution.<p>I had a lot of hope for IoT air conditioning vents, but those products never seemed to materialize. Indoor air quality monitors are expensive and inaccurate. Nobody is offering me a real-time fluid dynamics model of the heat and pollutant situation in my home, let alone responding to it appropriately.<p>Amazing how hard it is to create reliable, computable models of the world...')
