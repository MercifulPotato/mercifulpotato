Update the class &#x2F; structs, generate a migration and move on. Without the ORM you write the migration yourself, you have to find and update all the queries and if you’re centralizing all your query building then you’re just using your own ORM-light without the battle hardened trials of other users using something open source and popular.<p>I insisted we use sql alchemy and alembic in our latest Go project — and I’m eyeballing Buffalo’s Soda and Fizz as a replacement.<p>Its generally just nerdcore navel gazing to insist on raw sql across a project in my opinion. Especially web apps &#x2F; SaaS where you churn tables a lot. Simple migrations from simple models is what I love about Django and Flask&#x2F;Fast API with SQL Alchemy.')
