I didn&#x27;t get that message. Not that I really care about that for a media server, but it&#x27;s still strange that I didn&#x27;t realize that.<p>I think that the main problem with Plex (some of those are the same as Emby) are:<p>* They are trying to add too many features (Plex Arcade? really?) while other features are not stable - chromecast queuing was working then not working then working again with every other release. In the end it stopped working for a while, and I quit using Plex. I just need something to have my collection organized, with a bit of metadata handling and a &quot;watched&#x2F;not watched&quot; flag. Plex (and Emby) are trying to do an incredible amount of work on top of that.<p>* The price for the &quot;deluxe&quot; version is too steep for a self hosted solution. Netflix Standard is EUR 144&#x2F;year, Plex is 40 EUR&#x2F;year (about the same as Emby, btw). And I need to provide hardware, electricity, and content - it&#x27;s just not competitive. I&#x27;d be happy to pay something between 10 and 20 EUR per year for a properly working software of that kind.')
