Item(by='mixedCase', descendants=None, kids=[25609856], score=None, time=1609551325, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25609184, text='&gt; and i can&#x27;t think of a way to fix anything important with faster garbage collection or better type systems<p>I can, I am very hopeful better type systems will help heal the absolutely dreadful state of software robustness.<p>Better types (and by extension, better type systems) help eliminate many costly tests, improves knowledge transfer from senior engineers to junior engineers, makes refactoring and adapting to changing requirements a much less error-prone process where the computer can guide you, provides a more rigid way of breaking down problems into chunks instead of a procedural approach where good boundaries are harder to intuitively determine.<p>While education is what enables people to write better code with them, we need better type systems and languages that make this process easier for the average programmer to learn and use. Already languages like TypeScript, Kotlin and Swift are slowly getting many people to take a gander over the brick wall by exposing them to constructs like sum types and specific patterns like optionals and either&#x2F;result types, that should fuel a little bit of hope at least!<p>EDIT: That&#x27;s some visceral reaction. Would be nice to see some disagreement stated in text, or if any particular point needs further explaining, or to see if just hope of things improving is what&#x27;s angering people.')
