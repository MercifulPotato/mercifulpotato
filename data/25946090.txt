Imagine there is 1 share, owned by A. He lends it to B. B now (short) sells it to C. Now from C&#x27;s point of view, he owns a share. So he lends it to someone. That person then short sells it.<p>So you have 1 share, that&#x27;s shorted twice. But it&#x27;s impossible for A and C to both have their loan repaid, because there&#x27;s only 1 physical share.')
