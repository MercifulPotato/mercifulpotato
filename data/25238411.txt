Instead of praising her for at least trying the task, i would say &quot;almost&quot; and soon I saw her saying this to herself, and it seemed to encourage her to try again until she succeeded.<p>I&#x27;m not a parent so I have no idea if this is good or not.<p>But it strikes me that there is more to giving feedback than just quantity of it, or positive&#x2F;negative. &quot;Almost&quot; introduces another dimension, and potentially activates a different set of motivating emotions as well.')
