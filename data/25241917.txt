I know of one masters and one PhD student working in this domain, and it&#x27;s so hard to achieve human-quality spatial layouts.<p>However, that is just one part of building design, and some of the other constraints of architecture (to use your language) lend themselves more to ML&#x2F;AI solutions, and I&#x27;m seeing crazy progress in domains like structural or energy optimization. I&#x27;m pretty excited by the potential in this space, personally.')
