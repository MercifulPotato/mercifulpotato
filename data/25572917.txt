I get tired when I need to focus too much on lipreading and actually following the conversation. If there is nothing worth listening to I don&#x27;t get tired.<p>I&#x27;m used&#x2F;adapted to go without them, so basically forcing myself to &quot;re-adjust&quot; my brain by wearing them all the time would make my hearing actually far worse than it feels. It&#x27;s really weird, each doctor who examined my hearing was amazed how well I actually <i>hear</i> without any aids with my condition. So, I was good with wearing aids only when I really needed them, but <i>with teleconferencing it doesn&#x27;t work anymore and would be worse if I was used to wearing aids</i>.')
