Freedom can also be thought of as sovereignty.<p>Seems like a pretty one-sided American cowboy version of freedom.<p>More accurate take I think is that privacy is often a tool of the powerful stopping collective action of citizens. Finance, taxes, and payment compensation are a pretty trivial example. The rich and powerful love their financial privacy, ordinary citizens gain little from it. Wage earners who benefit from their status love that they don&#x27;t have to share their income with coworkers who may be discriminated against.<p>I think the opposite is true. It&#x27;s not privacy but transparency that is required if groups are supposed to be able to take action against the powerful.')
