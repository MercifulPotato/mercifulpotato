Item(by='philsnow', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609959682, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25659601, text='&quot;paste with formatting&quot; by default is a mistake.  the thing you&#x27;re pasting from and the thing you&#x27;re pasting to inevitably have different ideas about what formatting is relevant &#x2F; possible in the given textareas you&#x27;re copying from &#x2F; pasting to.  it&#x27;s almost always better to just paste without formatting and then fix formatting (so, the default should have been flipped, but the ship has sailed).<p>I played around with using hammerspoon to send cmd-shift-v whenever I typed cmd-v but I really needed to make it change depending on which app I was pasting into and that was just past my annoyance threshold.')
