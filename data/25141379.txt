I got PHPStorm when I started working at Automattic. I&#x27;d been developing in PHP for several years at that point, and didn&#x27;t see the point in an IDE. But my previous job had been a low-end local company.<p>At Automattic, the expectations were so much higher. They&#x27;d give me a 3000+ line, 20+ file codebase to review, for example. There was plenty of time to complete the task, but with so much code to deal with I needed to very quickly develop some skills and tools to keep it all straight.<p>I learned a lot of keyboard shortcuts for PHPStorm for quickly noting filenames and line numbers in my review sheet, and wrote several macros for quickly writing out repetitive text. These things were essential because it was so easy to get lost or distracted even by flipping between my notes and the code. I could end up going through the same file 4 times if I wasn&#x27;t careful (on a first pass, that is - it was normal to take several passes through a code base).')
