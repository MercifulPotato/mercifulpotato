I&#x27;ve had so many websites encourage me to sign up -- appealing to my fear that someone, somewhere, might write a blog post and I wouldn&#x27;t know it right away.<p>I couldn&#x27;t find any way to turn off all notifications on my MacBook, but I noticed you can set a &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; time.
