This is simply because houses are typically wired with outlets for 10A-16A everywhere, regardless of grid voltage.<p>That ofc makes electric kettles much less useful in countries with 110V grid. It also keeps stovetop kettles relevant in these counties, since stoves don&#x27;t suffer power limitations.')
