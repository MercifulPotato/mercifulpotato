I&#x27;m talking about companies ranging from office supplies to coffee makers. Hell, even beer producers quickly entered the hand sanitizer market. Consequently prices dropped drastically and not only is there no shortage of protective equipment but it&#x27;s also affordable.</i><p>Interesting, because IIRC there were global shortages of both hand sanitizer and N95 masks up to at least May. There were a lot of scammy products sold in between March and May, though. The problem with price gouging in large-scale emergencies is that companies just can&#x27;t retool <i>that</i> quickly, especially when - as is the case with both hand sanitizer and N95 respirators - a complex supply chain is involved. That takes months, and through those months, you&#x27;re dealing with extremely inefficient distribution of goods - from the humanitarian&#x2F;life saving point of view.<p>Free market does what it does. For instance, price the poorest out. A well-known example of the free market at work was in the US, when some people drove a van around towns and villages in their state and bought out all hand sanitizer to resell it on-line (with significant markup), thus depriving less wealthy communities of access to hand sanitizer.')
