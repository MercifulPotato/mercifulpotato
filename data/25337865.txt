Only the comment creator or a repository maintainer can edit a markdown checklist created the way you suggest. You may want to open a checklist up to an entire team.<p>2. The markdown checklist doesn&#x27;t block a PR the way that a check does. This is because a manual markdown checklist is not canonical for a pull request. The checklists here are canonical (at least for the Bugout app). This is important if merging the PR makes a production change.<p>Please don&#x27;t mistake me, not trying to push the app down your throat. I respect that this may not bring enough value to justify an app installation with access to your repos. Just want to explore your objections.')
