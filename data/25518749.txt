Charts are things like bar and pie visualisations. Graphs are networks of connections, like family trees or sequence diagrams.<p>If you want to visualise graphs, I have had good experiences using d3-graphviz, which can consume GraphViz DOT files - DOT is an excellent and well supported DSL for this job.<p>DOT lets you specify nodes and their edges quite concisely, apply positioning and ranking hints, and the d3 visualiser does a great job usually of laying out the nodes with minimal path crossover. You can then hook into the d3 selections to render however you please, generally in SVG.<p>A nice thing about having an SVG render is that it&#x27;s very easy to attach events, and inline SVGs can be styled with CSS. So you could plot e.g. a network of CI tasks and set up a click to take you to a job summary, just like the CircleCI UI. Or visualise step functions, sagas or state machines in similar wise.<p>There is an actual WASM build of GraphViz compiled from C++ (you can find it on NPM) but the bundle is enormous - over a megabyte of data.<p>I suspect, however, that what you are really looking for is a charting library. In that case my suggestion is to purchase a license for HiCharts or another commercial product, rather than assemble something yourself through D3.')
