It&#x27;s poorly thought-out because Go is designed by Google, who uses Bazel for dependency management. GOPATH is only there because you can&#x27;t expect everyone to adopt Bazel in order to adopt Go, so some half-assed solution gets designed to get the language out the door.<p>In simpler terms, the people who designed the language don&#x27;t use GOPATH at all. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s terrible.')
