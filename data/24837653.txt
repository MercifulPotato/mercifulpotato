If you&#x27;re residing in Tulsa and still only just surviving, you&#x27;re not earning a living wage.<p>Then there&#x27;s the fact that besides food and rent pretty much everything we buy nowadays is nationally priced - amazon doesn&#x27;t give you a discount for moving to a low cost of living area; and you don&#x27;t get to pay lower taxes because cost of living is higher.<p>But beyond all this, the disparities arise almost exclusively because of a few outliers - maybe 5% of people in the country can live comfortably on less than $20k&#x2F;yr and less than 10% require substantially more; the vast majority of Americans are close to the average.')
