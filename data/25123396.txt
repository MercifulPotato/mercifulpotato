Taking the traditional example of hosts-blocking the Adobe activation servers, what was stopping them from just querying 1.1.1.1 from the app? Or even falling back on a hard-coded IP?   \nEspecially with IPv6, bypassing DNS-based blocks is rather trivial - the main reson we don&#x27;t see it all that much is that companies simply don&#x27;t care to do it. Users of PiHole and similar are usually the kinds of users who will figure out a way to block whatever they want one way or another, so there&#x27;s no use in trying to stop them. Until we get hardware-enforced app signing (big middle finger to Apple here) we can block anything, regardless of DoH.')
