So, they put up an email to B. But, later B forgets the task and also A forgets to follow-up with B. When something goes wrong, suddenly A remembers that they had a task due on B. This leads to a bad situation.<p>This problem mainly happens across the teams rather than within the same team.<p>Do you also face this problem? What tools&#x2F;mechanisms&#x2F;SOPs do you use for this?<p>This is my first time posting on Hacker News. Please pardon me for any mistakes :)')
