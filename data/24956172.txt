Good enough for my work.\nYour posts are very political stuff too. If you want to be strictly technical just skip all the meta&#x2F;drama and the boogeyman talk. In the post and in the comment section. It doesn&#x27;t put you in a good light even if your statements turn out to be true.\nYour projects look very interesting. A suggestion for your next blog post would be talk about what you want to achieve, your real intentions, and how you plan to do that. If it&#x27;s just a showcase make that clear. It&#x27;s unfortunate that you don&#x27;t want to work with what they have now but I hope you can find a compromise. It would be great if your contributions could make Wayland even better.')
