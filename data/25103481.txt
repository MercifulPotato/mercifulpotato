Item(by='Avalaxy', descendants=0, kids=None, score=4, time=1605465326, title='Ask HN: Best way to annotate videos for ML?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I have a large amount of medical data in the shape of videos, where the plan is to use it for automated detection and classification of certain conditions. There are several hundred videos and each video has several hundred frames that contain things that need to be labelled.<p>My question is: what is the best way to go about this? I tried CVAT, but it didn&#x27;t seem very user friendly and it can&#x27;t deal with my file sizes (around 2GB per video). I now tried VoTT from Microsoft which is impressive when it comes to usability and user interface, but it can&#x27;t seem to do box interpolation, so you have have to label every single individual frame manually.<p>It&#x27;s just so much work to label it all, and it&#x27;s going to cost me months in the current way. Is there any better way to do it?')
