Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=[25199681], score=None, time=1606230820, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25198616, text='&gt; I understand what you&#x27;re saying, but I think there&#x27;s some &quot;both sides&quot;-ism at play here.<p>Why do these conversations &quot;always&quot; go like this, <i>even on a site as rational as HN</i>?  If we can&#x27;t even discuss these very real issues here without rhetoric, how do we expect politicians and the masses (and here I include literal deniers) to do so?  Because that <i>is</i> what we are asking of them, is it not?  To stop being stupid (which they are doing, to a very large degree), and to start being rational?<p>Also:  why is an article as reasonable as this [flagged] (and therefore <i>removed from the public discourse</i> here)?  We ask others to stop living in an information bubble, yet are we willing to do so ourselves?<p>Might this flagging (of which this is but one of <i>who knows how many instances</i> - HN users shall not know such things) hint at some underlying human characteristic that is a root cause of why we cannot have nice things?  Obviously speculative, but it seems reasonable to me.')
