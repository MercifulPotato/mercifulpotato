How an open file behaves when it is deleted has very little to do with the programming language. And it does not matter if that language is Python, Rust or C++. These ecosystems interact with the underlying OS and report back what the OS layer tells them.<p>I absolutely understand some of the niceness about Rust preventing programmers from shooting themselves in the foot(it is still possible nonetheless), but sometimes it feels people just want to complain about C++ for the sake of complaining.')
