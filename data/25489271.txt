It took awhile, as I balanced price with features. You&#x27;d be shock how many otherwise decently config&#x27;ed offerings lacked a key and basic feature (e.g., backlit KB), or was deficient in some key way (e.g., mid-priced models with only 8 GB RAM soldered, no ability to upgrade).<p>I agree. Some might not need backlit or more than 8 GB but if they do that machine - to them - becomes useless. Lack of sufficient RAM will cuts years off the usefulness of a laptop.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how such small thinking helps the brand, loyality, etc. Do these companies not understand?')
