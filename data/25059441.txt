Like the author, I too have a pretty good sense for the political affiliation that this sort of clothing represents (especially on a police officer) but it&#x27;s not explicitly endorsing a political party and seems to only include the text of an oath made by all U.S. soldiers.<p>It seems similar to someone wearing clothing that contained text of the Pledge of Allegiance, the Constitution, or the Declaration of Independence. Yes, we know the right wing loves this stuff but I really don&#x27;t think it rises to the level of &#x27;electioneering&#x27;.<p>In fact, the guy was probably thinking &#x27;Here&#x27;s another lefty that hates the United States and the military&#x27;. It really does seem like there was some (unconscious?) bias at play here.')
