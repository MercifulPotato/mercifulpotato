Beckwourth or Walker passes are lower and less steep, but both add a lot of distance to connect to the I-80&#x2F;Humboldt River corridor though which seems like the only sane route across Nevada.<p>Of course there are options to go around both the Sierras and the state of Nevada, Route 66 and up the San Joaquin valley being one example.')
