It&#x27;s not hard to convince a company that sells power plant control software that anyone who reads utilitydive.com is a good candidate for their ad.<p>But it&#x27;s gonna be tough for sites that are &quot;general interest&quot; or even very specific but on a topic that just doesn&#x27;t have big ad budgets behind it.
