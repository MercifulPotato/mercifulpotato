Item(by='Jtsummers', descendants=None, kids=[24825216], score=None, time=1603063581, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24821856, text='If you have a cyclic dependency in your project then you more likely have a DAG that’s not sufficiently broken down. That is if A and B seem to depend on each other you have some sub tasks in each that need to be pulled out. If this still fails to break the apparent cycle, you’ve got a problem.<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that there&#x27;s a distinction between a system having cyclic dependencies (I need A &amp; B working because they communicate with each other), and the task ordering. During development you can end up with a partially correct system. If A sends to B, and B sends to A but I only have one person working on both parts, then it&#x27;s possible I&#x27;ll end up in a state where A sends to B but not the reverse. That&#x27;s <i>fine</i> during development. Yes, the system is &quot;wrong&quot; per the design or spec. But it&#x27;s a partial system (like a half-built bridge). Your <i>tasks</i> will appear to have a cycle, but in reality you will break it by selecting one portion to complete first so in the end it remains (based on the chosen path) a DAG.')
