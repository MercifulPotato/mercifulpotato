As a benchmark, life expectancy in Germany is about 81 years, while Sweden is a bit over 82. In Minnesota, it’s 80.9, which isn’t far off. New York is over 81, Massachusetts is 80.5. Even less wealthy states like Arizona, North Dakota, and Utah are at 79.9.<p>It’s also interesting to break this down by ethnicity. Asians in the US are longer lived than people in rich Asian countries like Japan. Asians in California and New York have life expectancies over 87, even though they have slightly higher than average rates of lacking health insurance.')
