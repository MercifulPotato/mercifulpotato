Same with peripherals (do you really stare at your keyboard while typing? If so, then I have bad news).\nWalls and interior set the tone of room, and while you may not to look at it directly, it is in your vision at all times and affects your mood and behaviour.<p>However RGB lights on hardware is a lame attempt to force consumers into redundant expenses. After spending solid amount of time choosing parts and building your PC, installing and setting up OS, you have to make another choice regarding color of lightning. You would be endlessly changing it, until you feel satisfied for a couple of days&#x2F;weeks, or even worse, thinking that is not enough and now the entire room should glow in a color matching currently opened browser tab. I prefer not to have this choice in first place.<p>Somewhat related to this, friend of mine had been bothering me for a whole month to help him settle on a tattoo sketch.
