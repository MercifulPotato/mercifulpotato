It&#x27;s a bit of an inconvenience when editing though.  For example, re-ordering lines in a function &#x2F; adding a new line to the end.    That leaves a full stop at the end of an intermediate line and&#x2F;or a semi-colon at the end.  Compiling&#x2F;running that without fixing (assuming you didn&#x27;t spot it) can lead to cryptic compiler errors.<p>I find this hits me a surprisingly large number of times.  Maybe it&#x27;s just the way I write code. But it is an annoyance (for me anyway).<p>To be fair, any decent editor&#x2F;IDE will highlight the error.  None that I&#x27;m aware of has an auto-correct though.<p>It&#x27;s a minor annoyance in the great scheme of things.  Erlang remains one of my favourite languages.  Writing REST services as OTP applications on top of Cowboy* is a very rewarding experience and generates rock-solid, highly scalable, production-quality binaries.<p>*Webmachine was even better though sadly now not actively maintained.')
