But your examples don&#x27;t make much sense. You don&#x27;t stay in a bad marriage so that holidays would be easier.<p>&gt; One of the greatest indicators of success in a child, in the future who you depend on, is a stable two-parent household.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree. But you again miss the point. The reason people get divorce is because there&#x27;s no stable household. Two-parent household doesn&#x27;t automatically mean stable household.')
