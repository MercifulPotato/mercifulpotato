Two layers of pass-through means you have two abstractions talking to each other, which is not good. I&#x27;m removing some of these from our code right now.<p>The hard thing to remember about code is, nobody gives a shit about your code when everything is working. Nobody is poring over it basking in your magnificence.<p>If they&#x27;re looking at your code, it&#x27;s because something is wrong. So they&#x27;re looking for wrong things, <i>and they don&#x27;t know where the wrong thing is</i>. So they&#x27;re looking at every code smell they see along the way doing a probability calculation. Your ornate clever code causes them to dump important state, such as &quot;why am I looking at this code in the first place?&quot;.<p>In the case of argument passing, we&#x27;re all familiar with argument transposition. I have to check you haven&#x27;t done it. If you rename variables, I have to watch for that too. If you have a stack of empty methods just ferrying arguments around, you&#x27;ve multiplied the surface area I have to think about.')
