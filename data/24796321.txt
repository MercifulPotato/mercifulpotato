What I&#x27;m struggling with is, in the face of all the evidence in this thread and others, why. This stuff is easy. It&#x27;s well documented. There are YouTube videos literally (like, literally literally) walking through every step of the process. The fact that you specifically do not know how to do it right now doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t be done, or even that it&#x27;s hard. The fact that your argument is &quot;who knows about...&quot; and not a specific example is a big clue that you might be baselessly worried about the sky falling. You claim that users are walled off, yet you haven&#x27;t produced a single example of that being true.<p>The fact that the cost to exploit end user devices in an irreversible, hard to detect way has been raised is a real benefit to the user. The fact that mitm of banking apps is very difficult without protracted user interaction is a real benefit to the user. There are, conservatively, hundreds of millions of users having their lives made better by security people fighting for them every day to make their devices safer to use in a hostile world.<p>Do you also object to TLS?
