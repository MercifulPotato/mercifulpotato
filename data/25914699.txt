Item(by='pmiller2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611661428, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25913660, text='I&#x27;m looking around at all my home &quot;machinery,&quot; and I don&#x27;t see anything essential that <i>is</i> computer controlled.  I have an ordinary gas furnace heating it; a plain old gas stove for cooking; a refrigerator that&#x27;s got a plain analog temperature control; a boring, mechanical toilet based on technology that&#x27;s hundreds of years old; and simple, mechanical valves that control the flow of water through my pipes.<p>The things I see that <i>are</i> computer controlled are luxury items, at best: TV, camera equipment, security camera, microwave, blender, laptops, tablet, NAS server, air purifier.  This does leave out my car, but I don&#x27;t expect cars are going to be playing a big part in any realistic post-apocalyptic future, anyway.<p>Most of that stuff could also be replaced by lower tech versions without much loss of functionality: analog TV, film camera, mechanical blender.  I think even the microwave could be replaced by a lower tech version of itself without much loss of functionality.  You could even have an actual, wireless remote for the TV.<p>I would miss my DSLR, laptops, tablet, and air purifiers, but I&#x27;d gladly give them all up if it would actually be a meaningful thing to do.  As it is, getting rid of all the DSLRs and laptops in the world isn&#x27;t going to save us.  Very few individuals in this world have any real power to do anything about the most likely collapse scenario (climate change), and most of those people have a vested interest in <i>not</i> doing anything to help (American energy company CEOs).<p>Edit: a word')
