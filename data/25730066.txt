It gets various verifiable facts entirely wrong. For example, it claims &quot;senators [] would break laws governing U.S. elections&quot;, presumably referring to objecting to results. But not only are there no laws against this, moreover there have been objections for every single presidential election this century!<p>Snopes also claims that this vote is &quot;ceremonial&quot;, yet it was used in the aftermath of the civil war to disenfranchise every southern state which sent electors; that doesn&#x27;t sound very &quot;ceremonial&quot; to me.<p>Arguably both of these issues are immaterial to the rating, but then why include them at all? And why trust a fact checker who is demonstrably spreading misinformation themselves, however immaterial it may be?')
