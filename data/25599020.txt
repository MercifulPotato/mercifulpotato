My house is on a street that has been a popular thoroughfare for cyclists, for many years. The simple reason is that it connects A and B while avoiding busy roads. My breakfast table (and now my standing desk for working from home) look out over the street and I can watch the bikes go by all day. And I love bikes, so I notice every bike and its rider.<p>Judging from gear, attire, speed, etc., my impression is that the vast majority of riders are what you would call &quot;casual&quot; and not &quot;sport&quot; riders. Sometimes a sportive rider goes by, but it&#x27;s not the majority.<p>I know a lot of cyclists, including myself. Most cyclists recognize the difference between casual &#x2F; utilitarian and sportive cycling. Many do both.<p>I believe that the stupid American who doesn&#x27;t grasp cycling is a myth of the past, if it was ever anything but mythical. The most popular bikes sold in the US today have no relation to any category of competitive cycling: Hybrids, cruisers, and low end mountain bikes purchased for riding on pavement.<p>We&#x27;re adapting to different circumstances. Now, with that said, a peculiarity of Americans is that we don&#x27;t obey traditionalist rules about the separation of work and pleasure. Thus, a person might choose a &quot;fun&quot; bike for riding to work. I&#x27;ve been guilty of such a transgression. But I also own and use a bike that would not seem particularly out of place in Amsterdam.')
