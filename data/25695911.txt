Care to elaborate on how you made it? I like how the colormap acts as an indicator of where each little square ends up, but I wonder why you chose a constant color along the left and right sides of the initial big square? I likely would have gone with a black&#x2F;red&#x2F;blue&#x2F;magenta square instead.')
