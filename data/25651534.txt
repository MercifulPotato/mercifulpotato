Neural nets are actually pretty simple at their core; seemingly too simple to work as well as they do.<p>It&#x27;s entirely possible to learn this stuff to near state-of-the-art level with a year or two of self-directed study outside of work. All the research is published open access, the software is open source, there are many high quality datasets available, hardware access is simple and free through Colab, and there are dozens of online courses and lectures at every level from beginner all the way to the cutting edge, again all free.')
