And a number of those bugs you&#x27;re concerned about are rooted in content too, not lower level engine bugs.<p>I&#x27;ve worked about half of my career in the game industry. I&#x27;ve practiced TDD and written automated tests (and frameworks) for desktop, web and mobile apps. Some of those have been in the medical industry where the testing is crucial. I say this to make it clear that I&#x27;m familiar with solid software engineering practices.<p>With that in mind, games are the hardest software I&#x27;ve encountered for writing automated tests. It&#x27;s just notoriously difficult to do in an effective manner. It&#x27;s not impossible, but it&#x27;s incredibly difficult.')
