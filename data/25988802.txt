Even when you click through to one of the Bloomberg stories [2] and read past the first few paragraphs, they point out that the market position on silver is net-long and the market cap for silver is significantly higher than GME, meaning retail would have a much harder time moving the needle to produce the same type of short-squeeze as seen in GME.<p>[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2021-01-31&#x2F;silver-spikes-at-the-week-s-open-as-reddit-hordes-pile-in-again?srnd=premium')
