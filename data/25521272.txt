As a developer you&#x27;ll find yourself constantly hitting a wall trying to get wordpress to do what you want instead of wordpress working for you.<p>You could learn Flask, which is very simple but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend learning React&#x2F;Vue just yet, rendering the HTML on the backend as opposed to using a JS framework will make your life a lot easier, specially if you are not familiar with browsers and the problems that JS frameworks are trying to solve.<p>As for design, you can copy&#x2F;paste code from something like bootstrap&#x2F;bulma&#x2F;foundation to create a decently looking UI wihout having to learn a lot of HTML&#x2F;CSS.<p>For the DB, just use whatever you use before on python and at the end of the day you&#x27;ll pretty much end up with an HTML template, and just pass a dict to fill it with whatever data you need, totally decoupled from where that data is coming from, whether it&#x27;s an API or a DB or whatever else.<p>Good luck!')
