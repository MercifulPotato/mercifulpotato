They worked it backwards and found the backdoor.<p>It would be interesting to know how many &quot;softer&quot; targets the attacker went after and were completely undetected.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that FireEye didn&#x27;t find the backdoor until after it had been exploited. Nobody can vet modern software. The complexity is too high, let alone accounting for the ridiculous update &quot;velocity&quot; that&#x27;s coming out of most commercial software today.<p>Just getting software &quot;manufacturers&quot; to itemize and document the normal communication mechanisms used by their software, so that threat hunters aren&#x27;t reverse engineering communications protocols, would go a long way. If SolarWinds had provided a list of domains their software needed to communicate with that would have gone a long way to stopping this kind of attack. (I can&#x27;t be the only person who demands vendors provide this info, and who puts third-party software behind MiTM proxies and hard-assed ACLs.)')
