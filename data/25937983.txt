You can, and should, make your state hierarchical - reachable from top-level should not mean reachable from anywhere, you can have (non-toplevel) parts of your program that only access parts of your state. Unfortunately OO is uniquely bad at this, because objects are encouraged to have hidden coupling.<p>&gt; But if I&#x27;m writing an MMO server my GoldCoin class doesn&#x27;t need to know about the client&#x27;s connection state.<p>But you have no way of knowing or enforcing that. &quot;You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle&quot; - your GoldCoin might contain a (&quot;encapsulated&quot; i.e. hidden) reference to another class that has a reference to another class and so on, and so eventually it does depend on the client&#x27;s connection state.<p>&gt; Have you actually written or worked with OO code before?<p>Yes, for many years, which is why I&#x27;ve become an advocate of FP style instead.')
