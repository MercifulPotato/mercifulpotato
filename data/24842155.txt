I don&#x27;t own a Samsung phone, but I think that would indicate that it isn&#x27;t actually the default home screen (though I can&#x27;t quite make out whether there is an unhighlighted circle to the left), but a second home screen. And, while the Google widget <i>would</i> be removable there on most Android phones, it wouldn&#x27;t be there by default in the first place.')
