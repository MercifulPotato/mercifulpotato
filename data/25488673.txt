It&#x27;s a matter of user interface and ecosystem. They don&#x27;t care about the merits of the technology underneath, it&#x27;s truly not a concern for them, what they want is to be able to load up the Yoast SEO plugin and check their copywriters work, or have their in house guy make popups with whatever popup maker they had last time.<p>I think that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so hard to kill it off.')
