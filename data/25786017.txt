Seemingly excusing poor people&#x27;s unsafe behavior because they lack the wealth needed to do it better. However, lots of things are correlated with wealth but not caused by it. Such an explanation could be that the same tendency to take care of things in your life which is helpful for becoming wealthy also causes greater care for personal health or more careful following of social norms.')
