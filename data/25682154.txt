So your check of $100 out of your checking account gets split into 3 different places, e.g. expense accounts.<p>I&#x27;m aware of that, which is what I meant: If you do it this way, then you can&#x27;t do envelope budgeting using subaccounts the way the original commenter said (and I agree with you that you should not do it this way).<p>Both the methods you propose involve significant work on my part, which to me means &quot;Gnucash doesn&#x27;t support it.&quot; For the first method:<p>&gt;  In this way if you overspend in one, and underspend in another, it all rolls up into the same total.<p>Arguably, this goes against envelope budgeting. The whole analogy is mirroring the physical world, where an envelope cannot go negative. In my envelopes, if one goes negative, then I need to move money from another envelope into it immediately. In your first scenario, since you&#x27;re using real accounts, we should not do that (otherwise we lose real spending habits data).<p>Your second approach is closer, but it&#x27;s a fair amount of work (or perhaps I misunderstood it). Using my example above, if I go to the store and spend $60 on groceries, $30 on supplies and $10 on misc, how do you propose I put that in Gnucash using those liability accounts?<p>There&#x27;s always some way to hack it, but when you actually do it for a while, those hacks become tedious. As I said in another comment, the mechanics of envelope budgeting are easy to code, and I&#x27;d like the SW to handle those details for me.<p>I did play with the built-in budget tool. It&#x27;s like the typical budget tool in most such SW: No carryover of excess budget -  you have to manually track it and update it each month.')
