There&#x27;s a lot more written about this. It seems like there are several concepts working together that a lot of people find un-intuitive.<p>* In the main, human beings are honest. In fact mathematics predicts it must be so. (Game theory)<p>* Humans &quot;automagically&quot; cooperate if their numbers are small (under Dunbar&#x27;s number), but fail to do so over that number.<p>* If you can keep the number of cooperating people under control, you can take advantage of this.<p>* Conversely, if something needs attention, the ability to rapidly recruit them to the point needing attention is paramount (see eg. smart mobs)<p>Partly by accident, partly by design, wiki engines exploit the above 3 elements. At first approximation, as long as &gt;&gt;51% of users are honest,  the wiki will continue to function. The measured value on operational wikis is something like 60-80%.')
