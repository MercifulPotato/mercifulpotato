How do these students pay Lambda School after they&#x27;ve reached &gt; $50,000 (is that $50,000 annual, cumulative, something else?). Once the indentured student reaches this income threshold, what does the compensation to Lambda School look like? Is it a percentage of the student&#x27;s annual wages? How long does the student remain indebted to Lambda School? Are they required to sign a contract for a minimum term?')
