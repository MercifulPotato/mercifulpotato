It didnt just suddenly stop when elop came and drove the mobile phone division to the ground. It is just full of mediocre people with a lot of bureaucracy to make some people feel important while contributing negatively to the overall output.<p>Suri i think is the latest example yet the fault also lies totally in the board of the company. Siilasmaa and co should have resigned alongside suri since they clearly are as mediocre as leaders as him. But it appears that status and ego is more important to a lot of nokia&#x27;s leaders so it is what it is. Too bad since a similar finnish company of the same size, kone, demonstrates how well the company could be run with better culture and leadership.')
