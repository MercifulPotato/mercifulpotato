What the best thing about Pascal (and its successor Delphi) was the blazing fast compilation time and I am not sure that freePascal has that.<p>Also what I really hate about Pascal is it is dishonest. It tells you it is very structured and your code will be better because of limited expressiveness. But then the &#x27;writeln&#x27; &#x27;function&#x27; needs to be intruduced at the compiler level - you cannot write such a function in the Pascal grammar. (maybe with freepascal you can nowadays)<p>What I liked though is that it didnt have the empty statement &#x27;;&#x27; so you really had to understand the semantics. Sometimes you were not allowed to end you statements with &#x27;;&#x27; (since they were ended by the block, so this would require the emptystatement). I think freepascal does not have this feature anymore (which is the thinking changing).<p>And just one more thing: Personally I would try to learn ADA before diving into Pascal.')
