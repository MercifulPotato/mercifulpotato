If your load scaled horizontally, it still made sense to get a 2P Xeon over 2x 1P Xeon, but 2x 2P Xeon was way more cost efficient than a 4P Xeon. 8P or 16P seemed to exist, but maybe only in catalogs.<p>I&#x27;m not really in the market anymore, but Epyc looks like 1P is going to solve a lot of needs, and 2P will be available at a reasonable premium, but 4P will probably be out of reach.')
