My understanding is that  (legally) fraud requires intent, and they didn&#x27;t have evidence of intent. In civil election cases, (again my understanding as a layman) they are supposed to show that the number of votes that can be questioned is greater than the apparent margin of victory. So about the fraud thing, they didn&#x27;t make the accusation in court because it wasn&#x27;t necessary and couldn&#x27;t be supported to the legal standard. But here in a normal conversation we can kind of assume that if election integrity was compromised in order to boost one candidate over another, it was intentional and call it fraud. Even though challenging the results in court might not involve alleging fraud.<p>&gt; Why would anyone then believe that his other lawsuits are actually trying to resolve anomalies instead of being political smoke and mirrors to point his base to?<p>Its reasonable to suspect that these lawsuits are intended to rile the base and lack legal merit. I&#x27;m only really concerned with the sworn affidavits filed by observers that allege they were prevented from doing their jobs. A regular poll worker assumes a lot of liability for doing this, with questionable benefit. And if people are filing false affidavits to help trump with his propaganda, that needs to be investigated and the responsible parties need to be charged. Filing a false affidavit with the court is perjury.<p>&gt; Similarly, it is simply inconceivable that there was sufficient fraud for a &quot;landslide&quot; Trump victory.<p>Its fine for you to have that as a prior but with strong words like &quot;inconceivable&quot; you should have some solid arguments as well.<p>&gt; The reason people are storming the capitol is not because there are too few investigations, or because fraud has occurred. The exact same rhetoric and lies that Trump is employing right now would have just the same effect if there had been precisely zero cases and zero entertainable evidence of fraud.<p>I disagree, trump&#x27;s rhetoric works precisely because there is enough reasonable evidence to call into question your perspective on election integrity, and people are upset that it&#x27;s being ignored.')
