Are the unmarked helicopters circling the area black? Probably World Government.</i><p>We had a drug task force mass arrest staged a few years back.  I swear the DEA and other agencies did everything they could to kick up the paranoia.  It was unreal how they checked all the &#x27;conspiracy nut&#x27; boxes in one operation.<p>They cut the internet and cell phones in the area.  Real nice since we had an online class going.  They drove around in black SUVs and, just so stupid, had black helicopters flying overhead.  I guess they did arrest some people, but I question that too.  I&#x27;m sure someone was super pleased with themselves.')
