There&#x27;s lots of things in a LV driven app where you&#x27;re still wondering what front-end library to use with it.<p>&gt; Typically you wouldn&#x27;t use LV to handle:<p>&gt; Menu drop dropdowns, tooltips, popovers, modals (in some cases), tabs (when you don&#x27;t want to load the content from the server) or things that change the client side state of something but don&#x27;t adjust server state.<p>My experience is that LiveView is fine for all but the last use case. And while in practice I often don&#x27;t really need to keep things client-side-only, when I do it&#x27;s often pretty easy to just write a bit of js and, if necessary, use hooks and events to communicate with the surrounding LiveView(s).<p>In fact, I vaguely recall that in the early days of LV, the creator himself argued that it should be used for just &#x27;smaller interactive stuff&#x27;. Over time, we all discovered that LV does surprisingly well for SPA-type use cases (and as a result we now have stuff like router-level LiveViews (that take over the whole page), live_redirects, url updating, and so on).<p>&gt; That could be things like a &quot;select all&quot; checkbox toggle where that doesn&#x27;t do anything on its own other than select or de-select client side check boxes.<p>Why wouldn&#x27;t you just keep that within the server-side state LV paradigm? I&#x27;ve done just that in a project I&#x27;m working on.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s also things like wanting to copy to the clipboard or initiating stuff to happen on drag &#x2F; drop (like animations).<p>For those things you write js, yes.<p>&gt; Basically you&#x27;ll still find yourself wanting to use JS with LV. Whether that&#x27;s Stimulus, Alpine, jQuery, vanilla JS or something else that&#x27;s up to you. But I do find most of the above necessary in a lot of web apps I develop.<p>Absolutely, but I&#x27;m continuously surprised how little of it I need, and how often I &#x2F;think&#x2F; I do just because I haven&#x27;t quite wrapped my head around the different paradigm.')
