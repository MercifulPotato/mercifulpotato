Anyone &quot;just being a &lt;whatever&gt;&quot; in their life feels incomplete. (I think you were implying this by reversing the genders.)<p>To the GP, if it&#x27;s OK for girls to &quot;just be mothers&quot;, is it then OK to describe a woman as &quot;just a mother&quot;?<p>I have a daughter. I suspect that if she becomes &quot;just a mother&quot;, what that really means is her skills and interests are so foreign to me that I can&#x27;t come up with a better description than &quot;just a mother&quot;. And I hope that I will <i>not</i> be OK with that.')
