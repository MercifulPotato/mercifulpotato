This approach is precisely why I never tried ZMQ.<p>How do you know <i>my</i> circumstances? Maybe this system has tuned rmem_max&#x2F;wmem_max so I don&#x27;t care about kernel buffers? Maybe my programs have problems with multi-gigabyte queues? Why are you assuming stuff for me?<p>The right answer of course is you don&#x27;t expose a single &quot;queue size&quot; value, <i>but</i> you don&#x27;t hide it either. Instead, expose something like &quot;list of sockets: for each, here is an fd and a size of userspace queue&quot;. I&#x27;ll then query the kernel  myself to get sender&#x27;s and receiver&#x27;s kernel buffer size and so on.<p>Life is hard enough without libraries hiding stuff from you!')
