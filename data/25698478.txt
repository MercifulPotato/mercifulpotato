Cost effective propaganda when you can find all the people of a group on social media.<p>Interesting that the first couple of paragraphs talk about a meme, a viral idea he can assume we&#x27;ll know of because we&#x27;re all so <i>connected</i> online. Also refers to another popular online article in the same format he liked and adopted. Disconnecting someone from social media feels like it may only be helping their cause.<p>I think our social networks are too centralised and it&#x27;s a problem, particularly because people can be accuraretly targeted with misinformation, as well as the social media algos displaying things out of order (i.e. their order). Unfortunately it&#x27;s a truism that there are plenty people who are not empirically sceptical of what they read online and they&#x27;re only too happy to share it.<p>As much as I don&#x27;t agree with Trump on pretty much everything, I think he has a point about social media being arbiters of truth is a problem. I&#x27;m also a Brit so say very little about other country&#x27;s party&#x2F;policies. If only we could accurately measure reasons why people stormed Capitol Hill. My hunch is that information read online is the primary motivator, weighed in with the fact how information discovery is heavily entrenched in social media.<p>I would make platforms liable for their content (or at least greater emphasis on them taking an active role) and yes, I appreciate that would make them untenable as they currently stand, but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s plenty of strong counterpoints that&#x27;d make me reconsider. At the very least, viral content&#x27;s virality could perhaps be limited. Can&#x27;t recall the last viral thing I saw that wasn&#x27;t trivial but was positive. Social media has a lot of power at the moment.')
