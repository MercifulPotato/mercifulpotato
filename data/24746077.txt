They were great monitors for the time, top of the line. They weighed almost 300lbs, IIRC. And like all CRTs they can put out some heat.<p>LCDs at the time still left much to be desired so VFX houses weren&#x27;t rushing to replace them with inferior, at the time, technology.<p>I remember running mine at a higher refresh rate. 75Hz and 100Hz was easily reachable. 120Hz and you started to drop resolution and the coils would sing. I miss the wide range of resolutions you could run. LCDs still haven&#x27;t been able to replicate that without making everything a blurry, boxy mess.<p>I was able to take the broken smaller GDM-F500 (21&quot;) home. It was dim and after a bit of research I found out replacing a capacitor and a few resistors would bring it back. But it was terrifying working directly on the HV board. Once it was working I had so much screen. Almost getting electrocuted was practically it.')
