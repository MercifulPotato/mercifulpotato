I made similar observations when using LuaJIT as a SOM backend (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rochus-keller&#x2F;Som" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rochus-keller&#x2F;Som</a>), but it&#x27;s not clear why the Gral based SOM implementations are that much faster.')
