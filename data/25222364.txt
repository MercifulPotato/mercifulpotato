If you look at a many-core chip from AMD you&#x27;ll see a gradient of access latency from one core to another. You&#x27;ll see the same on any Intel Skylake-X descendant, although the slope of that gradient is less. Your software will need to be very highly optimized already before you start to sweat the difference, though.')
