In fact quite the opposite. Go into a convenience store, buy a pack of mints for $1.04 (104 yen) hand them an $100 bill (10000yen) no one blinks an eye.<p>Similarly, I was surprised in Amsterdam when a family got on a bus and didn&#x27;t have a ticket (or whatever) and so just gave the driver a 50 Euro note, and he made change and gave them their tickets.')
