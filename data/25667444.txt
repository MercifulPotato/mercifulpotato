The 21-day limit only applies when no vote is taken. If a vote is taken, and fails to get 2&#x2F;3 in both houses, the <i>entire process</i> completes in the president&#x27;s favor. Done. You could in theory keep the president out of power simply by failing to have a vote (the &quot;deliberately dropped packet&quot; approach), but there&#x27;s no provision for voting over and over again on the same question without new cause. You can&#x27;t just make up such a provision that would be an exception to how anything else in congress (e.g. impeachment) works.')
