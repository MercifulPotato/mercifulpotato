I DID get a Birch device last year, and I posted about it. I also cancelled the AMA because I got demands for all sorts of things, on a holiday weekend! People got angry because I didn&#x27;t reply to their demands right away and thought I was some sort of undercover employee. No, I put away my electronics when I spend time with family!<p>I frankly don&#x27;t blame people for not wanting to post about it, after the crap that I went through and seeing atitudes like this.')
