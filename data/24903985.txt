You had bad luck that day, maybe you’ll get the chance to try again some time in the future.<p>Ignoring the “metro” train stations, there are 4 major train stations in downtown Chicago.  People are pretty helpful, but if you don’t specify which station you need to get to you are going to get pointed in a lot of different directions.  Now you know which station you need, so it would be a lot easier next time.<p>The Greyhound station...  well, unfortunately there are a lot of naïve people out there that get paid $50 or something to carry an “extra” suitcase to Chicago “for a friend” who will pick it up.  The cops are always there because they know how it all works.')
