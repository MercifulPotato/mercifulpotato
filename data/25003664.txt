He seemed to be writing for people who knew nothing that he hadn&#x27;t already told them, and identifying CLIs with Unix was a simplification that I think was supposed to make it easier for his target audience to follow.<p>I did give the book to my computer-phobic father to read, because he was a historian who was interested in social and cultural changes and also <i>kind</i> of curious about what I did for a living, and he said it was interesting, but he also said he didn&#x27;t really understand it at a concrete level and was relying on the vivid metaphors to get any meaning out of it.  I don&#x27;t think he really considered it worthwhile for someone like him to read, which I think meant it was a fundamentally ill-conceived book.  Still a fun read, though.')
