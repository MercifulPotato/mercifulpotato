For example when it comes to chronic pain, there is that belief being pushed that opioids are actually a placebo and they don&#x27;t help. Then people are being sentenced to a talking therapies instead. These therapies try to implant the thought that all the pain people experience is in their heads and it is not real. If only they could just stop thinking about pain, then they wouldn&#x27;t need to take any pills. This is one of the reasons why people turn to dealers, if doctors start to believe this and are made afraid of prescribing anything. Also organisations who get involved in such &quot;therapies&quot; promote them, because that is, let&#x27;s be honest, rather easy money from the public health organisations. It fits the western perception of suffering, that it is noble and virtuous. I wish this topic was explored more by investigative journalists.')
