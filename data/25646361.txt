It&#x27;s a rollermouse without any real click in the roller-bar. It&#x27;s quite trippy to disable the clicking-sound, suddenly it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m actually pressing the bar. But with sound it feels like I have haptic feedback.<p>I think the trackpad on my previous mac was similar? Or, it had haptic feedback, but it was artificial and could be tweaked in SW.')
