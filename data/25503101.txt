Item(by='brigandish', descendants=None, kids=[25503460, 25503258, 25503209, 25503781, 25503296], score=None, time=1608613803, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25493367, text='There are too many myths peddled about Japan, internally and externally, to list here, and the article provides just one more example. It&#x27;s not just the media&#x27;s desire to draw wide ranging conclusions from specific, interesting stories, but also due to Japanese culture itself, a culture of putting appearances before truth, conveniently wrapped up in the (ironically) anodyne phrase &quot;don&#x27;t disturb the <i>wa</i>&quot;. One dangerous example being the distortion of the truth about COVID-19 spread in the run up to the Olympics. I expect the same over the next few months.<p>As to the larger picture though, I&#x27;m not sure why anyone trusts journalists nowadays. In an age of greater access to information their previous stranglehold on &quot;the truth&quot; has repeatedly been shown to be a sham and trusting factcheckers seems to be repeating exactly the same mistake over again but with added naïveté - &quot;Oh, they&#x27;re <i>factcheckers</i>, that must be true! Giving them that title immediately renders these humans incapable of bias…&quot;. The article even wants us to continue to swallow the blatant lie that some reasonably large proportion of stories go through a &quot;rigorous fact-checking process&quot; and even then couldn&#x27;t withstand lies from sources. <i>Please</i>, you may as well tell me Santa is really going to drop off my presents this year, which would nice given the chaos at ports (thanks again, COVID-19 and lies about contagion).<p>The &quot;age of big data&quot; and democratised access to data and communication (something that governments and media companies, old and new, have been seeking to reverse) has inadvertently created an &quot;age of epistemology&quot; for which most seem unprepared, journalists being among the least prepared.<p>I have precisely zero sympathy.')
