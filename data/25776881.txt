That&#x27;s not hyperbole: Accodding to the European Drug Report 2018 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.emcdda.europa.eu&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;publications&#x2F;8585&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.emcdda.europa.eu&#x2F;system&#x2F;files&#x2F;publications&#x2F;8585&#x2F;</a>...), the prevalence of injecting drugs (chiefly heroin) is between 0 and 0.9%, which consumption of alcohol is pretty damn near 100%.<p>With heroin specifically the increase would be nowhere near what alcohol is. Heroin is not a party drug while alcohol is. Cocaine, Meth, and MDMA I would expect to see increase in usage for the party scene but heroin specifically wouldn&#x27;t see that increase, it would a small increase at first but overall that would go down. Portugal has shown that if you legalise the drug and make it a health issue you then get access to the addicts and you can help them. This means while more people will take it, the number of concurrent users will be lower because the number of people coming off it will be higher.<p>&gt; Even if that is not exaggerated (which I strongly supect it is)<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure there was a study somewhere but I am lazy. But 1 thing I can tell you, every heroin addict I&#x27;ve met and talked with about the addiction of different things, I&#x27;ve met lots, has said they found tobacco harder to give up than heroin. Heroin it seems has a shorter withdrawal period than tobacco, so once you&#x27;re over the hump you&#x27;re for the most part fine. With tobacco from experience, it took weeks to stop taking nicotine gum and months for the cravings to go away.<p>&gt; those are not the only kinds of harm: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drugabuse.gov&#x2F;publications&#x2F;research-reports&#x2F;hero" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.drugabuse.gov&#x2F;publications&#x2F;research-reports&#x2F;hero</a>...<p>Those are envoirmental harm. I&#x27;ve heard heroin is healthier than alcohol but that&#x27;s just some random heroin addicts so I take that with a grain of salt.')
