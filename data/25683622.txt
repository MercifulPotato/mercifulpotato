But if you mean that as an excuse to not even try and just let future generations undo everything with hopefully better tech and a world in chaos, then I vehemently disagree. I don&#x27;t even have kids nor plan on ever having any, it&#x27;s just immoral (and perhaps it&#x27;s my way of finding purpose in life to help fix a problem humanity is facing).')
