If you are an overseas business that sells goods that cost £135 or below (per consignment) you have to register for VAT in the UK. If you sell goods that cost more than £135 you don&#x27;t however because the VAT will be collected as import VAT at the border. Basically this is all about shifting the administrative burden of collecting VAT from HMRC and customs and excise onto exporters. The only bright spot is that online marketplaces rather than sellers will be responsible for collecting VAT, so if you&#x27;re selling on Etsy, eBay, Amazon etc. you don&#x27;t have to worry. If you&#x27;re selling directly though you do. \n[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;publications&#x2F;changes-to-vat-treatment-of-overseas-goods-sold-to-customers-from-1-january-2021&#x2F;changes-to-vat-treatment-of-overseas-goods-sold-to-customers-from-1-january-2021" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;government&#x2F;publications&#x2F;changes-to-vat-tr...</a>')
