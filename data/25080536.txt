That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t store music on my phone.</i><p>Fair enough, but that still makes you a niche subset. For a vast amount of people in the world, streaming music suffices.<p>A couple years back storing music was the case in emerging markets too because cell phone internet was expensive and terrible. However, now with 3G+ and cheap plans the number of people who want to store music and listen to it is reducing. Nothing wrong with services adapting IMO.<p>You on the other hand are right to have your own preferences with storing and listening to music (maybe it is a curated list, old songs not available for streaming) - valid reasons. But then you should find alternatives.')
