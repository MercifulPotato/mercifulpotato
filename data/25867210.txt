AGPL is. SSPL requires not only that you open source modifications to the software, but also that you open source &quot;management software, user interfaces, application program interfaces, automation software, monitoring software, backup software, storage software and hosting software&quot; that you use to operate the licensed software.<p>If you want to offer ElasticSearch as a service, you have to open-source <i>your entire hosting stack</i> including UI. God help you if you pay for any proprietary software â€” you literally can&#x27;t satisfy these terms. Notably, Elastic itself doesn&#x27;t have to do this for its own hosting service, because of course it can&#x27;t satisfy the terms: no hosting company I know of can.<p>The point of the license isn&#x27;t to get contributions back. The point is to prevent competition to Elastic&#x27;s hosting business. Elastic&#x27;s new version of ElasticSearch is source-available software, not open-source, by pretty much any reasonable definition.')
