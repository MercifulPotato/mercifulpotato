One week a month I was &quot;on call&quot;, which meant waking up at 3am most nights and working through to office hours babysitting&#x2F;bullying the system. In theory we got time off to compensate, in practice if we arrived back in the office after about 9am we&#x27;d get funny looks and the boss would pop past to ask what the problem was. &quot;I just worked 5 hours&quot; did not matter, we got that one hour of extra time off and that was it.<p>There was no engineering effort to fix these problems, it was just accepted that &quot;sometimes the overnight jobs don&#x27;t work&quot;.<p>When I quit I made it clear that that was the reason. And even though I quit during the 90 day trial period I still gave them a week&#x27;s notice. The boss was not happy, but was adamant that the system he had put in place was working well and did not need to be changed. He wanted me to be on call during my weeks notice period!<p>There&#x27;s two fixes: technical, by stopping the callouts from being necessary; and stopping management from imposing the callouts. Or you can get paid enough to make you happy with the callouts. If you can&#x27;t do one of those you really need to get out.')
