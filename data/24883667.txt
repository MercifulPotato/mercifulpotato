I thought it would be funny to push a merge commit between the 2 repo&#x27;s latest commits. As a result, the git history is accessible from the dmca repo if you know the commit hashes. Since I didn&#x27;t rebase, all the commit hashes were preserved with signatures. Another fun discovery is that deleting my fork of github&#x2F;dmca didn&#x27;t affect the PR like I thought it would, so it seems a mirror of youtube-dl&#x27;s commits are stuck in the ether until GH deletes my PR and garbage collects the repo.')
