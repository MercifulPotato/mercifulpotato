I&#x27;m also a Git contributor, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a secret or in any way shocking to most of the Git contributors that the intended purpose of the smudge&#x2F;clean filter functionality in Git was to perform simpler modifications on source code.<p>However, one of the benefits to Git is that it is enormously flexible, and Git can be and is successfully leveraged to provide large file functionality using this mechanism.  Before I maintained Git LFS or knew how it worked, I hypothesized that this would be the ideal mechanism to do handling of large files, so it shouldn&#x27;t be surprising that the original developers decided to do so.  We just need to be cognizant that as with any design, there are going to be some limitations, which is what I was mentioning in that thread.<p>As a side note, it&#x27;s intentional that we don&#x27;t use hard links or symlinks into the LFS storage because that makes it extremely easy to destroy or corrupt data by modifying the working tree, so Git&#x27;s behavior here is actually helpful.  There is copy-on-write functionality in Git LFS that can be used if your file system supports it to make the size of the repository a little less painful with large files.')
