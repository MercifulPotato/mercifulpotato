Not as scalable that one I think.  But the article emphasizes small lasers combined via fiber, ok.<p>And yes the optics must be pretty impressive -- I wonder if adaptive optics (from astronomy) are used at these ranges and target sizes?<p>And then, a puzzle I&#x27;ve always wished to have the knowledge to solve.  Does a laser beam obey the 1&#x2F;r^2 rule in intensity and area spread over distance?  Of course it does, light waves intrinsically have that property I think.  But how do you show it when it comes to a coherent beam that is always depicted as a focused pencil out into space forever?')
