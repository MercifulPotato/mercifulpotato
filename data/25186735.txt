Most people keep their iPhones for many, many years. But if you try to do that on the Android side you&#x27;re putting up with a lot of hardware pains or putting yourself at risk using a device that&#x27;s no longer getting security patches.<p>Totally understand that people have different cosmetic preferences in operating system, or even philosophically just prefer the Android approach.
