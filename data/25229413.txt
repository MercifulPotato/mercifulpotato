In a lot of western europe, there wasn&#x27;t the same sharp de-unionisation. So, unions exist and their role is well understood. They more or less form for a regulatory body for labour by sector. It&#x27;s stable. I doubt amazon themselves are concerned about these. Not much uncertainty here.<p>Interestingly enough, shop-level organization at amazon scale gets somewhat similar to sector-wide unions.<p>In any case, unionization laws aren&#x27;t deterministic.')
