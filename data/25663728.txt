Biden encouraged his supporters to vote early. Trump did the opposite. Accordingly, the early&#x2F;absentee votes are ~90% for Biden. Due to the way they get counted they come in larger lumps than day-of vote counting. As far as I can tell the rest of the post is statistical gish-gallop with some graphs and equations to make it all look more convincing.<p>I also want to say that the sources of reported votes isn&#x27;t a mystery, and the author could easily have found out that they were early votes if they had wanted to. Either they didn&#x27;t check, or didn&#x27;t want to inform people of those very relevant facts.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;uk-factcheck-wi-pa-mi-vote-spikes-idUSKBN27Q307" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;uk-factcheck-wi-pa-mi-vote-s...</a>')
