Item(by='Vinnl', descendants=None, kids=[25056841], score=None, time=1605084734, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25053190, text='It looks neat, but I&#x27;m not familiar with most of the tools and concepts mentioned on its page, so if I were to use it, I&#x27;d mostly do so as a &quot;fire and forget&quot; and then hope it does its thing properly. Looking at the readme, that means I&#x27;d run `firecfg --fix-sound`, then `sudo firecfg`, and then after a logout and login never look back at it.<p>Would you (or anyone else) happen to know if there&#x27;s any risks for an unknowledgable user like me to do that, e.g. of breaking my system without knowing how to repair it?')
