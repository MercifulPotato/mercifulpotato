Some questions were ambiguous in a way that made the T&#x2F;F answer invert depending on how you read the question. (To be clear, these were not trick questions that required precise reading. They were just bad questions.) Students never knew why they got the answer wrong unless they asked, which few did. A fair number of students started believing the opposite of the truth as a result of getting a question wrong on the test due to the ambiguity.')
