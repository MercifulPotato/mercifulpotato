Philosophers have been seeking to answer this since the beginning of time and we will all continue to do so until the end of time.<p>Personally, I try to make a regular habit of thinking about my mortality. Visualizing my friends and family after I&#x27;m gone, and seeing how the world keeps on ticking. It helps me limit my own self-importance in the world but also helps free my mind to focus on the things I really care about.<p>Like you, I would love to be able to many lifetimes where I get to try all those other paths in the road I didn&#x27;t end up taking. And perhaps we will, maybe reincarnation is a thing. Or maybe the birth and death of the universe is cyclical and we get to try this all over and over. Sadly we can never know this.<p>If you haven&#x27;t seen the show &quot;The Good Place&quot;, it has some interesting takes on mortality and what it would be like to live forever.')
