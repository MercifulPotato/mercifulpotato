The testers also created a test kit, to make things even easier, so that people could try this test at home.</i><p><i>The study participants who said they had trouble smelling coconut oil and peppermint were found to be most likely to show a positive COVID-19 test. Almost 25% of participants couldnâ€™t smell the peppermint, and almost 21% of participants reported being unable to smell the coconut oil.</i>')
