Item(by='ubermonkey', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610140652, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25676908, text='&gt;it comes across in literally every piece of snobbery about how a spin bike can&#x27;t simulate real road feel and you&#x27;ll never get your proper position and couldn&#x27;t possibly train the same muscles and so on. I just smile and nod. The bike world is full of snobbery.<p>None of that is actually WRONG, though. A spin bike is its own thing, with its own set of desired features and aesthetics and behaviors. It&#x27;s not snobbery to say it&#x27;s different from training done with cycling trainers and &quot;real&quot; bikes.<p>Your final paragraph is kind of odd, since the questions you asked were already answered. Power interval training for competitive cyclists involves longish (45-120 minute) workouts with many intervals set at different percentages of your functional threshold power.<p>Manually adjusting for each one is a tremendous pain in the ass. For example, on my workout last night, I would&#x27;ve had to manually adjust it 16 times in 55 minutes.<p>Smart trainers have more or less taken over for serious riders precisely because they remove this problem.<p>If this isn&#x27;t a problem for YOU because you prefer the way spin-type workouts go, that&#x27;s awesome for you, but it really just points out that serious outdoor riders are mostly looking for a different experience than Peloton sells. Again: not snobbery. Just an acknowledgment that spin &lt;&gt; outdoor cycling.')
