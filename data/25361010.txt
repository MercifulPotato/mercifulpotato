The presuppositions that his arguments rest on aren&#x27;t even accepted by most people who, to steal from Stroud, bow reverentially at his feet. For instance, most who pay homage to Hume do not accept his severe restrictions vis-a-vis causality in the realm of perception. But it is precisely this crude imagist theory of perception that Hume grounds his arguments against the knowledge of causation in.<p>(Which is not to dismiss your point about their being a kind of savagery and philosophical philistinism among scientists. This was certainly Feyerabend&#x27;s view.)')
