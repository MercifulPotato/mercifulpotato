Go is just a well-designed language that makes everything straightforward.<p>The main reason I started learning and building with C is that I&#x27;m not confident the code I write in Go will age well. The discussions around Go-2 make me extremely nervous (it has something that reminds me of angular-2, python-3, symfony-2, bootstrap-3, and others major redesigns who left developers in a lot of troubles, I hope time will prove me incorrect).<p>So basically, I&#x27;m enjoying it, but I worry if it will last. I guess that means I really love it.')
