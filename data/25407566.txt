Moreover, if they had looked up &quot;andernfalls&quot; in a dictionary, they would have found &quot;otherwise&quot; as translation. For &quot;sonst&quot;, the number 1 translation in all dictionaries I have around or found online, is &quot;else&quot;.<p>So I firmly believe they used &quot;sonst&quot;.')
