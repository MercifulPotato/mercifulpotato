I know it gets better with experience but you absolutely always must have some high level estimates from your end that client should agree with upfront.<p>Few tips:<p>- &quot;Give you tight deadlines&quot;. Doesn&#x27;t work that way. YOU are the one who will give them an estimate and a timeline based on their requirements. Sorry but don&#x27;t get forced into delivering something quick because you want to please the client. You will always lose. Never agree to an aggressive timeline. Whatever you think is reasonable, multiply by 3 before agreeing with the client.<p>- Tell the client that timelines can shift if they change scope. Some things just take time.<p>- Remember that some people just have the habit of making everything urgent. In many cases, they don&#x27;t really mean it. But it depends on the person. If everything is urgent, nothing is urgent. Challenge them on it if needed.<p>- Always under promise and over deliver if possible. It is better to say &quot;3 months for this project&quot; and deliver in &quot;2.5 months&quot; than &quot;Yes I can finish in 3 weeks&quot; and then you are nowhere near it in 3 weeks.<p>- If client keeps asking to deliver quickly, remind them of the timeline that was agreed mutually.<p>- At the end of the day, it is 1 client. If they are becoming a nuisance, drop them. Beauty of freelance and being your own boss. Don&#x27;t let a client boss you around. Find another one.')
