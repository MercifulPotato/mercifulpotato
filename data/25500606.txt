If you vaccinate which eradicates &quot;normal&quot; variant than those less virulent strain which may be vaccine resistant will get opportunity to spread. That is if such variants exist.<p>Problem is that there is no alternative. You either vaccinate or let it run through your population. With IFR of 0.5-1% that is really hard choice to make.')
