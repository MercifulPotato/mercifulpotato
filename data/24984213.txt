It was defined and measured in the survey.  Both links confirm that.<p>But then they did not break it down in the reporting because few enough people fell into it for their survey to produce reasonable statistics on a per country level.<p>Now you are correct that I should not have said &quot;under 2%&quot;.  But given that the portion of the USA at level 4&#x2F;5 matches the international portion at the same level (both cases 12%), it seems likely that the portion of the USA at level 5 (which the survey was not large enough to estimate) is about the same as the international average (which the survey measured at 2%).<p>Therefore even though the survey did not report a figure for the USA, it is likely that the real figure is around 2%.<p>I stand by my belief that this terms of service is sufficiently complex that even fewer can understand it.<p>You are right that the average Prezi user is more likely to be literate than the average American.')
