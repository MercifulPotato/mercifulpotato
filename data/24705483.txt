Item(by='cookiengineer', descendants=None, kids=[24705579], score=None, time=1602047345, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24705243, text='&gt; they&#x27;ll be closed automatically regardless of whether you closed them or not.<p>Actually that is not really true. It is defined per html5 spec what is closed automatically when another open node is being parsed.<p>The &lt;p&gt; element always had a weird flow-root behaviour, that is why it is always closed automatically.<p>Rather than that iirc mostly form relevant elements are also closed automatically, like optgroup, option, select, input and such.<p>Additionally it&#x27;s only table (same problem with flow root) and body, pretty much.<p>I can understand that a lot of people are confused why that is. But the reason is not the difference of XML vs SGML per se (xhtml will simply break if a p is within a p)... it&#x27;s the flow root model and the difference in behaviours of layouting that is specified here, not the notation structure.<p>So SGML was the better choice, to allow all php crapsites that never test their html validity to still run rather than forcing the enduser to (fix?) the xml.<p>I mean, at some point opera didn&#x27;t even work on bbcode based forum software(s), so people quickly started abandoning it.')
