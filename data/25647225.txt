The only remaining shortfall will be the petrol taxes and I suspect that this will eventually be recouped by some variety of road pricing or mileage tax which will be unfortunate because it is a regressive tax as has been pointed out by another comment here.  It is likely to happen because Norwegian authorities are very willing to impose tolls; road pricing or mileage taxes are but a small step from there.')
