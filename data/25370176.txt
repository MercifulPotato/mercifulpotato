And then there was the making a mountain out of a molehill of her e-mail server with Comey coming out and publicly reprimanding her for it like a schoolmaster, which undoubtedly affected public perception of how electable she was at a critical time.<p>Of course it&#x27;s not clear if Hilary would have won if there was no such interference, but her claim is not nearly as far-fetched as all the baseless crazy batshit stuff being thrown around by republicans nowadays.')
