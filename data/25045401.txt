Rumors have been swirling that Putin has Parkinsons, and will announce his departure in January. Kremlin denies, of course, but Duma (Russian parliament) is currently working on legislation granting former presidents _very_ broad immunity even after the presidency ends. The fact that they&#x27;re working on something like that with like 4 years to go in Putin&#x27;s presidential term is unlikely to be a coincidence.')
