Item(by='sebmellen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605136921, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25058783, text='I lived in Zug, Switzerland, also known as the &quot;Crypto Valley&quot;, for a while between 2018 and 2019. The investors in my startup are based in Zug, as are many other large conglomerates (Siemens, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Glencore, etc.). My apartment was a short walk away from Crypto AG&#x27;s headquarters.<p>Zug is a very strange and interesting town, brimming with the sort of energy you&#x27;d expect from a little tax haven (also known as the &quot;Cayman Islands of Switzerland&quot;). It&#x27;s now well known for the cryptocurrency foundations located there, from Ethereum to Tezos to Cardano.<p>Of course, at the time Crypto AG was founded, the Crypto Valley had nothing to do with cryptocurrency, but how interesting that cryptography was a key export since so long ago. To think I lived so close to a covert CIA operation â€” I had no idea!')
