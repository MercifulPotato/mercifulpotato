EMV was supposed to fix this on card-level, but missed the importance of online payments completely.<p>In Europe, where debet-cards are the de-facto standard, most online shops use a payment aggregator, which forwards your payment request to your online banking platform of your own bank, which you then have to confirm. Sometimes using a cryptographic challenge&#x2F;response from the chipcard, but more and more just by using your phone and banking app to scan a QR code and validate the payment there.<p>This completely side-tracks the insecurity of creditcards, there is nothing to steal.')
