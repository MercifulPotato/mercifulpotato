They don&#x27;t and there are dozens of alternatives.<p>Its not a publicly owned square, that is obvious. It may be a publicly accessible square.<p>Ultimately its right to kick people out for lighting dumpster fires, still seems perfectly reasonable if it were a private square that is pubolically accessible.<p>That said, I could see civil suits could argue responsibility for keeping that square safe for guests(ie allowing ice to build up on the private but accessible square and someone slips and falls)<p>But if twitter doesnt want someone there in its square, it should be free to kick them out if they arent a protected class, just like every private but publicly accessible business we patron.')
