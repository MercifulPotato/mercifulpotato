And then there is the moral issue of murdering plants and consuming them.<p>&gt;  Minks werenâ€™t meant to live in tiny cages all cramped together<p>The same goes for plants&#x2F;vegetation used to feed vegans. Unless you are grazing the great plains like wild buffalo.<p>&gt; just like raising nothing but corn and killing everything else on farmland will eventually deplete the soil.<p>What about clearing the land for avocado, almond, etc? Also, do you know what helps replenish the soil? Animals...<p>&gt; the evidence is all around us that industrial-style<p>Except that the only way vegan diet works is through industrialized farming&#x2F;transporting&#x2F;etc. There are no such things as a vegan homestead. You cannot live harmoniously in nature via a vegan diet. Whereas an omnivore diet can be supported by a homestead.<p>You can argue industrialized farming is bad. But that&#x27;s the only kind of farming that can support vegans. An inuit in alaska or a homesteader in vermont cannot survive on locally produced vegan diet.<p>As a matter of fact, no human can survive in nature on a vegan diet. All humans on a vegan diet would die of starvation&#x2F;disease in nature. It&#x27;s why no vegan human society has ever existed.<p>You can&#x27;t be against industrialized farming and be for veganism. You have to be one or the other because they are necessarily contradictory of each other. Omnivore can be against industrialized farming because we can survive without it, unlike vegans.')
