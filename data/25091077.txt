There’s no 2050 or 3050 - if you go about looking for the cheapest PC suitable for gaming, you might buy a 1050Ti. It is head and shoulders above the integrated GPUs (yes, even the AMD Vega ones), and comparable in power to last-gen (as of last week) consoles, the PS4 and Xbox One S.<p>This in turn means that every PC and console game created up until now, and probably for the next year or so, will comfortably run on a 1050Ti, even with compromises (“medium” settings, middling resolution like 1080p).<p>For the first generation of Apple’s Mac GPU, running at 10W, this is a great result. This means, Apples idiosyncrasies aside, there will be no <i>technical</i> problems in porting games to macOS. (Metal is less of a problem than you’d think - if you use Unreal, Unity, DirectX 11&#x2F;12 or Vulkan for graphics, the work needed will be on the order of a few man&#x2F;months, which is small change in game development budgets.)')
