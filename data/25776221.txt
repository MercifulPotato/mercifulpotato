At most, word usage and the way nuances are expressed have changed. People from the 1910s just happen to make use of many words that have fallen out of use for the people living in 2021.<p>Someone from 1910 would have a hard time understanding all the neologisms that were introduced after two world wars and decolonization until today.<p>For us from 2021, someone from 1912 uses words that are commonly found in written works from  the same period (and after).
