Previously it works because most scientific calculations requires FP64 calculation and reliability is matter.<p>But now is the deep learning era, it won&#x27;t need FP64 calculation and rare RAM error isn&#x27;t matter. So they must enforce the EURA to avoid dirt cheap Geforce to be used in datacenter for deep learning.')
