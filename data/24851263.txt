Item(by='untog', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603309175, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24850594, text='&gt; seems, to me, to indicate some behind the scenes UUID tracking.<p>I don&#x27;t know why.

They just need to be using history.replaceState to do that, rather than history.pushState.')
