But this kind of &quot;language-within-language&quot; problem (regex within sh) comes up a lot when formulating grep and sed command lines.<p>Come to think of it, I think this is the most frequently-encountered class of &quot;this line didn&#x27;t do what I thought it would&quot; type errors that I get as a near-daily user of (ba)sh for a few decades now.<p>Question for the group: When you encounter this kind of issue, e.g. the shell is stealing a single or double quote meant to be in the regex, do you diagnose the problem w&#x2F;r&#x2F;t the shell precedence rules for quotes and backslashes, or do you just blindly put the opposite type of quote around the whole thing and re-run?<p>Because probably half the time I use a basic blind strategy, and that&#x27;s not usually how I approach programming errors!')
