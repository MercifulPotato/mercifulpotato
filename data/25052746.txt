How do you determine how much one can take?<p>We all want the world to be more loving and compassionate, but rules and financial incentives drive productivity in our economy.  If the financial incentive to start a company is reduced, there will necessarily be a cost to innovation.<p>Imo, the goal should be creating a system where the rules are fair and clearly outlined.  The rules and incentives for employment were very clearly outlined in the employment contract these people signed.  And, the founder does not seem to be the type of person who over-promises. So, I see nothing wrong here.')
