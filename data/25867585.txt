Long, sometimes rambling, well written (in my view; opinions vary), generally thoughtful, fairly centrist, often left-of-centre (enough so to deeply annoy certain breeds of conservatives), but with enough libertarian or classical liberal ideas sprinkled through it to deeply annoy a certain type of leftist.<p>Some of his consistent themes are a gentle scepticism about what we think we know, a refusal to attribute malice to those who disagree with him, and a desire to be pragmatic about how we can achieve our shared goals.<p>...obviously this means there&#x27;s a vocal faction on social media who believe he is the modern equivalent of a grand wizard of the KKK, and who have said so in exactly so many words repeatedly.<p>If you&#x27;re the kind of person who&#x27;d like Scott&#x27;s writing, you&#x27;ll probably like it a <i>lot</i>, and you will reach this conclusion quite quickly. You&#x27;ll also likely find it inexplicable anyone might disagree.  If you&#x27;re the kind of person who does <i>not</i> like his writing, you&#x27;ll probably hate it, and probably find it confusing that anyone else might <i>not</i> hate it. For reasons I don&#x27;t remotely understand, he (and his writing) is oddly polarizing.')
