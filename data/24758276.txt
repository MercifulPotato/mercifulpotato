It&#x27;s a very boring virus which has offered very few surprises. We knew since February that it is a flu-like respiratory disease with high rates of hospitalization and death, especially among the old. The initial estimates for fatality rate were about 4% and that has now been narrowed to 1% based on better testing and treatment. Social distancing and masks are effective at controlling the spread. All of this has been known since February&#x2F;March, most of it is spelled out here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;docs&#x2F;default-source&#x2F;coronaviruse&#x2F;who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf?sfvrsn=fce87f4e_2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;docs&#x2F;default-source&#x2F;coronaviruse&#x2F;who-chi...</a><p>At the same time, there has been an endless parade of contrarians trying to make the whole thing into a big mystery and muddy the waters for some reason. There was the theory that the virus was spreading much earlier than expected. There was the theory that most cases were asymptomatic and that immunity had already been reached. The theory that lockdowns are not effective. The theory that there were different strains with highly different behavior. Some vague theory about t-cell immunity.<p>None of these contrarian theories have been supported by any real evidence, but there is a large appetite for them and people will seize on any puzzling number to try to rethink the whole picture of the virus.')
