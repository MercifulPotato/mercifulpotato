(The bad habit of Slack DMs instead of conversations in a public channel is already pretty entrenched.)  People that work in the office will have casual conversations that exclude people working remotely, and the remote workers will always be a little behind.  I think for that reason that all or nothing is the most fair.  (I wonder if giving people a coworking space for free is the answer to people that need to get away from home, which is a completely reasonable concern.)')
