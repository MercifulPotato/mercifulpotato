Item(by='depingus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606852152, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25268563, text='Hi. Found a couple bugs in the web app (also using Firefox). I can upvote my own post in the feed (which may or may not be a bug), but then if I open that post and it slides open from the right, it doesn&#x27;t show the upvote there unless I refresh the page. Also I can upvote my own post in the feed a second time, Refreshing removes the upvote, so that&#x27;s just a UI bug.')
