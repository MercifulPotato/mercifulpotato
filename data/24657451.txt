This adds a burden to to the person checking it trying to make sure that any trickery has been accounted for and that you&#x27;re actually getting a non-malicious installer.<p>Aside from that, I don&#x27;t want scripts shitting files all over my file system - I am firmly of the opinion that software installation should be handled in the package manager so it can be cleanly removed later on, upgraded, and so on using the standard tools.<p>I also see curl|bash as a red flag because it indicates that either they don&#x27;t have the skill required to build a deb&#x2F;rpm&#x2F;etc. package, or they simply don&#x27;t care to do so - which I feel indicates they have a lazy or uncaring attitude towards software quality and craftsmanship. This is less of a red flag if they say something &quot;debian&#x2F;ubuntu users download .deb here [link], everyone else please use curl|bash&quot; to limit the variety of package management systems they have to support, but still concerning in my opinion.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.idontplaydarts.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;04&#x2F;detecting-curl-pipe-bash-server-side&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.idontplaydarts.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;04&#x2F;detecting-curl-pipe-b...</a> and related discussion <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17636032" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17636032</a>')
