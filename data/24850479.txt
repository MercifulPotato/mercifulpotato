Rather, what I say is that those number systems don&#x27;t suffer the particular flaw that the real numbers suffer. There might still be other flaws. That&#x27;s why in the beginning of Section 4 I wrote: &quot;There are at least two potential ways to change RL so as to make it applicable to such tasks and, thus, at least potentially capable of leading to AGI. Of course, there is no guarantee that removing the roadblock in this paper will cause RL to lead to AGI. There might be other roadblocks besides the inadequate reward number system&quot;')
