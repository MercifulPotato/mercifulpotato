Plenty of believers who have the highest respect for religion engage in such questions, but I don&#x27;t see why they should be off-limits to others either.<p>If it is in fact the case that established religions were rooted in entheogen use, that doesn&#x27;t mean that they&#x27;re devalued in any way, and proof of this might actually reconnect believers to their roots and open their eyes to the value of visionary plants for communing with their dieties.<p>Some have speculated that entheogen use might lead to a religious revival, and might actually draw many more people back to established religions.  How is that disrespectful or pointless?')
