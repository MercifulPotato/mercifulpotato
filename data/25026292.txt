I had prior experience making Debian packages (on Debian and Ubuntu), Arch packages, and a bit of Homebrew on macOS. When I started writing Nix derivations two years ago, I found that it <i>much</i> easier than making Debian packages. Arch packages were easier than both, because the build scripts are just shell scripts, but I found it easier to make <i>correct</i> packages with Nix.')
