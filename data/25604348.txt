One of their signature dishes is fried chicken, and it is glorious. They optimize everything about the meal with the understanding that it&#x27;s 15-30 seconds from the kitchen to the table. But those are the wrong choices for 15-30 minutes of travel time. You&#x27;d be better off just getting Popeye&#x27;s. But who gets the negative review on Yelp? Not the delivery company.')
