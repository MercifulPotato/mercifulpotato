Low bandwith conditions were more of the worry tho.<p>Honestly, people running slow computers are probably just used to poor performance.  I fully agree with you that we should do something about it but I don&#x27;t see that happening unless it&#x27;s a strong  priority (feature X&#x2F;y&#x2F;z or performance? is usually the conversation).<p>Anecdotally: I&#x27;ll never forget the first time I launched an app from an SSD and vowed I was never going back.')
