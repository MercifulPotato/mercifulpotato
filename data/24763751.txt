Mortality doesn&#x27;t say very much now. The true IFR would be a better indicator but since testing availability is very inconsistent it is hard to compare the number of infected across countries or time. The mortality numbers are also inconsistent in many places (which is why we looked at all-cause mortality in the first place).<p>&gt; It&#x27;s a virus. It&#x27;s endemic. _Everyone_ will get it eventually, if not now, then a month or two from now. There&#x27;s really no way around this simple fact.<p>This is plainly wrong. Vaccines have decreased the severity of many viral diseases and in some cases even eradicated the virus completely. Even without a vaccine, some countries have driven down the infection numbers almost to zero. Even the countries that could not eradicate it will only see 10-80% of the population infected in the long run.<p>&gt; Swedish strategy will &quot;win&quot; this one.<p>For one, it is too early to declare a winner. We have to wait.<p>The Swedish strategy may work very well in Sweden. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that it would have worked in countries with a different social structure, population density or climate.')
