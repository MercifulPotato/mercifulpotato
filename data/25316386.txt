The hive mind here just keeps repeating the mantra while still downvoting dissenting opinions. Look at the other dead comment. Was that really bad enough to kill it? And from my experience, if you really challenge the powerful crowd you get vengeance killed all over the thread.<p>Also accounts here are not like on reddit. You gain power with  accepted comments. That&#x27;s the most echo&#x27;y power dynamic imaginable. If you don&#x27;t play the old boy&#x27;s game, you can&#x27;t participate and shape the conversation.<p>So, HN, are you gonna give me voting rights or will you kill me, too?')
