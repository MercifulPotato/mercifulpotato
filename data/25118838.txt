Call the number on the takeout menu.<p>In the event you call and your menu is out of date, it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience and you&#x27;ll grab a new one when you go get your food. I never had a restaurant give me trouble because I had an old menu, usually they were happy I&#x27;d been a customer so long I had an old menu.<p>New restaurant? Yeah, you might end up calling from some shady Yelp number but then you add the takeout menu to your collection and use that number next time.<p>We don&#x27;t need the internet to order from restaurants. Plus there&#x27;s something nice about the time your favorite restaurant starts to recognize your number.')
