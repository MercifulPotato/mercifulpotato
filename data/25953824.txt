So it&#x27;s kind of jarring for me to see the app taking a hit when it&#x27;s the service people have a complaint about. The app didn&#x27;t misbehave, right? It&#x27;s not like a different app interfacing with Robinhood would&#x27;ve worked any better. So while I don&#x27;t particularly like what they&#x27;re doing, I think I can understand it if this is their motivation for removing these reviews.<p>Edit:<p>Never mindâ€”it turns out Google literally says &quot;Your reviews should reflect the experience you&#x27;ve had with the content <i>or service</i> you&#x27;re reviewing.&quot;... apparently they <i>do</i> want you to review the service... or at least at some point they thought they did. Pretty confusing to see how they&#x27;re dealing with this now, if they truly want that.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;comment-posting-policy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;comment-posting-policy&#x2F;</a>')
