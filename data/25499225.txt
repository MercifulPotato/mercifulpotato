The non-profit hospitals share of total hospital capacity has remained relatively stable (about 70%) for decades [0]. The regulation section of Wikipedia is a litany of anti-free-market policies [0].<p>You can argue that free market principles fail in healthcare, and I will happily disagree and we can all have a cheerful time. But the US hasn&#x27;t tried a free market approach to healthcare in at least decades. The free marketeers lost the argument; all the dials were set to non-free market and people argued that the quality&#x2F;access to healthcare would rise to offset the cost of regulation. I&#x27;m not totally sure why people keep buying that argument.<p>In a free market:<p>1) Employment status would be irrelevant to healthcare.<p>2) People would be legally allowed to provide healthcare as long as treatment met whatever minimum quality standards the government sets on healthcare.<p>Saying &quot;it became illegal to open a hospital&quot; is unrelated to high costs is a serious failure of imagination. A ban on allowing people to provide competing services is a serious concern.<p>Also, people arguing for socialised healthcare aren&#x27;t arguing to bring down the absurd costs, they are mostly arguing that the absurd costs should be shouldered by the middle &amp; upper classes instead of the people consuming healthcare. It is unfair to first being in policies that inflate the costs, then dump the costs on taxpayers. If the argument is dump the costs on someone else then a decent effort should be made to reduce those costs.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Health_care_in_the_United_States" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Health_care_in_the_United_Stat...</a>')
