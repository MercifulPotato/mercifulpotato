In human history, we&#x27;ve never before had individual companies like Facebook and Twitter that are so enormous and have so much control over our public speech. (2.7 billion and 330 million monthly active users, respectively.) They have become &quot;the town square of the world&quot;, so to speak. Facebook and Twitter are not literally governments, but they&#x27;re actually larger than many governments, with a larger population and more wealth than many nations. There&#x27;s nothing special about governments with regard to freedom of speech except that it has always been assumed governments are the only entities with enough individual power to significantly restrict free speech. That assumption is no longer true. Indeed, the whole motivation behind this particular act of censorship is the idea that these platforms are so powerful that they can change the outcome of the election of one of the largest nations on Earth. I&#x27;m not sure I believe that, but it&#x27;s clear in any case that Facebook and Twitter are not just normal &quot;private companies&quot;. They&#x27;re not little moderated discussion forums. They have effectively (unfortunately) become the public sphere.<p>Twitter once locked me out of my account because I made a joke about bitcoin. Their stupid &quot;algorithms&quot; got me. And the only reason I was able to get my account unlocked was that I personally knew a Twitter engineer. I don&#x27;t trust Jack or Zuck even one tiny bit to exercise the vast power they have to silence millions of people. It&#x27;s not even a question of whether I agree with the NY Post article: the story is probably bullshit. But so were the news stories about Iraq having WMD. How about suspending the NY Times account too? How about suspending every news outlet that has published a debunked story? &quot;Anonymous sources tell us that yadda yadda.&quot;<p>By design, Facebook and Twitter allow everyone in the world to post anything they want. That includes lies. If they can&#x27;t accept the consequences of the platform they created, then they should shut down. But as long as they exist, with the size of their user base, they are simply too big and too powerful to be allowed to restrict our freedom of speech.')
