When working in aerospace I used maths a lot, 3D vector work as well as physics like velocity, acceleration, gravity simulations etc were all pretty important. I have also had roles where I suspect I never used much beyond basic addition and multiplication. But if your maths isn&#x27;t there you are not going to be getting roles that are heavy on the fundamental maths problems.<p>It is the same with algorithms. Some times a role is utilising the basics all the time and you rarely get passed some DB access, lists and maps. In others I have needed to build a Type 2 ary tree with lockless parallel access. I think what ends up happening is that most projects have some tough stuff and some have a lot more of it but you can contribute to those projects without knowing how to solve it because the bulk of most programming is fairly simple. But that deeper knowledge is needed by at least someone on the team at some point in time.')
