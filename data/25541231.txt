And if you&#x27;re doing that, there&#x27;s no reason to use slices. So I guess the only thing to learn from my code... is that slices do useful bookkeeping for problems similar to this, in the case that you don&#x27;t care about the indices?<p>&gt; Returning the value you were given or None would be better expressed as returning True&#x2F;False to avoid the unnecessary copy.<p>Just because two values are equal, doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re the same. Though my function signature was wonky, regardless.')
