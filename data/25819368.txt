What is poorly understood is what the output is, in terms of what becomes energy, what  is stored, and what is excreted.<p>The output side greatly depend on hormones (esp. insulin), existing fat cells, gut flora, psychology and other factors.<p>The best example is that without insulin, you will starve, regardless of what your caloric input is. In fact, you will lose about 1 pound per day until you go into a coma and die.<p>But if I wanted to point to one thing that is killing Americans, it&#x27;s corn syrup (HFCS), which is used as a cheap (subsidized by US govt.) feedstock in many foods today. Group photos pre-HFCS show zero obese people. Our real pandemic is HFCS, affecting all Americans, not corona which only kills 1&#x2F;1,000.')
