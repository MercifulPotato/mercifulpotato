So what would be the incentive for rejoining the EU?<p>Plus if the UK does decide it wants to rejoin, this time it probably will get 0 exemptions, or close to it. I think it might get some as it&#x27;s a big economy and it&#x27;s geostrategically important, but definitely not as many as it used to have.<p>Without a major external or internal shock for the UK, it probably won&#x27;t rejoin the EU during our lifetimes.')
