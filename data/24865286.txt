I don&#x27;t know of anybody doing that, but dealers like Illumn might be willing to sell you multiples with the same lot number. I&#x27;d be surprised if most OEMs do more than that when building packs.<p>You can get a cheap analyzing slot charger ($30-40) and do it yourself. That won&#x27;t be quite as accurate as a big expensive industrial battery tester, but it will be accurate enough to make safe battery packs for consumer electronics.')
