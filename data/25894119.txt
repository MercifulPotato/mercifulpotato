The universe even less so. The Earth also doesn&#x27;t care about climate change. It&#x27;s just a rock plus some carbon-based lifeforms. Some will do just fine under climate change. In the end, all will perish along with the Sun or sooner.<p>It&#x27;s up for us to care for us.<p>Caring for &quot;Earth&quot; or for animal life to the detriment of humans, is just a long-winded way to justify being suicidal.<p>It&#x27;s also false consciousness. You don&#x27;t really love Earth or animals, you just hate yourself and human life.')
