Peertube and other fediverse software are examples of living AGPL projects. In recent weeks there was some discussion on this license, and people claiming &quot;no one would want to contribute&quot;.<p>My thinking is that AGPL today is where GPL was, I dunno, 20 years ago in terms of attitude of the industry (<i>not friendly</i>) and significance to the user (actual suppression of user-hostile behavior... of course as much as this software is practically usable). I&#x27;m no free software fundamentalist myself, but I recognize this. The shift is related to the changes in how software is distributed.<p>2. Many discussions of PeerTube viability seem to assume the &quot;content creator&quot; system created, to a large extent intentionally, by YouTube. This system changed over the years, but relies on people pumping out similarly-formatted videos in regular intervals. The people are driven by hope of accomplishing scale where they can support themselves with Patreon and maybe YT ads (though I hear these are less lucrative and important nowadays).<p>On PeerTube there is no scale as of now, so the realistic model of usage, I imagine, would be more like early YouTube. Funny and interesting videos (not quasi-TV shows), one-off tutorials, archiving, short animation etc., without hoping for making it a full-time job.<p>3. Lately YouTube have begun constantly pestering (at least when you have some cookie-deleting scheme?) to accept their all-Google terms, and to log in, every every time. I think it started in the late summer, used to be way more lenient. I&#x27;m assuming at least the terms thing is related to GDPR: to that extent I&#x27;m okay with reminding me what I&#x27;m doing to myself by exposing myself to Google. This may be a nudge to start using PeerTube in some capacity, certainly pushed me to peruse archive.org more.')
