When they talk about &quot;misinformation&quot; they&#x27;re talking about people who question the narrative, under the guise of labeling this group &quot;dangerous&quot;. Nothing changes. The new terrorist insurgent posts youtube videos about Bill Gates tracking those who have been vaccinated through smartphone-readable quantum dot tattoos. But that&#x27;s a mouthful, so the announcement comes &quot;No, the vaccine will not contain a microchip&quot;. And that may be construed as literally true, even if there is an RFID-type device in there. Not that the &quot;authorities&quot; have ever risen above outright lies, which it seems people sometimes forget. All this talk about suppressing &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; is a mission to create an army of militantly obedient and broken people, who are trained to remember that the television is the arbiter of truth because it brings together panels of experts to tell you what to think. You may not question vaccine safety or efficacy. You may not question scientific legitimacy. &quot;Chemtrails&quot; are for quack conspiracy theorists, but &quot;stratospheric aerosol injection&quot; is a promising new scientific field. Everything is a distortion.')
