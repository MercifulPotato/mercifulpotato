I&#x27;ve been hearing these &quot;KDE 5 is fine now&quot; for the past few months in comments, podcasts, blog posts, etc. Yesterday I gave in and decided to try the latest release. After logging in, KDE greeted me with a plasma crash. In the next few hours of light usage, some more crashes followed.<p>It&#x27;s working as it always has been for me, since the early days of 4. It&#x27;s pretty much dead for me now.<p>For the record, this has been happening on many machines, and I don&#x27;t use nvigia GPUs and similar stuff.<p>Also, I try to report bugs in software that I use, but KDE has the appearance of software which receives no QA at all. It&#x27;s one thing to report a bug in sway or some XFCE application which crashes maybe once in a few years, and other to use something which crashes a dozen times a day. I&#x27;d be filling bugs all day long.')
