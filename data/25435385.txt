Not foolproof, but marketing people at uber outclass the average marketing person that might answer an ad.<p>Another shortcut is ask other business owners who are similar to you. Hopefully you have a small network or community. If you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s worth finding 2-3 people who run businesses similar to yours to regularly connect with.<p>You might not even need to find a marketing &quot;person&quot; - there are agencies that do full service. You can talk to a few, listen to the pitch, and ask them for references. Few people do this, but you can and should, and its a great way to meet other business owners like you.')
