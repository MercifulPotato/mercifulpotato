Our dreams is already the results of some kind of processing, so feeding them back as more experiences that need to be analyzed is confusing and tiring for your brain.<p>You said that you&#x27;ve been doing it since your school days, so perhaps you don&#x27;t remember, but dreams are made from a different material then regular memories: they are usually very &quot;slippery&quot; and hard to hold on to. I think it&#x27;s important in this case to go with our default behavior and to forget them as fast as possible. And yes, it means that all lucid dreaming practices are damaging your brain functionality IMO.<p>To break the loop you&#x27;re in, I think you need to re-learn how to not mess with dreams. Give yourself the time you need, and if you&#x27;re tired the best thing to do is to go back to sleep. But avoid doing so while thinking about any dream, or anything that is related to a dream, or even the abstract concept of dreams. When you catch yourself doing do, dismiss the thought with &quot;oh, that isn&#x27;t important&quot; and then switch the topic to anything else, anything at all. You can follow the line where the wall meets the ceiling, for all your brain cares. The dismiss part is important, don&#x27;t skip it. It prevents your brain from re-saving the thought. This trick can also be applied to that embarrassing moment your brain keeps popping at random times. Just &quot;not important&quot; wave, and a quick change of subject. Works like a charm.<p>Good night, sleep well and wake up :)')
