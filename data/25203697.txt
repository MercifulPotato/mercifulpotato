It still has a certain “X-factor” which makes it perfect with the right content and message.<p>Some time ago I started looking for a new framework, more up to date, at least. The website and GitHub repo for Skeleton hasn&#x27;t been updated since 2014, so maybe I was missing out on the latest fashions? Doing more ambitious&#x2F;insane web projects than happened earlier when less experienced, a bigger toolbox was needed. Of course, I had more requirements which were as important as possibly at odds with eachother. \nI still wanted a framework which felt as qualitative, effortless and pure as Skeleton did. No “api-breaking changes” or industrial-grade build-processes.<p>For me, the winner was Spectre.CSS[1], great work by Yan Zhu[2] . I&#x27;d like to pretend Spectre covers all of contemporary must-have elements, details and attractively styled controls for all future needs, because Spectre is great at teaching what is doable with pure CSS at the same time it makes me feel like a great designer, getting more done while doing even less.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;picturepan2.github.io&#x2F;spectre&#x2F;getting-started.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;picturepan2.github.io&#x2F;spectre&#x2F;getting-started.html</a>\n[2] [<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;picturepan2&#x2F;spectre" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;picturepan2&#x2F;spectre</a>]')
