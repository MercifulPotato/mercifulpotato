When the Usenet started dwindling in relevance web forums took its place and eventually StackOverflow. But now it seems all these three places have become irrelevant<p>* The Usenet has become utterly irrelevant<p>* Equally web forums<p>* StackOverflow has archival value but for the rest it is a wide desert of 0-answer questions<p>* In my current case (an Android issue) even Google&#x27;s own forum (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.google.com&#x2F;g&#x2F;android-developers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.google.com&#x2F;g&#x2F;android-developers</a>) appears to be only a honeypot to train their spam protection :)<p>So is there a place to turn to these days when someone is hitting a roadblock with a specific development issue or have they completely disappeared?<p>Thanks')
