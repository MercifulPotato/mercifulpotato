For example, Waymo bucketed accidents by severity and went down to very low severity (like a pedestrian bumping into the side of a stopped car) whereas on that site Tesla is essentially only reporting airbag deployment counts. (To Tesla&#x27;s credit, they have more time granularity than Waymo.)<p>I do think the counterfactual &quot;how many times did the human driver taking over prevent a crash&quot; data is really important to have. In the article, the scary near misses they talked about fell into that category rather than into the &quot;actual airbag deployment&quot; category.')
