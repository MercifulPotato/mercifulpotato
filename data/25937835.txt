Level 2 curbside chargers are found throughout the city and they app works fine. There&#x27;s a few super chargers outside Montreal but nothing worth driving out of the way for.<p>While digging in to how their network is built, I found out it seem their infrastructure is from AddEnergie, a Quebec company that&#x27;s also the provider for the eCharge (New Brunswick) and the BC Hydro EV. They have their own consumer brand for home chargers and public charging network across Canada called FLO. They seem to be growing fast (closed their series C last year), their product seems to be pretty good, so it doesn&#x27;t have to be all terrible.')
