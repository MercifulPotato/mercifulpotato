Leith found Brave to be in its own class as the &quot;most private&quot; browser tested (including Firefox): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scss.tcd.ie&#x2F;Doug.Leith&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;browser_privacy.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scss.tcd.ie&#x2F;Doug.Leith&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;browser_privacy.pdf</a>.<p>You could perform a similar test yourself. Setup Fiddler on your machine (installing the root cert to inspect HTTPS traffic), set aside %localappdata%&#x2F;Mozilla and %appdata%&#x2F;Mozilla, then launch Firefox. The traffic (without any user interaction) is a surprise to many. Compare with Brave (be sure to set aside %localappdata%&#x2F;BraveSoftware beforehand).')
