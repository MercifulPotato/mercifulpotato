Just because you disagree with part of what I&#x27;ve said does not give you the right to twist my words to mean something altogether different—something I did not say.  I am very careful in what I say online and usually I labor the point by restating what I&#x27;m saying in different ways so that I&#x27;m not misinterpreted (unfortunately I did not do that here as what I was saying seemed clear enough).<p>With respect to science reporting generally:  sensational and misleading reporting by the media—often encouraged by scientist themselves to increase their changes of getting new grants, etc.—has done a great deal of damage to science and scientific research over the last five or so decades.  Probably the &#x27;best&#x27; example of this is cancer research which has turned great swathes of the public off science big-time because the enthusiastic promises of cures were never met.  You only have to see how science and scientific research has dropped in importance in the eyes of the public over the last half century to know that.  In other posts I&#x27;ve even spelt this out with examples.<p>Moreover, I standby what I said, this research into superconductors is so exotic that it is of little practical value now.  I am not saying that it won&#x27;t be value in the future (only time will tell if it will).')
