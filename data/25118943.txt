You may want to just access documentation or something like that, and that shouldn&#x27;t require scripts to be enabled.<p>Web pages that require scripts should display useful information even if the scripts are disabled; simply &quot;You must enable JavaScript&quot; isn&#x27;t useful. Links to documentation should be included. If there is a source code repository, a link to it should be included. If it is a display of some data, links to the raw data should be included. If it calculates something, a link to documentation or source code describing the algorithm would be useful (actually, it can be useful even if you are using the web app to calculate it; you might want to know its working). If it is a web interface to other protocols such as IRC or NNTP, or some protocol that works over HTTP(S) such as ActivityPub, the relevant information (protocol, host name, port number, channel, newsgroup, etc) should be mentioned.')
