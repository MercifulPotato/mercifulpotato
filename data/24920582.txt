Doing a lot of carbon capture with trees doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re growing a nice biodiverse forests, it means you&#x27;re growing vast tree plantations that you periodically chop down and sequester, e.g. with biochar.<p>A while back I saw a paper in Nature claiming that we could use trees to absorb up to 1 gigaton carbon annually, but more than that and we&#x27;d seriously impact biodiversity. There are probably other estimates around, but regardless of the exact threshold, it wouldn&#x27;t be a bad thing to have technology able to do the same thing with a thousand times less land area. Then we can let the forests grow undisturbed.<p>To your edit: climate change itself is making species go extinct, so it&#x27;s not like we can solve the extinction problem without addressing climate change too.')
