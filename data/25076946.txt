My graphic workflow is on multi platform apps, people are using Figma instead of Sketch, coding for web is beautiful under Linux, Resolve and Blender are working beautifully (I don&#x27;t use prores). The only hassle will be Windows (under WM) with no internet and Logic (searching to switch to new DAW but not with subscription based licensing like ProTools). Apple is actively working on making developers &quot;go away&quot;, the days of &quot;Great Mac for developers&quot; are gone. Bottomline: Users of Apple platform are exited, they will have powerful machines with M-soc, closed and secured.:)')
