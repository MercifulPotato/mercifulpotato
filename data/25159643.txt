It&#x27;s pay-once-use-forever and since I spend a lot of time staring at code, the price per day of use is very low. Of course, there are free fonts that do the same and look good, I used Iosevka and Fira Code before I found PragmataPro. Honestly, I just adore how the font looks, and that was the primary reason I bought it, the others being the amount of available characters and that the author is a paid professional working on it.')
