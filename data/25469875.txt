The medical advances alone make it worthwhile living in the future. Not to mention racism, gender inequality and all other sins of the past. The human race is in a terrible shape today, but it&#x27;s never been better.<p>I would argue the analogy extends to the internet. People talk about pageload payloads of today vs 20 years ago, and somehow infer that the web fast faster back in the day. It wasn&#x27;t - with the gigabit internet connections, we&#x27;re easily making up for the bloat in payloads.<p>Also, it&#x27;s never been easier to quit your 9-5 job and leverage the combination of the internet and globalism to be your own boss. Just because it&#x27;s still relatively hard, it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s ever been easier.')
