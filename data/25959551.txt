I&#x27;d even wager that most have had them get defensive when you try to explain why doing X isn&#x27;t a good idea.<p>That&#x27;s effectively what I see when someone criticizes &quot;experts&quot; broadly and generally.  I&#x27;ve long accepted that there are many individuals that know a lot more about subjects I know little about.  While I have a pretty good read on things related to computers, I&#x27;m more than willing to admit that I&#x27;m not an expert in science, medicine, climatology.<p>So who should I trust?  Should I trust the youtuber that&#x27;s &quot;Found&quot; the secret that the &quot;so called experts&quot; are trying to hide from the public?  Or should I look to the actual experts actually working in the field and take their word for it?  Or do I take the harder route and try and build understanding on the subject on my own?<p>I certainly have tried to expand my personal understanding in general. However, what I&#x27;ve found is that by and large the experts actually know what they are talking about.  You should generally trust them.  The place where I&#x27;ve found a LOT of misinformation is the &quot;skeptics&quot; that hurl doubt without evidence while denigrating &quot;experts&quot;.  That is the place where I&#x27;ve found outright lies.<p>Evidence of such BS artists include Flat earthers, Anti-vaxxers, and climate change deniers.  Those are all flat out wrong positions.  There&#x27;s mountains of evidence and experts against each of those positions and mostly lies or misrepresentation in favor.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=BKorP55Aqvg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=BKorP55Aqvg</a>')
