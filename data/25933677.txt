Unless of course you&#x27;re sold into a solution like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailscale.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tailscale.com</a>, who I believe are readying a userspace embeddable implementation of their P2P mesh wireguard overlay network, which then would be a compelling alternative, too, in the not so distant future, especially because of its security posture (though only the clients are FOSS).')
