You canâ€™t just change one color in a palette and expect the design as a whole to still make sense. Imagine a standard thing like a table where you want borders, subtle zebra stripes, focus&#x2F;selection states, error states, and maybe color coded text for different types of values. Getting that to work at all requires careful coordination of the entire color palette.')
