Item(by='ncallaway', descendants=None, kids=[25738233, 25739069], score=None, time=1610402309, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25737490, text='&gt; Twitter literally claims that &quot;To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.<p>Well, no, they didn&#x27;t claim that. They claimed the two tweets, taken together, were the straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back.<p>And, yes, I think you could reasonably make the claim that the tweets were innocuous if you throw out the context of the President inciting a violent insurrection on Congress. But, we don&#x27;t have to blind ourselves to that prior context. Given it, and given the way a number of people received those comments and have been actively organizing for violence around the inauguration since then, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be to be a close call.')
