Obviously there are tons of shenanigans, but otherwise, it&#x27;s an essential role. &#x27;Pumping and dumping stocks&#x27; is not value creating it&#x27;s actually quite destructive. While Game Stop may appreciate being helped in some way, they are not going to appreciate their stock going insanely volatile. Why do you think they would actually want this?<p>The populism on this issue is really out of hand.<p>&quot;So it&#x27;s simple to discover and execute, and there is a financial incentive, &quot;  - please - no, this is completely irresponsible.')
