Silly reason or not, it&#x27;s done, and I have no desire to go back.<p>I also really like my Oculus.  It&#x27;s helped me escape a bit, and gotten me moving around more.  It&#x27;s a fantastic little device.  I&#x27;m not looking forward to the day it becomes a paper weight.<p>The only positive in all of this is I&#x27;ve started upgrading my PC to get it to the point where it can play VR games, and deciding which VR rig I want to go with.  It won&#x27;t be as great as the Oculus, even if the tech is better, since I love the untethered nature of the Oculus, but a cable-tether is worlds better than a Facebook-tether, at least to me.')
