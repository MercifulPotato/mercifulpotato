Now, can you solve for both of these problems at the same time? I think so--and maybe Three.ma is exactly that!--but Signal doesn&#x27;t seem to care, as they have a somewhat strange model of how people chat. The question, then, is mostly about how well the application supports creating unrelated accounts &#x2F; aliases: what you really want is just some kind of separate user identifier (such as you get with Three.ma, or with services like Wire&#x2F;Kik); but, barring that (as federation makes that weirdly hard), email addresses are way better than phone numbers, as it is way way easier to get throwaway email addresses--even ones from unrelated hosting companies--than throwaway phone numbers.')
