Item(by='c22', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608780835, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25523861, text='I recently spent $2500 having a &quot;recommended&quot; handyman paint the trim of a rental house I own because I was taking too long to get the house done by myself and I figured it&#x27;d save money in the long run to accelerate the timetable, but his work wasn&#x27;t up to my standards and I still had to spend another week touching up his mistakes. Probably would&#x27;ve been three days if I just did the job myself, and I wouldn&#x27;t have had to spend any time picking paint out of the carpet either...<p>To be fair, though, the other subs I hired worked out okay.')
