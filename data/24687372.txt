Item(by='SamBam', descendants=None, kids=[24688002, 24691017], score=None, time=1601903057, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24686049, text='I&#x27;m still a little confused. In my mind, if I hold one surface still and rub the other surface on it, it&#x27;s exactly the same as if I reversed their roles -- the surfaces shouldn&#x27;t know which one is moving and which is stationary. For example, if I was sanding a block of wood, it wouldn&#x27;t matter if I moved the sand paper on the wood or the wood on the sand paper.<p>Yet several statements in the article make it clear that my understanding is not correct (e.g. &quot;Next, the Green plate acts as the control and the Red plate is lapped against it,&quot; or &quot;Next, the Green and Blue plates are lapped against each other in an alternating manner.&quot;)')
