Light color schemes still feel distinct in subtleties like fonts, border colors and other things that scream “you’re looking at github” or “you’re looking at msdn” or “it’s your iphone”. It doesn’t happen with dark mode, it’s just all the same dark bg with some text. Idk what can be done to fix it.')
