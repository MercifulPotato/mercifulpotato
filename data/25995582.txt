Regulated industries just put some expectations on what that means.  This can be done well or poorly, but it&#x27;s basically the intent.<p>Don&#x27;t read that the wrong way; I don&#x27;t think every product benefits enough from good engineering practice to make it worthwhile - it certainly adds some friction and makes even &quot;fast iteration&quot; slower.  On the other hand, it&#x27;s absolutely the right way to approach things with high stakes for failures.')
