It&#x27;s a super cool project though despite that and I wonder if you could extend it to put the two missing layers in...<p>The way I see it you have the evolution of individual humans at the genetic level - so this gives them built in desires and instinctual behaviour.<p>You then have the learning of the individual over the course of their life. Attachment theory is basically a load of research on how this can go wrong if the very critical early stages of emotional &amp; interpersonal development aren&#x27;t well supported in childhood.<p>Finally humans are social creatures, individual humans aren&#x27;t well adapted to surviving &#x27;in nature&#x27; so most of the ~500k years of evolution for humans going from anatomically modern to behaviourally modern there was selection pressure for genes and memes that resulted in survival at the level of human cultures.<p>I guess this would be quite an increase in scope.')
