You try laundering $10 million by selling stolen goods at the pub. It’ll take you a while, and I can guarantee that the police are gonna notice.<p>Even then you’re just turning your goods into cash. Which is still difficult to spend when buying high value assets like property. At some point if you’re a criminal that wants to spend their cash, and live in a developed country you need to turn your crypto into clean fiat in a bank account, or prove the crypto didn’t come from illicit sources.')
