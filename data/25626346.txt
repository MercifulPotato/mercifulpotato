What is surprising is that they actually found this out and acknowledged it.<p>Used to work in the performance marketing team for one of the top 10 brands as an analyst&#x2F;data scientist, and the reality is that the company politics and individuals&#x27; career ambitions top the science. Most of the time the work that gets visibility is spent on &quot;creating stories around data for the leadership&quot;: marketers do not understand at all the data they are fed to by the advertising platforms. Also, running controlled A&#x2F;B studies tended to show between 0 and 10% (this was rare, closer to 0% more common) causal impact on campaings making none of the marketing campaigns profitable in the sense that was used for performance evaluation.<p>There is one key visicious loop keeping the game going:<p>1. The marketers want to show great numbers back to the leadership (internal storytelling). Their employment&#x2F;bonuses depend on the number reported by the ad platform.<p>2. The ad platforms want more of your ad spend which can be achieved by showing better ROI in their platform.<p>3. Both the marketers and the ad platforms want to show as good numbers as possible, leading to a situation that nobody is incentiviced to measure true performance &#x2F; correctly measuring performance.<p>None of the A&#x2F;B tests nor analyses about ad fraud went beyond the marketing director. One cool case was analyzing Google&#x27;s DoubleClick ad logs for a bunch of campaigns that showed there were few cookies that received a significant % portion of the total ad spend - meaning that few &quot;insividuals&quot; received tens or hundreds of thousands of ad impressions.<p>Nobody cared and this still goes on. It is such a toxic environment to work in I ended up changing career a bit.')
