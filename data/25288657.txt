But then I think of it like this: they probably have to deal with many foreign customers, &quot;most&quot; of whom cannot speak Japanese. Or they might not have been exposed to many foreigners that they know there are foreigners who can speak Japanese.<p>At the same time, Japanese society puts consideration for others at one of the higher priorities when interacting with people, and is seen everywhere and highly evaluated by many.<p>So it feels natural for the person to assume that I, as another one of those foreign people, most likely cannot speak Japanese. Also, they could try speaking to me in Japanese, but it&#x27;d be inconsiderate of them if I didn&#x27;t know Japanese. So many a time the default, and very likely considerate route out is broken English to the best of their abilities.<p>I know this makes people like us who do know the language a bit bad, but then again, we&#x27;re still a minority so I wouldn&#x27;t read too much into it. :)<p>Of course, if the person in question <i>knows</i> you know Japanese, yet keeps talking to you in English, then it might be better to assume something is not right. :)')
