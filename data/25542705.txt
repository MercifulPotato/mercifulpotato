Biotech and even electronics patents now require large r&amp;d budgets, otherwise they&#x27;re obvious and thus not innovative. In other words, a lone inventor in those areas without a serious R&amp;D budget probably means a patent troll. I think in these areas (unlike mechanical engineering) patents should become exponential. As a reform, it would be more palpable to change the fee schedule depending on the area of the patent.')
