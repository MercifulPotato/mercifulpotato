Item(by='triceratops', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604038386, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24939526, text='&gt; The US is a federation of states, and generally internal matters (like stopping the spread of a virus in your state) are not the purview of the executive branch.<p>These states aren&#x27;t islands though - they mostly share land borders, freeways connect them, and people freely travel between them every day. The virus doesn&#x27;t know state borders. If the federal government can insert itself into random state affairs by citing the interstate commerce clause, I don&#x27;t see how it can wash its hands of responsibility for this debacle.')
