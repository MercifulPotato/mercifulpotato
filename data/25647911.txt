In this sense, it&#x27;s not very different from Javadocs.<p>For some examples:\nA comment that appears right before a type or function definition is exported as documentation by the &quot;go doc&quot; tool.<p>Another one is build constraints, which appear as a comment at the top of the file, like: `&#x2F;&#x2F; +build linux` to say &quot;only include this file if the build target is linux.&quot;<p>Other tools use their own comment format to recognize comments meant for them.')
