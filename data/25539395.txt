I don&#x27;t remember the circumstances of how I got it but I didn&#x27;t spend as much time on the computer at home back then. So it didn&#x27;t really matter as much.<p>When VGA itself improved enough to buy my first color VGA monitor, it was a bit of a let down in that the sharpness was a definite step down from that monitor.')
