Item(by='boringg', descendants=None, kids=[25934086, 25932568], score=None, time=1611771539, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25930969, text='&gt; This isn&#x27;t true. The institutions with Short Exposure are connected to the institutions who buy Robinhood data and perform high frequency trading on those orders. Citadel and Melvin can BUY GME themselves to mitigate the risks. It is likely that a substantial amount of GME is being held by the institutions who had short exposure. It&#x27;s basic risk mitigation.<p>-- They would have to do this at great cost and loss (rumor mill has it at current loss of $4B).  If you believe the reports in the media Melvin has had to go ask for money from other institutions.  Thus bigger fish would now be involved as they are putting money out to Melvin.<p>&gt; The high frequency traders who have the Robinhood data are making money on every Buy GME order and will make money on every sell when this bubble collapses.<p>-- Agreed i said as much in my comment that people will make money on it - some retail some institutionals.<p>&gt; It is wrong to present this as a populist uprising.<p>-- Disagree.  This is a trade that at its core is a sentiment of disenfranchisement, anger at wall street short sellers, financial establishment - and of course with the hope of making money.<p>&gt; This is an incredible fluctuation, a hilarious anomaly, but it is nothing more than that. It will have no lasting impact.<p>- Agree - most likely - it will however make wallstreet institutional short sellers think more carefully about their positions.  There will be impacts but doubtful anything transcendent on the markets.  If anything SEC will investigate Wallstreetbets traders as opposed to doing anything to Wall street (which has been having carte blanche under the last administration&#x27;s effort to neuter the SEC).<p>&gt; I firmly believe that the hedge funds that held GME short positions have bought into GME to mitigate their exposure. They likely bought in algorithmically using robinhood data and are making money off of retail right now.<p>-- Might be, however the losses they took at the beginning on their position were pretty steep to jump right back into the pool.<p>&gt; My message to the people here: &#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets is not a gameshark. You are still playing their game. You are still playing a rigged game and you are still losing.<p>-- I don&#x27;t think anyone has allusions that the tables have turned.  This is more like the chance for this one time give a giant F U to wallstreet who has been perceived to be making money off the backs of the population without any care at all from retail investors.')
