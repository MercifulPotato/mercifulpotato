Item(by='aydwi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605275197, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25081773, text='I own a company which manufactures and sells showerheads. Since the &quot;vast majority&quot; of people are prone to a fall while taking a shower, and since it is difficult to come up with a fool-proof solution against slipping and falling (who wants to get into the nitty-gritty of that?), my company also mandatorily installs a camera alongside, so that we can monitor for accidents.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s not perfect. Some customers have raised concerns about their privacy, but this is for the greater good. My company is very ethical in its practices, and really values each customer&#x27;s privacy (pinky promise). This is the best solution for everyone.<p>The footage of you and your loved ones showering is completely safe with us, although you can choose not to be recorded while showering by not purchasing our products.<p>Oh by the way, our showerheads are sleeker and more convenient than anything else in the market.')
