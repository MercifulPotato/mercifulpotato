Assets must be accounted for when calculating wealth, so the tax service will be required to track and value assets including vehicles, homes, and material good etc. for every citizen to see if the wealth tax would apply to them -- if we didn&#x27;t report material goods, the wealthy could  sock money away in expensive cars, artworks, jewelry and other material non-real-estate assets as they already do for investment.<p>This creates a surveillance society on every possession and purchase, and facilitates confiscation and intimidation, an encroachment on our liberty. In fact, that the IRS and the government have a view on every single financial transaction due to the Patriot Act already has a chilling effect on freedom (consider donations). A wealth tax would absolutely be a massive and unnecessary further encroachment upon liberty as the majority of Americans would ultimately have to detail and report their assets to show they do not qualify, while the wealthy would very likely be able to largely anyway cheat on their wealth tax by manipulating valuations of their assets.')
