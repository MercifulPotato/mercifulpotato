E.g. suicide rates are up on some locales like Japan and the UK, but down in others like Germany. (I am not disputing theses hypotheses as false, btw, as there is ample evidence that in order situations of e.g. economic turndown or e.g. isolation severe adverse effects occurred&#x2F;occur; tho it remains to be seen what damage there actually will be)<p>Given how you seem all about the evidence, this should give you pause.<p>I agree that the effects of measures have to be weighted against the good of measures - namely &quot;curve flattening&quot;. However, I still do think that the initial lockdowns were warranted as a short term measure, and that future, more fine-grained (hotspot) lockdowns are warranted.<p>Then there are other measures, such as facemasks... some people dispute the effectiveness... But really, that&#x27;s a no-brainer now; even if it turns out the masks are not effective at all, the worst that came out of it really is mild discomfort wearing them (exceptions for medical conditions of course apply) - and some morons shouting at each other for either wearing a mask or not wearing a mask.')
