It&#x27;s really quite impressive and also much easier to program.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=V6X4QSP0NpY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=V6X4QSP0NpY</a><p>The real issue is that the synth universe has contracted around a relatively small number of &quot;classic&quot; synth sounds. You have the Moog bass, the supersaw pad, various dreamy pads, various EDM plucks. the TB303 squelch, Oberheim brass, various dubstep pseudo-vocal woobs and buzzes, various clockwork-like sequences, and so on. There are maybe a few hundred of these sounds, and to music consumers they all sound like &quot;synth.&quot;<p>Even with vintage analog, the space of potential sounds is much, much bigger. But the number of people who are real sound design virtuosos - as opposed to patching up some kind of raspy randomness on Eurorack - is <i>tiny.</i><p>It&#x27;s so much easier to treat sounds as presets or as imitations of the &quot;classics&quot; - which are often imitations of imitations - instead of approaching sound design as an imaginative exercise in mood and association.<p>So that&#x27;s why some analog synths have legendary status. The promise is a legendary sound <i>without having to do much work.</i> And that&#x27;s a very boring reason to play with synthesizers.')
