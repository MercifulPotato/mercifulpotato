Item(by='asdffdsa', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609434298, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25594231, text='I&#x27;d argue that there&#x27;s culture and there&#x27;s vultures.  In any place, a community of people create a unique culture.<p>Geeks create most of the artifacts &amp; traditions of that culture, but the entire community (either passively or actively) contributes, supports, and adds to it.<p>When that culture blows up, the vultures move there because they find value to exploit in that culture, while simultaneously supplanting&#x2F;destroying&#x2F;building over that culture.<p>In your example, maybe the local (&quot;earlier groupie&quot;) who studied chemical engineering knows the artists, supports their shows, smokes with them, shares his or her life with them, and has the culture ingrained in them even if that person isn&#x27;t directly an artist or geek.<p>Continuing the example, contrast this with a &quot;later groupie&quot; who would move to said location.  This person might move into a new highrise development that used to be the warehouse where aforementioned artist &amp; chemical engineer would kick it on weekends.  The vulture will also support noise ordinance laws that would kill the informal events&#x2F;performances of the culture that said chemical engineer used to attend, and where said artist would perform his or her art when that person was still &#x27;underground&#x27;.')
