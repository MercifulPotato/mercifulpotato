If you absolutely need a truly distributed filesystem then AFS is your only real option. But really a filesystem is almost certainly not the right interface; you&#x27;re almost certainly better off using something higher-level - maybe HDFS if you need to store file-like data, maybe a key-value store or a distributed queuing system if you&#x27;re doing something more structured.')
