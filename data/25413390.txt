There are plenty of providers who offer DNS services for free or cheap, and have great privacy guarantees. I&#x27;m specifically looking for providers that will host your custom DNS records, and guarantee that all queries to those records are not logged. The few providers that I found who ran private DNS services and allowed for managed DNS still collected analytics when you hosted custom records, and did not allow for those analytics to be disabled.<p>If you know of any such services, I&#x27;d be super grateful if you could link them below, and&#x2F;or share any experience you have with them. Thanks!')
