They&#x27;re waiting until the public anger has dissipated enough that they can weather the reaction when they announce that no one will be punished. The British always do this to save their toffs, see Chilcot or Hillsborough.<p>Everybody has to report on the initial disaster, and after each wave of the media cycle, more outlets decide to stop reporting on the story (or for many, decide if they can get away with stopping.) The government press releases get fewer and trickle to a near stop, so now the only press releases they&#x27;re getting are from victims groups and lawyers which are easy to ignore. Eventually a report is released that condemns everyone for incompetence and nobody for malice, and a recently retired fall guy is chosen to have some moderate consequences, like a retroactive reduction in rank that slightly affects their pension.<p>If our rulers weren&#x27;t protected from consequences, they&#x27;d have to be competent.
