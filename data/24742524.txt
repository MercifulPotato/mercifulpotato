We (as a household) probably order a couple of things from Amazon a week.  We&#x27;ve had a couple of things not live up to expectations, and a handful of returns, but nothing like used underwear.  I do tend to stick to the Prime vendors and not wander off into the dark corners of Amazon.  Maybe that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve not (knowingly) been bitten by counterfeits or returns.<p>I know it&#x27;s a <i>caveat emptor</i> environment, but it&#x27;s worked for me.  It&#x27;s eBay that I have to watch like a hawk (just assume if you buy an electronic component, you have at best a 50-50 chance of it not being crap).  I&#x27;m curious as to the wide variety of experiences I see from others.')
