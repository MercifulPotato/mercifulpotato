A lockdown can have generations of consequences - what doesn&#x27;t? - but it cannot be paid for by generations to come. It was paid for now, resources were reallocated and consumed.<p>The risk is more subtle. If a group of people develop who have nothing to lose, then they lose nothing by being very violent and destroying stuff. Physical destruction of assets is something that can cause long-term damage. The lockdowns take away options from people who don&#x27;t have many.')
