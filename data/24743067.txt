I did some research and I found [this page](<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oehive.org&#x2F;VersionHistory.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oehive.org&#x2F;VersionHistory.html</a>) which says that SQL-89 support was added in 1988, but SQL-92 support wasn&#x27;t added until 2000.<p>But even so, SQL-89 is very anemic and not very expressive compared to SQL-92 (I&#x27;m thinking primarily of the support for different types of JOIN expressions), and the fact it took them 8 years to add SQL-92 support is telling (consider that MS Access 97 supported most of SQL-92). I can&#x27;t find any information suggesting that Progress&#x2F;OpenEdge implements later standards like SQL-1999 and SQL-2003 which add features I use on an almost daily-basis (recursive CTEs and window functions respectively).<p>&gt; my point was it was direct and inline access to data<p>Doesn&#x27;t that place architecture-based restrictions on performance though - how well does concurrency and transactions work in their OLTP model?')
