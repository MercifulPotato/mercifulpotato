I would have expected a digital pin be used to control the microphone in software<p>Yup, and even if the same pin drives both the LED and the microphone power switch, there&#x27;s various attacks (e.g. high frequency PWM 75% duty cycle-- enough to light the LED to nearly full brightness, but also probably enough to keep the mic bypass capacitor nearly fully charged).<p>Since the SOC can only turn off mute, and not turn it back on, any attempt to eavesdrop would leave evidence (a mute LED left off).')
