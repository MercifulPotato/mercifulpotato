There are two kind of rocks I saw it foundering on; one is luxury goods. Davok umbrellas; marketed as a luxury good -really, it&#x27;s just a badass umbrella -maybe last one I ever need buy; very well made -almost worth what they cost.<p>The other rock it could founder on is green. I mean, if you buy something once, that&#x27;s pretty green, but so often this sort of thing turns into sackcloth and ashes or absurd high fashion sackcloth and ashes that cost too much. The green variety is already a sort of consumer preference in Germany, but I think their idea has some &quot;well made&quot; meaning as well (nachhaltig? I dunno).<p>Here were a couple of places like that my German pals sent me early this year when I was thinking about it in earnest:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.manufactum.de&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.manufactum.de&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;utopia.de&#x2F;bestenlisten&#x2F;onlineshops&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;utopia.de&#x2F;bestenlisten&#x2F;onlineshops&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biber.de&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.biber.de&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.torquato.de&#x2F;haus-wohnen&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.torquato.de&#x2F;haus-wohnen&#x2F;</a><p>Anyway, it&#x27;s just a bunch of disconnected thoughts in my mind. Good on you for taking it further. I had thought the sibyl problem would make a rotten tomatoes type thing too difficult if it ever got juice (even if it didn&#x27;t; bots are everywhere linking trash products). I had also thought it would be very difficult to scale as a manually proctored catalog of carefully assessed things, and it would be real easy to corrupt if you don&#x27;t scale to the right kinds of reviewers.<p>The world does need more stuff like this. People who make shitty products should be punished.')
