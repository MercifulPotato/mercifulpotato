Here’s Yann LeCun [1].<p>I will concede that I forgot about DeepFakes. How’d I do that? But still, cool now we can live in a dystopian future.<p>The point that I was trying to make still stands. Assuming that more data and more compute will solve all of our problems is a ridiculous position. The field might be moving incredibly fast, but most of the work I see is not great. Everyone is hyped. People claiming that we can replace all of statistics and machine learning with pure deep learning models forget about how hard it is to actually get these things working in the first place. Do you have 100 TPUs to run full blast for a week? I mean consider the series of Nature papers a few years ago. Google says, “I can predict earthquakes using NNs!” Somebody comes along and says, “I thought about the problem for a little bit and beat you with logistic regression.”<p>Self-driving cars have been just around the corner for the last 10 years. Just like with the rest of stats and ML, it’s not the place you have a lot of data that’ll kill you. It’s the edge cases.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.facebook.com&#x2F;yann.lecun&#x2F;posts&#x2F;10157253205637143?notif_id=1603803722095314&amp;notif_t=story_reshare&amp;ref=notif" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.facebook.com&#x2F;yann.lecun&#x2F;posts&#x2F;10157253205637143?no...</a>')
