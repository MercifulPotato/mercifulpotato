My Jewish German grandfather&#x27;s father was taken by the Nazis and beaten. Somehow he managed to escape.<p>They lost the family bakery on Kristellnacht.<p>His synagogue was burnt down that night as well.<p>My grandfather routinely got beaten up at&#x2F;after school by Hitler Youth.<p>Not to mention many other things.<p>After immigrating to the US he was drafted at 16 to fight in WWII and landed in Normandy on D-Day, where he almost drowned because his landing vessel opened too far from shore and he didn&#x27;t know how to swim. And his unit was also captured later and he could understand the soldiers who&#x27;d captured them debating in German whether to kill them or not.<p>Crazy stories.<p>I know some people are desensitized to it by now, but whenever classmates in school would throw up the Nazi salute at me because they knew I was Jewish or make other anti-Semitic comments&#x2F;jokes &quot;in jest&quot; always made my blood boil.<p>I still feel this way and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be desensitized.<p>Even in middle school two decades ago I understood there was a huge lack of Holocaust education.<p>I hope someday that changes.<p>I&#x27;m just glad my grandfather is still alive for now and that he was able to share his family&#x27;s story in a Shoah Foundation interview (I recommend anyone curious to look them up [0]); Shoah Foundation was able to gather a plethora of interviews of Holocaust survivors specifically for this reason of educating about what happened.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfi.usc.edu&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sfi.usc.edu&#x2F;</a> (USC Shoah Foundation)')
