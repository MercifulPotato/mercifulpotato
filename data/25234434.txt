Many of these will be interesting and have some real merit, but most of them wont.<p>Then, give people the retweet button, and have them act as a filter for the most convincing looking bullshit. What gets retweeted? Is it the most throughly researched content? Highly unlikely, most people aren&#x27;t experts in the subject (heck, I don&#x27;t even dare go into the mechanics of the theory, only the math and stats) but they will still retweet if they find it interesting and plausible.<p>Oh, having some perceived authority (Nobel prize, etc) also helps a lot with this process.<p>Fourth, trick people by giving them dopamine system rewards (notifications for retweets and likes). They inevitably end up surrounded by a group of supporters that praise and retweet what they say. This whole process makes it so much harder for people (even scientists) to go back on what they said if it turns out they were wrong.<p>So what do you end up with? You end up with a system that delivers the most perfect bullshit to the largest number of people. The scientists that tweet the same old boring conservative stuff (words like &quot;likely&quot; often appear) are largely voiceless.<p>I don&#x27;t think any single person is necessarily at fault in this system. But I do think that the system is a total disaster, and we have to invent something better than this. These simplistic social network designs are failing humanity.')
