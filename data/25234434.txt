Many of these will be interesting and have some real merit, but most of them wont. (By itself, this doesn&#x27;t do much - we&#x27;re people, we generate ideas and theories, many of them wrong - nothing special about this process).<p>Then, give people the retweet button, and have them act as a filter for the most convincing looking bullshit. This is where things go terribly wrong. Retweets are a powerful amplifier. What gets retweeted? Is it the most throughly researched content? Highly unlikely, most people aren&#x27;t experts in the subject (heck, I don&#x27;t even dare go into the mechanics of the theory, only the math and stats) but they will still retweet if they find it interesting, plausible and aligned with what they strongly believe or wish was true.<p>Side note: having some authority (Nobel prize, etc) also helps a lot with this process. Still, remember that social networks won&#x27;t differentiate whether 1 scientist is actually having this idea or many, and worse, it won&#x27;t necessarily inform you if many scientists are actually demonstrating how the idea is wrong (unless they make it equally interesting for a retweet)<p>Finally, trick people by giving them dopamine system rewards (notifications for retweets and likes). They inevitably end up surrounded by a group of supporters that praise and retweet what they say. This whole process makes it so much harder for people (even scientists) to go back on what they said if it turns out they were wrong.<p>So what do you end up with? You end up with a system that delivers the most perfect bullshit to the largest number of people. The scientists that tweet the same old boring conservative stuff (words like &quot;likely&quot; often appear) are largely voiceless.<p>I don&#x27;t think any single person is necessarily at fault in this system. But I do think that the system is a total disaster, and we have to invent something better than this. These simplistic social network designs are failing humanity.')
