I have two pairs of studio monitor headphones on my desk (Sony MDR-V6 and BeyerDynamic DT770s) and I&#x27;m usually too lazy to put them on because the Q10s are good enough for anything but detailed audio work.  They&#x27;re $40, and often on sale for $30.  I returned a pair of $230 Sony WH-1000XM3s because Sony has jumped the shark in the bass wars and you couldn&#x27;t get them to sound reasonable without EQing the source.  The $30 Q10s literally sound better.')
