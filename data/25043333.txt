What everyone finds hard to believe is your assertion that data is ever moved from tape back into warm storage during the ordinary course of business. Enterprises use tape for backup. They only read data off tapes after something goes very wrong, or periodically to verify that their backup process is actually working. But except after a catastrophe, data read from tape is not routinely used to re-populate warm storage.')
