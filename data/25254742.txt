It&#x27;s also going to be cheaper to reuse existing, functioning cell modules (such as folks harvesting cell packs from Teslas and other EVs for stationary storage) than to landfill or recycle those materials.<p>Batteries are mostly recyclable currently, full stop, although there is work required to make them 100% recyclable.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redwoodmaterials.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redwoodmaterials.com&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pv-magazine.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;25&#x2F;innovation-boosts-lithium-ion-battery-recycling-rate-to-over-80" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pv-magazine.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;25&#x2F;innovation-boosts-lit...</a>')
