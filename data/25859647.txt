People go to a music venue for the music, they go to a bar for the drinks and a resturant for the food.<p>If the bar had no drinks, it could hardly be called a bar. Similarly, a resturant with no food is hardly a resturant.<p>In that meantime, where the reason to go there is missing, these are all just rooms with the potential to be something later. The same goes for the music venue; it&#x27;s just a big room that could be a music venue if there were actual musicians there.')
