Item(by='sradman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605552146, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25113595, text='&gt; All residents in the nursing-home receive chronic vitamin D supplementation with regular maintenance boluses (single oral dose of 80,000 IU vitamin D3 every 2–3 months), without systematically performing serum control test as recommended in French nursing-homes due to the very high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D reaching 90–100 % in this population. Here, the &quot;Intervention group&quot; was defined as all COVID-19 residents who received an oral bolus of 80,000 IU vitamin D3 either in the week following the suspicion or diagnosis of COVID-19, or during the previous month. The &quot;Comparator group&quot; corresponded to all other COVID-19 residents who did not receive any recent vitamin D supplementation. None received D2 or intramuscular supplements. All medications were dispended and supervised by a nurse.<p>All of these vitamin D studies seem to expose a single truth; serum vitamin D tests are too expensive. I suspect that these papers with inferred rather than measured vitamin D levels will continue until an easy and low cost vitamin D test is developed.')
