Making complicated technology simple, intuitive, and trouble-free, and hiding the complexities behind the scenes.  Technically, an Electric Car fits that description too.<p>The challenge is that the complexities of an EV are similar, but greater in scale than for consumer electronic devices - more parts, more complex supply chains, more extensive support network (charging stations, maintenance providers).<p>Whether Apple can scale up to handle those increased complexities, and whether they calculate it&#x27;s financially worth it for them, I doubt anyone outside Apple can really know at this time.')
