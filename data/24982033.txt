Item(by='RcouF1uZ4gsC', descendants=None, kids=[24982677], score=None, time=1604425979, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24981759, text='&gt; Wal-Mart putting their own brand of toilet paper on more prominent end cap shelves is fundamentally different than Amazon promoting their own Amazon Basics toilet paper on a search results page on Amazon.com.<p>The other fundamental difference is scale. It can physically walk down the toilet paper aisle in Walmart in see all the available toilet papers in less than a minute. In fact, I can probably wander the entire Walmart store in about 30-45 minutes and see everything they are selling in that store. It is not entirely impractical.<p>On the other hand it is impractical for me to go through all the items Amazon is selling. Thus what they are promoting becomes much more important.')
