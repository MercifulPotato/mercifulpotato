Bitcoin is just one member of a larger cluster of cryptocurrencies. There are certainly some cryptocurrencies for which it is not so obvious that governments <i>will</i> be able to enforce exactly the same laws as they enforce now.<p>That said, even with Bitcoin, I do think it shifted the world ever so slightly in a new direction of financial independence which just wasn&#x27;t there before. There is something distinctly different about sending money to someone else in any part of the world just by typing their address, with no one being able to stop you. With traditional methods, governments could impose and <i>have</i> regularly interfered and imposed bureaucracy already on this sending step. With Bitcoin they do not do this because it isn&#x27;t very practical.')
