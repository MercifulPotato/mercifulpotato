The Lenovo Chromebook Duet is probably the first ARM-based Chromebook where I haven&#x27;t felt constrained to keeping only three tabs open (and although it still struggles with some of the largest spreadsheets and dashboards at work, it is a delightful second-screen device).<p>But I think the M1 still has an edge because of the vertical integration between software and hardware -- if you previously wrote an app against Core Video or Metal, it should get hardware acceleration once you recompile it for the M1. Whereas if similar accelerators were exposed in Linux or Windows you&#x27;d probably have to write against a new custom API&#x2F;library (such as nvenc).')
