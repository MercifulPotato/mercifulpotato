So it&#x27;s completely reliable, and I don&#x27;t ever have to worry about it not working.<p>Regarding i3&#x27;s config, it&#x27;s really easy, and except for occasionally telling i3 the title of windows I&#x27;d like to float by default, I haven&#x27;t touched my i3 config in decades.<p>As for how I use i3, I mostly have one full window taking up the entire screen, with other windows in the background, as tabs that I can switch to.  That&#x27;s 99% of my use.  Occasionally I manually make a window float, when I want some odd-sized window or want it to overlap another window, and some windows I make float by default.  These floating windows are all very temporary.  Sometimes I&#x27;ll also change my tiling configuration so that more than one window appears on the screen at the same time, but that&#x27;s also pretty rare, but it&#x27;s there when I want it.<p>Overall, I&#x27;m much happier with a tiling WM than with a floating WM, because with a tiling WM I don&#x27;t have to manually fiddle with window resizing, stacking, or positioning.  99% of the time i3 just automatically does the right thing without requiring any interaction from me.<p>It would be nice to use emacs for this, but it&#x27;s just not nearly stable enough or reliable enough for me.')
