And sure, the truth is that a lot of people there weren&#x27;t very bright and things got out of hand. But even the people taking selfies and souvenirs whilst the considerably-less-harmless guys in military fatigues carrying flex cuffs looked for Pence didn&#x27;t fear punishment for their actions. You could tell that by the way they gave their names and itemised the crimes they&#x27;d committed to media outlets they supposed were sympathetic or livestreamed the whole thing.<p>Sure, a huge mob of people trying to get into a building not explicitly designed to be a fortress isn&#x27;t easy to stop, and with the limited resources available evacuation was probably the right move, but what we actually saw on video in front of the Capitol was a line of about six police and a movable fence, and open doors. I&#x27;ve seen more convincing looking security at music festivals. You can try to deter people by <i>what might happen if they try</i> rather than <i>what happens if they succeed</i>, especially if they&#x27;re crazy people who think what will actually happen if they succeed is President Trump giving them a medal.')
