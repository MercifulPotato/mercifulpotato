So that&#x27;s not really an argument against carbon credits.<p>I&#x27;m not saying technology has no role to play - but this specific choice of technologies by Stripe seems dubious to me, and seems to optimize for futuristic enthusiasm rather than potential impact.<p>I&#x27;m not against researching uncertain technology. But <i>all</i> of these projects are about aiming for highly-uncertain technology to solve our problems. Not a single one is about changing the way we live or relying on proven techniques. See why I&#x27;m talking about Silicon Valley bias here?')
