Soft tissues, bones, tendons... I want to take hundreds of images of the normal state and compare when something is weird.<p>Interpretation of images is hard but we can learn it. And it will be much more data that we can feed to ML models to help us make sense of it.<p>To this day I&#x27;m still puzzled that I can&#x27;t buy a â‚¬100 device and look inside myself.')
