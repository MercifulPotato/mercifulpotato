Just to add a few more things to the &#x27;todo&#x27;-list:<p>4. Keep a check on those elements on &#x27;our&#x27; side that are dependent on conflict with some &#x27;other&#x27;. If the last decades have taught us anything I think it is that a polarized environment is forced on us by an alliance of extremists on both sides that thrive on conflict. People who don&#x27;t shy away from provocations, false flag operations or falsified intelligence to achieve their antagonistic goals.<p>5. Remove as many incentives as possible for petty criminals to be recruited by terrorists. Make sure every citizen  have a place and belong in society. Let&#x27;s not make terrorist actions a shortcut to herostratic fame [0]<p>6. Actively research and promote alternatives to a revenge mentality in society. Revenge appeals to us because it is a reptilian brain response to harm on a personal basis. It is useless as a response to terrorist strategists (it just makes us their puppets).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Herostratus" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Herostratus</a>')
