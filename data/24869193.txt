Item(by='candu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603459416, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24868534, text='Yes - there is likely a &quot;high-risk, high-reward&quot; dynamic here, which is entirely consistent with both your and OP&#x27;s descriptions: the long tail will toil uselessly, while the lucky few will a) discover that they were right about its significance, b) be in a position to explore and articulate that significance, and c) find themselves suddenly at the top of a new field with few competitors.<p>On the other hand: there&#x27;s a second interpretation of all this, which is that doing just about anything big - a major product launch, a body of research, etc. - involves a lot of drudgery.  In other words, even big significant things involve a lot of work that looks silly &#x2F; insignificant.  I would agree that learning to commit to that drudgery, and to see it as necessary and even occasionally enjoyable (or at least meditative), is essential to reach a positive outcome.  (Which is not to say that all drudgery has value, or that we shouldn&#x27;t still seek to reduce &#x2F; manage toil over time: it&#x27;s also possible to fall into the trap of assuming all drudgery is of equal value, which it definitely is not.)')
