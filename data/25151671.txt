Item(by='eitland', descendants=None, kids=[25155575], score=None, time=1605806094, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25151378, text='In my experience Google is now about as bad as their competition was when they broke through: lots of irrelevant cruft on every single search, and not just spam but completely unrelated pages that doesn&#x27;t contain a single keyword from my search.<p>DuckDuckGo isn&#x27;t fabulous either but it is faster to retry in Google from DDG than the other way around so it is my default search engine now.<p>I wonder: why is it soooo hard - for both DDG and Google to just respect + or &quot;&quot; or the verbatim option in Googles case?<p>Because an empty set is far more valuable to me than a rich set of irrelevant results?<p>(Lately it seems I&#x27;ve been assigned to an experiment that has slightly better results and also shows me the context they think are relevant in the results page. That helps immensely, but of course I have no way to get that to stick :-&#x2F; )<p>PS: If anyone wants a billion dollar idea, recreate Google from before the DoubleClick acquisition: contextual ads, relevant results. Because that spot is empty, and given Moores law, the fact that the original PageRank patent has expired and more it should cost a tenth today vs then. Also Google seems to be collapsing under their own weight so there&#x27;s less chance they manage to catch up.<p>PPS: I&#x27;d pay 10USD a month <i>and accept contextual ads on top of that</i> to get back something like old Google.')
