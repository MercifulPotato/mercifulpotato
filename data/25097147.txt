And I tried to get my friends away from WhatsApp. Over half of the people asked me how to send voice messages. I came across this ticket while searching for the feature: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vector-im&#x2F;element-web&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1358" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vector-im&#x2F;element-web&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1358</a>\nFrom then on, it was clear to me that I could stop my attempts to bring people to Matrix. To be honest, the discussion in the ticket frustrated me deeply. The ticket is open since 2016 and the topics discussed in it are not oriented towards the users of this world, but towards some almost completely uninteresting technical details. Over the years, several people have intensively pointed out how important this feature is. Those responsible must pull themselves together and find a solution for it.')
