There is no ISO C function to find the first occurrence of any one of a bag of multi-byte characters, though it&#x27;s not difficult to write one.<p>&gt; <i>I have been told it doesn&#x27;t make sense to break on whitespace for Chinese text.</i><p>It could make sense to break on whitespace in some programming language or data format that allows Chinese (and other) identifiers.<p>A command interpreter that allows Chinese arguments (such as file names) wants to break on spaces, as usual.<p>&gt; <i>if a delimiter appears as part of a multi byte sequence, you may see strange results.</i><p>UTF-8 was designed by a dyed-in-the-wool C-and-Unix engineer, who ensured that such a thing can&#x27;t happen. No character in the 0x00-0x7F range can occur in a multi-byte character.<p>The byte which starts a UTF-8 character cannot occur anywhere other than at the start, which is why we can use strstr to look for it.')
