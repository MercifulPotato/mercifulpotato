If I cut it or take its babies and it produces a response that indicates it doesn&#x27;t like that, then I don&#x27;t eat it. Fruits easily pass this test because the plant encourages us to take them (although I recognize that we&#x27;ve gamed that system and it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re hunter gatherers anymore accidentally spreading seeds for the plant&#x27;s benefit). Vegetables less so, but the response is nowhere near as visible as mammals and birds and fish and even bees. I recognize that pain is also a squishy, debatable concept but personally this is a situation where I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll have a rigorous intellectual framework in our lifetime so we just have to trust our intuitions; which is why there&#x27;s so much disagreement (your intuition might be the opposite of mine).<p>I&#x27;ll also mention however that I&#x27;m not solely vegan for ethical purposes so my conviction in veganism doesn&#x27;t hinge on being perfect here. When I realized the health, environmental, and spiritual benefits of veganism, in addition to the ethical angle,  it was a pretty easy decision to make.<p>But to your point, yes I do think we (everyone, not just vegans) are biased towards bigger creatures that we can see with the naked eye.')
