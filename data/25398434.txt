Given that I mostly listen to news shows while doing something else (and hence rarely finish a particular episode) this makes the whole system near useless.<p>I may be missing something basic, or if you have any tips on the discoverability of Alexa commands, I&#x27;d be very grateful. But in my experience, the discoverability of voice commands is the worst I&#x27;ve ever come across; at least with CLI you have man pages, and with a GUI, even in the worst case of no documentation and obscure icons, there are buttons to explore through trial and error.')
