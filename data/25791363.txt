For some reason the tool is called &#x27;grep&#x27;. The name is followed by &#x27;-r&#x27; then the search term, then the directory to start the search in.<p>And it won&#x27;t be long before you start encountering tools with such intuitive names as &#x27;sed&#x27; and &#x27;awk&#x27; and &#x27;crontab&#x27;<p>The tool for finding a file by name is better - that&#x27;s called &#x27;find&#x27; - except compared to grep the arguments are swapped: The directory to search is now the first parameter, not the last.<p>Oh, to find the *.desktop files on your system you did a find on &#x2F; ? Yes, the messages like &quot;find: ‘&#x2F;proc&#x2F;19917&#x2F;fd’: Permission denied&quot; are normal, you should ignore them. It&#x27;s easy, simply add 2&gt;&#x2F;dev&#x2F;null to the command.<p>Before you know it, the command line infects your brain and you start saying things like &quot;sudo and nohup are perfectly good names&quot;')
