Always thought the husband took a big financial hit. But yeah, our situation ended up being exactly as you described (she gets to keep the house but has to pay me my share of it).<p>&gt; I think you look forward to therapy because it&#x27;s someone to talk with about personal stuff and it&#x27;s your only outlet currently for that.<p>Therapy is definitely my social moment of the week, and I think you&#x27;re right that that&#x27;s why I look forward to it. I thought I had made friends at work over the years (considering how much we did outside of work), but they pretty much seem to have reverted to being just coworkers, despite me repeatedly reaching out for 2-3 months at the start of the pandemic (just to chat, not to do stuff outside - we&#x27;re all pretty freaked out). I eventually gave up.<p>&gt; Let me also suggest that you may need to work on cleaning your house.<p>I don&#x27;t think that part is a problem. I really dislike messy places, so I keep my place clean and tidy at all times. And I&#x27;m a minimalist, so there&#x27;s not much to clean to begin with.<p>I definitely need some form of social thing.')
