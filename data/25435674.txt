The 2600 has two sprites per line plus a few single-bit objects.  There&#x27;s a particular way to reuse sprites within the same scanline, but only at certain fixed intervals which isn&#x27;t what we see here, plus strobing the positioning register that fast requires every single CPU cycle so it&#x27;s impossible to also write the color and playfield registers at the same time.<p>Source: I know the 2600 well, I wrote and published a homebrew game: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dos486.com&#x2F;atari&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dos486.com&#x2F;atari&#x2F;</a>')
