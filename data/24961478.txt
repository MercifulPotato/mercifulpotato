Consumers do not generally have choice of who tows them, and the OP article hints at the huge inefficiencies that come with private towing, and extent to which consumers aren&#x27;t benefitting from &quot;free market&quot; competition in this case.<p>A gang war between two truck companies is obviously very inefficient, but so too is the extreme day-to-day competition for tows. You&#x27;re right that the government-run scenario would involve idle capacity, but the OP article describes a situation where there is already an especially wasteful and ridiculous form of over-capacity (multiple drivers racing to the scene of a crash, a waste of fuel and labor capacity). The &quot;surveillance system&quot; you mention is already in place in the private towing example, it&#x27;s just a wildly inefficient version that lacks centralized dispatch.<p>Government-run liquor stores are also a perfect counter-example to your point--their whole purpose is to <i>not</i> provide the most convenient consumer-friendly option possible, and instead to reduce easy access to liquor and attempt to rein in some of the negative externalities that come with it. For the record, I&#x27;m not a fan of that approach, but in many cases it&#x27;s an example of government succeeding in what it set out to do, not the reverse.')
