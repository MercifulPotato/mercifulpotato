Think of it like low range.<p>&quot;muh instant 0rpm torque&quot; is absolutely nothing compared to the inertia of a hired driver who doesn&#x27;t care (or is just a novice) dumping the clutch.  Building a transmission to handle electric motor loads isn&#x27;t a particularly remarkable engineering challenge.  (Though you can make any engineering exercise challenging if you add sufficient weight and budgetary constraints)<p>Imagine a medium or heavier truck that&#x27;s expected to both get a load moving at low speed and to cruise at 80.  Putting anything near peak power through an electric motor at low speeds lets the magic smoke out in short order.  Sure you can gear it down but then you have insane rpm at high speed and the wonderful engineering problem of getting that insanely overbuilt motor to not fling itself apart at those speed.  A simple two speed transmission is a far more elegant solution.  Especially since a transmission for an electric motor can be far simpler than one for an ICE.  Letting the magic smoke out was a big problem in early EV conversions because power was low and consequently the vehicles available for conversion didn&#x27;t have lots of good options for deep gearing.')
