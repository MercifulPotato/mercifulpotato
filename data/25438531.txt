Although written language does eventually call upon highly visual parts of the mind, the structures and mechanisms I visualize when reading code are more highly dimensional than the initial mentally vocal interpretation of text. A program small enough to hold entirely in my mind that I know well, such as a piece of demo-scene code I&#x27;m golfing, is a sort of multifaceted non-visual abstract sculpture with features and values that interconnect in a seamless manner that I can interact with and predict the effect of my modifications on. I highly enjoy being utterly engulfed in the flow of this simultaneously logical and artistic activity.')
