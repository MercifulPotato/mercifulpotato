In almost all situations I&#x27;ve encountered, it&#x27;s easier to &#x27;git pull foo &amp;&amp; cd foo &amp;&amp; docker-compose up&#x27; than it is to install and configure a mishmash of individual services to work in tandem.<p>A Dockerfile may be complex for any piece of the stack. But now this complexity is not part of deploying the application. Each component has its own build process which is decoupled from the others. And even a really complex installation process results in a deployment process that works the same way.<p>If you can&#x27;t see these benefits then maybe you haven&#x27;t had to deal with complex software installation. Or maybe you haven&#x27;t had to run the same stack on your laptop that you run in production. But if you ever get to the point that you want to deploy something in more than one place, or more than once to a single place, it really makes things much easier.')
