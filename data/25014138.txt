I&#x27;ve been learning web design and python for the last 6 - 7 months and I&#x27;m enjoying it, but am worried that I&#x27;ve missed the boat on coding (too far behind at my age &#x2F; the market for programmers is getting oversaturated).<p>My ultimate goal is to work at (or potentially found) a company working to address climate change and transition to a greener economy. I&#x27;m really interested in synthetic biology as a pathway to this and thinking about doing a master&#x27;s in biomedical or biochemical engineering.<p>My question is what skills do you think will take me the most upstream for my goals? What skills open the most doors?<p>I like programming because it actually allows me to build my ideas. Is programming and biology a good combination? Is programming worth pursuing? If so, what area of programming should I focus in on?<p>Are there skills that I&#x27;m overlooking?')
