At least, the ones I write are. No state, no logic, no real ‘behaviour’. As soon as you introduce a fake that really has an underlying state and maybe some kind of validation logic (assuming that you want tests to make sure you can’t insert nonsense&#x2F;retrieve non-existent stuff), you’ve introduced a ton of new and completely meaningless failure points.')
