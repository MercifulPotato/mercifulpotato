MDN owes this guy nothing, and this guy owes MDN nothing. But attribution, and the volunteer labor, are not part of any financial transaction, so the question of who formally owes who what is entirely irrelevant<p>But from the <i>social contract</i>, attribution is a perfectly fair expectation for this kind of work -- especially because at the time of, and even going forward, attribution was given. It may not have been codified as a public contract, but the relationship was, and is, quite clear.<p>And the breaking of that relationship for fairly arbitrary reasons (it couldn&#x27;t be imported&#x2F;converted?) is a pretty damn good reason to be annoyed -- hell, what <i>other</i> reason would you consider valid? If it was financial rather than social, you don&#x27;t get angry, you get even (lawsuit).<p>Now I&#x27;m getting annoyed as I write this; its not a fucking privilege to have been given the honor of doing volunteer labor, and its not a fucking privilege to be given attribution for it -- it&#x27;s like the most basic free compensation you can give for free work. It&#x27;s a norm across the board')
