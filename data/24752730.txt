Oh no, updates galore. Ok fine.<p>- Those updates broke my IDE&#x2F;dependencies&#x2F;network driver etc. Let&#x27;s fix that as well.<p>- Let&#x27;s research a gazillion libs to see which one can help with my idea. Ah, none of them. So let&#x27;s first implement this (for the actual problem) irrelevant, but elaborate base module.<p>- Meanwhile: more updates.<p>- Grrr. I should have picked another language. Or no, let&#x27;s start again with new shiny, because it&#x27;s better suited (also not BLUB programmer).<p>- My wife got the updates too. Guess what I have to fix now because I&#x27;m into computers.<p>- Damn, hours passed and I achieved nothing valuable so far. Back to work. Wait what? Work?.<p>- Screw that, I&#x27;m spending the time with my son playing electric guitar.<p>So, there you have it.<p>Edit: Corrected typos.')
