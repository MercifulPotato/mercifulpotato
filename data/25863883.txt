While I did have employer provided healthcare, I was hired as a contract worker at Google X on their flagship robotics research project as a mechatronics prototype engineer and later a test engineer. I worked for two years alongside full time employees on the same exact things as full time employees. But they got stock, parties, and other special treats that contractors did not. Almost 50% of the team - I think the legal limit - were contractor roles.<p>While I do appreciate that from their perspective it makes sense, it is also true that if we don&#x27;t fight to protect workers, all jobs will go this way. That&#x27;s actually why what an up-thread comment said is a great idea. If we decouple important things like healthcare from employment, then everyone gets important quality of life care without employers having to restrict benefits. If we do not fight for ourselves, we will end up in a situation where most people cannot access the basic necessities of life. Already in the US millions of Americans are without healthcare.')
