You&#x27;d think if this was the experience of even a minor fraction of their customers (beyond the HN commenters who claim this is wide spread in every Amazon topic), they wouldn&#x27;t be breaking record sales every quarter.<p>Come on, you know as well as I that there is not necessarily a correlation there: between record quarter sales and counterfeit products. I agree that claims of 50% counterfeit products is an exaggeration but to point to their quarterly sales is as refutation is silly.<p>Sales could be increasing for any number of reasons unrelated to customer satisfaction. Cusatomers could be unaware they are purchasing counterfeit products, etc.')
