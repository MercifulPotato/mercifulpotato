I only have a library card for my city, but I&#x27;ve been to libraries all over the suburbs to read their books (on the premises), write, attend events, and even secure meeting rooms (just needed my driver&#x27;s license).<p>Actually when I was poor that was one thing I did a decent amount of, was just hang out at libraries. Although I&#x27;ve never been so poor I didn&#x27;t own a working computer, either, although I came close once. One time, when my computer died I spent a couple weeks hunting down a cheap one (just the tower) for $80 on Craigslist that wasn&#x27;t too much of a downgrade from what I had (mine was kind of old to begin with).<p>I don&#x27;t remember exactly what was wrong with it. I want to say it was the power supply fried, but if that&#x27;s the case, I don&#x27;t know why I thought I couldn&#x27;t just buy a replacement for the same cost. Maybe I just felt I couldn&#x27;t afford to take the chance.')
