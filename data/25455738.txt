I imagine it&#x27;s just catchy marketing like the defund the police movement (it&#x27;s really about adjusting their duties in specific situations by augmenting the force with civil servants of different training).<p>You spend 40ish years working and funding Medicare with a 3% tax to use it for 20ish, with still paying these costs. I don&#x27;t see how it would be feasible to extend the plan to everyone under that system (kids never paid in, how do they get coverage; what about young adults with no work history nor the savings to pay the premiums?). So the proposed systems must be fundamentally different from that.')
