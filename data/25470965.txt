I can see how this is a nifty demo of how the Matrix protocol can support many use cases, but the base use case (open communications) isn&#x27;t nearly complete yet.<p>Element is the only application supporting all Matrix features, but it&#x27;s look and feel are off, it&#x27;s speed leave things to be desired and I&#x27;m still getting issues with fetching the right keys for a chatroom on some of my devices. The file picker on mobile is wonky, some very basic features (like adding a caption to an image you&#x27;re sending) just don&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m definitely not convincing anyone to consider this over the existing, isolated, closed-source messaging applications out there.<p>Then there&#x27;s the fact that there&#x27;s very little chat clients that support most of the protocol, especially with encryption. To combat this, you can run pantalaimon if you can ever get it to work (its dependency on things like dbus makes it very hard to run well on a VM or in a container) to add encryption to more well-integrated chat clients like Fractal.<p>I love the premise and the idea behind Matrix, but I do fear that the focus on expanding and experimenting will eventually prevent it from reaching the critical mass necessary to ever be used outside of the enthusiast circle. All the (optional?) additions to the protocol also make me fear that Matrix will end up dead like XMPP, with different features implemented across different applications all in a way that things just don&#x27;t work well together.<p>Why put all of this work into running a daemon 24&#x2F;7 on your phone that will end up sucking battery to run an app with bad usability in peer to peer mode? What&#x27;s the end goal? I just want to rid myself of Whatsapp and Telegram, is that even a valid use case for the Matrix system anymore? Should I start looking in other directions?')
