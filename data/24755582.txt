They will be something entirely different, and very likely able to do entirely unexpected things.<p>Imagine a species which has roughly the same intelligence advantage over humans as humans have over cats. Most of what humans spend their time doing today is incomprehensible to cats. Virtually all of math, physics, the Internet, the arts, philosophy is far beyond the imagination of an animal which hasn&#x27;t evolved past a need to find food, sex, and occasional snuggles.<p>Now imagine a species which stretches the comparison to human-vs-ant. Not only are humans activities unimaginable, they&#x27;re <i>invisible</i>. Even though ants live in the middle of them.<p>Ant perception is tuned to pheromone trails, foraging, and occasional ant wars, and ants don&#x27;t have much of a concept of freeways, telecommuting, corner supermarkets, house renovation projects, or Amazon Prime - even though they may be surrounded by them.<p>Not only do ants not understand them, they cannot see them, except for those rare occasions where ants become a nuisance and a human decides to wipe them out.<p>It&#x27;s irrational and naive to assume that we are the most evolved of all possible intelligences in a universe which is as big as this one is, and whose operation we really don&#x27;t understand. We could be well surrounded by alien activities which are far outside our conceptual grasp - except for those occasions when the aliens take a passing interest, with strange and incomprehensible consequences.')
