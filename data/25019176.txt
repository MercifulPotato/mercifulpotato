I can claim invention of #if matching, though, as I implemented that in the 80&#x27;s, too. Don&#x27;t know of any prior art on that.<p>Vim was vi at the time :-) and didn&#x27;t have a Lisp mode at the time that I was aware of, and I haven&#x27;t messed with Lisp since the 80&#x27;s.<p>And yes, I still find Lisp difficult to read, regardless of how its formatted. Infix reads much better for me.')
