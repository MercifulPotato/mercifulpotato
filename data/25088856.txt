I joined the non-profit American Youth Literacy Foundation earlier this year and have been volunteering 10 hours a week for the last 6 months helping the build of iOS and Android apps called FUNetix that teach how to read and pronounce words in English. We just submitted our first production build to the Google Play console, so if you have an android device and time to check it out, feedback would be much appreciated.  If you have any young people learning to read that could test it out, even better')
