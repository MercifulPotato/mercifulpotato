There is a lot more to calculating price than just discount codes, tax rates for example. The cart needs to show regular price, the discount, the tax, shipping costs, and then total. Each of those is tested for multiple edge cases, so if we do it all in the shopping carts there are potentially hundreds of unrelated tests that need to change when the discount factor changes just because they happen to check the total.')
