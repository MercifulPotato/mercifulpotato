If I make an API for my own client software and put in the terms that you can only use my system in the combination in which I provide it, I think you&#x27;re out of luck.<p>The only law I can think of that could get involved is the DMCA. If my client implements usage&#x2F;content restrictions (very stupid design) you using the API with another program in violation of the terms could be considered circumventing the content restrictions and that&#x27;s illegal due to the DMCA.')
