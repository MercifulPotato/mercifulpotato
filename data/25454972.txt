FP has been around forever and it will still be around when someone digs up an idea from the seventies that got forgotten because everyone was being brow beaten by the “forget X the only true way to program is Y” crowd. Im tired of the dogma and the stifling of real criticisms. Everyone taking a dump on everyone’s ideas only to turn around and repackage it and sell it as something new to unquestioningly champion. There’s a wasteland of technologies that were once the one true way that were discarded as unworthy when something new came along. Usually there wasn’t anything fundamentally wrong with it which is why they’re resurrected years later but I wonder what the cost is of these boom and bust cycles are.')
