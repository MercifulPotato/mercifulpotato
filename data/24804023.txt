I force myself to keep programming because I need to keep that understanding alive, but companies would be happy to have me just explaining stuff.  And the people I&#x27;ve enjoyed working for the most are able to create a warm feeling of we are all in it together making cool new technologies!  Yay we are making the internet!  Pump up the feelings so we are motivated to use reason to solve problems in the path.')
