I have my phone, two PCs, Apple TV, iPad and MacBook Pro saved. You can slide and release the power button from the middle position to the forward position to jump to the next connection. Just stop on the one you want to connect to.<p>Like you mention it&#x27;s hit or miss with the host device though. Sometimes it fails to connect and you need to connect from within the OS.')
