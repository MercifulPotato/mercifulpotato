Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=[25648511], score=None, time=1609866854, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25647405, text='&gt; The trouble with textbooks is that nowadays there&#x27;s a new edition every other year, with slightly different pagination and exercises, all of this for an extortionate price.<p>This is what really gets me. I don&#x27;t necessarily mind charging $150 new for a big textbook, especially given the likelihood of it being shoveled back into the used market, but when the used textbook market is also killed off via gimmicks like new editions that do little more than shuffle exercises or one-time-use online codes, the justification for that high initial price tag is lost.<p>And I say this as somebody who also curated a personal library of textbooks that I do refer to in my day-to-day work!')
