Sure 7B people don&#x27;t have FB, but are you trying to invite 7B people to your event or business? Not really; you&#x27;re probably trying to target a very specific kind of person, or a group of people you already know. In that case you can just do some surveying &#x2F; focus group&#x27;ing to figure out what people already use and push your content on the platforms that cover the majority of users (which in most cases, I&#x27;m guessing, would include FB).')
