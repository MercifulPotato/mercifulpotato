This is obviously useful to have.<p>Say for the use-case of &quot;I have a macOS laptop, and I use Arch Linux on a different computer&quot;. I can&#x27;t genuinely recommend nixpkgs as better than just running &quot;brew install...&quot; and &quot;pacman -S&quot; (and whatever AUR tool is in vogue).\n-- Yes, once you know what you&#x27;re doing and have a configuration, nixpkgs is nicer. But it&#x27;s not as if the good-enough alternatives are too hard.<p>When there are more hurdles to getting the bleeding edge (like on Amazon Linux or whatever), I appreciate how much easier it is to just &quot;install nix, install my packages&quot;. But even then, installing a recent version of tmux or fish or whatever is a quick search and a few commands away. (Which isn&#x27;t that much if you only have to do it once every few months; and&#x2F;or note how to do it in some script or markdown notes).')
