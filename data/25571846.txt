That&#x27;s like saying IA-64 was over-engineered. It&#x27;s completely unhelpful unless you can articulate in which ways it is over-engineered and propose a practical alternative.<p>I take my hat off to the AMD folks that brought us x86_64. I challenge you to design a successor to IPv4 that is better than IPv6. Put it out there and let the world start taking shots at it. We&#x27;ll see how well it holds up.<p>There is plenty of opportunity for a better idea to catch on. Just like x86_64 succeeded despite the existence of IA-64. IPv6 has been so poorly adopted that it is not too late to retreat.<p>But it would take a lot more than lazy criticism to find a workable path forward.')
