Some projects have a list of goal and non-goals. Rejecting a PR because I didn&#x27;t read the non-goals is perfectly fine and should be encouraged.<p>2. I agree. But can&#x27;t this be solved by putting the &quot;burden of PR&quot; on the PR-er? A long checklist of &quot;I have read this&quot; and &quot;I have tested this&quot; should raise the PR bar high enough to make the code review cost worth it.<p>3. I understand that bad people are a problem on the Internet, but this feels orthogonal to the &quot;no PR policy&quot;. Won&#x27;t those people &quot;do shit&quot; anyway?')
