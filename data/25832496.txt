At the time, I remember thinking that some of these people must be trolling - and I still do.<p>For example, the people arguing that the wheels have already touched down. It seems abundantly obvious to me that the wheels have NOT touched down, and that the small strip of black asphalt running parallel to the wheels is a taxi-way in the background which has lots of small aircraft sitting on it. I get the uneasy feeling that anybody that sees it any differently is just trying to gaslight me. But, then, that was also the feeling I got about the blue dress, and that turned out to be all too genuine... People genuinely saw it differently, they weren&#x27;t trolling.<p>To me, the lack of heat blur behind the engines seems to be reasonably conclusive evidence that it&#x27;s landing... But who knows.')
