I didn&#x27;t get to read enough of it so I hope to get back and comment on it later. That said, it feels a bit too daunting that I don&#x27;t see a menu tree only links leading to yet another page. I feel lost. I&#x27;d love to have a map of the territory to be able to size it up. Currently I have no idea if this is 50 pages or 500 pages.<p>All right the sitemap says 127 pages.')
