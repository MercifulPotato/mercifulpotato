But that being said, HTC does have a standalone Quest competitor... just not for the consumer market.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;enterprise.vive.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;product&#x2F;focus-plus&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;enterprise.vive.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;product&#x2F;focus-plus&#x2F;</a><p>Arguably their reasons seem sound because how can they compete against Facebook in the consumer market with such a subsidized headset?
