But how…\nLooking at the code, the only things that could create the bug were the operators and pow() call. These are part of the C++ standard offering so it’s highly unlikely that either of these would have an error. What next? Off to GodBolt to try some other compilers to see if I get wonky results on them. MSVC++… nope, Clang… nope, GCC-Trunk on Linux… nope. I am only getting this weird behaviour in TDM-GCC. Time to try some other MingW64 compilers. Nuwen… Yes, Mingw64.. yes, TDM-GCC… yes.<p>Confirmed: It’s a bug in MinGW64.<p>When I create a new thread and run floating point operations in that thread, I get slightly different answers.&quot;<p>Interesting!')
