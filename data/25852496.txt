I looked at the source code to understand that.<p>SQLite knows where to look for when you open a SQLite database and you run a query, right? It just asks the underlying filesystem to provide N bytes starting from an offset using a C function, then it repeats the same operation on different portions of the file, it does its computation and everybody is happy.<p>The software relies on sqltorrent, which is a custom VFS for SQLite. That means that SQLite function to read data from a file stored in the filesystem is replaced by a custom function. Such custom code computes which Torrent block(s) should have the highest priority, by dividing the offset and the number of bytes that SQLite wants to read by the size of the torrent blocks. It is just a division.<p>See: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bittorrent&#x2F;sqltorrent&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;sqltorrent.cpp#L109-L158" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bittorrent&#x2F;sqltorrent&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;sqltorr...</a>')
