Even in covid times, I feel like there’s a better sense of community and civic engagement with neighbors. I also was super annoyed by people who came to SF that said it’s not diverse, when it was them not exploring outside of the tech world. All anecdotal, but life in the city is actually kinda awesome despite covid, but I do miss bigger hangouts than just a small social circle, which isn’t allowed anymore even.')
