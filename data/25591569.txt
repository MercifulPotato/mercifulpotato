This was at a time when Microsoft was still the dominant player in the market and IE had a stranglehold on the browser market.<p>By contrast, Apple doesn&#x27;t have a monopoly on the mobile device market, the browser market is dominated by Google&#x27;s Chrome, and the majority share of browsers use Chrome&#x27;s Blink engine.<p>&#x27;PWA&#x27; is a Google-invented term to describe technologies already implemented in their own browser; none of it constitutes a single standard unto itself. Apple not fully implementing Google&#x27;s standard, made not for the benefit of the open web but to make ChromeOS a little more functional than a glorified web browser, is only a threat to those who&#x27;ve forgotten that coding for one browser is what got us stuck in the code-only-for-IE mindset and halted progress for browsers for about a decade.<p>Apple isn&#x27;t the biggest threat to the free and open web. Google is. Everybody&#x27;s using Google&#x27;s browser, based around Google&#x27;s own standards designed to force people to stay using Google, to access Google&#x27;s search which displays Google&#x27;s ads above Google&#x27;s curated AMP results.')
