I had gambit installed, there&#x27;s pythonista which even has special support from official Apple apps like shortcuts. I&#x27;m pretty sure there were multiple C interpreters.<p>Apple stopped enforcing the no interpreters rule for years until just now. I honestly can&#x27;t imagine going back to having the list of approved software for one of my most important computers <i>dictated</i> by a publicly traded company. I&#x27;m shocked other people tolerate it!')
