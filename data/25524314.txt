Item(by='josephg', descendants=None, kids=[25524498], score=None, time=1608773709, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25523949, text='&gt; Performance is taken into account when it matters for the product, you&#x27;ll notice this in games where they do a lot of perf improvement work.<p>I think most development shops chronically underestimate how much application performance matters for sales. Most people will never file bug reports when software is slow. They just &quot;won&#x27;t like that program for some reason&quot;. (Or worse, misattribute the reason they don&#x27;t like your product.) Slowness is invisible to the developers because they&#x27;re almost always using computers which are much faster than the computers their customers are using. And unless you actually take the time to record performance statistics, you won&#x27;t have any idea this is the case.<p>Game developers know this. People measure the FPS they get on their gaming computers. But as far as I can tell, the reason isn&#x27;t an essential quality of video games. The difference is culture. There&#x27;s a culture in video game development of measuring performance. People have the tools and terminology to talk about it. In comparison, what are notion&#x27;s performance numbers like? Does notion run at 60fps for the average user? How many ms of typing latency does it usually encounter? Does the team even know?<p>&gt; Also swift &amp; rust are slow due to their design as a language. They provide very strong guarantees and make a lot of thing static. It&#x27;s very similar to the reasons why C++ is slow to compile.<p>Roll to disbelieve. Swift and rust are simpler languages than C++, and yet compile much more slowly. The reason C++ seems to compile slowly isn&#x27;t templates. Its because of the way C++ header files need to be parsed over and over again, and thats not a problem rust and swift share. (Rob Pike has some great rants about this if anyone&#x27;s interested.) A well written, from-scratch Swift compiler should be able to get compilation speeds closer to Go. At least, for debug builds.<p>I suspect if swift and rust were invented 20 years ago, we would still have been able to write compilers that ran at tolerable speeds on the computers of the day. And if thats the case, the reason for slow compilation speed is something other than language design.<p>&gt; Also notion is like 10 engineers last time I checked, and they&#x27;ve decided to go towards speed of dev &amp; features more than nicer, but slower to develop tools.<p>Notion can make that choice if they want. But until they fix performance, I won&#x27;t &#x2F; can&#x27;t use their product.<p>&gt; Also performance work is not fun<p>Speak for yourself - I love performance work. Its so measurable and the feeling of taking something sluggish and making it scream is delightful.')
