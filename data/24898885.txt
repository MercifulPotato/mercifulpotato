Item(by='Naac', descendants=None, kids=[24910033, 24898975, 24909035], score=None, time=1603734444, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24898373, text='Just quickly watched this[1] video showing an intro to Dendron.<p>I&#x27;m currently using tiddlywiki[2] so that&#x27;s primarily what I&#x27;m comparing it too.<p>Both tiddlywiki and dendron look very similar, supporting various forms of linking to one another. Dendron seems to have a more complete hierarchical way of combining pages, at least compared to the way that I use tiddlywiki.<p>Tiddlywiki&#x27;s advantage is the amount of plugins it has available. I think I also still prefer tiddlywiki because I just have it hosted on a server, so I can access my notes from whatever machine, including my phone. For dendron ( an electron app ) I&#x27;m guessing I would have to have some sort of Dropbox&#x2F;Nextcloud system setup to sync notes between machines. The fact that I&#x27;m in my browser all the time and can just open a web page to access tiddlywiki is also preferable. The least amount of friction between a thought in my head to being able to write it down, the better.<p>I was interested in Dendron because looking at its website, dendron supports a graph visualization of all your notes, like concept mapping[3]. But unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t look like this concept mapping feature is prioritized, or the main focus of dendron. That&#x27;s really the main thing I would like to add to tiddlywiki, some sort of functional concept mapping feature. I&#x27;ve tried tiddlymap[4], but its not very well supported.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3io2fHRmZsE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3io2fHRmZsE</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiddlywiki.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiddlywiki.com&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Concept_map" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Concept_map</a><p>[4] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiddlymap.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiddlymap.org&#x2F;</a>')
