I think it is quite possible that<p>1) people within the &quot;Amazon reviewing community&quot; know her (by her online identity, and maybe also her offline identity)<p>2) friends&#x2F;family recognize her profile, maybe because she has sent links to articles she reviewed, or because she shared an Amazon wishlist ...<p>3) it is possible to get her personal identity from information disclosed in her almost 600 reviews (maybe including pictures?).<p>Of course you did not share super critical information, and of course you did not write the billing address next to it. But it worries me that you choose to disclose any personal information at all for no good reason. Feels like a violation of trust.')
