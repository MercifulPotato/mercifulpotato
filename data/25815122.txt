An overestimate.<p>So you think correctly calculated inflation is <i>less</i> than the CPI says?<p>I thought everybody who thinks it is inaccurate thinks it is an <i>underestimate</i>, that the government is covering up inflation being rather high.<p>Also, if they just didn&#x27;t survey non-renters, then the result would not include how much homeowners spend on, say, hamburgers or whatever.')
