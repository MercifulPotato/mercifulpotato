Not sure why you were so upset. I didn&#x27;t say britain made india a democracy. Britain didn&#x27;t bring democracy anywhere it went. I just said Britain praises india&#x27;s democracy because it keeps india backwards and weak. And india just keeps sticking with something that hasn&#x27;t worked for decades because the leadership is desperate for that pat on the head from their colonial masters.<p>What&#x27;s better? China where hundreds of millions are out of poverty but britain calls it a &quot;dictatorship&quot;. Or India with hundreds of millions are in poverty but britain praises it for democracy?<p>&gt; As for India being a member of the Commonwealth, it was by Nehru&#x27;s insistence that it be named the Commonwealth of Nations, and not the Imperial Commonwealth as Britain intended it to be.<p>Who cares about the name? A pile of shit is still a pile of shit whatever you call it. The Imperial Commonwealth is still the imperial commonwealth whether it&#x27;s called timbuktu. Would the british empire be any different if you called it anything else? The japanese tried to call their empire &quot;Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere&quot;. I guess it sound more benign than Empire of Japan but it doesn&#x27;t quite flow off the tongue.<p>It&#x27;s the british empire. The head of the state is the british queen. It&#x27;s located in london. The language is english. It&#x27;s the association of &quot;former&quot; british colonies and their master.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Commonwealth_of_Nations" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Commonwealth_of_Nations</a><p>India represents over 20% of humanity. It should be a free nation and a permanent member of the UN Security Council, like china. Not a pathetic colony of britain. More than 70 years after independence, india is still a colony. That explains its rather terrible situation.<p>Interestingly enough, almost all of the world&#x27;s poor without electricity, plumbing, etc are part of the british empire today, I mean commonwealth of nations. What a wonderful association to be a part of.')
