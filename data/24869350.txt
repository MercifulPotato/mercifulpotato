Both Hossenfelder and Peter Woit (of the &quot;Not Even Wrong&quot; book and blog) have documented many such cases. Many theorists are still assuming supersymmetry as a basis for their work and essentially ignoring the fact that it didn&#x27;t show up where expected.<p><i>More to the point, what is the alternative strategy that’s more likely to produce useful data?</i><p>I think it&#x27;s &quot;remove the focus from high-energy physics and particle colliders, bring more attention to less fashionable areas that might benefit more from huge big-budget experiments.&quot; I don&#x27;t know of any <i>specific</i> proposals to do something completely different with the budget that might otherwise go to e.g. CERN&#x27;s Future Circular Collider proposal. Hossenfelder has pointed to other big science projects that could produce more <i>scientific</i> bang-for-the-buck than the LHC, such as LIGO and the James Webb space telescope.')
