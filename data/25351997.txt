The GPLv3 was released in 2007.   It obviously depends a lot on the language, since each language tends to have its own ecosystem, but the massive shift to permissive licenses really didn&#x27;t start until 2008-2010, which is after the GPLv3 was promulgated.  C didn&#x27;t tip over to being majority permissive until 2011.  So I&#x27;d argue that the analysis in the graph tends to support my contention that the GPLv3 hurt rather than helped the copyleft cause.')
