China can clone tech because they force companies that build products in China to essentially give away their IP. Can’t do that if the rocket is built exclusively in Hawthorne, CA and Boca China, TX with no outside contractors. They’re decades behind even the Europeans and Japanese. Chang’e5 is cool and all but Europe and Japan landed their spacecraft this year and last year on ASTEROIDS which is actually pushing the boundaries of space accomplishments and science. Hyabusa2 flew literally billions of miles (5.4bn to be exact)[0] during its mission to collect and return asteroid samples. The Chinese mission was a repeat of the 50’s just to say that they did it too. They’re not leapfrogging ANYONE, at least not until they do something novel.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp&#x2F;en&#x2F;enjoy&#x2F;material&#x2F;factsheet&#x2F;FactSheet_en_v2.31s.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp&#x2F;en&#x2F;enjoy&#x2F;material&#x2F;factsheet&#x2F;Fac...</a>')
