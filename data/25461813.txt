I can&#x27;t imagine I spend half that (looking at my latest card statement) on average, and that includes some random take out and we aren&#x27;t really shopping based on value other than stocking up on things we use that are on sale.<p>That said, when I was in my 20&#x27;s and single I probably spent more than that per month because practically every meal was fast food, take out, or otherwise prepared in some manner.  I suspect they could save a good $1,000&#x2F;mo if they started cooking exclusively at home and paid attention to a budget while shopping.<p>McDonalds is surprisingly expensive if you eat it every day.')
