If you make $15&#x2F;hr, they subsidize $1<p>Pretty bad example - where’s the incentive to work harder for the extra $3&#x2F;hour when you get nothing?<p>And do you really mean to tax per hour rather than per year which is where we currently base income taxes on? Wouldn’t that continue to encourage 70, 80, 90 hour weeks which is really bad.')
