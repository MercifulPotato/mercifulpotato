I rarely had to modify or read the actual code of libraries I used, but when I had to, I am not sure how I could have solved the problem otherwise.\nFor me it is sometimes quicker to read the code, than treating it like a black-box and trying to figure out what is supposed to happen by often outdated documentation and examples.')
