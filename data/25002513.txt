Granted, the first years the volume of mail was low compared to now.<p>About 5 years ago I tried other clients, including Evolution and Claws, and stayed with Thunderbird. Evolution&#x27;s UI was significantly slower than Thunderbird&#x27;s, Claws and the others were less functional.<p>I&#x27;m really happy Thunderbird development was rekindled, because it was getting noticeably behind. I manage six emails, two calendars and three USENET accounts with it, all in the same application, fast, and using less RAM than it takes GMail to display one inbox.')
