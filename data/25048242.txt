The new csproj format is vastly superior. The new dotnet CLI is a pleasure to use.<p>Many of the surrounding libraries like ASP.NET, Kestrel, LINQ, Entity Framework Core, System.Text.Json, etc are best in class.<p>I look forward to the Linker becoming stable, as this will really help in contexts such as Azure Functions and AWS Lambda.')
