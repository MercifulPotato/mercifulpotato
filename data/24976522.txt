They’ll pay you 3 dollars if it rains Monday next year. Otherwise you pay them 90 dollars.<p>Now, it’s pretty intuitively clear that at a year interval, there’s way too much uncertainty to take this bet. If you accounted for it, you would approach something like the average chance of raining on any particular day in November in New York.<p>You are right that with enough data, you would be able to price this correctly.<p>Taleb’s point is that Nate is not doing that, by demonstration: since Nate’s models oscillated so much, it demonstrates that he did not account for it.')
