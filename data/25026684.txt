I was civil. Victimhood is a tired and hateful reddit style personal attack. Stop it.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not using academic terms and yes, making up my own terms to put down what it&#x27;s been my experience.<p>No. You are using academic terms and then making things up. Why are you doubling down?<p>&gt; Indo-European languages share a lot of structure and roots, similar ways of thinking even if phrasal structure are very different between Germanic and Latin languages, the same for Slavic ones.<p>phrasal structure? What are you talking about.<p>&gt; This is my experience, instead of being an ass, try to improve on top of it, you help nobody.<p>You helped nobody either. Actually you hurt people by making things up.<p>&gt; Now please, try to behave as is expected by the rules of this forum, I try to come here to have civil conversations and not expecting this place to devolve into some other cesspool subreddit.<p>You are the one turning it into a cesspool with ad hominems and victimhood.<p>For someone so sure of his decision, you sure are defensive. And I wasn&#x27;t being &quot;uncivil&quot;, my &quot;party trick&quot; comment was actually a joke. I was poking a little fun. It was harmless. People like you are why the internet and places like sweden are turning into a horrible place. Loosen up, stop taking things so personally&#x2F;seriously and move on. And if someone calls you on a mistake, why not admit it and learn from it rather than doubling down with &quot;phrasal structure&quot;. Have a nice day. Civil enough for ya?')
