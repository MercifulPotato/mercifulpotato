Options do have expiration dates, but shorts just charge interest. The thing is if you own a stock and it goes down, worst case is you lose 100% of your money. If you short a stock and it doubles, you&#x27;ve lost 100% but there&#x27;s no barrier here, the loss could keep going up to 200% or more. If you can&#x27;t pay it back, the broker is on the hook for this money and therefore they have the power to actually force you to close the short position. You don&#x27;t control the timing on that. It&#x27;s the kind of situation where people start jumping out of windows on Wall St.')
