The daily salt reset is a deal breaker. (basically means people visiting the site are considered unique everyday which breaks monthly&#x2F;weekly unique stats and conversion tracking spanning more than 24 hours)<p>Our current pipeline for one app has a 14-20 days conversion and we rely on this data to optimize. Also have an marketplace app where conversions periods spans several days depending on the product and promotions. With the daily anonymization algorithm reset, every conversion will seem it took less than 24 hours.<p>The hunt for a GA alternative continues. BTW does anyone know&#x2F;recommend a great self hosted alternative to Mixpanel?')
