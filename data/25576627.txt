For example, if you&#x27;re playing Dungeons and Dragons with a group of friends, the choice to murder a child is likely to be met by at worst some groans. Try to have your character rape an imaginary woman, however, and you&#x27;re likely to not only be kicked out of the game but lose those people as friends as well.  I know I wouldn&#x27;t talk to that person again.<p>We have a double standard when it comes to imaginary evil that is simply violent and imaginary evil that is repugnant. Make a game about shooting a thousand people and it may win game of the year. Make a game about avoiding prosecution while abusing your virtual pet dog and you&#x27;ll probably lose your job.')
