There&#x27;s no brake on this system and they can lend out practically infinite amount of money and transfer all risks to banks&#x2F;asset management firms and consumers.<p>There&#x27;s no chance that Ant can proceed through IPO with this new regulation as the profit structure of the business has fundamentally changed.')
