The python interface makes things easy but doesn&#x27;t offer enough control for my case. I tested it with a cut down example (no video decoding, no funny stuff) and it all comes down to the batch size that is passed to model.predict. Large batches level out at around 10000 fps depending on the GPU and batch size 1 goes down to 200 fps independent of the GPU. This tells me that some kind of overhead (hidden to me) is slowing things down. I guess that I have to go much deeper into the internals of TF to find out more - so far I did not because it&#x27;s a large time hole that only offers better performance in a part that is not super critical right now.<p>The GIL and slowness of Python become a problem when processing multiple streams or doing further time consuming calculations in Python.')
