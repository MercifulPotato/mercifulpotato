Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=[25607091], score=None, time=1609534032, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25606484, text='Personal attacks are not allowed here and will get you banned here.<p>Obviously that&#x27;s a bannable offense and I&#x27;m shocked and disgusted that you stooped to it. I wanted to think better of you.<p>We&#x27;ve put up with a ton of shit in your posts because (a) there&#x27;s often a good point in thereâ€”even your point about the Beowulf translation would have been a good HN comment if you had cared to post it that way, and (b) I think highly of your technical comments and think HN would be poorer without them. But we can&#x27;t have you abusing the site and other users like this; we&#x27;ve banned many accounts for less. I don&#x27;t want to ban you, but if you don&#x27;t fix this, there won&#x27;t be a choice.<p>It&#x27;s in your interest to use the site in the intended spirit, because poisoning HN (which is what your behavior, compounded, amounts to) is only going to ruin it as anything interesting. We have a hard enough time trying to prevent this place from sinking. I wince at its mediocrity already and it pains me that someone with the talent to really help it be good prefers instead to piss all over it the way you&#x27;ve been doing.')
