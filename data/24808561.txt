The last time hard&#x2F;sound money was in vogue was long ago, and even when it was based on physics and not software it came with a host of ultimately intractable problems for society. The current system is no utopia either, but poor returns on savings are not the fault of central banks but the symptoms of prevailing economic conditions. There are of course limits to monetary policy, but &quot;sorry there&#x27;s just no more money available for some arbitrary reason&quot; shouldn&#x27;t be one of them.<p>From a technology perspective, Bitcoin is an interesting invention, but from a monetary point of view it&#x27;s a backward step. That&#x27;s partly why there are so many skeptical voices about the prospects of basing the money system on cryptocurrencies here.<p>I say this as an early adopter and friend of the technology.')
