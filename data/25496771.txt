Actual payout was low due to investor 2x prefs and all kinds of shenanigans, but after earn-out&#x2F;taxes it was enough to put a down payment on a nice house. Only took around 2.5 years to pay off.<p>Couldn&#x27;t 83b at the beginning because I didn&#x27;t have enough liquid cash, so I ended up paying a lot of taxes in the end. Company could have easily failed &#x2F; not gotten acquired so I don&#x27;t blame people who don&#x27;t exercise early.<p>Currently have a larger stake in a startup that&#x27;s dying due to COVID killing their industry, so I&#x27;ll likely leave with nothing.
