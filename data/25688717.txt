You don&#x27;t understand this, &quot;war on domestic terror&quot; will include legislative attacks on encryption?  That bad actors always use, create and amplify perceived crisis to expand their power and permanently erode our rights?  You can be certain that when the center of radicalization in Washington DC decides to whip up another war that will kill a million people, they won&#x27;t be &quot;deplatformed&quot; (as opposed to those &quot;radicals&quot; who will oppose that war, who most certainly will).')
