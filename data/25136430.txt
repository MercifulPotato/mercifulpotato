Android and iOS have already pushed ARM support and optimizations in programming languages and key libraries.<p>For macOS, the support revolves around Xcode. Cross-compilation support is Apple-specific and won&#x27;t benefit Linux. CPU architecture is abstracted away in macOS as much as possible, so average developers won&#x27;t think much about ARM support.<p>Where Apple wants developers to tune for M1 specifically, is their proprietary frameworks for ML acceleration and Metal, which don&#x27;t benefit anyone but Apple.<p>At best there may be some halo effect from proving that ARM can be as fast as &quot;real&quot; desktop CPUs, and it&#x27;s not just the low-end slow Qualcomm chips. That might legitimize running ARM on servers, but Pi is neither high-end desktop nor a server platform.')
