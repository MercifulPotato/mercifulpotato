Cameras evolved since the 90s, we have 5 stops of IS, sharp f&#x2F;1.4 lenses and exposure stacking.<p>The resolution advantage is not moderate at all. A 12MP phone is around as sharp as a theoretically perfect 8MP sensor with a perfect lens, while current cameras are as sharp as 40+MP perfect sensor with a theoretically perfect lens.<p>Diffraction absolutely doesn&#x27;t come out as a wash. What matters is the actual diameter of the aperture, not the ratio. Phones are a tenth of ILCs in this metric, or even less for non-optimal focal lengths.')
