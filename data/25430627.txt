It&#x27;s a liberal value to accept that some people want to wear hijab, and other people want to walk around in speedos, and both of these are fine as long as it&#x27;s their own choices.<p>What is it like to be a liberal Muslim in the West? I&#x27;m not one, but I am a member of an ethnic minority with similar stereotyping. I have neighbors and coworkers who are Muslims and Hindus and frankly, the ones I&#x27;m least comfortable with are the right-wing Christians. Everybody else just wants to get along; I&#x27;m upset with the people who announce that anyone who isn&#x27;t just like them should be coerced out.')
