We&#x27;re talking like a cumulative 100lb by integrating the front diff with the transmission and losing the drive shaft.  Tunnel is nice but most cars still don&#x27;t have a flat floor because they stick a tunnel in there for exhaust and the floor-pan is likely shared at least in part with an AWD crossover that puts a drive shaft there and it&#x27;s usually important enough for floor rigidity so they don&#x27;t omit it on the FWD models.<p>&gt;Modern platforms can make the front wheels turn and spin at the same time without much fuss<p>Yeah they can prevent you from losing traction but you&#x27;re fundamentally at a disadvantage to RWD because no matter how you cut it you&#x27;re trying to spread the front traction budget thinner.  Everything that makes RWD desirable for the track also makes it desirable for consumer A to B duty.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, FWD is great for bringing 0% no money down economy cars to the masses and creating bottom dollar van chassis for employees to abuse but even at its best it&#x27;s still never going to make varsity in any context where performance actually matters')
