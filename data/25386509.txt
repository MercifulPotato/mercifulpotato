It was ~Â£100, sounds amazing and lasted me 15 years of being dragged to clubs, house parties and getting a fair beating. Only this year have I replaced them and that was only because I lost my old pair in a recent house move and figured &quot;it&#x27;s been 15 years, there&#x27;s no shame in buying a new pair even though the old pair might turn up in a random box later&quot;.<p>However those cans don&#x27;t have bluetooth, noise cancelling, a microphone nor adaptive EQing. They&#x27;re literally just a high quality speaker, headband and copper wiring.')
