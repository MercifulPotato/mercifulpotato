I get pitched products all the time, UV light was all the rage for a bit.  Two products come to mind.  One was a light that shines on wounds which kills the bacteria which decolonizes the skin.  The lamp itself was different, but it was just mounted on an articulating arm like a desk lamp at home.<p>The other product was a nasal decolonization tool.  It looked like two foam earplugs connected to wires.  The person would stick them in their nose and the light would decolonize the nose (and nares) prior to surgery.  There&#x27;s research to show that nasal decolonization reduces surgical site infections.<p>However, I would say that Trump was not referring to technologies like this.  I think it was just a coincidence that he happened upon UV light in the body.')
