This meant the bar had to be lowered, which affected college output.<p>Spain has also absolute and radical aversion to the private enterprise collaborating with universities, meaning that research is poor and underfunded.<p>Barriers to entrepeneurship are high, both in the form of red tape, and taxes.<p>Spain has, at any point in space and time, AT LEAST 3 bloated and redundant administrative layers: local, Comunidades, central state, with some areas having more (e.g. cabildos, diputaciones). More red tape, more redunancy, more pensions and benefits. This means more taxes.<p>Like in the US, Spaniards have massively invested, with money they didn&#x27;t have, in real state. Unlike in the US, though, Spaniards have been convinced any private property other than housing is useless, or plain evil, so there&#x27;s ZERO equities culture, other than those having the 401k equivalent. Major Spanish corporations are less owned by Spaniards, compared to other countries like the US.<p>And all these UBI equivent measures just feed into the same narrative: the State will feed you, no need to innovate, no need to work hard, and if you want to thrive, affiliate to a major party.<p><i>The country lacks affordable housing</i><p>See above: high taxes (e.g. IBI, property taxes), plus housing being the only true value reserve, inflate the prices.')
