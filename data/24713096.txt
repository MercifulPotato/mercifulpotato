In any case what I remember beyond this was that he figured that the expansion at the end of a universe could be used to locate the “cosmic inflation” of a universe _before_ its Big Bang, in the heat death of the prior universe, and it was my impression that it was this “evolution to infinity” of the prior universe but I might be totally mistaken.')
