Guaranteed work and income, with options to negotiate higher pay every few years, what&#x27;s not to love? Unless you&#x27;re that even-more-rare talent who can jump to movies and make more on one film than a few years of TV. But many have tried to make that leap and ended up poorer for it.<p>I wonder sometimes whether Robert Sheehan thinks he made a good choice leaving <i>Misfits</i>. He seemed very certain at the time that he would be a movie superstar, but most of what I&#x27;ve seen him in since is other TV shows, like the recent <i>Umbrella Academy</i>.<p>But hey, Sheehan leaving opened a spot for Joseph Gilgun, who seems to be doing pretty okay too.')
