It makes sense at first glance, but in reality dramatiq is not an actor system. Actors do not live and die and get managed by supervision as they would in an environment like Erlang. Instead, messages just go onto a queue and get popped off by a worker.<p>I guess as long as you go into it eyes wide open - dramatiq is not an actor framework - you will be a-ok.')
