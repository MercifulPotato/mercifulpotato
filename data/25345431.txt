Every MB counts! Web pages these days have so many useless things to load.<p>Last time I used Opera mini with extreme mode to save data. But now, there is no more Opera Mini on iPad. I found some available tools like text.brow.sh (offline now), and another tool (not support UTF-8). I don&#x27;t own a computer now, only have tablet devices. Thus, I think I may need to build a simple pure text only browser tool (Javascript&#x2F;PHP) and put it on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;glitch.com or https:&#x2F;&#x2F;herokuapp.com or github page. Then I just simply use the browser on tablet visit my web page and enter the web I need to read with pure text only.<p>The idea now is something like:<p>```\ntext = await fetch(&quot;google.com&quot;).then(res =&gt; res.txt())<p>```\nHowever, &quot;fetch&quot; will use our cellular Internet data to fetch the page before processing it to text.<p>Thanks for any advices&#x2F;solutions.<p>May you all be well and happy!')
