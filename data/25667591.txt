Their problems aren&#x27;t their ability, it&#x27;s that Intel is poorly managed and internal groups are constantly fighting with each other.<p>Also, compiler support for CPUs is very overrated. Heavy compiler investment was attempted with Itanium and debunked; giant OoO CPUs like Intel&#x27;s or M1 barely care about code quality, and the compilers have very little tuning for individual models.')
