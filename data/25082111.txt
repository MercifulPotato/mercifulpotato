Google Photos decided to grandfather old photos: only photos uploaded after June 2021 count towards your storage limit. That&#x27;s nice, but the obvious solution to prevent all this outrage would have been to grandfather in old user accounts: anyone already using Google Photos has no storage limit for compressed images (as before), but new accounts have the new limits. That allows for fast growth with insane offers at the start of the product cycle, while switching to a more profitable model for later users.<p>This is how most companies operate. For example I&#x27;m on a mobile plan that&#x27;s better than anything currently offered by the provider. They don&#x27;t force me to switch or change the plan I&#x27;m on, they just don&#x27;t allow anyone to switch to that plan.')
