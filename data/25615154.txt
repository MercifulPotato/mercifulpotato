Sure, you could regulate to death&#x2F;kill Facebook tomorrow with legislation in country X. All that happens is a clone launches immediately overnight from a country with less onerous regulation, one that anglosphere legal systems will have even less direct control over than the Facebook we have today.<p>FB, for all its flaws, is at least still based in a democratic nation and operates within a (_relatively speaking_) fair legal system. That the FEC is able to demand (and force implementation of!) regulation already at FB is evidence this works, at least a little. Better the devil you know as they say...<p>We can&#x27;t remove the natural human desire to connect to one another on the internet (and associated problems). For me personally, the cat is out of the bag - you can&#x27;t rewind time and uninvent the underlying communication infrastructure. If people want a social network, the internet will make it for them again and again   and host from whatever polity&#x2F;region allows.')
