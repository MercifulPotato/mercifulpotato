I threw together an HTPC a few months ago out of mostly second-hand parts and it&#x27;s been a mixed bag. With an i5-4460 and an RX 570, I can run modern shooters perfectly, but a bunch of indie games give me unexpected trouble. Hades for example (isometric roguelite heavy on visual effects) still gives me lots of slowdowns and framedrops, and I even get jitter and issues on some really old titles that I would have expected to be butter-smooth, like Sonic Generations.')
