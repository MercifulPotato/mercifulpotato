Name another industry-leading groupware system.<p>The last big dominant rival MS took down was Nokia&#x27;s phones operation, but it mainly succeeded there because Google and Apple accidentally helped: Evidence: MS doesn&#x27;t make phones any more. It derailed the #1 smartphone vendor&#x27;s own OS efforts and planted an MS exec in charge so that vendor used exclusively MS phone OSes, but it wasn&#x27;t good enough.
