Item(by='Traster', descendants=None, kids=[25944890], score=None, time=1611849696, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25942443, text='I&#x27;m not an expert but it seems to me that this whole 100% thing is a total red herring. If I (A) have 50 shares in GME, I let you (B) borrow them and short sell them to person (C), person (C) now owns them, you (B) can borrow them from person (C) and short sell them to person (D). Suddenly you&#x27;ve short sold the same stock twice.The only issue for you is that you now need to buy back 100 stock to pay off what you&#x27;ve borrowed, which you could do buying the stock from person (D), giving it back to person (C), buying them frmo person (C) and giving it back to person (A).<p>The only issue comes if someone notices that you&#x27;ve done this, pushes the price up to the point where you have to exit your position because your broker won&#x27;t let you hold this short position that you can&#x27;t afford to pay for. At that point you <i>must</i> exit, which drives the price up even further because you&#x27;re creating demand for the stock.<p>What&#x27;s important to notice about this is that the second you&#x27;re no longer short the stock, <i>no one</i> has any incentive to hold the stock. So it&#x27;ll return to $20 and all those super smart boys on WSB who were holding out for $2000 have thousands of shares of a worthless retail stock that they probably bought on margin and are going to lose everything.')
