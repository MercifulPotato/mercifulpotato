It&#x27;s an implementation of pre-rendering that comes integrated tightly with a global CDN layer to ensure that your users receive rendered pages, lightning fast, regardless of where in the world they are.<p>We built this out of frustration with existing solutions for SSR. Nuxt, Next.js &amp; Gatsby have become heavy handed over the years, making it really hard to change platforms, and usually come with a vendor lockin - you end up integrating your framework so tightly with the hosting provider that you&#x27;re stuck!<p>Spirit Fish has no opinions about where you host your assets, and what tools you use. Instead, it sits between your raw assets and DNS, runs your site in serverless Chrome, and applies a bunch of optimizations and routing normalizations against the rendered result to produce optimized content every time. It takes minutes to setup, doesn&#x27;t require code changes, and usually doubles your Google Lighthouse score in the process.<p>Thanks everyone! Please let us know what you think!')
