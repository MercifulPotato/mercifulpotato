They could all use public transit (in places where it&#x27;s available), but that would increase the burden on that kind of transit. Especially for big cities, that was already quite busy - well, until the pandemic.<p>What I&#x27;ve seen happening here in the UK is that a lot of people leave their cars in a park &amp; ride or close to a train station then shuttle in, which I guess is a step forward, but a lot are still driving all the way.')
