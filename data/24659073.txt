The first thought I had by looking at the screenshot of the PR(without watching the video) and reading the highlighted comment was that &quot;This guy must be an Indian&quot;. I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt but after watching the video, I was appalled by what I was hearing. And the worst part is, that he says you will learn how to make a PR. Sorry, but no, you will not learn how to make a genuine PR by watching the video. Another thought that I had was, how many kids are getting into software development because of the &quot;swag&quot; and how many of them are genuinely interested in understanding the intricacies involved in building good software.<p>Disclaimer: I am an Indian')
