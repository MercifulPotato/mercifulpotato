That&#x27;s not the case with cars, which intermingle heavily with pedestrian areas. In those cases I think it&#x27;s perfectly fair to restrict their speed for safety and to put the onus on the driver to prioritise safety. The alternative is we either ban cars from pedestrian areas completely or we just accept the deaths or heavy inconvenience of pedestrians (which seems to be the current US model).')
