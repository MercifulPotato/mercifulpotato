Item(by='typomatic', descendants=None, kids=[25865676], score=None, time=1611259023, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25863241, text='&gt; What I take away from this all is that for every article about academic misconduct and p hacking there are 100 more where the peer review process (both before and during submission to a journal) caught the issues in time.<p>p-hacking isn&#x27;t a mathematical error. It cannot be &quot;caught&quot; because it is not presented to referees--you slightly modify your hypotheses after you experiment based on results, or you throw out &quot;outliers&quot; that blow up your theory. These are things that don&#x27;t even show up in a paper, they happen during the compilation of the paper.<p>How you could conclude that p-hacking is rare based on a completely unrelated experience is beyond me.')
