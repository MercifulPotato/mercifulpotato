The teachers would deliver tailored course on a per need basis, and would create creative challenges on the lab (simulated outage, computer hacking, High load on the servers) that would each illustrate a concept. The course would be validated when a set  of requirements is passed, such as proper incident response handling and reporting, server uptime ... As I am strong believer in direct easily evaluable feedback.')
