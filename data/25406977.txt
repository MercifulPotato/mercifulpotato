And if you wanted to delete data from Facebook, it&#x27;s almost impossible, you&#x27;d need to manually delete every action you ever took in their app!<p>We think that everyone should to be able to easily understand and control the data companies collect about them, and one day even use it for themselves.<p><i></i>We help you find out how Facebook:<i></i><p>- tracks you across the internet<p>- tracks you across the world<p>- collects hundreds of interests about you<p>- tracks your social life<p>- can even track your mood.<p>Then we help you delete what you no longer want them to keep! We&#x27;re trying to put users back in control.<p><i></i>Our users are not the product at Ethi.<i></i> We don&#x27;t use your data for anything else. Instead of Ethi being totally free and us monetising by selling ads or data to a hedge fund, we ask users to pay so we can expand Ethi to Google, Amazon and others, and build a full toolset for you to decide who knows what about you.<p>Data is encrypted in your browser before you upload it, and is only decrypted to provide the graphs and analysis you see in Ethi.<p>Looking forward to hearing what you think!
