United States ruling that the government needs an actual search warrant to collect an individual&#x27;s cell-site location data.<p>These appear on the surface to be 2 separate things. If they’re not buying “an individual&#x27;s cell-site location data” then they are not circumventing the warrant process.<p>If a judge rules that aggregate metadata also requires a warrant (which I’d be ok with) then we have a path to object here.')
