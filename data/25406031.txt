Ho told them he had now secured the help of the Americas including Chennault. At first no- body really believed him. Then he produced the photograph\nof Chennault signed, “Yours Sincerely.” After this, he sent for the automatic pistols [the six .45s that Fenn had given him] and gave one to each of the leaders as a present. The lead- ers considered that Chennault had sent these presents person- ally. After this conference, there was never any more talk about who was the top leader.”<p>Ho Chi Minh manipulated the situation masterfully and used the minimal Allied support to boost his standing in his own organization for Vietnamese independence.<p>&gt; In the case of Ho, the OSS failure was in the vetting process. Fenn did his best, but his best was not good enough. He learned that Ho was an anti-French rebel and a communist; but he did not uncover the salient fact: Ho had also been an agent of the Comintern, and probably still was.b The proper vetting of agent candidates is obviously essential, and extra caution must be exercised when strong political aspirations and involvement are found in an agent-candidate.')
