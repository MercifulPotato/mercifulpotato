We have recently open sourced KubeVela which is the Kubernetes community implementation of OAM. I am very excited to share and talk about it!<p>First of all, let me clarify what it is and what it is not.<p>• KubeVela is an easy to use tool that enables developers to describe and ship applications to Kubernetes with minimal efforts. The core innovation is that we provide a docker-compose style appFile. This developer friendly interface allows a developer to focus on the application instead of infrastructure.<p>• KubeVela provides an extremely extensible way for platform builders to build a PAAS that is customized towards their own user base. The secret is that KubeVela implements the Open Application Model which provides a standard way to describe not only the workloads but also the operational characteristics of the application and how do they interact with each other.<p>• KubeVela is not trying to replace Helm. This is a very common question. For one, KubeVela does rely on tools like Helm to package k8s operator&#x2F;controllers.  However, KubeVela is not a packaging tool. KubeVela provides a standard model for applications which could comprise of multiple resources, each can come as a helm package. Furthermore, KubeVela also supports application operational needs which is beyond what Helm can do.<p>• KubeVela is not just another PAAS. The difference between KubeVela and any existing PAAS is that KubeVela can take full advantage of the rich Kubernetes ecosystem which includes any operational capabilities such as routing&#x2F;rollout&#x2F;autoscale. This is again enabled by the OAM implementation.<p>Please feel free to ask questions here, or raise an issue on our GitHub, or come to our slack channel.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kubevela.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kubevela.io&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud-native.slack.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;C01BLQ3HTJA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud-native.slack.com&#x2F;archives&#x2F;C01BLQ3HTJA</a>')
