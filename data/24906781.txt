At the moment, the market <i>expects</i> a boom. (It is probably incorrect; it might not be).<p>That expectation, however, is being exaggerated by other people who likewise expect it. Sure.<p>But we shouldn&#x27;t characterise the market as irrationally faith-based, if it were, it would never go bust. It doesn&#x27;t go bust because, for some random reason, people loose faith.<p>Rather, their beliefs are revised with updated evidence, which propagates thru the market. This &quot;correction towards reality&quot; is <i>always</i> at work, but people attend to the evidence at different rates: when the whole market looks, then you go bust.<p>There is a deeply tyrannical and propagandistic undercurrent to the view that human action is simply a matter of our &quot;faith about the world&quot;, and not evidence. It encourages people to act as-if false things were true; and requires others to do so;  to cause great catastrophes precisely <i>because</i> the false things <i>arent</i> true.')
