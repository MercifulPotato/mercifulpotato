I don&#x27;t know enough to agree or disagree, but it&#x27;s a big part of the discussion.<p>My feeling is that Nordic countries can have nice prisons because their social safety net is so strong. Maybe they can argue that being a free, poor person in a Nordic country is still better than being in their prisons.<p>The same is not true in the US, especially when you consider how harsh our culture is toward people who suffer from drug addiction. Abject poverty is <i>much</i>, much worse than the prisons in this tweet, and we don&#x27;t have good non-criminal options for people who are both poor and deeply addicted to illegal drugs.<p>You can imagine a poor person in the US (with or without an addiction) trying to steal from someone&#x27;s house and ending up shooting someone. If they go to a dangerous, filthy prison, they&#x27;re probably worse off than when they were free.<p>If they go to a Nordic-style prison, their lifestyle has actually upgraded quite a lot. My understanding is that the latter option, the Nordic prison, would reduce their likelihood of having to resort to crime in the future.<p>But the question is how much violent crime is deterred by fear of prison and whether the Nordic style of prisons would instill enough fear.<p>I think I&#x27;m on the side of having nicer prisons, but I don&#x27;t really know enough about it.')
