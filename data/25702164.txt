The fingerprint scanner at a former employer was filthy beyond all recognition after housekeeping destroyed the first one trying to clean it (side issue, why are all biometric sensors so incredibly non-robust compared to a RFID scanner or human guard?).  Anyway the thick gross layer of human grease on the fingerprint scanner made people grossed out during flu season so they would capacitive couple getting close to but not touching the sensor and relying on the last person to touch the filthy thing to have left enough fingerprint to work.  It worked pretty well.  The concept of a non-contact fingerprint scanner in the last century is pretty funny.  I wonder if it still works.  A more general filth problem is in the covid era I would not want to share eyeball juice with everyone going thru a retina scanner.')
