They constantly record everything in front of them, but only save 30 seconds of video at a time. To record an entire incident, the officer must double press the “event” button in the center of the camera.<p>So non-compliance is the default.<p>And compliance failure is as easy as an incorrect double-press that fails to start recording.  Is there even any feedback that the double-press has registered?<p>Why not buffer 5 hours by default?')
