I don’t think this company should have gone public.<p>They froze my account and soon after I started receiving credits to my account associated with it in small amounts like less than $2 or $3. Why? I have no idea. No one will tell me and I can’t get through to a real person. It makes me so nervous and I was constantly monitoring it.<p>Finally I cancelled the card mostly because there is no real customer service that would explain why ..and this tells me that they are clueless. Something just smells ‘off’ about Doordash. What shenanigans would cause a blip like that? And why should I be the one left twiddling my thumbs without an answer?<p>The reason I am bringing up a personal anecdote is because it reveals to me that the company doesn’t have the right staff or strategy. Or attitude. They keep calling themselves a technology company. But food delivery would make them a logistics company. They will flounder and fail if they keep seeing themselves as a technology company.')
