Since the attack requires recording of approximately 6k U2F auth operations, we can quite easily calculate the minimum wall time.<p>From a purely anecdotal experience, it takes between 1 and 2 seconds to &quot;cycle&quot; a YubiKey from a working keypress to the next working keypress. The delay is probably built in to the firmware to mitigate attacks like this. Let&#x27;s be conservative and say you can run a U2F auth operation every second.<p>6000 * 1s = 1h40m. That&#x27;s how long an attacker would have to have the key in their possession to generate enough material to run the rest of the attack offline. So perfectly doable as an evil maid attack with enough specialised gear. Infeasible as a drive-by attack.')
