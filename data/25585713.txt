You can use Defold to make commercial games for free. You can even extend and modify Defold and use your modified version to make commercial games for free too from what I understand.<p>And you can also change and modify Defold and distribute your changes and modifications to others, but you can&#x27;t do so commercially. That said, I think others could still use your modified Defold to make commercial games, just you can&#x27;t take any money for it.<p>So it seems to be much more than just visible source. Basically the only thing it doesn&#x27;t allow is for you to commercialize the Defold engine or some derivative engine based on it. Everything else seems allowed.<p>Caveat: I am not a lawyer.')
