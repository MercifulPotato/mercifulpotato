The puzzles are still reasonably simple. Have a look around today&#x27;s Reddit thread where people can post their answers:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;adventofcode&#x2F;comments&#x2F;k7ndux&#x2F;2020_day_06_solutions&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;adventofcode&#x2F;comments&#x2F;k7ndux&#x2F;2020_d...</a><p>These are self-selected people, free to use a language of their choice. Ask yourself some questions:<p>- Which of these do I think is &quot;most readable&quot; vs &quot;least readable&quot;?<p>- Which of these am I happy is correct, and bug-free as far as it goes?<p>- Which of these would I like to make a change to, confident that it won&#x27;t break?<p>- Which took the author most &#x2F; least time?<p>- If I could only pick one to run on my puzzle input and submit the one answer which came out, which of these would I pick?<p>- Which of these would I like to maintain long term?<p>Another way to see the same ideas is to pick a task on RosettaCode - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rosettacode.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Category:Programming_Tasks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rosettacode.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Category:Programming_Tasks</a> - and see how much &#x2F; little code people write in various languages to solve the same problem.<p>IMHO it isn&#x27;t &quot;the longest one&quot; that is clearest, by a long shot. Nor the golfiest one. But it tends to be the shorter ones done in languages that have higher levels of abstraction, more libraries, nicer looking naming, more standard patterns.')
