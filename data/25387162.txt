Or at least feels like 10 seconds; no more. In fact it takes more time for it to wake than to boot from full power off, albeit that says more about Linux sleep&#x2F;wake support than anything else.<p>But my point is that, for most of the time, I just leave it on. It consumes almost the same power sleeping that fully on, at idle.')
