You must keep the faith!<p>- &quot;The Event&quot; will take place on <i>X</i> date, but when it doesn&#x27;t, no problem: it was always going to be <i>Y</i> date that It Happens.<p>- We all KNOW our version of the story is right. What particular pieces of evidence are so rock-solid and convincing? Oh, well, there&#x27;s SO MUCH, but it&#x27;s not my job to spoon feed you the facts. If you don&#x27;t know, you clearly haven&#x27;t been paying attention and should do your own research.<p>- If somebody published something saying that we&#x27;re wrong, it means that &quot;They&quot; are scared of us. We must be getting close.<p>I don&#x27;t know whether WSB&#x27;s narrative is right or wrong, which is why I am on neither side of this trade and merely watching with interest from the sidelines. They could very well be correct about all of this.<p>I also am not trying to allege that being a &quot;GME to the moon&quot; person makes you a &quot;Q person&quot;. They are completely different sets of beliefs. All that I&#x27;m observing is that the <i>marketing</i> of the ideas is similar.')
