I have recently told friends and family to start buying and wearing medical masks.  Our experience is that medical masks are very protective in protecting the wearer from catching the disease. Hospitals have plenty of masks now.  A cloth mask prevents spread away from the wearer, but a medical mask protects both the wearer and those around him&#x2F;her.<p>Medical masks protect in two ways. One, they filter the air at an extremely high level.  Two, they are fluid resistant, so the saliva droplets that are filled with virus particles cannot penetrate the mask.<p>Most health organizations, including mine, are noticing that COVID prevalence within their employees is less than the local population as a whole despite being around contagious COVID patients all day long. The major difference in these two populations is that health care workers are wearing medical masks.')
