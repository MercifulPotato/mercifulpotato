But you&#x27;re left wondering at the end how does it specifically relate with what he&#x27;s concretely asking for (which presumably is just increasing the specific rate at which &quot;JieBei&quot; short-term debts can be repackaged and re-securitized). In other words, it just seems like a big obfuscation and dance around to ask for neoliberalism without saying the word and strawmanning the flip side as obsolete &quot;pawn shop mentality&quot;.<p>Granted, regulatory hurdles this late in the process seems super opaque and vindictive. But on the flip side, leveraging debt at this level seems like a massive systemic risk to the social order considering the risk ratings on the repackaged security will be equally opaque within the Ant debt product offerings. It&#x27;s fascinating seeing this as China more or less writing Glass-Steagall on the fly the day before the IPO. Despite it looking like 2 kids fighting over an ice cream, I think it&#x27;ll be massively consequential in A) demonstrating leveraging on new forms of financial instruments like ML-driven peer-to-peer lending based on massive amounts of Ant&#x2F;Alibaba consumer data, and B) it being a fork in the road on China setting a precedent on neoliberalism or politics controlling capital.')
