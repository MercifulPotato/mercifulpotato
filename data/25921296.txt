Such &quot;radio silence&quot; serves no useful purpose to normal users, but can make the browser appear buggy, e.g. if tracking protection broke a site, and you wouldn&#x27;t get a fixed blacklist in a timely manner.<p>Someone has to host these dynamic components, and the browser has to get them somehow. IMHO it&#x27;s way better if they&#x27;re fetched straight from Mozilla that has strong privacy policy and a good reputation to uphold, rather than from some rando free distro mirror.')
