Over the past 17 years I&#x27;ve managed to collect:<p>- A Milwaukee right angle drill. I don&#x27;t use it much, but when I need it, it&#x27;s invaluable<p>- A Porter Cable circular saw. I get a bit more use out of this. Circular saws are so versatile.<p>- A hand-held power planer. I used this a lot fitting doors to irregular door jams. I&#x27;ve loaned it out quite a bit too. Like the right angle drill, I don&#x27;t reach for it often now, but when I need it, I&#x27;m damn glad to have it.<p>- Just purchased a Makita track saw. I&#x27;m anticipating a lot of long rip cuts in the next few months. I could do this with a circular saw, but I really like the simplicity of the track saw.<p>- Power drill. I&#x27;ve had it forever. I rarely reach for it, but it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s there.<p>For battery powered tools I have:<p>- Power drill. This is a must-have for battery. The convenience is worth having to get a new one every so often. I&#x27;m on my second one now. I started with a Craftsman a long time ago. I replaced the batteries once and now I can&#x27;t get new ones.<p>- I&#x27;m considering a jig saw. I&#x27;m not sure. It feels like this would be more convenient w&#x2F;o a cord, and they&#x27;re cheap enough that I wouldn&#x27;t worry about replacing it. Still undecided.<p>For yard tools, I can totally see going with battery powered as well. I&#x27;m considering an edger. I hate dealing with two-stroke engines, and a cord would be a huge PITA. I&#x27;ll probably get a battery powered one and try to stay in the same brand for leaf blower and chainsaw.')
