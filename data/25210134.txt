Physics are &#x27;easier&#x27; than manufacturing&#x2F;building something...lab scale&#x2F;bench scale are exponentially easier than full scale...full scale is exponentially easier than building something consistently. Ask Tesla.<p>I have yet to hear them talk about how they are manufacturing parts for the full size centrifuge. When I hear them mention forging or the heavy press program or similar I&#x27;ll take them slightly more seriously. I&#x27;m trying to conceptualize what the arm would look like and the force it would have to withstand and honestly can&#x27;t.<p>Right now, they have been stuck for years on &#x27;trust us this doesn&#x27;t violate the laws of physics&#x27; which is not comforting when I only ever hear that from cooks.')
