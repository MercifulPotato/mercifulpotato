It represented one instance in a chain of many of Japan&#x27;s fixation on the decisive battle. Guadalcanal, on the other hand, represents the American strategic fixation on continuous pressure and attrition. When the United States fought the battles Japan wanted to fight, we won (repeatedly; Midway, Philippine Sea, and Leyte). When Japan fought the battles the United States wanted to fight, they lost repeatedly. That suggests that none of the battles themselves were <i>decisive</i>, rather the strategic concepts of the respective nations.<p>Anthony Tully does a nice job demonstrating how absolutely screwed the Japanese were <i>whatever the outcome</i> of Midway: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.combinedfleet.com&#x2F;economic.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.combinedfleet.com&#x2F;economic.htm</a>')
