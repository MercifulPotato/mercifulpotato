I understand they are necessary, and I don&#x27;t have a better idea on how to do them, bit they suck.<p>I remember the mechanics exams from University. You would get a test that is simply impossible to finish in the given time, which meant that you had to practise doing the calculations really fast. You had to speedrun through the whole exam, pattern matching the examples against stuff you practised. No time to think about them.<p>Knowing fully well that the exam could only be finished in time via this method, they made sure to put examples in it that we had never seen before. And while this is the right way to test understanding, and the way I prefer my tests to be, I really don&#x27;t understand how they can ask you to do both at the same time, with that time pressure.<p>We had more than 50% fail rate at these exams, which the professor was proud of.<p>And all of this combined with the worst teaching I ever witnessed.<p>I also had a fun experience getting between two professors once. I failed the second semester math exam, and the assistant professor held a refresher course in the third semester, for the roughly 100 people who also failed. It was 1.5 hours for something like 6 weeks. It was the best class I&#x27;ve ever been in, and I really deeply understood all the stuff for the first time.<p>The professor proper then prepared an exam for us that 95% of the people failed (I managed to get a passing grade, along with 5 other people).<p>Literally an old professor being angry at a younger one who does better teaching. And that old professor was even pretty good, to be fair.')
