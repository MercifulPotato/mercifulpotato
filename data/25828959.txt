I assume whoever picks it up just sells it.<p>So what? If you want to spend your days selling used junk for a few bucks, and I don’t, more power to you. My time is more valuable than that.<p>I understand why you’re upset and it does seem like this person took advantage of your good will. I guess I would not get too upset about it; you don’t know how much work that person put into selling these things. Could have been a lot more time than made it worthwhile.')
