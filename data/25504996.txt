Item(by='1_player', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608634463, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25502403, text='&gt; The continuous political vigilance widely acknowledged to be necessary to prevent liberal democracy from devolving into tyranny is incompatible with the political disengagement you seem to prefer, so I think would be not at all a disgrace if your opinion were unpopular.<p>That is if you believe that politics have infected all corners of the Internet because there&#x27;s a &quot;struggle to prevent democracy from devolving into tyranny&quot;, paraphrased from your quote.<p>In my opinion it is the other way around: politics are everywhere nowadays, and it&#x27;s perfectly fine and encouraged that teenagers participate and radicalise further toward one side, people whose critical mind are still under development. Add a sprinkle of bipartisan politics, so it&#x27;s often a matter of black and white, and the amplifying power of social media, and that&#x27;s the perfect recipe towards tyranny, bigotry, entrenchment and moving further and further from the centre.<p>I said this on other threads and I&#x27;ll repeat: until not very long ago at all, politics was a game for rich, old people. It still is, but these days you&#x27;re shamed if you&#x27;re not actively involved in it.<p>I&#x27;m from Europe, while this attitude has started to affect over here as well, it&#x27;s come from the English-speaking world (two famous bipartisan democracies, which are very overrepresented on the Internet) yet people are always quick to point out &quot;The internet&#x2F;world has always been so politicised.&quot; No it wasn&#x27;t, in my experience.')
