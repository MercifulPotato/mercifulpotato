For non technical folks static site generators, GitHub, DNS, SSL, etc may seem like rocket science, and a hosted WP subscription will be way more user friendly.<p>Nevertheless I believe that most software developers will find setting up and managing a static site blog pretty easy, just a matter of forking a pre-configured Jekyll &#x2F; GitHub Pages repository, fiddling with it&#x27;s theme, and then configuring their our custom domain and hosting options. There are plenty of tutorials on this subject.<p>If we were to compare self hosted WP and Jekyll then I would even argue that Jekyll is less complex, since it&#x27;s just a bunch of static files behind a simple web server that doesn&#x27;t require SSR or a backing MySQL database.<p>Jekyll writing experience may be considered worse for most, since you are required to write directly in &#x27;md&#x27; files using markdown and sometimes even HTML elements. But again, if you&#x27;re familiar with front-end development this may not be an issue to you, and I actually prefer it this way.')
