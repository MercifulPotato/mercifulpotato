The rewards are not actually rewards but rather donations, the “last for 1k years” part seems naive, and I’m not quite sure what “zero sum internet” means.<p>I’d me more than interested in backing a project such as this, but I’d need something more concrete around the design, implementation, and roadmap. Diaspora is a good example for such a kickstart page. Even though their results were horrible.')
