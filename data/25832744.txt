It&#x27;s all well and good training people to be engineers, but the universities end up teaching the whole syllabus to them again in about 6 weeks. It&#x27;s just shit.<p>The only reason why I am now doing theoretical physics (I was in the dumb group initially and worked my way up largely by myself) is because I read a calculus textbook by accident and got hooked when I was 14. Even when I made it to the top of the pile I still wasn&#x27;t allowed to do anything more than calculus because the module system means we had to choose <i>as a class</i> whether to do group theory or not.')
