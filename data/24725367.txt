RedHat is potentially as vital to the Linux ecosystem as Boeing is to the (pre-pandemic) civil aviation sector. If IBM falls apart and RedHat vanishes, the impact on the Linux sector could be almost as bad as Boeing collapsing. Since Linux runs everything that&#x27;s not a desktop computer or an iOS device, IBM-RedHat failing would be a very major problem for everyone.')
