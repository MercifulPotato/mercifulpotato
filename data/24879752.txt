Item(by='wholinator2', descendants=None, kids=[24879911, 24880001], score=None, time=1603553147, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24879656, text='Basically yeah, but I would rephrase it as liberation from constant reliance, or from always having the perfect answer, from a lessened use of ones mind, from necessary human interaction to ask anyone a question, or from spending any precious second not maximizing the amount of information and &quot;productivity&quot; you can achieve.<p>It&#x27;s about being a human, in an environment, around other humans, with time to spare for original thoughts and just to enjoy being alive. I expect many people on this forum are the &quot;productivity&quot; and &quot;maximizing&quot; type. Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with that! We need those people! But I think we might all be able to benefit from truly relying on ourselves in difficult situations, instead of just asking the answer box to help us avoid any annoyance or unnecessary difficulty.<p>If you wish your life to be a perfectly smooth series of directions given by a silicon hivemind, feel free friend. Sometimes the bumps and the dirt are what make life worth living though. Sometimes the empathy of unnecessary difficult situations can create bonds and perspective that shiny chrome smoothness cannot. Persistent smooth perfect answers have their purpose and we wouldn&#x27;t have invented it if not for its use but I find the rather strong opposition to experiencing and exploring one&#x27;s humanity, whether this way or that, rather frightening. Almost sounds like it&#x27;s the chrome talking and not the human.')
