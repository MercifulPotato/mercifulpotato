I mean, in this case, all the information I got about what the ethical AI team demanded comes from the posted article. My previous comments about this were all taken from Gebru&#x27;s public tweets and information in the primary posts. I didn&#x27;t feel a need to rehash what she actually DID because it was all posted, multiple times, in public forums, and my assumption (perhaps incorrect) was that other people were similarly up-to-date on the controversy.')
