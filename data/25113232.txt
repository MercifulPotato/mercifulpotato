When I read it, I assumed they meant things like - prefer more individual freedom and less central control, see the risks of government corruption and abuse of power as equally concerning to the problems that government is supposed to be solving, etc. The things that then manifest as policies which are pro-freedom of speech, pro-small business, pro-free association, pro-private property rights etc.')
