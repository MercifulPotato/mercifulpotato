Personal these topics may be relevant but for the groups mission they are not. It doesn&#x27;t matter if the topic is relevant for a majority or minority at all. Even if the topic would be of interest for all people, if its not relevant to the mission it simply inst relevant in the scope of working and should not be handled at work.<p>If you are mistreated by others AT WORK for whatever reason including political reasons then you have (should have) a way to report that. The Mission Protocol isn&#x27;t about looking away from wrongdoings its about focusing on the mission and avoiding mission non-critical stuff.\nYour views on whatever outside of that scope can be emotionally affected by current events but that can not and should not be in the way of the companies mission.')
