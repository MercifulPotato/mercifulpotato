If we consider the perhaps likely outcome that MacBooks will one day be ARM-only, that Docker will not offer cross-arch emulation, and that our development environment will be ARM only, it then becomes likely that we’ll migrate our UAT and PROD to ARM based instances.<p>If we go that route it’ll mean more money to the AWS Graviton programme and likely further development of ARM chips. I can’t see this affecting RISC-V but the M1 switch could very well benefit the wider ARM ecosystem.')
