Producing an accurate MSA is hard even if you have many homologs.<p>They require protein homologs which means they can &quot;only&quot; do this for wild-type proteins. This work is useless with mutant and synthetic proteins. This is a big advancement that will assist crystallographers and NMR structural biologists with difficult wild-type proteins, but it doesn&#x27;t &quot;solve protein folding&quot; by any stretch of the imagination.')
