In my late teens and early twenties, there were times I had to scrounge my cushions and rummage through my car to find enough change to eat a meal.<p>We live in a society where everyone has access to a computer—personal or local library. We have all the information we need to bring (the majority, but not all) ourselves up from poverty to lower middle class or even middle class.<p>It’s my belief that it boils down to a few things:\n - self learning\n - dedication<p>Self Learning: if you must, pirate the crap out of all knowledge you need to get your family in a stable place. You need a textbook, you can find an older version; need a research report, find it online; you need.... just go find it and get it. If you don’t know how to find it, learn how to find it. If you don’t know where to start, ask someone. Just do...<p>Dedication: it’s so much easier to just come home do what you need to do with the family and then sit down and watch tv or do something that’s not going to progress you. It’s not fun and your mind will fight you every step of the way, but what’s more important to you? The show that’s on in an hour or the stability of your mind and family? Don’t look for those immediate returns, yet rather look for those returns that pay off in a year or two or 5. As i said, it sucks, but what’s more important?<p>One thing I’ve noticed over and over again is the difference between being raised in middle class or upper middle class vs poverty is the view of the work place—I’m not saying this is true for everyone, but just what I’ve observed over time. \n - Middle class and up: not as scared to talk back, speak your mind, or challenge their opinion to your bosses or colleagues.\n - Poverty: fearful of doing the aforementioned<p>I, for some reason see this as one of the largest issues with advancement as it propagates to not just the work life, but also the personal life too and thus creates a fear of challenge—it’s better to go with the status quo than to break out.<p>How can this change? Learn learn learn and then go find a place where you can apply your new skills and then just keep learning instead of doing the easy thing...<p>Thoughts?')
