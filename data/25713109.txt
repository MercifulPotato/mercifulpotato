Or any theoretically equivalent end-to-end encrypted messaging app where the “message group” is the entirety of the current Parler community.<p>Apple, FB or anyone else, have no way to separate those users from others.<p>Of course, one could argue that Apple &amp; Google could institute new policies to prevent the spread of misinformation on apps. But nobody can argue that it is a definitively more difficult problem to solve than on a user-content based, server-driven social network such as Twitter.<p>WhatsApp has implemented feature such as limited forwarding to combat misinformation.<p>But still they haven’t (and technically cannot) prevent Parler users from expressing their views.<p>In other words, I don’t see any instance of Parler users losing their right to free speech anywhere. Sure, they don’t enjoy the luxury of _convenience_ driven speech. But depending on how you define it, none of us have universally convenient means to express our speech.')
