If you had a partner and were diligent about timing, it was a ridiculous amount of points.<p>I have a stash of bonus points and that I book hotels and trips with for years.<p>Previously the hotel and flight bookings in their portal were very good deals, at some point they switched to booking through a rebranded Expedia and now I would say the prices are average compared to other travel aggregators.
