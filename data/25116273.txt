It&#x27;s cheaper, more reliable, and just works&quot;<p>I got bad news for ya: I just bought a new Yoga a month ago and it is just as bad if not worse.<p>* Animated ads in the start menu tiles<p>* I&#x27;ve had to upgraded and restart almost every other day for 4 weeks<p>* there are ads that keep reapparing in the tiles on update<p>* there are constant popus reminding me to log in to my windows account (or problems that I can&#x27;t log in because I HAVEN&#x27;T)<p>* nVidia ads popping up in the lower-right corner<p>* MSoft ads popping up in the lower-right corner.<p>* Also, day one: tried installing some LabView software and BSOD (well, the new pretty color blue they use and the high-res warning).<p>* Starting a new app takes about 15~30 seconds (I believe it is phoning home the way macOS does, not sure).<p>Win10 now looks and feels like an annoying clickbait website. Once macOS includes ads, it&#x27;ll be an equally appalling UX.<p>The only respite I get are logging into AWS compute instances or my Ubuntu and FreeBSD boxes. They can&#x27;t take away my BASH CLI.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m getting a lot of &quot;it never happened to me.&quot; Yes, I&#x27;m sure some of you haven&#x27;t seen this. I&#x27;m jealous.<p>Meanwhile on my new MacBook PRO 2019:<p>* Fans randomly turn on with nothing running and `powermetrics` has the fan at 3200 RPM and cpu temp of ... 40C? I literally have to reboot to get them to turn off. I walked into my office one morning and apparently the fans had been running all night with no apps loaded and nothing using considerable power.<p>* Only some USB-C ports work with my belkin Gigabit adapter. I had to experiment with where-to-plug-what to get it to work. Apparently all USB-C ports on it are NOT the same. Grrr.<p>* Gigabit adapter never goes to sleep, stays warm when plugged in<p>* The apple display adpater port + USB-A + power jack periodically drops the screen, and sometimes when I log in I  have to open my laptop (I stay docked), wait for the video to mirror, then close my laptop and wait for it to switch to the external monitor.<p>* Too many Catalina updates this year! But they are faster than my Win10 box.')
