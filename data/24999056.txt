Google searches show that &quot;Benemy&quot; is a real surname, but it&#x27;s not very common.<p>Google also informed me that &quot;Benemy&quot; (or &quot;Benami&quot;) means &quot;no name&quot; in Urdu, so if one was into word games then &quot;Bill Benemy&quot; could be &quot;Bill No-Name&quot;.')
