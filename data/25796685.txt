That said, they are all good and donâ€™t matter enough to sway what machine to buy.<p>That is <i>exactly</i> the problem!<p>There are people who love the butterfly, they seems to prefer the mushy key typing experience. That is fine, but those same people dont <i>hate</i> scissors either.<p>But there are enough people <i>hate</i> the butterfly keyboard. To the point of hoarding 2015 MacBook Pro. You dont need any Internet forum to judge, we can judge the market by 2nd hand MacBook Pro pricing. There are demand for good quality 2015 MacBook Pro simply because of the keyboard.<p>The same goes with Trackpad, some people love larger trackpad, but they wont go mad with a smaller one. And then there are people who have palms that couldn&#x27;t even use the new MacBook Pro.<p>Basically both of these are the wrong trade offs and compromise.<p>And both of these design decisions were all post Steve Jobs&#x27; making.')
