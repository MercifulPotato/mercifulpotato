Chief among them is RISC-V[0]; SiFive[1] is taping out RISC-V processors to real hardware, selling dev boards, and stuff like that. These are real, competitive, Linux-capable CPUs, although widespread adoption has not happened yet.<p>On the more minimalist front, the ZipCPU[2] is simpler (though has less software support), and it&#x27;s author writes some really great blog posts about HDL[3] (Hardware Description Language -- how these CPUs are defined).<p>You might also enjoy developing for very small embedded systems. I like AVR CPUs such as the ATMega328P (of Arduino fame) for this purpose. Although not open-source, they have quite good and thorough datasheets. AVRs are very small 8 bit systems, but as a result, you can fit most of the important details in your head at once.<p>If you want to talk more about these topics, feel free to get it touch with me.
