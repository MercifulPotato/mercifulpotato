After the first two culture-fit interviews I had a technical interview with the lead dev and the CTO.<p>There were no programming tasks. It was a 3-tiered conceptual question on designing a backend system. They asked me how I would do this and that. How would I handle this edge case? What if the user did this? What if the data was shaped like this?<p>I don&#x27;t think I even did that well in it, but it was the most enjoyable interview process I have had.')
