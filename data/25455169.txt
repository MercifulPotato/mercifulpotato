It&#x27;s obvious what the benefits are when running outside a container. Inside a container, on the other hand, there should only really be one important process running. That process will need to have access to all the interesting parts of the file system anyway, and being root inside a container doesn&#x27;t let you do crazy superuser stuff like installing a kernel module.')
