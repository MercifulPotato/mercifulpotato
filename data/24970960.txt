The only extra information you need to correctly do time calculations is the table of leap seconds, and that&#x27;s a very small amount of mostly-static data that everyone can agree on.<p>With your proposal, time handling would be slightly simpler, but every geographic coordinate everywhere would need to be tagged with a date to let you know which epoch it was relative to, or else you would get huge (in local terms) errors.')
