Your (not-included) estimates of how much money a US resident definitely will have to pay is by definition never going to be as good as zero. It&#x27;s almost like you&#x27;re setting out to smooth over this also-easily-verifiable fact with &quot;rhetoric&quot;.<p>This reasoning is absurd. If I have to pay $10&#x2F;mo in the US, but I make $100&#x2F;mo more in the US, then I&#x27;m still up $90&#x2F;mo. No one cares about &quot;not paying a fucking cent&quot; if &quot;not paying&quot; actually means &quot;I&#x27;m $90&#x2F;mo poorer&quot;.')
