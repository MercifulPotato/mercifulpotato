A woman being choked in Melbourne for not wearing a mask? A man getting pepper sprayed by police at a Tim Horton&#x27;s in Canada for not wearing a mask? A man getting shot in Canada, after he left the store, by police, for not wearing a mask?<p>The Premier of Victoria locking down the entire state with tiny measures of case numbers? Continually changing news stories and narratives? The demonetization of any challenge to the State narrative as conspiracy theory. Doctors like the ones in Bakersfield or the silence of Scott Atlas&#x27;s social media.<p>Sweden, and everything that entails (what you think, what the media tells us, what&#x27;s actually true).<p>We have never seen this type of response to a virus before in all of human history. The culmination of both fast travel technology with media technology is causing a massive diaspora of conflicting facts and information with media and corporate giants attempting to control every aspect of what&#x27;s true and what is not.<p>This is absolutely mass hysteria.')
