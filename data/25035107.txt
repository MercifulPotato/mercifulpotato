It’s more about control and having options for working the way you like instead of Apple’s way. I can’t imagine accepting such a limited environment. Unfortunately, thanks to iOS, I still have to build and test things in the Apple prison complex regularly - so I know exactly how limited things are by comparison (I prefer a Linux desktop.)<p>Programming is about controlling things and Apple hates giving users and developers control. It’s about getting your job done by being able to install and configure things the way you need them without a lot of hassle. If you’re willing to put up with that hassle and live within the confines that Apple has laid out for you than that’s good for you. But there’s a reason that the vast, vast majority of programmers are not using a Mac outside the SV bubble. Even Windows gives you more control! (and hardware freedom of choice.)<p>I’ve been programming since the early 90s and Apple has always been anti-developer and anti-power user.')
