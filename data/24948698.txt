I don’t think either of us have enough evidence to know whether it’d be better or worse without the CoC.<p>To the contrary, it&#x27;s pretty easy to deduce that the CoC had nothing to do with the ban of the player you reported. Do you genuinely believe that a &quot;CoC enforcement committee&quot; sat down to review demos of the reported player and analyze whether their actions constituted CoC violations? No, that process is reserved for political enemies and occasional power trips. The ban was almost certainly a result of an automated process. For example, in CS:GO, if a player receives significantly more abuse reports than average, they will be muted by default. No human review is involved. I imagine the Valorant ban is something similar, because there is no way Riot could afford to pay actual humans to go through these reports.')
