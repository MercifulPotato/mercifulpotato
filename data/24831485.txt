Item(by='nullc', descendants=None, kids=[24832323, 24831636], score=None, time=1603144582, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24831140, text='Many of the security design flaws in signal have had little to no direct impact on usability.<p>For example, for years we asked for a simple mechanism which could be used to view a users key and mark it as identified, to prevent MITM -- even one buried in a menu for advanced users (who could at least act as canaries against widespread interception).  Not only was the request turned down but usually responded to with vigorous personal attacks against the requesters.<p>Subsequently once a fingerprint validation method was added it was gratuitously bound to be pair-wise, making it largely unusuable -- e.g. post a pgp signed signal fingerprint that any of your contacts could use to transfer trust from an existing key.  Requests for a non-pairwise version, even as just some advanced thing that grandma never sees ... again, hostility.<p>The constant logic-bombed auto-expiring software that make signal effectively open-source-in-name-only. etc.<p>I think signal is fine as an insecure messanger:  Unencrypted communications protocols should have no place in on the internet today.  But to advance it as a <i>security tool</i> almost certainly puts people&#x27;s lives and freedom at risk.<p>Common usage of signal has zero security against MITM: users aren&#x27;t effectively notified that the contacts keys have changed-- and given how often users lose&#x2F;wipe phones perhaps that&#x27;s really the best that can be done for normy friendly software.<p>If that&#x27;s how it is, that&#x27;s how it is. Some resistance against passive monitoring is still a critical upgrade.  But don&#x27;t call it secure: if you do people will do and say things using it that they wouldn&#x27;t otherwise.')
