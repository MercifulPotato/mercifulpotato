A huge contributor to that was that people&#x27;s work was rewarded on a metric other than their productive output, as measured by what society was willing to pay for in the free market.<p>To put it another way - we need people to produce. And we need them to produce the right stuff. The best system we have to deciding what&#x27;s right is what other people use their dollars for.<p>If we paid people on some other metric we&#x27;d end up with a lot of bullshit work, no aspirations, and physical shortages.<p>I am sure your definition differs.')
