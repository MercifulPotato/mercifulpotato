If a private party doesn&#x27;t like what you say, tough shit get off their property. Otherwise you&#x27;re impinging on their freedom to keep anyone the hell they want off their property.<p>Speaking of high priests, it would be pretty funny if discussion boards required declarations of faith to join and being kicked off was akin to excommunication. In such an environment, moderation is just another name for &quot;suppression of heresy within the religion&quot;. Surely the government wouldn&#x27;t dare intervene in the free practice of religion, would they?<p>Overall, I find it hilarious in this whole discussion that conservatives appear to be arguing for more government interference in private property rights and freedom of expression.')
