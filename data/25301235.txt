Item(by='njwi332', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607081828, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25288215, text='As a counterpoint to the sibling replies, I speak fluent Japanese and was still refused entry to a local izakaya in Hakodate. It wasn&#x27;t about the language, I made plenty clear that I could speak it well. They just didn&#x27;t like foreigners. Racism and discrimination is definitely a thing here, and I certainly wouldn&#x27;t go back to that restaurant.<p>However it&#x27;s only happened once in a year of living here and never in Tokyo, only a ruralish city, so I don&#x27;t take it as an indictment on Japanese people. I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of bars in rural America or Australia (where I&#x27;m from) that would have been equally unfriendly to someone of Asian ethnicity. At the end of the day you just have to decide not to let it ruin your day that there are some bad eggs in the bunch, no matter which country it is.<p>*Caveat though that I&#x27;ve heard it is much worse here for people from China than it is for white foreigners such as myself. If it made up a significant portion of my experience it would be hard to live here comfortably.')
