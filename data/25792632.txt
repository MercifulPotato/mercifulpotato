If, however, you&#x27;re confident that you&#x27;ve hit onto something better than everyone else, let me echo others and suggest that you should try to implement it; either you will succeed and show the industry the error of their ways, or you&#x27;ll find out why things are the way they are, and both of those are good outcomes.')
