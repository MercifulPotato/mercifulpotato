Anything beyond that (SSH, text editing, web calls, etc) I do through Termux. I wish I could combine the two more seamlessly, but it&#x27;s effortless to switch between the two.<p>Learning: Wanted to learn to use vim. Termux provided simple vim access and vimtutor. I&#x27;ve also used Termux to freshen up on languages and write a few scripts. Namely, differences between Python2.7 to Python3 which I didn&#x27;t look into until this year. Starting on C and&#x2F;or Rust soon.')
