Item(by='rglullis', descendants=None, kids=[25707559], score=None, time=1610241306, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25706803, text='And you are yet to start your run of Localism. ;)<p>&quot;Custodial&#x2F;Non-custodial&quot; is not the point of Hub20. It&#x27;s not supposed to be used by a company that wants to operate an exchange or to compete with Coinbase. It&#x27;s supposed to be used by me and my family, or a small co-op of artisans that want to sell things online. <i>Trust</i> is not enforced by the technology, it is built and supported by the group that is using it.<p>A rule of thumb for Hub20 should be <i>do not join an instance if you can not knock on the door of its operator</i>.<p>&gt; Trust them? Do business with them. Don’t trust them? Maybe don’t.<p>Try this:<p>- I trust Joe with the cash register from our shop, but I wouldn&#x27;t trust him to manage my life savings. For the former, we can use our Hub20 server and enjoy quick, low-cost transactions. For the latter, I will keep a very secure and private wallet.<p>- Rachel trusts me to manage the funds collected by the members of her church, but she doesn&#x27;t trust me to manage the funds of a multi-million investment club which she happens to have some shares on. She <i>can</i> trust the blockchain contract that lets me and her pool our resources and invest in real estate development, though.<p>- I trust Bandcamp to pay me my fair share of whatever I sell through their platform. I don&#x27;t trust them to be my bank. But Bob, my Starving Artist friend is kind of crazy and he is okay with using Bandcamp as his &quot;checking account&quot;. If Bandcamp wants to use Hub20 as a payout option (and if they implement a KYC system that satisfies Uncle Sam), they can operate their own instance of Hub20.<p>The idea with Hub20 is to get a different kind of decentralization. I can be a part of many different hubs, just like most people have different circles of relationships and different <i>types</i> of relationships and different <i>levels</i> of trust among them. The payment network as whole gets more robust, more people can get access to crypto. It&#x27;s still &quot;permissionless&quot; (if you don&#x27;t trust anyone, you can just run your own node just for yourself) but it also enables non-technical people to use it. It brings the benefits of economies of scale without forcing people to trust and depend on some faceless company.<p><i>Trust is not binary</i>. It depends on context and the nature of the relationship. Should I be involving Visa on everything, costing me and everyone else 3%+ of our capital and <i>rob us</i> the opportunity to exercise this mutual trust? Also, wouldn&#x27;t the act of involving a third-party signal that this mutual trust does not exist?')
