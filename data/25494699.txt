Certain participants intentionally submit partial order messages to reduce latency, and only complete the order message upon the happening of an event or trading signal. Implementation of the enhancement is expected to reduce the frequency of intentionally split order messages as the additional processing time will serve as a deterrent.<p>The letter is on the web, but it&#x27;s a PDF; the Google search result has a redirect link to it, DuckDuckGo can&#x27;t seem to find it, and Firefox on Android won&#x27;t tell me the URL it downloads things from, so I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t link to it!<p>CME also made a more general change, where if they decide a participant is sending dodgy messages, they will reroute all their packets to a special gateway for &quot;additional checks&quot;, but in practice, to impose a latency penalty. Can&#x27;t find the documentation on that at all, though.')
