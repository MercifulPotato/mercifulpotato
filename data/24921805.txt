It&#x27;s theory in the mathematical&#x2F;logic proof based sense. There are really two uses of the word &quot;theory&quot; for this context, science based theories proven by statistical experiments, and logical based theories created from a set of elements and assumed axioms.<p>Things like this shouldn&#x27;t be titled with &quot;Theory.&quot; Call it your &quot;opinion&quot; or a &quot;design pattern.&quot; Theory is associated with things like the theory of gravity (science) or game theory (math). This title is wildly inappropriate and shows a lack of understanding of what constitutes a theory.<p>The fact that this post is voted up shows how much the public misunderstands &quot;theory&quot; and how they mistake things like this which is actually just someone&#x27;s qualitative opinion with the integrity of an actual theory.<p>Using big words and drawing diagrams does not lend any formal legitimacy to your opinion.')
