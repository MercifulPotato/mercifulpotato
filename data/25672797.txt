Many more of the other models, of course.<p>It took me a while of waiting but I finally got mine a couple of weeks ago. It is pretty nice.<p>Since the chips sell out in the same day they arrive at the store you won&#x27;t ever see them &quot;in stock&quot; but obviously, out of all the chip models at least 100 new PC enthusiasts every week own one just from that one store.<p>I also know several friends of mine who finally received their prebuilt gaming systems with Ryzen 5800 or 5900 chips and Nvidia 3080&#x27;s. There was a lot of delay but the OEMs are shipping a lot of boxes.')
