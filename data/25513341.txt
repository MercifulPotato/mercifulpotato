The list goes on forever.<p>Right now -- this very second -- one can find videos of labradors mauling people, basset hounds mauling people, schnauzers , scottish terriers, again, the list goes on forever.<p>The difference? The public hasn&#x27;t been shown countless scare-pieces on basset hounds &amp; schnauzers, so it&#x27;s not a topic of interest in the public mind.<p><i>Any</i> poorly trained dog is a foot-gun.')
