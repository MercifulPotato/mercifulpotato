It was silly to do lazy validation of memory accesses and Intel fixed that.<p>For Spectre, you can&#x27;t really have a high performance chip that isn&#x27;t vulnerable to it in theory.  A processor can&#x27;t read your mind and know which code within a process should be able to communicate with which data within the process unless you tell it.  You could just go to strict in order but that&#x27;s taking a huge performance hit.  Programmers cominging secure information and JITs running untrusted code within the same process will have to work to make sure they&#x27;re not vulnerable to Spectre going forward.')
