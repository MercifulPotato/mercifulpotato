Your message confirms my hypothesis.<p>- From your point of view, you opened the box first, got blue and caused me to get red. My message confirms your hypothesis.<p>We can repeat this experiment thousands of times, every time, we both get a 50&#x2F;50 chance of red vs blue, and every time, the hypothesis is confirmed.<p>In order to know who really was first, the only way is to wait for the other person result. For example: when you open the box, start a timer, stop it when you receive my message. It the time is less than the times it takes for light to travel between us, I was first. But in order to have this information, you have to wait, so it is not faster-than-light anymore.')
