It&#x27;s as simple as that. I have never had a Gmail account until an Android device sort of forced it on me, because I definitely didn&#x27;t want to link things up to my real email address, so I just signed up for the whole thing. Do I ever use that email address? Definitely not! Why would I?<p>What happens if I ever loose access to that account? I have to register a new one for my Android device(s). Boohoo.<p>Some of this obviously requires &#x27;abstinence&#x27; and not having the same &#x27;cool toys&#x27; as other people. I.e. if I buy lots of fancy apps that I actually rely on for my daily life, then loosing this Google Account will hurt. No longer have a PC and do everything including your banking, gaming etc. with the tablet (i.e. things you really need or things you paid a lot of money for)? Well, welcome to the walled garden where Google practically owns you.')
