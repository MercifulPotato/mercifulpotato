Item(by='udwx', descendants=0, kids=None, score=3, time=1605633673, title='Alternatives to Notion for those on corporate VPN', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;ve been using Notion for a more than a year now, and I love the following features:<p>* slash commands<p>* export&#x2F;import to&#x2F;from markdown<p>* export to pdf<p>* page linking &#x2F; page nesting<p>* support for code snippets<p>And I&#x27;ve used Evernote for several years before that, and after I made the switch, I&#x27;ve never had to look back. I find that my productivity has increased (content throughout, clarity of thought, knowledge base building, etc) since I&#x27;ve started using Notion.<p>Now, coming to the nub of the issue, I&#x27;ve recently discovered notion.so is blocked on our corporate VPN. And I&#x27;m missing out on the valuable Notion features.<p>I&#x27;ve researched other note-taking tools, and I&#x27;ve used ClickUp for a while, but then recently settled in on using Obsidian. While I like Obsidian, I see that it&#x27;s not a total replacement for Notion, and I don&#x27;t like spending extra hours syncing content between my various devices.<p>And it doesn&#x27;t look to me that migrating the site from notion.so to notion.com (not a redirect, but a full migration) is on Notion&#x27;s roadmap for the foreseeable future (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Notion&#x2F;comments&#x2F;f6x9mk&#x2F;why_the_so_domain&#x2F;)<p>For those of you who&#x27;ve switched to using Notion, and are currently not able to use Notion at workplace, what are your alternatives?')
