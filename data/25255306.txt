The startup mystique that YC perpetuates is designed to convince very smart people to work extremely hard on a small chance of becoming rich. They become a product in YC&#x27;s portfolio, which captures just enough unicorns to allow hundreds of others to fail.  This example is one of the lucky ones. There are order of magnitude of others who worked as hard but got nothing.  The only consistent winners in this game are PG and his investors.  You are the product. They&#x27;re buying your surplus labor at a very cheap rate.')
