People might forget this but various right wing leaders in Europe had large followings in the US right up until WW2. It took a huge war and government intervention to change trajectory. Similarly Hoover&#x27;s FBI and the federal agencies at that time, or Nixon&#x27;s whitehouse, trended towards these ideas.<p>Social media might be a part, but it always feels like this is a longer historical trend.
