On the contrary, lockdowns are largely credited for overall having averted cases and deaths. I maintain a list of peer-reviewed studies (and some preprints) on the subject, and the vast majority agree: \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;zorinaq&#x2F;status&#x2F;1307723024523616257" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;zorinaq&#x2F;status&#x2F;1307723024523616257</a> There isn&#x27;t a <i>single</i> peer-reviewed study that suggests lockdowns are responsible for a &quot;large chunk&quot; of excess deaths. You are victim of misinformation.<p>Your comparison to 1999&#x2F;2000 flu death is invalid: there were delays in reporting deaths that caused many deaths to be reported on the week after Xmas, hence the artificially high peak of that week of 2000. If you compare monthly excess deaths (to smooth artificial peaks) you will see covid excess deaths in April 2020 surpass flu excess deaths of January 2000.<p>And yet, this comparison would still miss the point: covid is such a serious disease that despite (effective) lockdowns, it still managed to kill more than he most severe flu seasons of the last 20+ years. That alone should make you stop and think...<p>There is in fact a government report that found «<i>in comparison with the deaths due to influenza and pneumonia occurring in the year to 31 August 2020, deaths due to COVID-19 have been higher than every year monthly data are available (1959 to 2020).</i>» <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ons.gov.uk&#x2F;peoplepopulationandcommunity&#x2F;birthsdeathsandmarriages&#x2F;deaths&#x2F;bulletins&#x2F;deathsduetocoronaviruscovid19comparedwithdeathsfrominfluenzaandpneumoniaenglandandwales&#x2F;deathsoccurringbetween1januaryand31august2020" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ons.gov.uk&#x2F;peoplepopulationandcommunity&#x2F;birthsde...</a><p>Germany and Switzerland have implemented particularly effective lockdowns, hence little to no excess deaths.')
