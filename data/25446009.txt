RedHat broke their pinky promise: CentOS 8 will no longer be supported after 2021.  That in mind, while I have been using RedHat since the dot-com days, I am now a Ubuntu user.<p>Breaking a promise like this is non-trivial, and I have stopped using RedHat as a result.  If RedHat had said “We’re not going to release CentOS 8” or if they had said from the beginning “CentOS 8 will only be supported until the end of 2021”, I would be singing a very different tune right now.')
