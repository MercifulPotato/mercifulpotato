But businesses only pay taxes on their profit. It&#x27;s a big, big difference that changes the incentives.<p>Itâ€™d be insane to have it any other way for businesses. Whole swathes of low margin businesses would be impossible to operate. For example a super markets average margins are 3-5%.<p>Corporate tax is (generally) on profits because you can deduct costs. It allows for the flow of money to efficiently find a sub supplier for the parts of a good or service.<p>The real scam is when things like health insurance premiums are deductible for a company but not for an individual.')
