Idris&#x27; type system is precise enough to capture that information, so specifying the type in Idris&#x27; type system should be enough to generate (at least a first-pass of) types for anything from Java to Haskell by just dropping the information the target language doesn&#x27;t understand.<p>At the very least, it would make for some really precise, concise documentation that could save people implementing libraries a lot of time digging through prose.<p>Edit: Looking at the examples, it looks like it&#x27;s actually value-level Idris describing Algebraic types, not Idris types, so I&#x27;m not sure if it supports dependent quantification.')
