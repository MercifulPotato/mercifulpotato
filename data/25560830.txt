There are even more technical problems I won&#x27;t get into here (see Question 9 in the interview).<p>In short, I see no reason why we couldn&#x27;t be getting slightly less effective but way cheaper drugs today if the FDA was willing to slightly relax its use of the precautionary principle. But in order to keep pushing the frontier of drug efficacy, we&#x27;ll need new technical breakthroughs to help us solve the search problem.')
