Item(by='DenisM', descendants=None, kids=[25769161], score=None, time=1610577249, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25768439, text='&gt;  Is the author seriously arguing that it was easier to distribute information in the late 1700s and early 1800s than it is now if you&#x27;re off of the internet<p>No. He is arguing that 200 years ago distribution was about equally hard for everyone, but today it&#x27;s very easy for those approved by the IT moguls, and still hard for everyone else.<p>&gt; Is he also arguing that FB&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;Apple&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Amazon have a monopoly on the ability to communicate on the internet<p>Google and Apple have absolute 100% lock on app distribution. FB &amp; Twitter together have pretty much 100% lock on &quot;like and share&quot; media, which accounts for, say, 90% of all news discovery. Of course you can still stand on the corner and hand out printed pamphlets, but there is significant difference in reach that is affected by having favors with the IT moguls and not by the appeal of the message itself.<p>I wonder whether you really didn&#x27;t understand this or simply expressed your disagreement as a question?')
