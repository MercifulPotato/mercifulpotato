The Internet was a great experiment with unknown possibilities. I edited Wikipedia and talked about its potential.<p>I was skeptical at the same time - it was an experiment, not a revelation. I used to tell people, &#x27;I don&#x27;t know how Wikipedia could work, but it seems to&#x27;. I&#x27;d apply &#x27;The Cathedral and the Bizarre&#x27; concept to it, and &#x27;with enough eyes, all bugs are shallow&#x27; (even though those ideas were intended for open source software).<p>The &#x27;wisdom of the crowds&#x27; depends on good faith from the members of the crowd. Otherwise you get the manipulation of the crowds and propaganda of the faux crowds. One serious concern I had was that, if economics predicts human behavior to some extent, Wikipedia could be a victim of its own success: The more readers and influence it had, the more likely people would try to use that power. I first saw it happening in 2006, in the page on the Duke University lacrosse team&#x27;s sexual assault case. Many editors clearly engaged in rewriting history in order to advocate for the lacrosse players; many had names clearly asserting affinity for Duke U., such as &#x27;bluedevil&#x27;. That seizure of power was highly disturbing; has Wikipedia developed better means to prevent it now?<p>Of course, the focus on using the &#x27;wisdom of the crowds&#x27; to manipulate has shifted to other platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter. I stopped using Wikipedia years ago, other than to lookup basic facts that have little significance to me. I use Britannica (or other expert sources), which IMHO is very good and often very well written. While there is some benefit to &#x27;wisdom of the crowds&#x27;, I never know if that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m getting at Wikipedia. As for the expert approach,<p><i>In matters of science, the authority of thousands is not worth the humble reasoning of one single person.</i>')
