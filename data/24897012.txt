One way to do this is to participate on Math Stack Exchange:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;math.stackexchange.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;math.stackexchange.com&#x2F;</a><p>I&#x27;d recommend not only asking, but also answering others&#x27; questions. It&#x27;s not the same as having a group of people that you regularly talk to, but it&#x27;s something.<p>You could also hire a graduate student tutor. For example, here is a list of math grad students at the University of Wisconsin willing to do this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.math.wisc.edu&#x2F;tutors" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.math.wisc.edu&#x2F;tutors</a><p>An hour every two weeks would go a long way.')
