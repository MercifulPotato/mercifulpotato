Here’s the full statement we received:<p>“Joe Biden opposes the Trump&#x2F;(Betsy) DeVos conception of ‘school choice,’ which is private school vouchers that would destroy our public schools. He’s also against for-profit and low-performing charter schools, and believes in holding all charter schools accountable. He does not oppose districts letting parents choose to send their children to public magnet schools, high-performing public charters or traditional public schools.”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statesman.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;20200720&#x2F;fact-check-does-joe-biden-want-to-end-school-choice" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statesman.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;20200720&#x2F;fact-check-does-joe-...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joebiden.com&#x2F;education&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joebiden.com&#x2F;education&#x2F;</a>')
