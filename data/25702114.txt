Item(by='CogitoCogito', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610212110, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25701383, text='&gt; Jesus Christ how many times do I have to point out that China is linguistically unified and that the Hong Kongese have no significant cultural differences to justify independence. The burden of proof lies on you to disprove me. Countries don&#x27;t stay unified for centuries without a linguistic and cultural common ground.<p>So basically you&#x27;re just stating opinions as facts and then claiming it&#x27;s my job to disprove these &quot;facts&quot;. Okay fine like I said in my last post we&#x27;ve made our positions clear and I don&#x27;t see any point in going back and forth. Believe what you wish.<p>&gt; And I can&#x27;t reply to your comments because of rate limiting on HackerNews. No need to be extremely passive aggressive about it.<p>There&#x27;s nothing &quot;extremely passive aggressive&quot; about pointing out that your posting style is extremely hard to follow. Maybe you should consider posting less frequently so that you&#x27;re not rate-limited? Anyway I&#x27;ll stop this discussion here so that you can focus on all the other posts you&#x27;re apparently making. Maybe the extra bandwidth will allow you to post normally in the other conversations at least.')
