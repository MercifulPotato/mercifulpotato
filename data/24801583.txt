Reality is somewhere in the middle. For some specific use cases, (image manipulation, Alexa skills, etc.) serverless is fantastic. Dealing with persistent storage and DBs is challenging. But continues to evolve.<p>Managing server fleets and keeping them patched is no small feat. How much of the productivity can we gain if we didn&#x27;t have to do all that with serverless?
