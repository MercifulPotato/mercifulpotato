An ISO standard cable with several tiers or power delivery ratings, mandatory for all EVs to accept should be the way to go. We have a standard gas&#x2F;diesel &quot;plugs&quot; all over the world, why not have the same with EVs?<p>Edit: Obviously, a car should accept only the &quot;tiers&quot; that it is rated for, but the charging station and the car can negotiate which &quot;tier&quot; that they would like to charge.')
