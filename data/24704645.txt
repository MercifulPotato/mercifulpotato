Even if your older board supports the newer generation, likely you have a more limited QVL for DDR4 modules, so compatibility and perf may be limited.<p>This is why I implied it had limited impact, though there is some truth to boards with newer AMD chipsets offering better memory support.<p>This was a response to parent comment stating it was greedy behavior to try to get consumers to buy new motherboards with new chipsets, when the chipsets have little impact on RAM compatibility&#x2F;support.')
