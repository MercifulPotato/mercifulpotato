It would be fast enough to prove RH myriad different ways, and not be finished until its proof cannot be shortened any more, just as AlphaGo isn&#x27;t finished until no version of it can beat it.<p>Whether humans could understand the shortest possible proof is another question. It might take generations of study just to understand its outline, and many more to extract all the lemmas implied.<p>Or, it might turn out to be a trivial trick, and not reveal anything new and substantial.')
