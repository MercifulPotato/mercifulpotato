I.e. for the purpose of this scenario, in a holistic sense, Facebook doesn&#x27;t avoid hiring Americans.<p>So like, the government says facebook had a bunch of PERM positions that they sandbagged recruiting for to Americans. But then, \n&gt; while comparable positions at Facebook that were advertised on its careers website during a similar time period typically attracted 100 or more applicants each.<p>Are these...the same positions? How does facebook&#x27;s hiring process work? \nIs there actually any discrete limit to the &#x27;slots&#x27; on the careers website? Do they have 2500 listings for software engineers, or just like, everyone applies, we are looking to hire ~2000 people this year.<p>I can see where the government is probably right in saying &quot;you did it wrong&quot;.\nBut if you are facebook, and the hiring strategy is honestly:<p>* Hiring for the &#x27;American&#x27; positions is only limited by the company finding the applicant skilled enough. There is no numerical cap.<p>* Only foreign applicants apply to a discrete, government-limited pool of PERM positions. This way you don&#x27;t waste the PERM positions on Americans, who can apply to you nigh-unlimited pool of &#x27;American&#x27; positions.<p>* Starting salary for everyone is the same ($156k)<p>I could certainly see that the government&#x27;s way of interpreting your &#x27;insidious hiring program&#x27; is flat-footed to the point of being wrong.')
