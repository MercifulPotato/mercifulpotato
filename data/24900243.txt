Very little string parsing or data formatting required, no malformed data, etc. There&#x27;s a library floating around on GitHub somewhere that makes loading a simplified version of React Developer Tools inside Puppeteer just a script you eval with a jQuery-like API for selecting React components, but I can&#x27;t remember the name right now.<p>Someone could probably do this without needing a headless web browser (via jsdom)')
