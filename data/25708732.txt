Absolutely no soft drinks at all<p>Yep, same here. I am bad about other sugars though.<p>&gt; 2. Find an exericse regimen that requires you to show up, on time, and be accountable to others.<p>I just focus on regular workouts (bike rides in my case) with friends. We have a Wednesday night ride and a weekend ride every week. As you say, it&#x27;s a habit. If I don&#x27;t text location by Monday night, someone is asking me where the ride is. Likewise for the weekend. I keep fit on other days too so I don&#x27;t hold up the pack.<p>&gt; 3. DO NOT treat exercise as a priority.<p>I break from you here. But much of this is because I have a different attitude about exercise in general and that is:<p>4. Make exercise fun. If you find some activity you love doing, you look forward to getting your workout in as opposed to dreading it. For me, riding is not just physical well being, it&#x27;s mental and sociological. For me, riding is a priority because having fun and hanging out with friends is a priority.<p>While all the above is mostly about cycling, I&#x27;ve been taking up kayaking now too and seeing a similar effect.')
