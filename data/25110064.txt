I think 400+ years of indentured servitude and slavery paints Romania as quite barbaric. You should probably reconsider your biases.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Slavery_in_Romania" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Slavery_in_Romania</a>')
