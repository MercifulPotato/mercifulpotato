Moreover, Apple has opposed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act which would penalize companies with forced labor in their supply chains[1].  It also has a history of similar accusations with regards to their LCD screens [2] and their uniforms [3].  All of this is completely ignoring their history with foxconn and other suppliers that routinely abuse their employees without compelling their labor through outright force.  Apple might say that they care about this issue, but its clear that their supply chain is setup to take advantage of poor workers from 3rd world countries at a minimum.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;9to5mac.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;23&#x2F;anti-forced-labour-bill-apple&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;9to5mac.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;23&#x2F;anti-forced-labour-bill-apple...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;9to5mac.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;02&#x2F;apple-suppliers-implicated-in-reports-of-uyghur-forced-labor-in-china&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;9to5mac.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;02&#x2F;apple-suppliers-implicated-in...</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;9to5mac.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;10&#x2F;apple-store-staff-t-shirts&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;9to5mac.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;10&#x2F;apple-store-staff-t-shirts&#x2F;</a>')
