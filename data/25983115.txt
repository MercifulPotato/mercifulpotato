Maybe there&#x27;s 10 different sources to they could have gotten the money from and they chose not to as well. Maybe there were actions they could have taken to solve the problem and chose not to because they were more aligned with the problem not being solved.<p>This is why I don&#x27;t like this explanation. At face value it is a good excuse, but when you do an analysis from an ethics and alignment point of view:<p><pre><code>  Citadel is in bed with Melvin.\n  Robinhood is in bed with citadel\n  Robinhood sells data to citadel (this almost certainly is at the direct cost of its users)\n  Robinhood does transactions through citadel (skimming some of the money off of users transactions)\n  *Robinhood is more aligned with citadel than retail*\n</code></pre>\nThe whole point of an excuse is to seem reasonable. Even if the excuse is true, the underlying relationships are very smelly. All of this from every side is speculation until discovery is done.<p>Counterpoint, trading firms across the board were asked to alter behavior: If &quot;You wouldnâ€™t believe the shit going on behind the scenes right now. 10 hedge funds have fallen, and our clearing firm emailed to block ALL trading platforms from $GME, $AMC, and the like.&quot; is true, then that is quite literally a conspiracy. \n <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;IAmA&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l81l3g&#x2F;dan_pipitone_cofounder_of_tradezero_fought_our&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;IAmA&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l81l3g&#x2F;dan_pipitone_c...</a>')
