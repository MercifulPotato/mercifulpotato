And that&#x27;s <i>before</i> you consider all the non-technical crap Apple has thrown at its customers recently.<p>And of course, the big issue is that in order to use the M1 you must switch your entire stack to Apple. Considering the broad swaths of essential business software that is simply incompatible with Apple OS, that&#x27;s not going to happen.')
