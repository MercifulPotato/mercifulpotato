Or maybe the &quot;liberals&quot;. That&#x27;s because the &quot;left&quot; historically has been as assertive as the &quot;right&quot; if you look at the extreme communist parties VS fascists&#x2F;feudal parties.<p>I do think you have a point though, but you can&#x27;t be liberal and authoritarian at the same time. So to push for liberal ideas and laws&#x2F;rights, while also pushing to enforce it through anti-liberal means is pretty contradictory, and so it makes sense most liberals don&#x27;t do so.<p>Also remember that liberal societies are the exception in human history, not the rule. Almost never have people rallied around the idea that each man has a natural right to life, liberty and property and governments must not violate these rights.')
