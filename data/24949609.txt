Converting that into methane would require to produce 3.5 million gas trucks filled with methane - for just a day.<p>And Germany’s current total hydro capacity is about 40 GWh, so only 1&#x2F;40 of what we need of storage for a single day.<p>I don’t see a future for 100% renewables other than for small countries like Norway, Austria or Iceland who have lots of mountains for hydro power but only a fraction of the population of Germany or even the US.')
