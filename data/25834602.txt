It&#x27;s not that markets lose or destroy human experience, it&#x27;s that it gets lost when we organize our society <i>only</i> via markets.<p>It&#x27;s also a bit of a silly question because everybody will have a different answer depending on their personal moral and value system, but generally it will be things that are not easily priced.<p>Sticking with the theme of literacy of the overall discussion here, poetry comes to mind.<p>Poetry has notoriously low market value, and really poems are almost inherently not a good to be traded on a market. They are rooted in an oral tradition of poems being shared in social settings. At least in my personal experience, this is still largely the case. And yet many (obviously not all) people value poetry to some extent, perhaps because there are some poems they find beautiful, or they tickle the brain in just the right way.<p>But again, poetry is just one example and I&#x27;m not even saying that it&#x27;s the most important one, it&#x27;s just that they fit particularly well into the larger discussion here.')
