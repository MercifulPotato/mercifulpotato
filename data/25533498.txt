So I don&#x27;t think it has affected my productivity at all.<p>Of course I don&#x27;t know what would have happened if I&#x27;d started with touch typing.

I.e. some value, but not as important as other skills.<p>I&#x27;d be very surprised if we don&#x27;t have conversational interfaces with human-level comprehension within twenty years - possibly ten at a push.<p>You might think code will always be typed, but I honestly wouldn&#x27;t be sure about that.')
