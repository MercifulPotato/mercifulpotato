I put the monitors so I see the middle of the screen. It means that my eyes are moving in every direction, and I&#x27;m less likely to bend my neck downwards, resulting in neck strain.<p>EDIT: This does result in the monitor being very high up off the desk, but a good monitor arm will handle it without a problem.')
