You want some particular pet behaviour, and claim it is impossible to achieve. When someone points out that it is in fact possible, you are unhappy that someone else did not anticipate and implement it pre-emptively...<p>Do you also expect your &#x27;custom getproperty&#x27; (whatever it might do) to have been predicted and pre-implemented by someone else? And do you also expect arrays to &#x27;just know&#x27; what value or behaviour you are looking for whenever you index out of bounds?')
