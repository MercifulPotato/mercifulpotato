Call your parents when you think of them, tell your friends when you love them.<p>83. Compliment people more. Many people have trouble thinking of themselves as smart, or pretty, or kind, unless told by someone else. You can help them out.<p>84. If somebody is undergoing group criticism, the tribal part in you will want to join in the fun of righteously destroying somebody. Resist this, you’ll only add ugliness to the world. And anyway, they’ve already learned the lesson they’re going to learn and it probably isn’t the lesson you want.<p>85. Cultivate compassion for those less intelligent than you. Many people, through no fault of their own, can’t handle forms, scammers, or complex situations. Be kind to them because the world is not.<p>86. Cultivate patience for difficult people. Communication is extremely complicated and involves getting both tone and complex ideas across. Many people can barely do either. Don’t punish them.<p>87. Don’t punish people for trying. You teach them to not try with you. Punishing includes whining that it took them so long, that they did it badly, or that others have done it better.<p>88. Remember that many people suffer invisibly, and some of the worst suffering is shame. Not everybody can make their pain legible.<p>89. Don&#x27;t punish people for admitting they were wrong, you make it harder for them to improve.<p>90. In general, you will look for excuses to not be kind to people. Resist these.')
