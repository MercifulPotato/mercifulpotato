What they take away from a story is the emotion, not the facts. It can be the complete opposite of what really happened.<p>Subjective language is one way they do it. For example, an organization might have a &quot;culture of abuse&quot;. That&#x27;s not factually wrong but it has no meaning either. When the Christchurch massacre happened, suddenly there was &quot;growing white supremacy&quot;. When they want to suggest a person is dishonest, it&#x27;s &quot;X claims, without evidence, that ...&quot;.<p>Another way is taking advantage of people&#x27;s inability to distinguish anecdotes from a representative sample. If they want us to believe that crime is increasing, they&#x27;ll report more on crime so the audience gets the impression that there&#x27;s more of it. They may even say it&#x27;s increasing, which it always is if you cherry pick the appropriate time scale.<p>Then there&#x27;s using quotes from other people to say whatever the journalist wants to say themselves. A technique for interviewing people is to go fishing for someone to say the right thing, which someone inevitably will if you ask enough people. Or worse, telling their subjects what to say or tricking them into saying they thing they want, perhaps by expressing the same belief themselves and using the human nature of agreeableness to get the subject to say they agree, even if they don&#x27;t really. Sometimes the quotes are written inline with the rest of the sentence so they feel like facts being asserted by the journalist but aren&#x27;t subject to the usual standard of accuracy.<p>I&#x27;d say these are more serious problems than factual errors because they&#x27;re convey high level feelings and overall sense of the state of the world which are being prefabricated and fed to gullible voters so they don&#x27;t have to think for themselves. With factual errors, you still have to use those facts to conclude something, which is hard mental work.')
