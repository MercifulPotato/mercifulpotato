I&#x27;ve seen many based off library rolling shelving as well, most older than aforementioned designs. \nPretty natural conceptions for architecture student + student living + spending time in library + furniture design (easy to tackle small scale project). Of course after graduation, most of these ideas get dropped because (I guess) market conditions were never particularly fertile for these designs to take off. Even now with vanlife, micro living, I rarely see smart furniture like this in real life. Still extremely niche. I wonder if there&#x27;s a term for multiple discovery &#x2F; simultaneous invention for design ideas that gets spontaneously rediscovered due to very specific conception conditions but never material on mainstreet. Something sisyphean about it all.')
