Item(by='woodruffw', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608594330, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25500682, text='&gt; Isn&#x27;t this kind of leap?<p>No. Here are two specific examples:<p>1. The Cross Bronx Expressway, which basically created the South Bronx[1]. &quot;The Power Broker&quot; by Robert Caro is one of HN&#x27;s most frequently recommended books, and covers this subject (as well as other racially-motivated planning projects by Robert Moses) extensively.<p>2. I-65 and I-165 in Mobile, AL cut directly through the historic &quot;Africatown&quot; neighborhood[2]. Residents regularly complain about both automotive and nearby industrial pollution, encouraged by ease of access by the highway[3].<p>Most of these effects are more visible on the East Coast rather than the West Coast, since the East&#x27;s older and denser cities had fewer &quot;paths of least resistance&quot; when building the Interstate Highway System during the midcentury. But it wouldn&#x27;t particularly surprise me if the areas that are <i>now</i> expensive in the cities that you mentioned were originally cleared for highways under &quot;slum clearance&quot; or similar laws.<p>Edit: This is anecdotal, but I figured I&#x27;d mention it anyways: I grew up in Manhattan, and <i>virtually everybody</i> I grew up with has (or had) asthma. Some of that is to be expected from other pollution sources (in particular, NYC used to burn very dirty heating oil), but I <i>also</i> went to public schools that were directly alongside major state and interstate highways.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cross_Bronx_Expressway#Urban_decay_and_congestion" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cross_Bronx_Expressway#Urban_d...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;19&#x2F;733996699&#x2F;alabamas-africatown-hopes-for-revival-after-slave-ship-discovery" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;19&#x2F;733996699&#x2F;alabamas-africatown...</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;2018&#x2F;jan&#x2F;26&#x2F;africatown-site-of-last-us-slave-ship-arrival-sues-over-factorys-pollution" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;2018&#x2F;jan&#x2F;26&#x2F;africatown-s...</a>')
