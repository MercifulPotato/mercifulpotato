I&#x27;d say much the same of its distant, MySQL-flavoured cousin, TiDB, but I don&#x27;t see nearly as much written about that. I guess this mostly just reflects a lower emphasis on marketing by PingCAP... but if the equivalent content did exist I&#x27;d be up-voting it just the same.<p>So while the reason Cockroach Labs employees are paid to write these articles might ultimately be marketing, they&#x27;re far from being what I&#x27;d consider marketing fluff pieces, and so it feels to me that they&#x27;re at least as much &quot;for curiosity&quot; as they are &quot;for promotion&quot;.<p>Again, I&#x27;m in no special position to interpret the rules, but I find it hard to object to the content itself, and I figure most articles like this are going to get posted here eventually anyway. Would proper Hacker News etiquette be to wait for someone not affiliated with Cockroach Labs to post it?')
