As in, &#x27;halting&#x27; could have been substitued with &#x27;somewhere in the program variable x gets set to 5&#x27; and you could still construct a program in which it would be impossible to prove whether or not x gets set to 5. And of course the proof of the Halting problem relies on the possibility of crafting programs that are deliberately hard to parse - something that may or may not happen in practice.<p>And so for me it all boils down to &#x27;complexity is complex&#x27;. Which is kindof obvious to anyone thats wokred on large programs but might not be so intuitively obvious in some other fields. And so thats why there&#x27;s always bugs. However hard you try, there is so much complexity in a large bit of software that you can&#x27;t ever squash them all.<p>And parallel processing adds another layer of complexity for sure. But I dont see how worrying about the Halting Problem helps deal with that any better than some of the language constructs we&#x27;ve already seen.')
