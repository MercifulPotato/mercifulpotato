They&#x27;re not behind the curve because there&#x27;s new replacements. They were already behind many years ago, and that&#x27;s why Unity decided to rewrite them instead of upgrading. Non-preview replacements still haven&#x27;t arrived for <i>a lot</i> of those features. Maybe that&#x27;s ok for you, but it&#x27;s not for me. The end.<p>The rest of your post seems to be making the point that Unity is great for people who want to give input on how to create an engine. Sure, but I&#x27;d personally rather have software where the major advertised features are ready for use without having to &quot;deal with the fact... they&#x27;re unfinished&quot;.')
