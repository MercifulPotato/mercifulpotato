Linux has had the superior audio stack for the past two decades, and it&#x27;s considered the standard for most A&#x2F;V work. Just as there are &quot;Mac exclusive&quot; apps, many Linux&#x2F;*nix audio tools are never ported to MacOS (for example, the industry staple CALF tools are not actively maintained for MacOS).<p>The larger point here is that the M1 is not as revolutionary as it&#x27;s being made out to be. The &quot;flagship killing&quot; multi-core performance is embarrassed by the Ryzen 4800u, which can be found in NUCs that cost significantly less than the Mac Mini. If price were a limiting factor in the industry, we&#x27;d probably see more people reaching for those Ryzen machines: but we don&#x27;t. That&#x27;s why this article is ultimately self-defeating.')
