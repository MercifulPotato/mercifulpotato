I also should have stated I was talking more about US universities in this particular case.<p>The problem I see is that what you talk about as academic rigor isn&#x27;t what is taught and evaluated in many of the programs and classes that I&#x27;ve seen or been a part of. A lot of these exams and assessments don&#x27;t particularly evaluate you on your ability to research and understand knowledge. If I know for example that my physics professor uses a bank of questions then it is much more incentivized for me to memorize that bank of questions vs. understanding the content and working the problems myself. Whereas in say a Discrete Math or Algorithm based class, the final exam&#x2F;grade is based on a proof you have to write yourself, that encourages (or rather at times forces) you to learn and research like you said.<p>I also think the issue, and this may just be me looking at from my own experience, a lot of people don&#x27;t want to be scholars, as you put it. They went to a University based on the unfortunate expectation for some jobs that say you need that diploma as your entry ticket.')
