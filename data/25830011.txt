It&#x27;s very difficult to believe that there aren&#x27;t a ton of variations in how the data is gathered, filtered, and presented that need to be accounted for before any comparisons can be made. I&#x27;m not going to trust the law of averages to negate the effect of completely out of whack data when peoples&#x27; health is on the line.')
