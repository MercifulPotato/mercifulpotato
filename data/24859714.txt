As soon as you replace a single cell with a new cell of the exact same model, or a new cell of a different capacity and charge characteristics, that cell will charge differently than the rest of the battery pack. This results in an unbalanced charge situation.<p>If the battery pack has a battery management system with leads in between each cell to balance the pack, this might work. The BMS can drain off excess charge from the unbalanced cells and convert it to heat.<p>If the battery pack does not have a BMS, the unbalanced charge situation can lead to pack failure, with varying degrees of smoke and flame depending on the battery chemistry.<p>When in doubt, play it safe and just get a new battery pack.')
