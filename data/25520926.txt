Sometimes days in a row. I also work as an external examiner for CS students, which again, mean that I sit through long days of tedious technical tests.<p>I can’t imagine why you would ever want to subject candidates to that. It’s tiring enough when you’re not on the spot. I’ll typically spend the weekend or days leading up to such an ordeal in preparation, and when a day is over I’ll go home or to the hotel, do a few hours of prepping for the next round and then go straight to bed. Because you’re that spent. It would be ridiculous to expect a candidate to perform well, or show you anything about themselves, when the interviewer gets that busted. Because a candidate would have it much harder, especially if they are early in their careers.<p>I can’t imagine why anyone would want to subject themselves to those sort of ordeals either. I realise that I’m Scandinavian, and that our interviews and hiring processes are very different from Silicon Valley, but all my interviews have been as much about the company&#x2F;organisation selling itself to me as me selling myself to it. Well not for my first two jobs, but since then.')
