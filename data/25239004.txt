I wonder why Ada is not considered by large companies when it comes to critical low-level programming. Ada&#x2F;SPARK got all the constructs for that, it has been designed for very critical stuff, and low-level programming is pretty easy and so much less error-prone than most languages that are considered. It is actually a joy to do low-level programming in Ada. There are no performance penalties either, so that is not an issue.')
