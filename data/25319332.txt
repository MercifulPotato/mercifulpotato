Philosophy as a discipline has terrible quality control, and there is a great deal of status worship and outright charlatanry.<p>Often the big interesting questions are unanswerable, so the field is split between those who pretend to give answers (sometimes via bait-and-switch tactics, whereby a trivial or only tangentially relevant question is swapped in for the interesting one; sometimes via obscure, grandiose, ultimately hollow nonsense), those who fiddle around the edges making &#x27;progress&#x27; that can never resolve anything important, and those who give boring history lessons about the failures of the past.<p>On the other hand, philosophy can provide you with a toolset for dissolving confusion, crystallising concepts, and minimising self-deception. In its more poetic forms it can be inspiring and emotionally resonant, if you are that way inclined. Follow your nose, delve deeply into the areas that interest you, and make sure it&#x27;s an active process: always be thinking, rather than hoping to passively receive knowledge.')
