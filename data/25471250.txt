It&#x27;s still a frequent top-seller on Steam according to SteamDB, and it&#x27;s a 5-year old game.<p>Unless CDPR drops the ball in a major way, I&#x27;d expect Cyberpunk 2077 to have a similarly long-tail of popularity, meaning most people who will eventually play Cyberpunk 2077 have yet to do so.  There are also a lot of video game players who don&#x27;t follow video game news.')
