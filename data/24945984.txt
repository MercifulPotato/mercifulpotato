Gravity is like an echo for mass. It seems that we are now realizing it was wrong to assume that the echo was homogenous. The electron movement process in atoms is emitting gravitational waves. The movement of any type of energy causes gravitational waves. Gravity won&#x27;t be homogenous if the pattern of mass-energy emitting it, isn&#x27;t homogenous. We know most mass comes from cyclic processes, ie. the inner processes of hadrons. So it stands to reason that those processes should have a unique and animated gravitational field.')
