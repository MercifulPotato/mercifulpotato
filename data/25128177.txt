The one where there&#x27;s the starkest difference, k-nucleotide, Java gets to take advantage of a fastutil collection. I don&#x27;t think an equivalent to that hash map could be built in JavaScript.<p>Those benchmarks don&#x27;t cover this, but I wouldn&#x27;t be at all surprised to discover that Electron can does actual UI drawing more efficiently than Java can. In Electron, that whole layer is a bunch of (presumably) carefully optimized C++ code, while in Java the bulk of it&#x27;s still going to either be managed code, or be taking a lot of marshalling hits if it&#x27;s calling into OS APIs.<p>Long story short, it would appear that, based on those benchmarks (which, we all realize benchmarks are a lie, but still) the only spot Java clearly beats JavaScript is in applications where someone who cares all that much about performance would choose neither Java nor JavaScript, anyway.')
