Corellium is effectively providing a hosted virtual machine, presumably running on their own custom hypervisor, with their own management stack to give a convenient user experience.<p>You &quot;spin up&quot; VM-based instances of emulated devices (i.e. booting an emulator from a filesystem image), and can then research vulnerabilities and explore, and downgrade&#x2F;upgrade iOS versions rapidly, like you can with VMs. Real devices are fused to prevent downgrades.<p>Side-stepping brute force lockouts on passcode would be irrelevant, since that&#x27;s enforced on physical devices via the Secure Enclave - even if you dumped the flash from a real device, you&#x27;d not be any further forward as you would need the enclave&#x27;s contents to derive the correct keys to do anything.')
