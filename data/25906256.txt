I calmly corrected the incorrect statement. There is no flamewar here, but criticizing something incorrectly because of personal bias and lack of knowledge is more or less &quot;hating&quot; in a nutshell<p>&gt; How can you &quot;promise&quot; this?<p>Because I am a pro web dev who has made a ton of apps and understands the difference in power between HTML templates and JS components? There are objective standards of user experience and for anything non-trivial a web application is clearly going to be more interactive and deliver the data and workflows in a more user-friendly way. Reporting, workflows, interactivity, visualizations, all are much better when they&#x27;re done interactively with JavaScript than delivered as some static asset to the browser.')
