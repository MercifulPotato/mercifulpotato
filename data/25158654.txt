Item(by='qohen', descendants=None, kids=[25161212], score=None, time=1605863018, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25157485, text='Thank you for posting this -- I had the same reaction as you to the news of Flash retiring and an archive of Flash games that&#x27;s out there -- I remembered this site. But...I couldn&#x27;t remember the name of the site or its designer. Thanks to you, I was able to go back and revisit some of the games I enjoyed back when as well as getting to try some that were new to me.<p>For anyone unfamiliar with the site, there are over 60 casual-games, mostly of a calm, gentle, whimsical flavor (though there are a few arcade-style games in the bottom row). The games are simple to learn and engaging. I expect, given their themes and easy game-play that they&#x27;d be suitable even for younger children but are fine for adults as well.<p>&quot;High Delivery&quot;[0]  is a good example, in my view, where you move your mouse around to use a fan to blow a rising balloon in different directions as flowers fall down from above. The balloon has an attached bottle on a string and the idea is to collect the flowers in the bottle by moving the balloon in their direction. So well done.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ferryhalim.com&#x2F;orisinal&#x2F;g3&#x2F;high.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ferryhalim.com&#x2F;orisinal&#x2F;g3&#x2F;high.htm</a>')
