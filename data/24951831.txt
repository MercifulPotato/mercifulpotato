As awful as it is, it persists because your survival with sickle cell was better with it than without it in some regions where malaria was a big issue. (Granted, it may be a case where having one copy of the gene is a good thing with minimal downside and two copies is &quot;Damn, that suuuucks.&quot; But the mutation persists for a compelling survival reason and not actually because the butthead in charge of the universe is simply a sadistic jackass like I so often feel they are.)<p>Probably most major &quot;genetic disorders&quot; are adaptive to some degree and in some manner. And most drugs have significant side effects. If &quot;tan in a pill&quot; causes heart attacks or cuts off circulation to your toes such that they necrotize and fall off, welp, you can keep your damn &quot;tan in a pill&quot; as far as my pale ass is concerned.')
