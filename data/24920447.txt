For example, you might award carbon offsets for replacing a coal plant with solar, when that would have happened anyway just because the economics worked out better. If you&#x27;re actually removing carbon from the atmosphere, that&#x27;s not an issue.<p>As a matter of government policy, we definitely need to focus on reducing emissions, and a simple way to do that is with a carbon fee. But for voluntary contributions right now, it&#x27;s not so clearcut.')
