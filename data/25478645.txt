This alone I think invalidates some of your comment altogether.<p>So the tax actually says that a founder owning 40% of a $100M valuation would have to $40k per year (0.4% of the 10M that they own over the base 30M0). By your calculation, they would have to pay themselves ~$200k per year to afford that, which would be ~0.5 employees for a company that can afford ~16 (simply doubling your numbers for employees and halving the increases because of the half tax).<p>This doesn&#x27;t seem like such a horrible onus on a corporation. Now, if the valuation is wildly off, then perhaps there will be bigger problems - but that would also mean that this law gives better incentives for correct valuations of companies, a win in itself.')
