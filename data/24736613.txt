If twitter was bi-partisan, sure, but the people in charge clearly have a heavily bias.<p>You believe that and I respect your beliefs.  I don&#x27;t use Twitter, so I&#x27;m not really in a position to agree or disagree with you.<p>That said, so what?  The shareholders of Twitter own the company.  If the company is doing what the shareholders want (within the strictures of the law), then so be it.<p>Free speech cuts both ways.  I can say just about anything I want.  But Twitter or Facebook or HN, for that matter, is under no obligation to host my speech.<p>The only entities that are forbidden from censoring by the First Amendment are the Federal government,(and through the 14th Amendment) as well as state and local governments.<p>So if Twitter censors (or doesn&#x27;t censor) content that you think shouldn&#x27;t (or should) be censored, you are free to argue for your point of view and encourage others to do the same.<p>And Twitter can do the same.<p>Even if (and I take no position one way or another) Twitter <i>is</i> biased and acts upon those biases, so what?  That&#x27;s their right under the First Amendment.<p>It&#x27;s messy, and it pisses people off, but there&#x27;s no provision in the First Amendment that speech must be orderly or inoffensive.')
