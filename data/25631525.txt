Businesses and business leaders lobby politicians and donate to their political campaigns too. It&#x27;s strange to single out unions when there are so many different kinds of political interest groups, often with much more money than unions.<p>Public employee unions are bad, but the Tavern League, for example (I&#x27;m from Wisconsin), is ok? The National Rifle Association is ok? The National Landlord Association? Businesses and interest groups of every kind are donating money to the politicians who will directly regulate them. Why specifically exclude public employees from that?')
