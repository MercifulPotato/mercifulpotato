I’m sorry that you were disturbed. I did not feel it needed a warning label when posting, as the video shows neither cruelty, nor did I consider it particularly gory. But I guess I could have erred on the side of caution and included a short description as not to catch anyone off guard. Then again, that’s part of what fascinated me about the video and made me post it..<p>For late readers who are deciding on whether to watch it: the video shows somebody butchering some deer meat, and the deer carcass is shortly seen hanging in the background.')
