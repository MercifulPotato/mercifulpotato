For example, the “hands on wheel” metadata in a Tesla is based on angular force detected on the wheel, not actual hands on the wheel. Tesla will report that the driver didn’t touch the wheel in X seconds, when it would be more accurate to say the driver didn’t apply angular force, although their hands <i>might</i> have been resting on the wheel the whole time.')
