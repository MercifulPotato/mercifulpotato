Mainly because the RIAA,MPAA, and ESA always show up tp fight the exemption even when they know literally NOTHING about the exemption being asked for.<p>We petitioned for an exemption to allow museums and libraries to reboot old MMOs in closed rooms with no network connections. That&#x27;s because we couldn&#x27;t get anything more from the Copyright office. Still, the RIAA&#x27;s lawyer was there to lie and not understand a god damn thing we said, and accuse us of making tools that could be used to pirate any MMO.<p>I begged for them to tell me where to find such tools, as it would make life so much easier. Their lawyers were complete imbeciles who seemed never to have touched a computer, yet here they were telling a group of game programmers what they could and could not do with their programs.<p>Fucking horrible people, all of them.')
