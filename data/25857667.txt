I think it feels &#x27;wrong&#x27; because 10 thousand plays of your song feels like a big number. I mean 10 thousand sales of your single would make you some nice money, right?<p>Actually selling CDs was hard. Selling music is hard. Streaming is so much more passive than people credit and so much more like the radio.<p>I&#x27;m absolutely with you - financially lots of people weren&#x27;t successful before streaming and lots of people will continue to be unsuccessful today. Do it because you love it and if you can make a career (or even some extra cash) out of it be super thankful - there really hasn&#x27;t been a better time to actually get people to hear your art.')
