I highly doubt I would want to live as long as it would take to get to the heat death of the universe. I expect somewhere between a 10â€™000 and a few million years would feel about right, but for all I know it could only be a few hundred, or maybe billions.<p>But yes, all signs point to the idea that death is inevitable. I would just personally like to be able to increase my time in this universe by a few orders of magnitude.')
