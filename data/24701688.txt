The cost of 5 pens box at local pharmacy is about $33. The price used to be $40+ per box two years ago and recently dropped. So the insulin cost for me is about $7 per month.<p>I usually only care about the “real” price, which is the price I actually paid, rather than the prices from an article.<p>Maybe there’s difference between a type 1 patient, but this is my personal experience.')
