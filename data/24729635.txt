The title &#x27;Arabic World&#x27; is strange, it&#x27;s usually the &quot;Arab world&quot; unless they&#x27;re referring to the regions where Arabic is spoken.<p>It then gives statistics for Iran and Turkey, neither of which are significantly Arabic speaking countries, by which point you realise they&#x27;re conflating ethnic-linguistic groups with the most region&#x27;s most popular religion.<p>So by the time it&#x27;s quoting Bernard Lewis this feels like the old Zionist reductionist talking points you periodically hear from right wing conservatives bashing Islam. A quick search of the publication shows why this isn&#x27;t an accident. &quot;Islam has no tradition of separating politics and religion&quot;, well neither did Christianity, until it did.<p>This is not to say the state of education there is fine, nor can it be said people there are happy about it either. Every one of those countries have had nascent democracy movements crushed by their governments with the help of foreign backed interests and companies. We&#x27;re supposed to buy that it&#x27;s just Islam, please don&#x27;t look at NSO Group and Finfisher cashing in on the strangulation of reform - reform led by, yes, students, academics and other such terrorist armies of the night.')
