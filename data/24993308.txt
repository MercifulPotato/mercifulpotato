Understanding of human behavior is not freely flowing from access to human beings. Which btw is certainly not complete, and not that much internal as humans often cannot clearly see reasons of their actions, and ask for help from other people. Extracting knowledge from access requires serious discipline in finding of causative relations which studies like this tend to ignore. It makes them worse then meaningless because they produce pleasant illusion of understanding from what is essentially guesses.')
