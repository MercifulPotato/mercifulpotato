I can kinda see why companies want out. Especially as they get bigger. Two of my former employers had to go through this hurdle of moving to SaaS from a an on-prem installation.<p>* It&#x27;s really hard to scale support. You end up being on the hook for why &quot;it&#x27;s not working&quot; in thousands of different of environments you have zero control over. Anyone qualified to do that level of support could be making more money not hating their life.<p>* Nobody wants to pay for updates. I mean it&#x27;s totally rational but we also don&#x27;t want to support $old_version forever.<p>* Even when updates were free people still didn&#x27;t do it. Telling your users &quot;sorry you&#x27;re using an ancient version, please update&quot; just makes people angry. Again, understandable, but surprise! those same people suddenly weren&#x27;t angry about updates once they were on our SaaS offering. Turns out that frog boiling is reasonably effective.<p>* We had to deal with swaths of customer complaints about performance that we&#x27;re mostly not our fault. Sorry our app is slow on 1&#x2F;64th of a used SuperMicro. Maybe your IT department should get on GoFundMe?')
