What you&#x27;re talking doesn&#x27;t make any sense.<p>If one of entities involved in the exchange doesn&#x27;t want to trade, there is no trade. Simple as that. There is no such thing as privilege here.<p>I think you don&#x27;t understand the concepts of legal tender and misunderstood what I said.<p>No, you cannot decide to trade in whatever currency you&#x27;d prefer. This is illegal in most parts of the world. Even if you base the exchange in another currency, you&#x27;ll need to have a local legal tender to do it. There are exceptions, such as Panama... but in most of the world, you&#x27;ll be required to exchange to the local currency.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Legal_tender" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Legal_tender</a>')
