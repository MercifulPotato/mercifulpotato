But here&#x27;s what&#x27;s great: copyleft wouldn&#x27;t even stop Amazon, so they have to use SSPL which is a proprietary license masquerading as copyleft.<p>Also, one way they were clearly outright reneging on their promise was that Elastic explicitly promised the community that the parts of the codebase that were Apache 2.0 licensed (the &#x27;open core&#x27;) would never be made proprietary. They broke that promise for this move.<p>And what&#x27;s doubly hilarious is from a business perspective it&#x27;s an awful move. It won&#x27;t stop Amazon from making money - they&#x27;ll just fork 7.1.0 and develop under Apache 2.0 like they just did, and keep operating their service just the same. And by the way, it&#x27;s Amazon&#x27;s right, legally AND ethically, to be able to operate AWS Elasticsearch for profit - just as Elastic is right both legally and ethically to use Lucene as a necessary part of Elasticsearch.')
