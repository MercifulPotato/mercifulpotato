It didn&#x27;t turn out anything like what I&#x27;d hoped.<p>Bittorrent, semantic tagging, RSS, decentralized aggregation. <i>Ownership</i>. All dead or dying.<p>These companies are all gobbling up the commons and pushing us into serfdom. Apple, Google, the RIAA. The whole lot of them have poached and polluted the web and protected their profits.<p>Pretty soon we won&#x27;t be able to &quot;view source&quot;. It&#x27;ll just be binary blobs with DRM. The browser monoculture will collapse into a universal thin client that leaves &quot;standards&quot; in the dust and takes away all the features BigCo developers don&#x27;t themselves need. Nobody wants URL bars or ad blocking extensions. Those get in the way of the revolutionary UX they&#x27;ve prepared for us to predictably fawn over.<p>If Flash can die, one day 3rd party websites can too. In fifteen years your personal website won&#x27;t even work. I can hear it now: &quot;What&#x27;s haitch tea tea pee?&quot; Too confusing. Too dangerous.<p>Your tiny applet will exist within the WeeChat shell that is ChromeOS. The BigCo [1] will take 50% of your profits and make you obey arbitrary rules, lest your app be taken down. This bleak utopia is coming to Microsoft Windows too, because they know best how to Protect You™ and make your computing Trusted™.<p>All interactions will be recorded for training the models. You don&#x27;t deserve that data yourself. Only BigCo has the resources and expertise to build their own. And they&#x27;ll use it against^W for you to sell more ads and Farmville Loot Crates. You&#x27;re just another whale to pump full of dopamine.<p>&quot;Nobody would <i>personally</i> own an oil rig or an airplane, so why would anybody own a computer? What a laughable concept. Only big companies get to have those. Go back to your safe and easy to understand smart tablet that we&#x27;ve prepared for you, and consume your TwitterTok FaceFeed.&quot;<p>...<p>I hate supporting this. Economically or with my brain.<p>Stallman told us it was coming. Brace yourselves.<p>[1] there are several, and that is an important point, because several BigCo competing for your attention cannot possibly constitute a <i>monopoly</i>. That&#x27;s an outdated concept from last century. Go be angry at your local representative and&#x2F;or family members so you can drive more engagement for us.')
