Sure, it&#x27;s walkable just like everything in NYC is walkable, but I don&#x27;t know why you wouldn&#x27;t just pick another landmark in NYC like Central Park or Grand Central Terminal. Or just say that all are less than a 20 minutes subway ride away.<p>Also, saying there&#x27;s a direct subway line to Brooklyn from Manhattan isn&#x27;t saying much. Brooklyn is huge and to go anywhere besides downtown likely requires a transfer. I&#x27;m not arguing that flying is better between DC and NYC, but your arguments are making it seem like it&#x27;s trivial to get anywhere from Penn Station and impossible to get anywhere from Laguardia.')
