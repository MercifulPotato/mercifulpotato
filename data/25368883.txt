How does it affect me that it&#x27;s part of FB?  How is my life improved if its not?  Another voice&#x2F;video app will somehow thrive?<p>* Opening their APIs so that a couple of startups can build custom FB and Instagram apps?  One of them will succeed and the rest will fail.  This is the public benefit?<p>There&#x27;s such a huge difference between this and Microsoft&#x27;s anti-competitive case: Microsoft controlled your entire computer.  When they restricted apps, they restricted your entire ability to operate your computer, connect to the internet, etc.  Here, FB is constraining... your access to social data on FB??')
