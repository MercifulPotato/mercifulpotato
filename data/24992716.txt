I can&#x27;t. Democrats lost control in 2012 because of healthcare reform (which probably had just as big an impact on Colorado than the local gun reforms). Pandemic prevention and economic relief are out. Climate change, no chance. Free school certainly isn&#x27;t a unifying issue, even if it worked in Colorado.<p>To be honest, it just seems like you personally value education funding over gun control, and you&#x27;re assuming most other people feel the same way while ignoring the broader national context of what was happening to the Democratic party in 2012 and 2018.<p>Also, what does &quot;ceasefire&quot; mean? If most people were ok with the status quo, it wouldn&#x27;t be a major issue.')
