I get it. ...but I&#x27;ve also been on the receiving end when that 2-person team has 1 person leave and gets scaled up to a 5-person team, and you have to a) bin everything, and b) write the entire thing from scratch.<p>I personally consider it a very selfish way to build things. Me first. Me now. ...someone else&#x27;s problem later.<p>There are scalable solutions in this space (eg. pipelines, airflow, azure data factory, glue); doing it using lambdas is... not. ideal.<p>That&#x27;s not a problem with severless in general; but what you&#x27;ve described isn&#x27;t any of the things which is good about serverless either: what you&#x27;ve described is the problem with the low barrier to entry with serverless, resulting in production serverless code that skips past &#x27;quality control&#x27; to &#x27;let&#x27;s deploy straight to production!&#x27;.')
