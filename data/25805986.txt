I was just consolidating my thoughts through reasoning. The first abnormality I observed was light propagation having a direction that is asymmetric between source and target. There is no room for that asymmetry. Next is, assumption that time, space and causality exist independent of light, and movement of light being described in terms of those concepts. This can&#x27;t be true, because all these (light, time, space, change, causality, direction etc) only have mutual existence but not independent or absolute existence. So, light can&#x27;t be described in terms of others as if others already exist. For more discussion, you can ping me at vrpbkp_at_gmail.')
