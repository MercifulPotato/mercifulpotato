The sense of unity should extend to an actual implementation of unity as well: monetary support for people while they self-isolate would go a long way, for example.<p>Unfortunately I&#x27;m afraid that at this point its way too late. The window has moved and the new accepted normal seems to be lots of people dying from the virus. Due to privacy protection those people are also largely invisible to the majority of the population, except for their loved ones - an abstract number. There is also a general sense that &quot;testing doesn&#x27;t work&quot; - even more so accentuated by the repeated insistence of various medical professionals that rapid tests are &quot;not reliable&quot; (which misses the point - they are not for diagnosis but they&#x27;re a good infection control tool) and a focus on the vaccines.<p>Success for rapid tests is therefore highly unlikely at this point. Could have worked 3 or 4 months ago. Maybe if there are huge incentives to get tested and a large campaign to inform the public, it could work - but otherwise I doubt it.')
