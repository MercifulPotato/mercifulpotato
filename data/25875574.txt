This is true regardless of what anybody else does. Meanwhile anybody choosing to be listed doesn&#x27;t hurt the people choosing not to be -- it hurts the other people who are, by providing more news sources in the Google search results and diluting their traffic.<p>What you&#x27;re really saying is that if the largest news corporations form a de facto cartel through the use of the legislature to prevent Google from freely linking to everyone, they can monopolize the industry by disabling a discovery mechanism for independent news competitors.')
