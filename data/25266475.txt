In fact, most communists (and some political philosophers) hold that capitalism and democracy are incompatible. Leninism is (in theory, maybe not in practice!) also democratic, and anti-Stalinist forms of communism are too.<p>&gt;but because it tends to produce human rights respecting outcomes<p>From the communist&#x27;s point of view, they agree with this - communist movements until shortly after the second world war stressed non-involvement and the illegitimacy of &quot;bourgeois democracy&quot;. The communists contend that the mixture of capitalism and democracy does not yield <i>human-respecting outcomes</i>, even if they may produce outcomes that correspond to the liberal conception of human rights.<p>If there is no space to disagree with liberalism - from its economics (capitalism) to its conception of human freedom (the rights system and the law of the state), where does that leave us? I think it results in dogmatism and ideological conformity.<p>Liberalism and capitalism should be able to withstand criticism and rhetoric without banning such criticism because of the symbols used to represent it. And it really is just criticism - these people are trying to get elected.')
