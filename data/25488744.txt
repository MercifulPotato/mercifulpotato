As I read this series of game history, it&#x27;s a reflective process of realizing that my own childhood experiences with computers were part of a cultural moment shaping several generations. As a CS education researcher, I sometimes have conversations trying to balance my sense that these simpler games offer rich learning opportunities to beginners with the recognition that my nostalgia for a time and place doesn&#x27;t transfer to much value for the next generation. That said, has anyone seen modern re-implementations of Lode Runner or its kin, perhaps in Python, which would be suitable for analyzing program structure&#x2F;hacking&#x2F;teaching the basics of state-based AI?')
