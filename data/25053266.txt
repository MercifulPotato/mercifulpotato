But it&#x27;s supposed to be for time series data. This could be metrics, events, or any kind of semi-structured data that fits into tables where you want to ask questions about it over time.<p>It also defines rules for replication (push and pull), subscriptions to subsets of the data, and processing data as it arrives via a scripting engine.<p>Some of these features will arrive before others. Right now we want to make it work well for the data InfluxDB is currently good at (metrics, sensor data) and also work well for high cardinality data like events and tracing data.')
