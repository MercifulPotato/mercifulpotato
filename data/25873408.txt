Today&#x27;s fueling infrastructure is the way it is largely due to the difficulties of storing and pumping fuel safely (physically and environmentally speaking). There&#x27;s no reason that an electric car shouldn&#x27;t be able to &#x27;refuel&#x27; at a restaurant, grocery store, or at work (ie, where we see most charging places pop up).<p>Having four-corners real estate and employees dedicated for electric charging all over even city is just inefficient.')
