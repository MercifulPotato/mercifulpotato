The ANLF structured their organization such that nobody had good knowledge of the organization except the portion of the org chart immediately above and below them.  This annoyed the French because they would capture the grunts and it was a hell of a lot of work to work their way up to knowing who the leaders were since you&#x27;d need an unbroken chain of N people willing to narc on their boss.  This is made harder because people are more likely to narc on their boss&#x27;s boss who they don&#x27;t really know vs their boss who they have a hack of a working relationship with but that depends on knowing who your boss&#x27;s boss is.  Be advised that I glossed over some details in my original comment.')
