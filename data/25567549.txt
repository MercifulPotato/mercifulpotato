Everything I know about monads comes from &quot;Explain Monads Like I&#x27;m five&quot; by Theofanis Despoudis [2]<p>Futures&#x2F;promises do form a monad. async&#x2F;await is not a monad since async and await are not values, functions, or anything really. If they&#x27;re implemented on top of futures&#x2F;promises then async&#x2F;await are like a hamstrung version of do notation that only works for one particular monad.<p>Also async&#x2F;await is not really full continuations, it&#x27;s a very restricted subset of continuations (which is good, full continuations are incomprehensible).')
