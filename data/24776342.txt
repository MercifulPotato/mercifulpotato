A wind turbine, produces on average 1MW (from a potential 3.5MW with a 120m blade diameter).  The turbines need to be spaced at 8x the blade diameter to be optimal,  call it 1km.  (edit)<p>So at the moment, the UK needs 35,000 wind turbines to match the national grid.<p>We&#x27;ll need at least double that again to charge all electric vehicles in daily use if we get to 100% electric vehicles, e.g. only 5 million vehicles with 7kW chargers, but we have almost 30m registered vehicles in the uk.<p>That&#x27;s almost 200km by 200km of wind turbines, or 120 miles x 120 miles right now.<p>No wonder we&#x27;re putting them in the sea.  I can&#x27;t see all of Kent, Sussex, Surrey, Essex, London and Hampshire being covered with wind turbines somehow.')
