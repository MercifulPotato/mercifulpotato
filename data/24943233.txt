It’s possible with the top 3 CSPs to get virtual private, where machines do not receive a public IP and cannot reach or be reached from public IP at all, but can have private connectivity back to the office.  (This is only rarely leveraged, should be more.)<p>Or skip the article, and apply the title to energy instead of compute, as we entered the industrial age:<p><i>“When companies should go to public utility power, and when they should come back.”</i><p>How many companies should invest in an electrical power production plant on-prem instead of using their resources to compete?<p>There are of course narrow exceptions.  As an example, when we invented one-ticket one-seat pay-per-view video streaming for HBO, Showtime, and World Wrestling Entertainment, we delivered streams from 200 arenas around the country, and learned that power grids are less reliable than one can count on for 100 nights of live television a year.  WWE began bringing tractor trailer generator trucks and wiring the arenas to run off that power during the live show, letting the “show go on” even if the local grid went out.  You could imagine similar redundancy if you’re storing smallpox in refrigerators on-prem.<p>It’s just a risk weighted ROI calculation, and most firms are not existentially threatened by an extended power outage, as shown every time a cat 5 hurricane blows through New England and <i>most</i> businesses still don’t install a generator in their basements.')
