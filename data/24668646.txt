I&#x27;ve got billions of people I can treat like strangers, why not give my first teachers a special status? You might say that I treat my parents as if they were my very own parents.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the lionization of letting the atomization of society pervade even your closest and oldest relationships. I understood what my mother was before I understood what walking was, and far before I understood what a dollar was. I don&#x27;t feel a need to be absolutely autonomous to be an adult. I also don&#x27;t feel free to disappoint my parents just because they can&#x27;t punish me for it.')
