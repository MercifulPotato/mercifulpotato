However, if you just can&#x27;t stop extending CSS&#x27; basic mechanism of property-value assertions with ever more layout model magic, exceptions, and microsyntax, then you get the clusterfuck that is CSS today, where any semblance of intent, locality, or other cognitive aid whatsoever is lost in the written code artifact.<p>Drunken or not, I can&#x27;t also really fathom the primordial mindset of looking at HTML (eg. SGML&#x27;s already heavy attribute and element syntax infrastructure), then come up \n<i>with a completely redundant syntax out of nowhere</i> for holding the exact same thing that went into attributes yet with weaker type checks.<p>The result is the write-only mess that is CSS today, unusable without CSS debuggers, inaccessible to most devs and traditional graphic designers let alone laymen, yet always insufficient for innovators, seemingly perpetuated only by folks who mistake their huge effort into learning CSS with its merit (aka Stockholm syndrome).')
