It&#x27;d be (obviously) very easy to cheat, and being programming a certain degree of similarity would be expected. However, for the final assignment, you had to go for a viva. You had to explain how it worked and why you&#x27;d chosen to do things in a certain way, and that formed the bulk of your assessment.')
