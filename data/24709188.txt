Item(by='Retric', descendants=None, kids=[24710595], score=None, time=1602084252, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24708836, text='Jet engines are significantly less efficient than electric engines so itâ€™s lithium ion has 1&#x2F;20th the useful Specific Energy at takeoff, though that gets worse as the flight progresses and fuel is burned or batteries age.  On the other hand for ultra long range flights electric jets can cruise as higher altitudes which makes up for some of that. Also having 1&#x2F;3 the 15,000 km range of some aircraft is perfectly viable.<p>IMO, Due to cost savings electric aircraft would likely become common at around 4x the current Specific Energy and fully take over at about 10-20x.<p>PS: Energy density is fine for lithium ion, the issue is energy per weight (Specific Energy) not energy per volume (Energy Density).')
