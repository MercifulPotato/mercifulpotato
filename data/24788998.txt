I don&#x27;t get why I&#x27;d want _REDIS_ to be remote, then i loose all the speed benefits of redis. Also i don&#x27;t get why i need my redis cluster to scale. The only case where that seems like a need is if I&#x27;m caching global variables which is widely frowned upon. Everything else, there are caching + eviction strategies to handle this. If i&#x27;ve got massive traffic such that my redis cache is constantly churning (and thus not providing value) then couldn&#x27;t i just spin up more redises? redi? along with all the new machines i&#x27;m surely needing to spin up. If my engineers are being paged to spin up more redis instances (or aNYTHING) then they&#x27;ve failed in their autoscaling configurations, and it&#x27;s good they got called, and hopefully they&#x27;ll rethink their architecture and scripts so that they never get called again.<p>I&#x27;m not a devops guy so maybe i&#x27;m missing something obvious. On the other hand, I&#x27;m not a devops guy and I&#x27;m not _seeing_ an &quot;obvious&quot; win here. Either it actually doesn&#x27;t meet my needs or I&#x27;m ignorant about something and the marketing isn&#x27;t meeting my needs.<p>Side note: not a devops guy but my team has hundreds of AWS machines and lots of redis usage.')
