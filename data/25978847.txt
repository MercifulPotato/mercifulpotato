If you don&#x27;t need to change your demodulator, you can do all your digital signal processing on a purpose-built ASIC, which brings the cost way down. Radio demodulation and decoding typically falls in the &quot;embarassingly parallel&quot; category, so it&#x27;s an excellent candidate for efficient implementation on an ASIC or FPGA.')
