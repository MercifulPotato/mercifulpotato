I want to organize that folder the way I think fits best with the content. Then I want to point the site generator to that folder and it should figure out the rest by itself.<p>Same. I think lots of people would appreciate this. Writing is naturally private (in draft) before it may become public (published).<p>I am tempted to follow the author&#x27;s path. But I don&#x27;t think I need to go the whole way. I just need a preprocessor of sorts. I have a folder of markdown files I edit with Zettlr. I could flip a `published: true` flag in the frontmatter. Then iterate over each file and conditionally copy them somewhere to be dealt with by an off-the-shelf SSG (11ty is the current favourite).')
