Item(by='etripe', descendants=None, kids=[24978531], score=None, time=1604400817, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24977925, text='They are taxed because they are beneficiaries of society&#x27;s investment in infrastructure and people. They benefit directly from a healthy, educated population, enforcement of construction codes, the operation of the legal system, roads and waterways, etc. Companies aren&#x27;t entirely benign, either, so part of those taxes goes to environmental impact assessment and handling they don&#x27;t pay for, such as pollution, health hazards, etc.<p>If you were to make the case the healthy, educated employees could be compensated through their wages, then that still leaves infrastructure, externalities and the legal system.<p>While you could privatise infrastructure, I think it would be a bad idea. It could lead to shady schemes where a corporation &quot;taxes&quot; its employees on the toll road leading up to the building. Considering historical examples like company stores, I&#x27;m not sure we could rule that scenario out. Also, where does infrastructure stop and what does it include? The last miles of telecoms, power, water and other utilities or more?<p>As to the legal system, it seems self-evident we don&#x27;t want that privatised. Do you disagree?<p>On the topic of externalities: I suppose it&#x27;s feasible to create new taxes specifically for what are now considered externalities, so corporations pay for them: pollution, carbon footprint, burnouts&#x2F;boreouts, etc. Would you be in favour of those?')
