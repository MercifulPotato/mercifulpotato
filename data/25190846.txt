I bought a case&#x2F;motherboard&#x2F;cpu, but didn&#x27;t have enough to buy lots of memory for the new machine (which didn&#x27;t use the same memory as my old one), so I had 128MB on the new one and ~800MB cobbled together from various dimms on the old one.<p>Then I read about NBD.  Half an hour later I had made a 640MB ramdisk on the old machine and mounted it with NBD on the new machine, and used it as a swap disk.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it worked.  Fun times.')
