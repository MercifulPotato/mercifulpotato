In many cases it takes years - or even over a decade or more. That&#x27;s insane. People bring their spouses here, they have kids who are born and go to school here, and all along the way their immigration status is uncertain. And meanwhile they are tied to whatever job they&#x27;re in. It&#x27;s insane.<p>Make that process faster. Give people a thumbs-up or thumbs-down like 10x faster. Months not years.')
