There aren&#x27;t enough abstractions that help programmers write good code. So when a programmer has to do something complex, they end up doing the easy thing which is just importing every library they need. If instead, there was a way to say &quot;only import this when I&#x27;m doing this action&quot; and there&#x27;s no way for the programmer to explicitly say what to import, then that problem almost disappears.')
