I see there&#x27;s some critique here already that could be a bit hurtful - don&#x27;t take it to heart. As most of these commenters haven&#x27;t even had a chance to try your app yet, this signals to me that something isn&#x27;t quite resonating with the way you sell your product, and you&#x27;ll need to work on your messaging a bit more to win them over.<p>From my experience successfully launching fintech API[1] on ProductHunt and HN, a fleshed out pricing page can really help with the credibility. Also, a more concrete statement on privacy would be very helpful too.<p>Best of luck!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wisefin.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wisefin.ai</a>')
