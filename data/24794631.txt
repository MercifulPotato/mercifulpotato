And Phantom was actually providing something browsers were not doing at the time.<p>It has no real distinct features from what browsers already do right now, and whatever way they make it easy to use, if the product by some change get traction, it will be easy for them to just ship with that feature built it.<p>It may provide some value on convenience, but its easily copiable by a competitor that is deployed everywhere, which is a big threat to their bussiness model.')
