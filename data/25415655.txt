It&#x27;s not a person. A thread like this isn&#x27;t going to hurt its dominance of the browser ecosystem. And if it did, it would even be good for the diversity.<p>I don&#x27;t think it would make a really big dent in people&#x27;s bias against Google, because slowing your computer down is way way WAY less bad than the things that people biased against Google are worried about (being a gigantic faceless corporation with power equal to nation states that is controlled by something that is not, does not care for democracy).<p>It&#x27;s like badmouthing Thanos because he has bad breath.<p>If true then Chrome has some bad code, and what else is new. If false then ... then what. At worst somebody deinstalls Chrome, and then?<p>Let&#x27;s not bring libel law into this, or in fact even compare it to biased and false political news stories.')
