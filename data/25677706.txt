They were among the banks who would process all charges and deposits in a day starting with the largest charge and ending with the largest deposit. This let them ding you for many more insufficient balance fees (each small charge once you were below a $0 balance got you a new $25 or $50 fee; this hit a colleague and some acquaintances, I don&#x27;t let my balances get that low). They also liked to tuck away account policy changes, like minimum balances, into the fine print. I had one account with them (wanted a physical bank and had moved everything else online) with the minimum $1500 balance to avoid any fees, they changed it to $1600 or 1750 and started hitting me with $25&#x2F;month fees (reimbursed) because I&#x27;d failed to notice that policy change in the documents they&#x27;d sent. And the main reason, today, to avoid them is that their interest rates are terrible. Their CD rates are often below checking account rates at other banks (last checked in early 2020, not sure what their current rates are but a 10+ year history of horrible rates probably didn&#x27;t change this year).')
