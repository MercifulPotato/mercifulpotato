Do you know if there is a way to alter the policy to undo this change with root privileges without disabling SELinux enforcement entirely? It fundamentally seems like it should be possible; I just don&#x27;t know how. It would get around the issue very nicely if someone can figure out how, since I imagine many people with Termux also have root.')
