Then you do get it installed, but don&#x27;t know where it installed to so you have to go searching for it.  Then you get it up and running and it works fine.  You play with it for 5 min.  2 months later you come back to it and want the newest version, so you have to download an update, because the auto-update feature was blocked by your firewall.  Then you get it updated and running.  A couple days later you decide not to use it, so you go to uninstall it.  The uninstaller fails for who the f knows why so you delete the folder on your drive, but your OS still think it&#x27;s installed.  So you figure out how to manually remove it.')
