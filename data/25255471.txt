This means we can &quot;compile&quot; (one part of) the DNA code. It was already possible, but so slow that entire datacenters would spend months calculating this for a single protein and even then we can&#x27;t use them on the really complex ones at all, necessitating things like neutron spectroscopy which are totally insane, and only work on like 1% of proteins.<p>This is useful because for example chemical simulation tools don&#x27;t run on DNA code, but on atomic models. And also to produce &quot;images&quot; of the molecules (images between quotes because most proteins are too small to interact with reasonable photons, and no interaction with photons means you can&#x27;t see them in any way)<p>DNA has other parts that are really important but we don&#x27;t understand at all yet, where this doesn&#x27;t help at all. This applies to sections of DNA sent to ribosomes, to produce actual molecules. Besides that, there are pieces of DNA that &quot;index&quot; the DNA, pointers (from one gene to another), triggers (that for instance start production of an enzyme based on some external influence, like detection of a marker molecule) and export markers (that tell you what to do once the protein is produced, for example, mark a protein to be removed from the cell, incorporated into the cell membrane, or for instance used inside the cell nucleus, and there&#x27;s also one that essentially says &quot;at this point stop producing a protein and instead couple the rest of the DNA code to the end of the protein you just made&quot;).')
