It’s possible I’m not incapable of understanding it.<p>All I’ve ever heard are exchanges that are so grossly incompetent that I would never even think about engaging with. Months of waiting for verification that never happens. Waiting for transfers that never happen.<p>Uploading passports and drivers licenses to an exchange, and bank account information, to only think that 6 months from now there will be a breach and all my information is downloaded by criminals. It’s a full stop to not even consider proceeding.<p>I would love to know how someone can convert Bitcoin or other digital currency to millions of USD that are capable of hitting a bank account, that can be spent at the local grocery store.<p>I watched as Bitcoin became a thing  and never even considered touching it because I didn’t even remotely wanted to be associated with criminals using it for drugs and other illegal stuff.<p>Anyways, digital currency is just so bizarre to me.')
