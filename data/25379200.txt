I have worked in large organizations - smaller than Uber, but we did more stuff (as in more complexity and diversity in products - shipping software and the hardware to run it, for example).<p>&quot;100s of screens&quot; is as meaningless to me as &quot;thousands of lines of code&quot; and wholly uninteresting because it seems like the front end is the least significant reason why Uber requires so many people to operate. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m interested in seeing how many people are assigned to projects and what they actually spend their time doing, because at scale you begin to experience inefficiencies due to scale for bad reasons if your incentives aren&#x27;t aligned. From the original twitter thread that sounds like it was rampant at Uber.<p>Not sure how long you&#x27;ve been around, but &quot;Uber scale&quot; used to be a joke a few years ago because no one could understand why they would reinvent so many wheels because &quot;they don&#x27;t work at Uber scale.&quot; The joke being that Uber didn&#x27;t need to be Uber scale to begin with, they just had investor money to burn.')
