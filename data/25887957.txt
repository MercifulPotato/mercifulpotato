Having been talking to different content&#x2F;marketing teams, they hate it so much because of the complexity it brings. Editing content? Sign in to this headless CRM app, want a form? Go sign in to another app. It might be a fun project for devs but the actual users if these systems will almost always have a hard time using it.')
