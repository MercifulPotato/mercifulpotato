With Ruby on Rails, there&#x27;s the ActiveJob abstraction which you can hook up to different backends like SQS or Redis with a few lines of code. In addition, AWS has a lot of out of the box integration with SNS and SQS for other services like Cloudwatch and Lambda (in fact, lambda you don&#x27;t need any special code).<p>If you have a Lambda function processing SQS messages they just get dumped in your handler method and it your function runs successfully they get automatically removed from the q. If your lambda fails, the message reappears after the visibility timeout out subject to your redrive policy')
