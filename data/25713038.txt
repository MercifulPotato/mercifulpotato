Sadly, that&#x27;s actually not the case.<p>Well, then we must fall onto another maxim. Truth and reality does not have a political bias. Regardless of how many tens of millions of Americans believe that Trump is the real winner of the 2020 election, it doesn&#x27;t change reality.<p>A comparable tens of millions believe in angels, do not think that humanity has any role in climate change, and that vaccines cause autism.<p>They&#x27;re wrong about all these points too.')
