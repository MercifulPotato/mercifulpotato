Worked pretty okay for print press and I even liked to specifically browse the pages with ads on certain magazines. They were focused. If you were a farmer and bought magazines on this topic, the ads there were relevant.<p>The problem discussed today is the invasive and often clueless nature of online ads. They just spam you and nothing else. Adtech companies gather mountains of data and at the end of the day what do they have to show for it? &quot;Oh, we see you bought a gaming machine. How about you buy these other five ones?&quot;. lol.<p>Seriously. This is sloppy work.<p>My conclusion is that they don&#x27;t utilize the private data (that they gather in some very legally questionable ways) and thus they won&#x27;t lose anything if they&#x27;re robbed of all the personal data. And the world will be better for it.')
