And as to your last point, that&#x27;s pretty much the conclusions of the piece itself:<p>&quot;Based on the current state of machine learning courses it is clear that AI courses will get you through the door in your effort to perform cutting edge research or landing a machine learning job, but they wonâ€™t teach you everything you need to know. To fill in the knowledge gaps that remain you will have to put in outside effort on your own. &quot;<p>I guess the question is whether the outside effort needs to be addressed by universities, or by other resources.')
