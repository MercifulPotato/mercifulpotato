Until Resolve 15, nobody was really taking it very seriously as an editing tool.<p>Adobe has an extreme advantage, in codec support and the fact that After Effects is basically ubiquitous in the industry when it comes to graphics work.<p>Resolve 15&#x2F;16 made it a very viable alternative though, capable of some of the most demanding workloads.  And tomorrow, Resolve 17 will be announced.<p>I use Resolve personally.  Adobe Premiere on Creative Cloud has become relatively unstable. Crashes, bugs that have been present for 4-6 years now, lost work in their ridiculous auto save process, and slow&#x2F;laggy timeline playback when coloring&#x2F;effects are applied, it adds up.<p>Frequent updates are a complicated thing in fine tuned production environments as well. And until recently, next to no real shared work environment solutions.  Resolve has had a pretty great server setup for multiple users for awhile now. Granted, it has a lot of room for improvement. Overall, it&#x27;s been a night and day difference for me coming off Adobe.<p>Last year we had three edit bays in Premiere and one on Resolve. All PC, pretty close to the same builds. The editors on premiere had between 50-60 crashes between them in 3 weeks.  The resolve station had 1 which was most likely a Windows issue at the time and just needed to be restarted.<p>But the best part. One time purchase for Resolve Studio, for life.')
