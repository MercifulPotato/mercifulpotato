Those systems are useful even if you&#x27;re in the same building and just don&#x27;t want to go hang out in the cold, loud server room while you figure out the problem, and everyone wonders if you&#x27;re even working today (since they can&#x27;t see you).<p>Or you might not even have access to that room.<p>We just haven&#x27;t had much motivation to do this for a more general class of hardware, and there probably haven&#x27;t been enough non-pandemic motivators to build such things, and it would be pretty macabre to build a system just in case there&#x27;s another pandemic, or to buy the thing if it existed.<p>Time sharing hardware with someone on the other side of the planet, for instance, might introduce too much delay for a Big Red Button. Apparently it&#x27;s about .25 seconds if you&#x27;re in the room. You can do a lot more damage in another 200 ms, and packet loss could make that delay bigger.')
