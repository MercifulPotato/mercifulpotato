A morning ritual is something I&#x27;ve always done, not intentionally though, it developed organically.<p>So, I always start work in the same way: make coffee, connect VPN, hook up the tmuxes, start the web browser and start the mail program. (Those processes get purposefully killed every night)<p>It&#x27;s just some silly busy work which takes very little time. It is also something I would not do outside of workdays. However, it mimics the things I&#x27;d do (and did) at the office.<p>Also, maybe your dedicated room is too quiet? If you were a cubicle&#x2F;open landscape worker prior to the pandemic, you surely now lack all kinds of uninteresting and annoying ambient noises, so could it be this silence makes things feel &quot;wrong&quot;? Perhaps a radio on an uninteresting channel might work?')
