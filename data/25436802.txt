I dont even want apple to have my face biometric and that says something from guy whos wife was working for apple and could lookup anyone for any reason.<p>Also nit pick: you don’t “press” the button. In fact there is no physical button; there is surface that acts upon touch and tiny hammer hits the surfec from underneath, making it feel like its a button. I was in shock to discover that once i turned off my iphone 8 first time and though the button was broken because it didn’t “recoil” or made its typical behavior noise.')
