But somehow you believe that your specific, personal interpretation is the absolutely correct one? Why? If you ask 100 people where the line is between harassment and legitimate criticism, you will get 100 different answers. What makes your answer correct and the other 100 answers incorrect? You refer to &quot;widely accepted definition&quot;, as if a dictionary definition could somehow be applied to real world situations to judge whether an expression is harassment or not. Maybe it can be in _extreme_ cases, like if someone said &quot;gays should be killed&quot; we could easily judge that as harassment, or if someone says &quot;i like cats&quot; we could easily judge it as not harassment. But there&#x27;s a huge gray area where expressions can be interpreted either way and it&#x27;s up to each individual to assess whether they feel like an expression is harassment or not.')
