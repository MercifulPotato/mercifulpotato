Nothing snapped to together. This video shows a pattern emerging from pure chaos, all based on probabilities and the fact that each individual atom probability wave can only oscillate in certain patterns.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure in Quantum Mechanics systems like this the entire unit behaves as one and there&#x27;s no real distinction possible regarding &quot;which is which&quot; if you were to try to identify individual atoms. It would be like looking at a standing wave pattern in water (or any other medium) and labeling one peak &quot;Wave A&quot; and some peak &quot;Wave B&quot;. You can&#x27;t really do it. Because for the standing wave pattern to exist at all it has to be the entire system interaction to cause it to emerge.<p>I&#x27;m not saying atoms are &quot;Standing Waves&quot; but I&#x27;m merely making an analogy. However even from some perspective you could even say any oscillating system of wave probabilities when taken as a &quot;system&quot; comprises a standing wave.')
