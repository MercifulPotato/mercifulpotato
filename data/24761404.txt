I&#x27;ll have a long stretch where I come home and I&#x27;m just fried and can&#x27;t do anything that takes critical thinking. And then I&#x27;ll go through a period where either work is more boring or I&#x27;ve found something to do on the side that&#x27;s so exciting to me that I have tons of energy and focus on side projects.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve been doing for the last 2ish years is having side projects that are really far removed from my work. So for example a lot of my work is infrastructure automation and related problems, so I&#x27;ve been doing some side projects learning basic electronics and hacking on microcontrollers. Figuring out why my I&#x27;m getting weird readings on a temperature sensor is a great break from figuring out why my load balancer didn&#x27;t do the right thing.')
