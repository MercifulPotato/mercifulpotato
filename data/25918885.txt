Stale is cherstvyj in russian, but in czech cherstvyj is fresh. A corpse in russian is a torso in czech. Shame is attention. A cigarette butt is a cucumber. Toadstool is buckwheat. Looseness is speed. And so on. Some words like zivot in czech are closer to old russian meaning (life) than current (stomach). Between some i can see some other relation. And with some i have no idea how it could coincide that way.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zen.yandex.ru&#x2F;media&#x2F;solo&#x2F;takoi-zabavnyi-cheshskii-iazyk-5d504088bd45c002cb50bd32" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zen.yandex.ru&#x2F;media&#x2F;solo&#x2F;takoi-zabavnyi-cheshskii-ia...</a>')
