It&#x27;s hard to find much info&#x2F;practitioners. I&#x27;m also not sure how legit some are. Usually I would avoid non-conventional treatments (though I have been taken by family to everything from osteopaths to chinese medicine practitioners), but previously similar fields (e.g. chiropractors) had sort of helped, so I went. It has literally changed my life. I had chronic headaches since I learned how to speak (they were not so often then). Me and my family had tried everything. I had progressed to the point where it was 24&#x2F;7 pain, highly depressed, could not work&#x2F;go to university. Within the month my pain was down 25%, within a year I was 50% better overall, no more 24&#x2F;7 pain, started studying. Now I&#x27;m about to graduate. I still go once a month but am 90% better. I&#x27;m also not downing pills like crazy. I was on 3-4 a week (this was just to numb the bad episodes), now down to 2-3 a month (mostly due to me overexerting myself).<p>It does not work for everyone (it helped some family members with back pain but not others or not immediately so they stopped going), but can&#x27;t hurt to try. It is very similar to going to a chiropractor but &quot;softer&quot; is how I would describe it. There is not as much cracking and popping. Half is stretches. There&#x27;s lots of checking specific points for pain, also the whole body is looked at. And unlike chiropractors or massage therapists there is a noticeable change in mobility and posture and other things (for me decreased light sensitivity) after a visit.')
