I&#x27;ve tried several solutions I found through research but the issue still remains. Even restarting kwin won&#x27;t solve the problem and I have to resort to rebooting to hope it fixes itself. Quite annoying.<p>Also occasionally my nvidia dGPU (with power management enabled) just doesn&#x27;t power itself off even if its not being used by any process. I&#x27;ve once again played around with all kinds of parameters and configs without any luck. I&#x27;m aware it&#x27;s an experimental feature but it&#x27;s still a major issue for me since its the difference between 6 and 3 hours of battery life.<p>On top of that for some reason all of my games randomly decide to drop down to very low framerates while barely utilizing my CPU and GPU. It&#x27;s nothing to do with my temps or either CPU or GPU throttling down (they&#x27;re still at their max clock speeds), there&#x27;s nothing in the background using any kind of significant amount of system resources and the niceness &#x2F; ioprio of my game&#x27;s process is set high enough so some random process going rogue shouldn&#x27;t affect game performance too much.<p>These are just some examples of random problems I&#x27;m facing regularily and it&#x27;s just frustrating having to tinker around (sometimes for days) to (hopefully) fix them. Which is a shame since I&#x27;m really enjoying my Linux install.')
