Item(by='strulovich', descendants=None, kids=[25660981, 25665264], score=None, time=1609959553, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25658098, text='As a person working in Facebook for 7 years I feel like this post is incorrectly portraying FB&#x27;s process and culture:<p>- First, Facebook avoids titles, so there&#x27;s no such thing &quot;senior software engineer&quot;. Levels are generally unknown by people so ICs get judged by their ideas, and not their title.\n- If there was such a thing as &quot;senior&quot; in Facebook, it&#x27;s not starting at the E4 level. (If you look at levels.fyi and align the Facebook levels with Google you might get that an E5 is a senior)\n- This entire list of chapters of CLRS chapters is ridiculous. It&#x27;s a great book and I&#x27;d recommend it for people into theory and who will be around Computer Science. But if you didn&#x27;t go through a college degree and algorithms course, and need to interview, do yourself a favor and go directly for LeetCode or Cracking the Coding Interview. YMMV as to how much you need to learn. Some people I know can easily breeze through these interviews with no prep, those people are also super smart. Some smart people I know have a harder time, no system is perfect.\n- To actually get hired in one of higher levels at Facebook you will need to go through the design interview, which is a very different type, and the career experience one. No matter how well you ace the coding, you will not get an offer for a high level if you didn&#x27;t succeed adequately in these.\n- All of my coding questions in the last few years required knowledge I learned in my first year learning programming. This is usually the norm.<p>Of course, this is my personal experience at Facebook, but it is based on quite some time and a lot of interviewing.')
