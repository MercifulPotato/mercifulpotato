Even in a suburban&#x2F;rural setting, with more and more devices connected remotely, you need the range. It&#x27;s not in a manufacturer best interest to decrease the range of their routers. Only a <i>small</i> fraction of user will look at setting the TX power &#x2F; investing in a better antenna &#x2F; setup mesh network. The first reflex will always be &quot;buy a new router&quot;.<p>So once again, max legal transmit power is the best overall bet.')
