And pretending that you were talking about the protocol rather than the libraries a minute ago won&#x27;t fool anyone when your post saying &quot;APIs&quot; is right there.<p>There is a specific imperfection in the protocol around verification; there is a mitigation in place, and a good library implementation (that didn&#x27;t simply 1:1 replicate the protocol) would include that. The consensus is largely that the mitigation is adequate, but again, if you disagree with that then the remedy would be a protocol update that addresses that specific issue, not a radically different protocol with very different properties that&#x27;s missing key protections.')
