Imagine a process engineer scaling up a chemical reaction in the pilot plant and neglecting the cooling capacity of the reaction vessel. A thermal runaway is encountered, and the vessel contents, 100s of liters of flammable organic solvent are distributed throughout the building.<p>The fire chief will want to have a word with the rapid prototyper, sizing the thermal budget has been practice for 100 years.<p>Software engineers have an odd mindset towards bugs. It&#x27;s already an outrage that when you activate a new cellphone the first thing the device does is download gigabytes of updates. It&#x27;s a disgrace.')
