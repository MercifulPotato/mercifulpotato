If it&#x27;s 2D (which I understand regular screen-plus-mirror things to be), then it&#x27;s not much different from a screen, except that it takes up much more valuable floor space and is going to be a lot more expensive, while also horribly breaking immersion if you&#x27;re nearby.<p>If the frame&#x2F;box really add much immersion, then some solution that can sit flat on a wall while still appearing to be a cabin (recessed into the wall) would likely be a lot more successful, as it can &quot;create&quot; instead of eating real estate.')
