Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=[24948025], score=None, time=1604099230, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24947639, text='<i>&gt; In the coordinate system of an observer at a constant distance from the horizon, the path of a free-falling object takes an infinite amount of coordinate time</i><p>No: the path of the free-falling observer at and beneath the horizon <i>is not covered at all</i> by the coordinate system of the external observer. That coordinate system simply becomes mathematically undefined, which means you can&#x27;t use it to make <i>any</i> claims about what happens.<p><i>&gt; In this coordinate system, the time coordinate becomes space-like passed the event horizon and the radial coordinate becomes timelike.</i><p>No: there is a <i>separate</i> coordinate patch that covers the region inside the horizon (but <i>not</i> the horizon itself--the horizon is not covered by either patch), in which the &quot;areal radius&quot; coordinate is timelike, and in which the coordinate corresponding to the extra Killing vector field is spacelike. Calling the former coordinate &quot;radial&quot; is at least justifiable, since it still is the &quot;areal radius&quot; coordinate even though it&#x27;s timelike. But calling the latter coordinate &quot;the time coordinate&quot; is simply wrong; the fact that the letter t is commonly used for it does not mean it&#x27;s a &quot;time&quot; coordinate in any meaningful sense.<p><i>&gt; There is a coordinate singularity around this switch</i><p>Yes.<p><i>&gt; which is where the infinite coordinate time comes from.</i><p>No, which is what makes statements like &quot;infinite coordinate time&quot; incorrect; the correct statement is that neither coordinate patch covers the horizon at all.<p><i>&gt; An observer fammiliar with relativity could compute the proper time of a path traversing the event horizon</i><p>Yes. The easiest way to do that is to switch to some other coordinate chart which covers the entire path, above, at, and below the horizon. In such a coordinate chart, the &quot;areal radius&quot; coordinate will <i>not</i> be timelike below the horizon. (In at least one chart commonly used for this, Painleve coordinates, <i>all four</i> coordinates are spacelike below the horizon.)')
