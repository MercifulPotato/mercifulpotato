I&#x27;m saying that based on AOC&#x27;s 100% plan, pretty much everything is off the table, meaning that the plan needs to be revised.  I plan to have 30kw of solar panels in my next home and a large collection of LifePo4 batteries that also have a dependency on strip mining.  I also plan to do some of my own mining (drilling, blasting) for zinc and silver.')
