The &quot;Send to trash&quot; button simply is a shortcut to add the trash label.<p>If you called that the &quot;bin&quot; label in England, then functionality could break when the user switches languages...  Now they have a bin and a trash, with different things in!<p>Or you could write the code to relabel all the users emails when they changed language... \nBut what if they had already manually created a label called &quot;bin&quot; then the auto-re-labeler will cause loss of data...<p>There is no perfect solution here...
