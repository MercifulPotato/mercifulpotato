Fox Foundation for Parkinson&#x27;s Research<p>This is a tangent, but I remember a minor news item of Michael J. Fox appearing in an ad soliciting donations for Parkinson&#x27;s research, Rush Limbaugh (maybe?) criticizing him for &quot;exaggerating his symptoms&quot; in the ad, and then Jon Stewart (definitely) lambasting the criticism on the Daily Show, something along the lines of &quot;How DARE Michael J. Fox appear in an ad trying to fund research into the crippling disease that Michael J. Fox has?!?&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a clip of that, if anyone knows where to look?')
