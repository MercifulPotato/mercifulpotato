(Edit: Just to be clear there are constraints on the implementation imposed by it being ARM compatible.)<p>A related example (Not directly atomic fetch add&#x2F;sub and not directly coherency either) would be the way LL&#x2F;SC operations are implemented. Mainly on ARM you have a parameter of how large the memory region &quot;marked for exclusive access&quot; (by an LL-load operation) is. This can have mayor performance implications as it directly affects how likely a conditional store fails because of accidental inference.')
