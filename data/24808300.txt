If this indeed happens I can easy understand the rage of users (I have a corporate Windows 10 so I do not see that behaviour)<p>- the forced restart part: from the perspective of someone working in information security: good job. People  do not give a shit about security and when begged to reboot quickly (= within, say, 3 days) they have all kind of important things to do instead for months.<p>I do not care if their machine is hacked and all their stuff stolen. What I care about is that this machine becomes a part of a bot that is either poses a risk to others (DDoS) or sends out crap (phishing, spam). Such machines should be actively hunted and taken down.<p>So MS forcing these users to have their PC rebooted even in the middle of their work (after several attempts to have it done by the user) is great.')
