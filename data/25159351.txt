The &#x27;problem&#x27; (if you believe it is a problem) is once game companies are happy to &quot;lie&quot; about one aspect of history without any concern while at the same time refusing to &quot;lie&quot; about another part of history because it would &#x27;ruin the historical accuracy&#x27;.<p>If your samurai game includes werewolves and machine guns you don&#x27;t get to turn around say you didn&#x27;t add something because it wouldn&#x27;t be historically accurate. You have to use a better excuse, like you felt it would be dumb or that you didn&#x27;t feel like it.')
