Look up doubly robust estimators for a neat counterexample. Or IPTW for an extension of a dataset that can help with this (X, t, y, and propensities, instead of just X, t, y). Causal inference has a super rich literature that&#x27;s quickly growing.<p>Or better yet (stretching and sidestepping how you meant it), give your friendly neighborhood statistician&#x2F;econometrician just a dataset and they can&#x27;t do causal inference. Give them propensities and column names&#x2F;descriptions and a writeup of the experiment&#x2F;where the data came from, and suddenly they might be able to do causal inference. It points to a need to augment our observations with more structured metadata, if we want to do causal inference with data that&#x27;s just lying around.')
