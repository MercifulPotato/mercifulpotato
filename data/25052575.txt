Item(by='JustARandomGuy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605045552, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25050847, text='I volunteered as an election judge in a neighboring county (Hello from DuPage County) and can affirm much of tptacek&#x27;s post. Having the experience of an election judge, I&#x27;m not worried about anyone trying to steal the election, there&#x27;s just too much paperwork involved at every level.<p>Likewise in regards to the police: we had DuPage sheriffs wander in occasionally to look around and chat - they were reasonably friendly with some random chitchat. I don&#x27;t think they were looking for anything in particular, just trying to deter any mischief by being seen openly.<p>One thing that surprised me is how hard election judges worked: I started by 6:30 AM and only ended at 8:30 PM, with maybe a 15 min break for lunch. All the other time I was handing out ballots, doing paperwork, giving directions, etc. In DuPage election judges get $100 for the whole day - I would be in favor of doubling that plus some money for lunch + dinner.')
