Among other things, Raku has first-class Roles that I think Ruby should consider adopting. In Raku the sigils (symbols prefixing variables) give an immediate indicator as to a general role that the variable implements -- so $ for single-values, @ for lists, % for dictionaries (hashes), &amp; for callables. That adds a lot of &quot;noise&quot; that makes Raku look different, but under that it is like a lot of modern dynamic OO languages ... lots of objects and method invocations with a few JSON like built in types.')
