Both parties (in the US) take money from Big Tech, and they vote the same shit anyway. That will &quot;show them&quot; nothing. Especially since their stance on such laws is 1&#x2F;100 of the things you vote a party&#x2F;candidate about (so you will still vote for them if you agree on other matters).')
