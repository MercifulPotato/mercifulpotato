One charger.  Road trip? One charger.  Biking to work? One charger.<p>Better yet - Leave a charger at work, keep a charger at home, don&#x27;t need to carry 5lbs back and forth every day.<p>Forgot my charger?  Every person I hang out with has a usb-c charger floating around somewhere.<p>----<p>You know what I really don&#x27;t want to have to carry around anymore?  Fucking cable adapters.  You know what no one will have if I forget my charger?  Fucking cable adapters.<p>Honestly - I probably wouldn&#x27;t have bought these headphones yet because I&#x27;m quite happy with my current headphones.<p>But I&#x27;m very, <i>very</i> close to no longer even considering devices that ship without a USB-C port. And that&#x27;s a shame, because I otherwise really like the Max, and probably would have slotted it in when my current cans die.<p>Getting over the hump to convert to USB-C initially was fairly expensive, but my job is good and I can splurge.  I don&#x27;t want to go back.')
