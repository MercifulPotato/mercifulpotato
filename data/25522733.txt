If you set a child down in front of a chess board with the pieces nearby and they are not aware of the rules, I doubt they’d ever figure out how to play even a single correct game of chess. Heck, the child may decide to put the pieces in their mouth or dress them up as make belief characters.<p>Without any concept of the rules you have no way of even knowing that you’ve set up the pieces for a legal starting position, never mind executing a legal move to open the game.<p>This is really bizarre.')
