We did finally get there with the MVP; the initial roadmap was full of envy, and I set the bar way too high regarding build, tooling, ci&#x2F;cd &amp; testing.<p>I thought that those would help us further down the road, and I was right, but the issue was more about the time&#x2F;effort it took me to get there, eventually.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say that code quality doesn&#x27;t matter, but I certainly should&#x27;ve made more tradeoffs on that front. It was just really hard to judge.<p>With my background (enterprise frameworks, mostly), quality almost always needed to be top notch, because our deliverables were the basis for many other developments. I guess this created a bias in my way of looking at code quality? :p')
