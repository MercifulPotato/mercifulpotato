It hasn&#x27;t changed, which is why we needed socialist programs like Social Security. Why? We live in a high trust society that is more individualistic.  Families in low trust societies tend to adopt a more &quot;clan&quot; like mentality where you even know your distant cousins pretty well, see your cousins on a regular basis, and it&#x27;s common for three or more generations to live in the same building. Why? Because in a low trust society, you will lean more on people who are related by blood when it&#x27;s harder to rely on 3rd parties like the government or anyone not related to you. Conversely, we don&#x27;t have that issue, so our families tend to be more distant.')
