Actual: MS NT kernel<p>Not entirely true, because in fact NT is heavily &quot;inspired&quot; by VMS, that Dave Cutler, the main architect of NT kernel, used to work in DEC as a technical fellow. This is also one of the reason DEC Alpha can run Windows NT out of the box, as it is quite similar to VMS in nature.')
