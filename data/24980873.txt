That said, weight wise it’s fairly trivial so you could just eject it.<p>Project Orion is detonating nuclear weapons which consist of far more than just fuel, they also need high explosives etc, however much of the fuels energy is wasted both from low yield bombs being less efficient but also simply radiating energy in all directions.  Nuclear powered ION engines however would be ejecting far more of their reaction mass of say xenon per KG of fuel that leftover fuel is basically irrelevant.  In other words it’s a more efficient nuclear reaction, a vastly more efficient engine, and a much lower mass fraction spent on the physical engine.<p>This gets more extreme when you consider a crewed mission would need lots of power during the trip so they would want&#x2F;need to build redundant nuclear reactors anyway.')
