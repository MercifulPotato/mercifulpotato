I also don&#x27;t like cars having connectivity with other devices or the network, but that&#x27;s another tangent.<p>I like older car control panels - knobs, switches, buttons. You can feel what you&#x27;re doing so you&#x27;re not looking at a screen instead of the road. That&#x27;s not to say I don&#x27;t like technology in cars. Voice commands for playing songs and a HUD for critical data (speed, RPM, tires, warnings, etc) are awesome.')
