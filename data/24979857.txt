Item(by='totalZero', descendants=None, kids=[24980655], score=None, time=1604413375, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24976314, text='Although eBay&#x27;s motivations are probably not benevolent, and the implementation of this policy harms a reputable distributor, I do think this is a good thing overall. There are several different authorized distributors of RPi; listing RPi on eBay simply offers another vector by which counterfeit&#x2F;damaged&#x2F;problematic devices can be sold, and the existence of a secondary market (eBay used buyers and sellers) for RPi also reduces the demand (revenue) for new devices. I buy mine directly from one of the authorized distributors provided by the project&#x27;s website.')
