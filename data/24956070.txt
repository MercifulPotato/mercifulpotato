A lot of them (that I ever saw) even had some preinstalled CGI scripts linked into the user account&#x27;s cgi-bin.<p>What a lot of shared hosts did <i>not</i> support were things like mod_cgi or mod_rewrite that might let you make cleaner looking URLs. With PHP you just enable mod_php and add index.php to the DirectoryIndex directive and call it a day. Many hosts didn&#x27;t allow overrides so you couldn&#x27;t add a CGI handler to your DirectoryIndex unless you knew the server admins.<p>So like I said, PHP was the <i>easiest</i> to get running. It wasn&#x27;t the only thing that worked or was supported but it made it simple to have URLs that looked &quot;professional&quot; with no access to a server&#x27;s configuration and no ability to override defaults. So it worked well for cheap shared hosting.<p>I&#x27;m still annoyed I know this stuff almost twenty years after having to deal with it. People really wanted their brand new .com address to serve up their &quot;dynamic&quot; homepage with nothing hanging off the path. PHP was the worst is better way to make that happen.')
