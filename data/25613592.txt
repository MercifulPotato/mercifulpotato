Item(by='alexjm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609602817, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25613374, text='This sort of stock ticker uses a small metal wheel that continuously rotates from letter to letter, with an electric mechanism to print the letter that&#x27;s currently in position.  That makes it very slow compared to teletypewriters -- you have to wait for the needed letter to come around, rather than just lifting the correct typebar.  Teletypewriters also have mechanisms to move a full-width sheet or roll of paper, which makes them larger than the roller that this ticker has to advance its paper tape.<p>I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding tickers in pictures or videos, but here&#x27;s one; skip to nearly the end to see it printing.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5N_A5hUDtZY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5N_A5hUDtZY</a>')
