I have asthma and I really hate hospitals. Right now, I have been going for groceries about once a week. I&#x27;ve gone to some appointments, but I&#x27;ve cancelled others. I&#x27;ve been getting take-out some, and I even went on one shopping expedition for craft supplies.

Not going for walks. It specifically means no human contact outside the people you are quarantined with.')
