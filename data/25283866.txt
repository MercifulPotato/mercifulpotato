Item(by='35fbe7d3d5b9', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606956431, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25282990, text='Mate, going by politics alone I&#x27;d wager &quot;those people&quot; would write my opinions off – I&#x27;d get called a filthy statist at best, and if they only knew what I really believed... ;)<p>But I think you&#x27;ve got this wrong. I <i>absolutely</i> want to know what my exposure is to carcinogens, but in the absence of context it isn&#x27;t helpful. Very few people are equipped to understand and evaluate the real risks they face – and I count myself in this bucket. That&#x27;s why regulations and governments are a good thing. That&#x27;s why I want <i>meaningful</i> warning labels that indicate what risks I face over time, not just &quot;there&#x27;s a carcinogen here&quot;.')
