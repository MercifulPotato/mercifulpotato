You have a sense of what good safety practices could look like - you’ve been to conferences and talked to your colleagues, and you have some thoughts yourself. But management at your airline doesn’t want to spend the money.<p>Would you argue for meekly going along with management’s choices, knowing those choices will kill people? I would say, if you did, you would have blood on your hands. We’re people first and employees second.<p>The stakes are lower and there’s a middle ground here. But you have a voice, and usually more power than you think. The siren song of dumping all responsibility for your actions onto upper management makes you into a victim and a child. It’s bad for society, usually bad for your company in the long term and bad for your psychological health and development. And a disaster for your professional development.<p>I don’t know if that lands with you, but it’s certainly a lesson I wish I could give to myself over a decade ago.')
