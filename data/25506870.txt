I went through something similar and it wasn&#x27;t fun.<p>As much as you have shareholder agreements etc. none of that matters too much if the business fails and so it&#x27;s basically about what the two of you can negotiate.<p>In my case, I&#x27;ve paid off a former business partner much like a loan. You can negotiate all sorts of parameters on this: monthly payments, grace period, cash triggers, funding triggers etc.<p>Basically you set a valuation for the business (at least as set by the price of the round of the last investor, if not more because of growth) and then he buys your ownership.<p>Idk what &quot;reverse&quot; vesting is, but if you had normal vesting it sounds like your 49%, after the 1 year cliff, would be worth e.g. 12%. So you can either keep that 12% or if he wants to buy you out he could pay you your 12% vested * last valuation * growth factor.<p>It sounds like it&#x27;s not going to work for the two of you to work together, so now it&#x27;s just about negotiating the details before the conflict kills the company')
