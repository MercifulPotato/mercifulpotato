I was recently looking for some QuantLib bindings for Rust and its not really there yet.<p>There&#x27;s a great book called Implementing QuantLib by Fabio Ballabio that is a really nice introduction to QuantLib for those that are interesting. It is really nice, has lots of term structure data structures built in and some datetime abstractions useful for pricing&#x2F;risk calcs, and supports lots of financial instruments, like CDS, vanilla&#x2F;exotic options, bond calculations. Just wonderful.')
