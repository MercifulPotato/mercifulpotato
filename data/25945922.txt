They are under no obligation to provide trades on specific stocks, and if users want to trade that specific stock then they are free to use a different service. Users can sell&#x2F;trade their assets out of the Robinhood service if they are unhappy with the current state of affairs.<p>Of course, the users are free to file any lawsuits they wish. Saying &quot;the game is rigged and its unfair&quot; isn&#x27;t exactly a legal argument, though.')
