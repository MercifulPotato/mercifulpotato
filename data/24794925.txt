Q-anon happened to stick, and off the rails it went.</i><p>It&#x27;s just like how 100% of the memes are created on 4chan, the mechanism is the same, applicable from cat pictures to political propaganda. Since 2016 or so, there has been much talk about &quot;weaponized memes&quot; on 4chan that was mostly a meme by itself initally (I was a witness there in 2016), but based on the situation by now it&#x27;s unfortunately surely a real thing, and even MIT Technology Review has an article [0]. It feels surreal. What an interesting time to be alive! A bunch of random grassroot web dwellers can create something out of nothing by natural selection and genetic exchanges, and by attracting conspiracy zealots in this process, it will eventually become big enough to make an impact on national politics.<p>20 years ago, it was a Sci-Fi plot. Although Usenet already foreshadowed many social aspects of online communities (I could find conspiracy materials even from the early ARPA archives), but nowhere influential.<p>One comment mentioned the changed perception of free speech before and after the 2010s, and this is an important contributing factor. Perhaps the society will learn to better adapt the new meme order in another decade.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyreview.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;24&#x2F;132228&#x2F;political-war-memes-disinformation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyreview.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;24&#x2F;132228&#x2F;political...</a>')
