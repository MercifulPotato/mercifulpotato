I think if PG was being honest with himself, he&#x27;d admit that they spend only 10 minutes interviewing because he personally wouldn&#x27;t want to be stuck in a room with someone he doesn&#x27;t like for longer. That&#x27;s a weakness of someone who clearly disdains anyone he views as a lesser mind (see: &quot;culture fit&quot;).<p>Making snap judgments about people seems to be one of his major personality flaws. Steve Jobs had the same flaw, so it&#x27;s clearly not professionally debilitating, but it is reprehensible nonetheless.<p>2. YC could make the process less fickle and far more objective by having each startup get interviewed for 10 minutes by each partner, rather than in a high pressure groupthink session. It would cost no more of their time.<p>And of course, they could also just increase the time and interview just as many startups as they want. YC partners could treat it like a real job with hard work, rather than act like lazy VCs.<p>Anyone who has interviewed people knows that first impressions are <i>often</i> wrong, and yet YC bases their decisions entirely on first impressions, which is both funny and sad.<p>3. It&#x27;s likely that YC&#x27;s success is based on their much-more objective application process, and the interview is random noise in the process. It is probably even worse than random noise and YC might be 2-10x more successful just by eliminating the interview stage.<p>4. PG has no true idea how other YC partners make their decisions, it&#x27;s likely to be very far from his own process, making his advice inaccurate and harmful to founders.')
