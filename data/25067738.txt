Item(by='teraku', descendants=None, kids=[25069384], score=None, time=1605170088, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25062188, text='&gt; The upper classes have something of a tendency to view all details of lower class life like every single bit of it is terrible and more bad news. There is a tendency to never see any stats in any kind of positive light. If you are poor, well it must suck to be you and you must be a victim every step of the way.<p>I mean it&#x27;s the general fault in all the communication of politicians and media since the late 70s that depict receivers of social security as beggars and undeserving and everybody who is poor is responsible for it themselves. I know this varies a bit from country to country, but even in Germany where we have a &quot;strong&quot; social security system (although it was weakened in the early 00s), the general public&#x27;s opinion is receivers of social benefits are freeloaders, even among poor people.<p>Although studies show time and again that even if you are able to become a higher-earner, it still won&#x27;t make you rich. The strongest indication for wealth is inheritance. And the top percent (owners, not earners) also pay less tax per wealth. So why are they not depicted as freeloaders?')
