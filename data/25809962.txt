I am on an active search for a technical co-founder and was thinking that some of you surely had the same experience. My method is a published advert on google doc with intro and other information attached, I am not sure what the policy is with attaching links here.<p>So now to my questions:<p>If you succeeded, how long did it take you?<p>How did you do the „interviews“ or matching process?<p>What do you think is a realistic timeline? I started on the 12th of Jan and received some feedback and am now thinking how to proceed.<p>Thank you so much for your inputs and feedback!')
