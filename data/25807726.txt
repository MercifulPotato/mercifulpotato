My impression is that when you hear something aloud it&#x27;s nearly always different to some degree from what you imagined in your head — and I don&#x27;t think even someone like Beethoven escaped this entirely.  I feel confident that he would have made minor adjustments to many of the late works he was never able to hear — he was known as a &quot;reviser&quot; in his working methods anyway.<p>My best evidence for this is the weird harmonic rhythm of the second movement of Sonata #32.  (&quot;Harmonic rhythm&quot; is a technical term having to do with where we perceive a move from chord to chord.)  The harmonies change at odd points.  I don&#x27;t believe that the effect was entirely deliberate — I think he meant for the harmonic rhythm to be straightforward and merely to anticipate with some melodic gestures.  He was probably experimenting, but when you do something unusual, that&#x27;s when feedback is even more important.<p>When I <i>read</i> that sonata, though, the harmonic rhythm I hear in my head doesn&#x27;t seem off.  The barlines provide a downbeat, and the apparent harmonies from the melodic gestures don&#x27;t override  it.')
