These assignments have 12 short answer questions and each student must do them.<p>Slowest part about marking these is having to context switch for each question. So I&#x27;d mark Q1 , then Q2 etc for one assignment, then go over to the next one and start back at Q1.<p>I figured this was super inefficient since I needed to have the answer and context of the question in my mind and keep switching.<p>So I wrote a program to parse all of the questions from all of the reports and present them to me in question batches. So now I see all of Q1 one after the other for each student&#x27;s and mark those. Then once all of the Q1&#x27;s are done, I mark all the Q2&#x27;s. After all the marking is done, I run that through another program that then formats that data to each student so it&#x27;s back onto their individual report plus any comments or deductions.<p>I find that apart from saving the time to have to open tonnes of docx files, now it takes maybe 5 mins to mark everything.')
