That&#x27;s great (and a good reminder for us to reconnect with ThoughtWorks too :) We&#x27;ll have to see if Globant would be willing to share some lessons learned with us.<p>One of the problems we noticed in the Middle East &amp; North Africa is a lack of agencies &#x2F; development houses that do this at a high quality. In Eastern Europe lots of people go from college into a dev house for 2 years, and then qualify for great remote jobs (which usually require at least 2 years of experience).<p>We believe there&#x27;s value to getting talent straight into the top tech companies, and that we will be able to develop a more scalable approach to teaching them these skills (communities are powerful &amp; scale quickly). But it can be a challenge to get companies to hire engineers that have just graduated from college and have no work experience, so we&#x27;ll need to find solutions to that. One approach that is working well for us is internships. Companies like Google have great programs and our talent has been doing really well interviewing for those opportunities.')
