That always blew my mind because the amount of effort to find a library, learn it, include it, and use it, seemed really high for the functionality. I don&#x27;t understand why it saw such adoption - I wouldn&#x27;t even -think- to Google that functionality as a library; I&#x27;d just write it (if I was unaware of the string method, which to be fair, I only know of because of the leftpad kerfuffle).<p>A game engine is an example where learning the framework is assuredly going to be faster; you&#x27;d need a better reason to write your own, and as a dev manager I&#x27;d be pushing back on it hard (whether it was coming from the devs or the business).')
