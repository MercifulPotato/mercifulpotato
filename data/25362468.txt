If it was it would lose the Section 230 protections, that is the whole point of that law, it is separate who is a publisher (like a news company) and who is just a &quot;dumb wire&quot; (a ISP for example, was the original goal).<p>Section 230 was created after people sued ISPs using laws intended to allow lawsuits against newspapers.<p>Section 230 is overall, a good law, but the bigtech abuse of it is greatly risking it to be killed for good, they are supposed to be either a platform, or a publisher, not Frankenstein&#x27;s Monster that has parts of both, having the protections of a platform while having the powers of a publisher.')
