It&#x27;s one thing to pivot a startup, and another to pivot a beheamoth like the company that Kodak was. And transitioning from one industry to another is a much bigger deal than transitioning from designing x86 CPUs to ARM CPUs.<p>In hindsight, yes, it was a mistake.  But it&#x27;s a very understandable one.')
