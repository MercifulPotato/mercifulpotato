Most of a decade, ~7 years IIRC. If student loans could only be cancelled via bankruptcy after 10-15 years, that would mean students trying to cancel their loans through bankruptcy would be doing it in their early to mid 30s assuming they graduated at 21 years of age. Their credit scores would be ruined until their 40s at least. Few people would pursue this route just to save some money on education.<p>If a graduate doesn&#x27;t have enough assets by 30 to make bankruptcy a bad option, then I think it&#x27;s fair to tell the lender that they made a bad investment and that the loss is reasonable. If this is how it worked, student loans to good universities would still yield a good return. It&#x27;d probably incentivize universities to track students&#x27; earnings after graduation, and focus on improving that figure. Lenders would probably stop writing loans to degree mills, or non-rigorous universities that don&#x27;t substantially improve the employment prospects of students.')
