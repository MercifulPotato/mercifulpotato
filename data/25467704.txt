Nobody except Rockstar and Insomniac does AAA open-wolrd and story-rich game that was expected from CD Projekt, and these studios have enormous head-start. Some engineering projects are not solved by money, they only get solved and polished by institutional experience.<p>And in some areas, Cyberpunk was actually trying to do something that nobody in the whole industry has done before. Open-world with such a sense city, with such a density of characters and unique assets, all of which have to work both with high-speed car movement and very close, first-person camera (as opposed with third-person camera, which is used in other open world games). And the art theme and style which is defined by dynamic lightning and reflection!<p>Yes, they but more than they could chew. But you gotta admire the ambition here, and how much did they get right. I play on PC and just upgraded video card to 3070 for this game, and it truly feels like a generational leap. Rough, unpolished, lacking in many areas, but a leap nevertheless.')
