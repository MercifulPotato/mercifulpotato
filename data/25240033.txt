If you’ve got frontends that take longer than 10 mins to serve traffic then you have a problem.<p>But if you’re running a DB or a storage system, 10 mins is a blink of an eye. Storage systems in particular can run a few hundred TB per node and moving that data to another node can take over an hour.<p>In this case, the frontends have a shard map which is definitely not stateless. This is typically okay if you have a fast load operation which blocks other traffic until shard map is fully loaded')
