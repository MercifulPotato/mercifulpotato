We just don&#x27;t know.<p>Unemployment rates are slowly going back down, and the economy seems to have come to grips with how to handle the virus over the summer, so for now I think we&#x27;re probably good, but the long term effects of COVID&#x27;s shock to the system and the tax breaks we passed before it are probably at least 6-12 months away from starting to materialize.')
