Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610655061, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25776500, text='&gt; Tangentially, I think 4th edition and now 5th edition lost a lot of the creative soul of earlier editions - the lore is much more heavily integrated with the rule set and feels a lot more prescriptive. but that could just be nostalgic bias as I grew up with 2ed.<p>I think that’s true in a superficial way that helps people new to it get into it, but I also think the core is more streamlined and easily adaptable than the earlier versions (particularly the pre-3e versions), and there’s quite a diversity of different-setting-and-flavor options in the core (primarily, in the DMG), and a good diversity of both generic tools and specific built settings and reusable setting elements, both first- and third-party, so even if the core doesn’t push as hard for “build it yourself”, the support for that is as good as earlier editions.')
