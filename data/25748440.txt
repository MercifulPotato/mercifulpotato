New York has always been different from St. Louis, but both &quot;universes&quot; could coexist and now they seemingly cannot. That doesn&#x27;t look to me like a function of geography.<p>What has changed is that it&#x27;s now easier to be an &quot;undercover radical stlouite&quot; in NY and viceversa.<p><i>&gt; I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by this.</i><p>Trump&#x27;s organization is fundamentally bolshevik in nature, with a small inner circle of &quot;avantgarde&quot; that decides everything and then pushes decisions down to the masses. It&#x27;s why significant chunks of his own party don&#x27;t like him, because there is little or no policy elaboration even slightly down the pyramid. Both Clinton and Obama did it to an extent in their first few years, but nobody has done it as much as Trump. Trump could make it stick because the social web reduces the need to cozy-up to the larger press ecosystem for his message to spread. It&#x27;s the sort of qualitative jump that early-XX century parties did with radio and films, which removed a lot of influence from local bigwigs in favours of national leaders.<p><i>&gt; One blames the media for the information purveyed rather than the sorts of people amenable to Fox&#x27;s viewpoint in their news.</i><p>Amenable people still need to articulate and support their views to be effective, and for the message to be efficiently evangelized and legitimized. Dedicated media does that work for them. Without that work, they wouldn&#x27;t be as effective.<p><i>&gt;  there are other factors at play.</i><p>Of course there are, but the likes of Fox are <i>important</i> factors. Their tone has been extremely divisive since the &#x27;90s, this is a long wave coming.<p><i>&gt; And yet geography seems to be in play in which media bubble you end up in</i><p>Yes, but this was <i>always</i> the case and it&#x27;s arguably much less so now that local papers are dying off. The point is what <i>is changing</i>, and geography has largely not changed; but the media landscape has, and pretty dramatically too.')
