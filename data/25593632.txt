Item(by='necovek', descendants=None, kids=[25593763, 25593879], score=None, time=1609429297, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25592681, text='Totally click-bait: my immediate reaction was that there were already studies to show that taller people are wealthier, and it seemed more reasonable to expect wealthier people to (in general) care less about wealth redistribution.<p>That selection bias was already confirmed in the abstract, but obviously not in the title.<p>However, as a tall person myself at 6&#x27;5&quot;&#x2F;195cm, I find that I do have to earn more (actually spend more) just to get the same lifestyle.  All my out-of-pocket expenses for business travel to upgrade my economy seats on long-haul flights, bigger cars just to be able to fit my kids in the back, custom, longer beds and mattresses (and when looking to vacation somewhere, checking photos to ensure bed is not bounded at the bottom by a rail or I&#x27;ll be spending nights crunched up)..., increase costs just so I can &quot;fit&quot; into many places people take for granted.<p>So while there is some preferential treatment for taller males (I&#x27;ve seen it too), nobody mentions the extra costs their lives generally require. It&#x27;s like comparing absolute salaries between countries.')
