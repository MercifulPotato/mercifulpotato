Item(by='UncleMeat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607794103, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25399335, text='&gt; It is shocking to me that some people actually prefer to rely on &quot;fact checkers,&quot; as if those people are somehow more intelligent, and less biased than the readers themselves.<p>In the large majority of topics, there exist huge numbers of people who are far more expert than I am. I don&#x27;t just prefer expert &quot;fact checkers&quot; in fields like medicine, law, science, plumbing, wiring, etc., I depend on them. Similarly, there are certainly journalists who have much more time and experience when it comes to these topics than I have.')
