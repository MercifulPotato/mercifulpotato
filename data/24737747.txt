It&#x27;s not a force for good.<p>They&#x27;ve kicked us out of open computing by locking down the only computer a lot of folks own (iPhone). And now look what kind of shit they can pull because they own the entire stack! <i>This shouldn&#x27;t be possible!</i><p>We really have to push against this and hope the DOJ forces all phone providers to allow &quot;side-loading&quot; (what a bizarre term!)<p>The iPhone is a computer, not some gaming console. It has to be free for freedom. You should be able to install straight off the web.<p>And before you downvote me, please look again how much Apple gives a damn about democracy in the world. And look what it&#x27;s doing because of its power. Double plus ungood.<p>It&#x27;s an American device. <i>It should act like it!</i>')
