First rumblings I remember about phasing out lead was around 1988 or so. Same time they also had to deal with switching to surface mount packages and the phase out of Freon. The electronics industry didn&#x27;t want the liability of having to deal with lead solder, lead contaminated waste, and worker safety. Seriously in 30 years I&#x27;ve never heard any complaints from the PCB manufacturers about phase out of lead. Only from people with no attachment to the industry.')
