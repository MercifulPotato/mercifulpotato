Modern PC EUFI bootloaders are bigger and more bloated than any uboot build in existence, and things like device tree support in linux means that you can support various boards with the same kernel (including boards that don&#x27;t exist yet). Sure you&#x27;ll probably still need custom bootloaders for most boards, but it&#x27;s not like you can swap your motherboard BIOS&#x2F;UEFI chips and expect them to work either. The PC &quot;platform&quot; with hardcoded physical addresses for your serial ports is nice if you&#x27;re running DOS but it&#x27;s not really relevant for modern operating systems which have to employ much more complex hardware discovery mechanisms.<p>It&#x27;s true that on ARM it&#x27;s still a bit anarchic and bespoke in practice but that&#x27;s mainly because there&#x27;s no reason to push for strong standardization when every vendor is building their own kernels for their own devices anyway.<p>But the tools do exist (on Linux at least, not sure about the other OSs), if desktop ARM becomes mainstream things could settle fairly quickly. It&#x27;s less of a technical problem and more of a &quot;why bother?&quot; problem.')
