This year’s event will happen on Thursday, December 3rd and be entirely online, including both the founder pitches and the virtual expo hall:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workatastartup.com&#x2F;events&#x2F;startup-career-expo-s20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workatastartup.com&#x2F;events&#x2F;startup-career-expo-s2...</a><p>The expo is an efficient way to meet a number of great startups all at once, and not have to seek them out yourself. We start the event with rapid pitches by founders -- like Demo Day, but for engineers instead of investors -- to give you a quick way to survey the companies. There is also custom software to let you easily like the ones that stood out, so founders can reach out to you.<p>After the pitches, we open up an expo hall (again, all virtual) to give you a chance to meet founders and early employees, learn more about the domain and technology, and hear about open roles. We’ve been experimenting with the format over the last few months, and recent participants of YC events say it’s just as good as our past in-person events. (Thank goodness!)<p>We aim to have 40 or so YC startups attend and give pitches, with a bias towards ones that have graduated in more recent YC batches (W20, S20). These startups are vetted by YC and have raised a healthy round of funding. A good number of the roles they are hiring for are in engineering and design, but there will also be non-tech roles as well.<p>Working at a startup isn’t for everyone, and many HN users will be the first to point that out. Justin Kan, a former YC partner himself, has this great post on what you will and won’t get out of working at a startup, and it’s pretty accurate: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atrium.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;work-at-a-startup&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atrium.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;work-at-a-startup&#x2F;</a><p>That said, we’re finding more people are joining YC startups this year, and for a variety of reasons: to pursue something better aligned with their values, to have a bigger impact through their work, to grow skills in ways that their current jobs won’t allow, and (yes) to seek out “the next big thing”.<p>If you might be considering something new -- or even if you’re just curious to know what’s out there -- we welcome you to join YC and our founders for an informative and efficient evening of networking, job hunting or just seeing if startups are for you.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workatastartup.com&#x2F;events&#x2F;startup-career-expo-s20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.workatastartup.com&#x2F;events&#x2F;startup-career-expo-s2...</a>')
