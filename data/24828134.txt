It builds upon results about the relationship between trigonometric functions (usually defined in terms of power series) and the unit circle&#x27;s geometry, as well as intuition from 2D geometry in general. These things can actually be quite hard to prove. (Prime example in a slightly different context: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jordan_curve_theorem" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jordan_curve_theorem</a> ) For instance,<p>&gt; A similar triangle inscribed at this vertex has a short side which is necessarily less than the arc length.<p>already uses the fact that straight lines are the shortest lines in the class of C¹-differentiable curves due to the Euler-Langrange equations. (Good luck with proving this statement in the class of C⁰ curves.) Then, to use this fact, you need to prove differentiability of a curve parametrizing the unit circle, i.e. differentiability of the trigonometric functions. Now, at this point you might as well use the standard definition of e^x in terms of a power series because it simplifies the differentiability proof tremendously.')
