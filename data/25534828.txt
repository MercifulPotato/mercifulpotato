(In some ways it&#x27;s good to review that way, as it means you evaluate whether the code is still clear even with less information available).<p>&gt; Same goes for sharing snippets with colleagues to explain&#x2F;understand ehat is happening.<p>I hardly ever see that happen; it&#x27;s usually much better to create a branch or worksheet.<p>&gt; There is definitely a balance to be found, but I believe most languages today (and, unfortunately, programmers) rely too much on an IDE even though there&#x27;s a large enough part of our work happening outside of it.<p>IMO it&#x27;s just the opposite; there&#x27;s a lot of good things we can do with the GUI tools that we realistically ~always have available. Programmers are rightly sceptical of &quot;visual programming&quot; tools that break VCS history, but a language that has an understandable textual representation enhanced by the GUI gets you the best of both worlds.')
