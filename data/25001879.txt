Even if you have a damning confession letter which proves intent. Do you have a murder weapon? Evidence that puts the person at the scene of the crime? Circumstantial evidence like phone location data?<p>Ironically intent is the far harder thing to prove, I have no idea why you chose to base your argument on intent.')
