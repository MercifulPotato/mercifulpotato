The hope is that when they become &quot;real&quot; courses the pass rate is higher. I think this counts people who are re-taking the course or who dropped it as failing. We had ~50% of our class drop within the first month.<p>Part of it was related to their expectations of the course: &quot;you mean I have to write code and the class is based off of that and not memorizing test answers? I&#x27;m out&quot;')
