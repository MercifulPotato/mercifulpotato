Without something like ACPI, you need customized kernels and other crap to control system devices. ACPI is actually quite nice. And it replaced something (APM) that really was legacy cruft (dropping into real mode for power management?!! Ugh!)<p>EFI doesn’t seem that bad either. Maybe something like uboot would suit you better? But the reason we have those nice graphical bios utilities now is because of EFI.')
