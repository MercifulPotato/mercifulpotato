On the one hand, he has deep experience with Apple and great knowledge of the computing industry, but on the other, he is an elderly technologist who was pushed out of Apple decades ago [1] and is no more relevant to M1 than anyone else in the industry.<p>In either case, I tend to disagree with Gassee&#x27;s attack on the Morehead review, and I don&#x27;t believe that there is any need to connect Morehead&#x27;s M1 opinion with his 64-bit iPhone opinion. M1 should indeed be judged on its instruction set limitations because that is one of its major differences versus x86. It would be careless to consider personal computing hardware while forcibly ignoring the sofware ecosystem that it supports.<p>I also think it&#x27;s a cheap shot to accuse Morehead of choosing his opinions based on a financial interest in the supremacy of x86.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mondaynote.com&#x2F;50-years-in-tech-part-13-firing-frankness-3d17e207d1cf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mondaynote.com&#x2F;50-years-in-tech-part-13-firing-frank...</a>')
