Very cool, there&#x27;s something about tech at a convergence of aesthetics, science and <i>history</i> that is really awesome.<p>I did wonder about one bit though, which really was driven home by their speculation about trying to do it mechanically at the end:<p>&gt;<i>&quot;However, as a fan of astronomical complications, I can&#x27;t help but wonder if this sort of complication couldn&#x27;t be realized in a mechanical wristwatch or pocket watch.&quot;</i><p>Does what the Apple Watch is doing require GPS? I sort of assumed that if it&#x27;s showing true noon&#x2F;midnight and so on it must also be taking into account the watch&#x27;s physical location and calculating with that. As someone who knows little about mechanical watches, can this be done without that, or there mechanical complications that can take a manual location adjustment as an input or the like? It&#x27;s amazing to consider the kinds of creative and impressive engineering and construction that has gone into mechanical computation though. On almost the polar opposite scale, it somehow reminds me a bit of the Ars article last year mechanical analog computers for warships ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;information-technology&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;gears-of-war-when-mechanical-analog-computers-ruled-the-waves&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;information-technology&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;gears...</a> ).')
