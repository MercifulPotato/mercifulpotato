This will sound silly, but FCrDNS was accepted almost unanimously in 2013 when a draft IETF document was created, but never ratified, that caused all the ISP&#x27;s to add generic reverse DNS for everything.  This turned every home PC into a malware magnet over night.  Fast forwards a little bit and a gentleman in Japan created a concept to utilize this called &quot;S25R&quot; [1] which is a simple regex methodology to block generic devices from sending email.  Problem is, very few people implemented it and instead people opted for throwing a lot of money and anti-spam companies.  Multi-billion dollar businesses were created and people like money!   So anyway, the mechanism is there already to stop most of the spam, but people choose to not use it.  The way it can work is that using 7 <i>or a few more</i> simple regex rules, almost all generic devices are blocked from sending email.  This limits the sending devices to those that control forward-reverse DNS.  Some anti-spam companies make use of this, but only for flagging things as spam.  This method when used correctly makes RBL&#x2F;RSL databases effective again and forces spammers to rent servers.  If a VPS or server rental provider allows abuse, their AS number gets blocked. [2]<p>In short, if people won&#x27;t use the simple mechanisms that already exist, they probably won&#x27;t add a new mechanism or make use of it.  One argument against the existing method is friction or false positives, but really it just forces people to update DNS correctly.<p>To add a math puzzle to email servers, you would also need to update every MTA and email server to understand this concept.  All the major providers, all MTA&#x27;s, etc...  All the smtp libraries in all the programming languages would also need to understand this concept.  <i>java, golang, python, php, perl, C, C++, C#, etc...</i><p>[1] - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gabacho-net.jp&#x2F;en&#x2F;anti-spam&#x2F;anti-spam-system.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gabacho-net.jp&#x2F;en&#x2F;anti-spam&#x2F;anti-spam-system.html</a><p>[2] - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uceprotect.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;index.php" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uceprotect.net&#x2F;en&#x2F;index.php</a>')
