Git commits, mostly, but I&#x27;ve used it to sign legal documents as well, and a small grab-bag of other cases.<p>Is it the best for this application? It is not. Many of the objectionable aspects of the PGP standard apply to signing as well.<p>But also, yes, it is: it&#x27;s supported by GitHub and GitLab, and if any other way of signing commits is supported, I&#x27;m not aware of that.<p>I&#x27;d be happy to switch to a better, modern cryptosystem for signing things, if it were adequately supported.<p>What I never do, is use GPG for encrypted communication. Given moxie&#x27;s particular claim to fame, I don&#x27;t blame him for focusing on that application, and he is (of course) correct: if you&#x27;re using GPG to communicate &#x27;securely&#x27;, stop.')
