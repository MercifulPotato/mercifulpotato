Comcast, &quot;advertised 100mbps to 1gbps&quot; (true enough, although you can only get 150mbps, so I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s bracketing) 2. CenturyLink, &quot;25-50mbps&quot; (CenturyLink&#x27;s own website says &quot;Our systems indicate that our High Speed Internet is not currently available at your service address.&quot; I tried several other streets in the area that indicated that none of them had availability either.) 3. Platinum Equity LLC, &quot;10-25mbps&quot; (err, Platinum Equity is an investment firm - oh, one of their portfolio offers &quot;T1 and Bonded T1&quot; lines to businesses and after further investigation would offer me 192K SDSL as a residential offering) 4. Integra Telecom Holdings, &quot;3-6mbps&quot; (a Vancouver telco that does business fiber). So there&#x27;s one - Olympia, WA.')
