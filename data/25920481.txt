We are on the Bronze plan with over 300 users company wide.<p>My department of 40 does the vast majority (90% plus of all commits&#x2F;MRs) of the coding in the company, but we enrolled everyone within operations as well so that they could contribute on occasion.<p>The rest of those users are never going to be worth spending $19 a month on, but it really sucks having to put up barriers from people who do like to contribute on occasion. Feels like we&#x27;re going in the wrong direction here, so much for devops :(')
