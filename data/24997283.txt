In the POA 1986, Parliament extended the  offences  to  the  private  sphere.  However,  an  exception  exists  where  words  or  behaviour are used or written material displayed within a dwelling, provided that they cannot be seen or heard outside that or another dwelling.129 Similar protections were later  incorporated  into  the  legislation  on  religious  hatred  and  hatred  on  grounds  of  sexual orientation.<p>18.251 This exception also applies to the POA 1986 offences of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to put a person in fear of violence, or to provoke violence, or causing a person harassment, alarm or distress.130<p>18.252 To the extent that the aim is to ensure that the criminal law does not intrude on purely private matters, the exception is poorly targeted. It would include a meeting held in a large private house, for instance, but would exclude a private conversation conducted in an office. Other jurisdictions handle this issue differently. For instance, the Canadian Criminal Code excludes a “private conversation” from the offence of wilful promotion of hatred.131<p>18.253 It  is  also  anomalous  that  the  parallel  offence  of  showing  video  or  sound  recordings  does apply in a dwelling.<p>18.254 We question the need for this exception to the stirring  up  offences.  As  discussed  in  Chapter 3, the harm at which these offences is targeted is the propagation of hatred. Other incitement offences, such as inciting or encouraging commission of an offence,132 are not protected simply because they take place within a person’s home.<p>18.255 We therefore propose that the dwelling exception should be removed from the stirring up offences.')
