I am just not sure whether other people use the word &quot;depression&quot; to refer to X, or something else. Maybe &quot;depression&quot; actually refers to 10 times X, how am I supposed to know?<p>Sometimes people use the same words to describe different things (or different degrees of the same thing), sometimes people use different words to describe the same thing. I don&#x27;t have a direct access to your feelings, so how am I supposed to tell whether my feelings are the same?')
