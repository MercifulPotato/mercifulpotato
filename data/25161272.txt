I tried 32 and 64 bit OS images, Chromium and Firefox.  All are browser not supported, or it works but then doesn&#x27;t make any attempt to use the webcam or a microphone (even the setup menu entry for this is missing).  This being a web app, it could of course change any time.  The other stuff that I tried - Zoom and Google Hangouts - worked, just not fast enough for good frame rate.<p>A modern computer should have suspend&#x2F;resume.  This doesn&#x27;t, but all kitted out with accessories - 7 port USB hub, USB headset, spinning laptop hard disk - it idles at 6-7 watts, plus it boots fast and shuts down almost instantly, so that&#x27;s not a big issue.<p>Now for a list of things that I think this is good for:<p>1. As an accessory to the family TV - for online video that the &quot;smart TV&quot; is too dumb for, for games and such.<p>2. As a classroom computer, with a few sample setups.<p>2a. Overlay mode (i.e. immutable SD card image and no wear) and everyone uses the same generic userID but then logs into their own google account.<p>2b. Overlay mode, immutable SD card image and everyone brings a USB stick to store their data on.<p>2c. Completely diskless mode, everyone has a USB stick they boot from (this works very well even with a typical slow USB stick).<p>2d. Completely diskless mode, PXE boot from a server (needs gigabit wired ethernet for adequate performance)<p>2e. Like 2c but with NFS home directories.  This needs some sort of centralized account management.<p>Practical as that is, probably Chromebooks are too well established for this to get any traction.<p>3. As the standard experimenter&#x27;s Raspi.  Costs about the same as a Raspi4 with a good aluminum fanless case, so you get the keyboard for free.<p>4. As a small NAS&#x2F;DVR&#x2F;whatever server node.  Same as 3. You get Raspi4 performance and passive cooling for about the same price but a free keyboard.<p>5. As an extra homework&#x2F;Youtube&#x2F;whatever screen in a screen-constrained budget conscious family.  Get a $10 monitor from Craigslist&#x2F;Kijiji, a $2 HDMI&#x2F;DVI adapter for it and you&#x27;re off.  Except for the sound thing; suggest Bluetooth for minimum clutter for that.<p>Really a practical little machine, comparable to a decent 10-12 year old laptop with an SSD upgrade.')
