Item(by='gamblor956', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606162575, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25190706, text='Disney acquired Lucasfilms in 2012, not 2014, so ADF continued getting payments for <i>something</i> for almost 2 years after the acquisition. (Disney didn&#x27;t acquire Fox until 2019, so the Aliens books would be an entirely separate issue.)<p>The SFWA president has made some earlier misstatements of the law, and it appears she doesn&#x27;t have a clear grasp of the timeline, so I&#x27;m not putting much weight into anything she says. She&#x27;s correct that the WFH agreement is binding on Disney, but Disney isn&#x27;t disputing that (though the SFWA claims otherwise). The issue, from Disney&#x27;s standpoint, is that clearly they don&#x27;t think there is anything in the contract requiring them to pay.<p>It is very possible Disney reviewed all of its payments and ended the ones for which it could not find a contractual basis for continuing payments, such as for example, paying royalties on a WFH contract where they owned the rights to the work. But as neither side has actually coughed up a WFH agreement entitling the author to royalties, it&#x27;s just speculation.<p>Apparently, ADF actually has a copy of his contract, per the SFWA president (but again, she&#x27;s made incorrect statements about the parties before). If that&#x27;s the case, ADF could resolve this very quickly by showing the part of the WFH contract where it says he will be getting paid royalties.')
