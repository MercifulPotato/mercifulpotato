An example is Bitcoin&#x27;s concensus critical code</i><p>I don&#x27;t think Bitcoin is a perfect example here, the Bitcoin consensus rule is fragile because it&#x27;s Bitcoin, not because it&#x27;s old. The unchangeable consensus code is a result due to the fundamental property of Bitcoin itself (every client must run in lockstep, even the slightest deviance cannot be tolerated, which means there should be one and only one Bitcoin client whose behavior shall remain consistent for as long as Bitcoin exists), this outcome is independent from its code quality, age, and other factors.<p>...Nevertheless, on second thought, the Bitcoin analogy isn&#x27;t too far from the truth. If an aged legacy system is the dependency of many other systems and serves a critical role, it effectively becomes Bitcoin-like.')
