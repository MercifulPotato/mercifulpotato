I grew up on an old colonial street in a major Latin American city. Beautiful street &quot;paved&quot; with cobblestones.<p>Somehow the cobblestones managed to look both randomly placed and have some &quot;lines&quot; that gave it a very orderly look. The cobblestones were placed in some substrate that allowed moss to grow between them.<p>At some point about 10 years ago, the city decided to tear up a giant trench in the middle of the street to replace some sewage. When they were done, they covered the trench with concrete and then re-placed the stones they had removed onto the concrete.<p>It looks nothing like it used to. Just messy. I think that if someone who didn&#x27;t grow up there were to see it, they would think it was a perfectly charming street, but really it lost so, so much.<p>I asked around and apparently nobody knows how to lay cobblestones anymore. There was a certain art to how they were placed and the substrate selected: dirt, then sand (what kind? how coarse?) then stones, then something else. This ensured that they would never wash away even in the torrential rains we get here every year.<p>Placing cobblestones seems like an easy thing to do. Just rocks on dirt, right? But how do you ensure they never move, they never wash away, they don&#x27;t get covered in dirt or greenery.<p>The craziest thing is that the street had remained basically pristine for what was probably 100+ years, but the new stones on concrete are already falling out.')
