Give me git and ssh and I&#x27;m good to go.<p>FYI: the wait time is marginal at best to deploy images and containers. My workflow is the same as yours most of the time for solo projects: SSH into server, git pull (from a &quot;stack&quot; branch that has docker-compose files containing DB and microservices), docker-compose up -d, and because of cached images it takes minimal time to deploy.<p>--<p>I agree that as a sole developer it can add initial complexity. As a sole developer myself on prior projects and now on personal projects, I use Docker primarily to streamline my deployment practices.<p>Another excellent use case of Docker not mentioned elsewhere in this thread is the simplicity of running databases locally, e.g., mongodb, postgres, etc.')
