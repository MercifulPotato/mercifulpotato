But my request is rooted in the fact that AskHN&#x2F;ShowHN are often more niche questions&#x2F;show posts. The signal:noise ratio for them is, imo, different than that of popular posts on the front page. Therefor i&#x27;m describing that they should not be required to be front-page-popular to be browse-able.<p>Another way to think about it is i often want to see discussions and projects from HN folks. The frontpage can often just be full of popular nonsense - Reddit-esque. However ShowHN and AskHN often have gems that are obscure, with a much smaller amount of points.<p>Yet another way to look at it is: i&#x27;d love a toggle filter to only show me AskHN&#x2F;ShowHN on the front page. However most days it would only be one or two posts.<p>Hopefully this illustrates my desires :)<p><i>(one final example, hah, might be this very post. I suspect it&#x27;ll get over 100, but currently it&#x27;s sitting at 60 pts)</i>')
