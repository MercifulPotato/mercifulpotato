You can run x86 apps with emulation without the Microsoft Store but why even bother with an ARM device then?<p>Turns out Windows on ARM is a farce and never had a chance in the first place. The available SoCs were crap, no hardware manufacturer actually launched ARM laptops in significant quantity, apps had to be ported to UWP, etc... It&#x27;s basically Windows RT again and it was a total failure at that.')
