When I first learned about ALOHAnet, at least it was a surprise to me. Specifically, the main idea of &quot;send at a random time, retry if there&#x27;s a collision&quot; in Ethernet&#x27;s CSMA&#x2F;CD was originally employed in the ALOHA protocol (which makes sense, as both networks operated on a shared medium, unlike today&#x27;s Ethernet).')
