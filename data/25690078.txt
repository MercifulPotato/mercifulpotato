Apple doesn&#x27;t make a dime from user data. Really, the only use they have for it, is usability&#x2F;A-B testing, and crash dumps (which have been quite useful for me, as a developer).<p>If FB brought Apple (maybe ten years ago, but today? Fat chance), then that would be a different matter, entirely.<p>In a way, it&#x27;s quite fortunate that Apple was considered too radioactive to buy, when it wasn&#x27;t doing so well.')
