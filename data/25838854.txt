Plus performance doesn&#x27;t matter at all because you can add it later if you need it, which you don&#x27;t. Anyway, you can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s slow until you&#x27;ve measured it and you can&#x27;t complain until you have a fix. Besides, it&#x27;s more important that the code is readable because it will be read much more often than it will be written. And furthermore, if you re-run the same thing a few times to warm the JIT up, discount startup time, ignore input and output time and network lag because they are external to the system and only measure the core function runtime, you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s ackshually really fast (if you buy new hardware which is ifine because +$2000 computer spend is cheaper than developer time). And does a few seconds really matter, what were you going to do with that 10 seconds of response time, read a book or something? Slow? What do you mean &quot;slow&quot;, launch time, hover response, switching response, time to finish redrawing a page? There&#x27;s many things happening and you can&#x27;t complain unless you narrow down exactly which specific sub-millisecond behaviour is taking too long for you - none of them? thought not.<p>Stop questioning the dogma, hush.')
