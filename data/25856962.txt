That way whenever “the numbers” are brought up, the context and focus is around goals that really matter (are we creating a product that is meaningful and making people’s lives better?) versus cherry-picking and gaming the system to meet KPIs. Quantitative metrics are a dangerous tool since numbers are so easily digestible, so special care should always be given to understand exactly what the metrics are holding people accountable to.<p>An example that comes to mind in personal life is fitness. Weight is such an easy metric to get your hands on... doubly so since you can quickly judge weight by looking at yourself in the mirror. It’s really easy to tunnel on trying to lose weight! The activities (both physical and mental!) encouraged by fixation on weight can be incredibly destructive. If instead I first start with a strong vision statement that aligns with my values: My body is my most important possession; I want to keep it healthy so I can live a fulfilling life. In the context of that purpose weight is an important metric to keep in mind as a risk factor, but it is also clear that there are a multitude of other metrics that will allow me to measure, stretch, and grow towards a productive end.')
