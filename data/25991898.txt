As per Wikipedia:<p>&quot;Censorship can be conducted by governments, private institutions, and other controlling bodies.&quot;<p>There is also the issue of orthodox views and orthodox privilege (as per Paul Graham&#x27;s explanation).  Many conservative views are not orthodox to the point where you can be canceled for merely quoting someone else or citing facts (yes, both have happened in the past).  So there is some form of self-censorship (this is related to &quot;social cooling&quot; IIRC).<p>I think it all boils down to this: which side supports censorship and which side condemns it? There you will find your answer on who is more adversely affected by censorship.<p>Note: this is not a left or right issue, historically speaking.  For example, look back to McCarthyism.')
