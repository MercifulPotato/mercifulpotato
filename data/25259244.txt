Item(by='hamburglar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606771799, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25259074, text='I felt a little bad about hating everything about this and wasn&#x27;t even going to comment, but it kind of looks like you aren&#x27;t alone in your sentiment, based on how most of the top-level comments here range from &quot;WTF&quot; to &quot;I hate this.&quot;<p>Staring at the site, I couldn&#x27;t help but wonder what aspect I hated the most about it.  Is it the awful name for the mascot?  Is it the fact that they&#x27;re obviously so proud of the PH&#x2F;PHP &quot;wordplay&quot; that they overdo it?  Is it the fact that I can&#x27;t even tell what I&#x27;m supporting?  Is it that they couldn&#x27;t even be bothered to set up a payment system?  Is it the fact that a guy made a mascot in 1998 and seems to be making a grossly misguided attempt to &quot;cash in&quot; 22 years later?  Is it doing e-commerce via IM?  Is it the massively overinflated sense of PHP&#x27;s importance?  Is it the obnoxious way he keeps thrusting his head forward for emphasis?  Is it just that he ... <i>likes</i> PHP? (only about 50% joking on that last one)  It&#x27;s kind of a sum of all of the above for me.  And that sounds really harsh, but I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s the truth.  This is a very hateable site.<p>At any rate, I doubt you&#x27;re in serious downvote danger. :D')
