This is a bit absurd. No one would argue that buying a brand new car for $30k fresh out of school is wise financially for the typical college graduate. Whether it crushes your life or not, it is very ill advised.<p>You have also not addressed the half of debtors who owe <i>more</i> than the average. If the average is so high just think of the figures in the most indebted quarter which is necessarily one million persons per year approximately in the U.S.<p>There is a reason student debt cannot be discharged through normal bankruptcy. It is for many a horrific and crushing burden.')
