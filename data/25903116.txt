Author of the article here.<p>Your point on roadmap communication probably deserves another article in itself. “The real roadmap trap in my experience is that the org takes a roadmap as a promise of when specific things will be delivered.” That sentence brings home a point that I didn’t clarify well in the article.<p>Let me try to expand my view on the underlying problems faced by PMs that I think you’re touching upon: Product roadmaps are confused with release plans. And us Product Managers haven’t done a great job at distinguishing the two. This stems from a mismatch in expectations: While Product Managers try to create and communicate the mid-term product strategy, the ‘operational’ stakeholders (functions whose job is to conduct marketing campaigns, create sales collateral etc.) need to know about product releases.<p>The concept that Product Roadmaps ≠ Release Plans isn’t novel, and my motivation behind the article stems from exactly the problem you are describing. I think changing the format of the roadmap is a great way to start changing expectations and discussions around roadmaps. It’s not sufficient in itself, but necessary. As long as we show features mapped over time, our audience will take a roadmap “as a promise of when specific things will be delivered”, to borrow your phrasing.<p>I guess just one of the issues in separating the two formats is that somewhere between 1-6 months out, the line between a release plan and a roadmap blurries. That’s why I’m currently convinced that these two need to live in distinct documents.<p>With regards to the time horizon, I’m 100% with you in that I’m also hesitant to commit to anything further than 6-8 weeks&#x2F;one dev cycle out. However I do think that it’s important to communicate product goals to the rest of the org beyond that time frame, though not in the form of features.<p>A final thought: This topic is highly dependent on company and product maturity. My experience comes mostly from fairly early-stage companies. In my mind, as the company matures, other functions have longer planning cycles, and the committed time horizon must increase. So I’d be curious to hear how later-stage product teams are handling this.<p>Curious to hear further thoughts from you!')
