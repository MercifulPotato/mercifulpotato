Being Google and having boat loads of server resources I imagine they decided they may as well make it public.<p>All those products that got killed mostly started that way, employee&#x27;s wanted them and google had the money to make them happen. Eventually though if they&#x27;re not growing, then who in google wants to work on them?<p>Did google also see it as a strategic way to make sure dns providers couldn&#x27;t force search results elsewhere? Probably, but then as users WE certainly don&#x27;t want dns providers fucking with dns in that manner either.')
