That said, I think it is an example what is about to come if the USA doesn&#x27;t close off its market(which will lead to others close off their markets to foreigners and the internet will become balkanised) or break up its current Internet companies situation. Sure, FB and Google will continue to earn an  enormous amount of ad money in the years to come just like Nokia continued to sell it&#x27;s phones until it couldn&#x27;t anymore.')
