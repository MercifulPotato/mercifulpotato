Have an exit plan - are you planning to go on the postdoc treadmill afterwards?<p>Go for the BigCo if you&#x27;re unsure what to do. You&#x27;ll build your CV, make good money, and learn whether it suits you well.<p>IMO only go for the start-up if you&#x27;ve got a specific opportunity in mind that you&#x27;re in love with. Almost all start-ups fail, and sadly it&#x27;s harder to spin those failures into something positive on a CV.')
