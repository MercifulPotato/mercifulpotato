Withdrawing cash given the ATM limits is also an issue. Not all cash is bad! I organize festivals and although we heavily advertise that we take credit cards, checks, etc., although it costs us money, 50% of the people still prefer to pay cash. And with these virtual banks, what do I do with it? Deposit it into my personal account and write a check for the same amount to the business?!')
