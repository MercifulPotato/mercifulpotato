I&#x27;m not aware of a project similar to Jepsen for filesystems but there have been research papers like the one presented in this page that explore the guarantees of popular local filesystems: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danluu.com&#x2F;file-consistency&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;danluu.com&#x2F;file-consistency&#x2F;</a><p>Of course distributed filesystems are even harder but we can see that even writing to a local file is surprisingly complex and in many (most?) apps probably not really guaranteeing proper data consistency.<p>Imho the whole Posix filesystem API is flawed to begin with and it would be great if a modern replacement would emerge.')
