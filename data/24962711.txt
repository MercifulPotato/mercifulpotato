They are won by the side who are most effective at fighting, and who are the most ruthless. And almost no revolutions have ever had just two sides.<p>This is the main argument for incrementalism in my view. I see a lot of people arguing for radical change, and no matter how much I might agree with their values and how pure their intentions are, I cannot help but note that I do not think they would end up as the winners of any revolution.')
