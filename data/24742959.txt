It is fun to do stuff nobody else (or very few) people are doing, in labs with very cool stuff, working with extremely smart people.<p>However there will be a few extremely smart jerks, and leadership seems to spend a lot of time applying&#x2F;fighting for funding. I definitely got the sense that there was a pecking order. The PhDs are at the top, engineers and technicians don&#x27;t get as much respect. Also in these days I hear that US national labs are moving to a more &quot;flexible&quot; model. In days past an engineer might be assigned to an experiment for the duration, but now leadership wants to be able to assign resources on a more fine-grained basis. (Though I think this is becoming more the case in industry too.)<p>All that said, if I was in a position to not mind a pay cut, I&#x27;d definitely consider going back to pure research.')
