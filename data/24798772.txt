If you have a community of a million humans that constantly cause trouble, stab random people, blow themselves up, drive through crowds of people to make a quasi political-religious statement, doesn&#x27;t that merit some kind of bad treatment?<p>You reap what you sow. I am sorry, but the last decade of islamic terrorism, senseless killings of innocent people, of KIDS infront of their families, like the christmas market drivetroughs we have had here in europe, I just have no sympathy for humans that subscribe to islamism. Sorry! The glass is empty. You can&#x27;t do vile inhuman stuff on a regular basis and then cry human rights -  Its hypocrisy on such a level that only religious people can display such ingracious and dishonest behaviour!<p>I can really understand why some obscure sect of radical islamists get mistreated in China. What I cannot fathom is why globalist NGOs work so hard at bringing unending islamic migration to europe. Look! I can understand why Junckers of EU wants to bring in millions of Africans (and thereby commit genocide on the european population, as per UNs own definition) in order to subvert the african continent into some kind of unholy union where we will have &quot;1.8billion consoomers&quot; as he so graciously puts it. What I cannot understand is the love for islam, that shows absolutely no love for any other group or religion. There isn&#x27;t a level of the average European society that isnt deeply affected by islamic immigration! Its rediculous. Where is my human rights to be left alone by religious nutjobs and questionable cousin on cousin breeding, clan traditions, honor killings, segregation, religious demonstrations, crime, grooming gang scandals, weapon and grenade attacks and I could go on. This isn&#x27;t even the tip of the iceberg!<p>The only tears I have for the cries of human rights, is crying laughter. Why is it always the most inhumane groups of people who calls for human rights? If you want to be treated like a human, start acting like one.<p>The worst of all of this human rights nonsense, is that in south africa, they are literally chanting &quot;kill the Boer&quot; while almost everyday, another family gets slaughtered and raped, and no one as much as bats an eye, no media mention, probably because it doesn&#x27;t resonate too well with all that BLM subversion.')
