I personally like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spamgourmet.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.spamgourmet.com&#x2F;</a> - you can create an identifying address on the fly that also limits the total number of emails you&#x27;ll receive from that address. It solves all the issues you mentioned - it&#x27;s frictionless and still allows replies, while preventing spam. The gmail &#x27;+&#x27; feature works too, but is so high profile that a lot of spammers know how to parse it.')
