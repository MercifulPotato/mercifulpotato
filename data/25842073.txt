One gym in Williamsburg stayed open even during March and just kept paying the fine.\nThere just hasn&#x27;t been that much enforcement. We came to the conclusion that we experienced a real lockdown instead of a short stint of heightened delivery use. It&#x27;s absurd that indoor&#x2F;outdoor dining is still allowed (also that restaurants can&#x27;t get support). In my experience as a 20-something, most of my friends have been hanging (even house-partying!) indoors maskless, and it too leaves me at a loss for words. The &quot;well I already tested positive&quot; mentality is pretty common. Meanwhile my partner and family in Asia participate in heightened levels of lockdown when getting a fraction of the cases we get on a good day.')
