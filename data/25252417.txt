[...] And rarely do they have to sacrifice everything </i><p>The 4-letter word <i>&quot;work&quot;</i> encompasses very different activities:<p>(1) The so-called &quot;work&quot; that&#x27;s <i>genuinely interesting</i> to the entrepreneur and he&#x2F;she would rather not spend time on anything else<p>-- or --<p>(2) the work that people just barely tolerate as a job from 9 to 5<p>This means many observers using mental model (2) are confused why some founders have no &quot;work&#x2F;life&quot; balance.  In a previous comment, I try to explain what mental model (1) of passionate work feels like.[0]<p>If a person&#x27;s MITTD (Most Interesting Thing To Do) happens to be a research scientist working 80 hours a week in a lab trying to discover a new molecule, or a musician practicing guitar &quot;until his fingers bleed&quot;, or an Olympic athlete spending most of her time for years to prepare for competition, it&#x27;s more likely that society romanticizes that &quot;unbalanced life&quot; with more <i>positive</i> labels such as &quot;intense dedication&quot;.<p>But if that MITTD for a human happens to be working 80+ hours a week on an internet startup, we label it with <i>negative</i> labels such as &quot;work&quot; and that the entrepreneur is illogical for not having a good work-life balance.<p>If Warren Buffet is already worth $80 billion and owns a private jet that can take him to any exotic location in the world, why does he bother going into a boring Omaha Nebraska office every day to look at financial statements?!?  Because looking at business numbers is the <i>most interesting activity</i> to him.  Other entrepreneurs understand why WB doesn&#x27;t just take it easy and lay in a hammock in the Caribbean or go whale watching in Alaska.  WB is <i>not</i> &quot;sacrificing&quot; a tropical island vacation and he&#x27;s not suffering at work to look at financial statements.  That&#x27;s what he prefers to do with his time.  But to the accountant that wants to gouge his eyes out after balancing debits and credits for the 1000th time, WB&#x27;s passion makes no sense at all.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23924830" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23924830</a>')
