Perhaps they should be, but the intersection of the two sets (advocates for rent restrictions and advocates of zoning restrictions) appears to be a large portion of the total, as far as I can tell.<p>&gt; enough to fix the problem<p>I think we need to define the problem before we start arguing solutions.  In my view &quot;can&#x27;t afford the rent&quot; is a poverty problem, not a rent prices problem.  So, I want anti-poverty solutions, not rent price adjustment solutions.  I view &quot;the rent is too high&quot; as a distinct problem from &quot;can&#x27;t afford the rent.&quot;  So in my mind, rent price adjustments via price regulation are inappropriate for both problems.<p>&gt; so that only productive activities ... are profitable<p>I understand taxing negative externalities, but this sounds anti-democratic.  Who decides what&#x27;s productive?  Let&#x27;s put an appropriate tax on pollution (broadly defined) and let the market figure out what&#x27;s most productive.  That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s good at.<p>&gt; why oppose them?<p>I don&#x27;t know of any instances where rent control didn&#x27;t affect mobility.  Are you considering the effect on immigration and wages in other cities?  If they didn&#x27;t affect mobility, then almost by definition they had no effect whatsoever.  They&#x27;d have to be covering such a tiny portion of the market that they can essentially be ignored, both cost and benefit.  Which makes them a waste of bureaucracy.')
