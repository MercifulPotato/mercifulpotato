After 3 years (used to be 2 years up until very recently) a worker has to be moved to a permanent contract. That makes firing a person very difficult.<p>&gt; when they can boot you out for free<p>You can&#x27;t really. It&#x27;s extremely difficult and no lawyer can magically change the fact that the culture and the courts are in favor of the worker, not the employer.<p>Now the laws might change a bit, making the terms of termination a bit easier for the employer in the future (we&#x27;ll see what the next government brings), but in general I expect it to still be quite difficult. So it may be easier to pay the employee 30K extra compensation to let him go then trying a game of psychological torture. \nAnd if that sounds unreal to you, know that in the Netherlands employees can get paid up to 2 years if they have a nervous breakdown. And nervous breakdown is quite common culturally. So employees have dirty tricks of their own if the employer wants to play dirty.<p>Now of course, there are obvious disadvantages to this approach, not necessarily for the employer actually. The employer can protect himself by simply not hiring anyone for more than a couple of years, making &quot;flex work&quot; a real problem in NL. But yes, firing could be hard and I&#x27;d be surprised if it&#x27;s much different in Germany&#x2F;France etc.')
