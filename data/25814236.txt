Item(by='qwerty456127', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610913036, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25814158, text='I used MacBook Air 2013 (which was not mine) a lot and appreciate how portable (and durable) it is very much. This is exactly why I feel like buying a MacBook perhaps. But it already is perfect and I certainly don&#x27;t want it to be even more thin. I actually just want a MacBook Air 2013 with better CPU&#x2F;RAM&#x2F;SSD&#x2F;GPU specs and a Thunderbolt 4 port added to the those already there.<p>As I have emphasized the difference between USB-C and USB-A is just some millimetres and this doesn&#x27;t make a valuable difference. Of course I would appreciate the difference if it was a centimetre or more.')
