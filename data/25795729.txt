Yes, I am not using my words well as English is not my native or languages I use often.  My apologies.<p>&gt;I know that you want to have an attitude where you are indignant that I am minimizing genocide and war<p>No.<p>I re-read your original message. Your examples in some can be prevented by interrupting specific actions, as you describe it.  \nIndeed speech, clothing, ritual, and any other behavior can be interrupted.  For the OP, how would s&#x2F;he interrupt being Asian?<p>&gt;people do not choose to die for their beliefs; rather, they choose to take certain actions, and then their killers choose to kill them because of those actions<p>What is the substantive difference? I am also uncertain on &quot;kill them because of those actions&quot;, or more precisely I do not believe there is a way for making such nuanced distinction.  Looking through the list of genocides, I am hard pressed to find a set of actions that could have been interrupted to prevent death.  At State level, maybe.<p>&gt; This suggests that our morality needs to not just account for making the choice to &quot;die for what you believe in&quot;, but also the choice to kill for what you believe in.<p>I had no disagreement with this statement in your first post, which is why I did not comment to it.<p>&gt;concentration camps on our southern border<p>I do not know what country you live in.<p>&gt;I don&#x27;t know exactly what your point is<p>My original post was in response to describing the current willingness to &#x27;&quot;care&quot; about politics&#x27; but not to &quot;die for&quot; or &quot;kill for&quot;.<p>(As part of the &quot;kill for&quot;, I am certain neither of us are advocating murderous rampage, but more like a para-&#x2F;military action to liberate.)<p>Again, appreciate your responses.')
