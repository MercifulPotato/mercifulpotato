What you&#x27;re seeing is the world change before your eyes.<p>Feel free to refer back to this comment in a year or two.<p>E-commerce is sitting at 15-20% of all retail, it will almost certainly go to 50% this decade if not higher - it&#x27;s inevitable.<p>Value is more than revenue or profit and P&#x2F;E ratios largely don&#x27;t matter and haven&#x27;t for a long time. Competitive positioning, long term leverage, and other things that you can&#x27;t easily price matter just as much. This is about total and utter dominance in a sector - just look at the investments Shopify is making in delivering capital to small businesses or building out a fulfillment pipeline.<p>Amazon&#x27;s P&#x2F;E ratio has been at or over 100 for the last 20 years. It was at 300 in 2012 (would you have bought then?). If you looked at that and that was the basis for not investing, you are using outdated views to invest. These companies are different and it&#x27;s worth figuring out why.')
