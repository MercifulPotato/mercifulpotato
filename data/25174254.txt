I&#x27;d suspect that smaller keyboards would be better for children.<p>&gt; 2. Get a smaller one for yourself, and assume the risk of increased mistakes when performing on someone else&#x27;s full size.<p>Given that the current size is too big for <i>most people</i>, maybe we&#x27;d converge to the medium size suggested eventually in a perfect world.')
