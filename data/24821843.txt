This is both problematic because these languages don’t provide first class support to remove unwanted features, and because huge amounts of existing code will use patterns you’re hoping to excise. In order to successfully do this you have to do a huge amount of both linting and dependency checking, and the resulting requirement that you not use any existing libraries makes using Result in C++ about as hard as doing a progressive rewrite into Rust.')
