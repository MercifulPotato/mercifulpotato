A subscription buys you updates and support. RHEL itself is free.<p>That&#x27;s true in a literal-but-useless sense. Developers-RHEL might be bit-identical to real-RHEL at some dates, but as a <i>product</i> it&#x27;s of course very very different due to lack of interim updates. And that&#x27;s aside of the smaller speedbumps of registration and having to involve Legal if you want to run in a company.<p>&gt; In addition, considering that almost all of Red Hat&#x27;s products are &quot;upstream first&quot;, branding is generally a single additional RPM which changes some colors. It is _not_ hard to rebrand RHEL. [...] The &quot;expensive&quot; part of building an EL8 clone is standing up a bunch of Koji builders. That isn&#x27;t necessary either, strictly. It just makes &quot;turn this SRPM into an RPM and combine it with a bunch of others into a temporary repo we can dogfood&#x2F;release&quot; easier. As always, it comes down to cost.<p>I don&#x27;t know how true that is, the CentOS wiki makes it sound like like the debranding part is non-trivial&#x2F;manual labour intensive. So according to you the main bottleneck is hardware &#x2F; buildservers? If that&#x27;s true, one wonders why  even the minor CentOS 8.x releases lag RHEL 8.x by 4 to 6 weeks.<p>I guess we&#x27;ll get to see it soon, with Rocky Linux development.<p>&gt; The problem with this, broadly, is that the &quot;community&quot; is comprised of a lot of Red Hat-employed engineers. This idea that Linux is a bunch of &quot;community&quot; people that RH&#x2F;IBM&#x2F;whomever siphon off is completely fallacious. [...]<p>Sure, I largely believe the long-running narrative that a lot of core Linux development is paid&#x2F;done by Red Hat, and that most other distros, including Debian&#x2F;Ubuntu are free-riding to some extend. That&#x27;s why I not really behind the cheering for Rocky, and think it&#x27;s fairer in the end to either pay up, or roll up the sleeves and do a real _community_ enterprise OS based on Debian instead of cloning RHEL.<p>&gt; What customers values is indemnity and the ability to point their finger at someone external, plus normal stuff like a security response team and responsible+timely disclosure during major CVEs.<p>The first part might be true of RHEL customers, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s true for CentOS customers. The customer base is of course diverse, but my guess is that for a very large part of the (CentOS, not RHEL) users, objections to moving to Debian&#x2F;Ubuntu are practical (legacy&#x2F;switching costs, maybe followed by maybe proprietary software support), much more than principled&#x2F;legal.')
