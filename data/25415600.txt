And this particular question is great timing for me, so I hope you don&#x27;t mind me doing a bit of market research and get your feedback on a few things.<p>- Is this for personal domains or commercial?<p>- Are the clients &#x27;sensitive&#x27; or do you want to protect PII out of principle?<p>- Do you expect to pay a premium (compared to larger providers) for client privacy?<p>- For records that have a distribution strategy like round robin or balanced by load, do you expect a client to receive the same result on subsequent requests?<p>- Is it acceptable to keep (for a record&#x27;s TTL) a hash the client&#x27;s subnet and the response for the purposes of only returning consistent records, or do you consider this another flavour of tracking client IPs?<p>- How valuable are metrics&#x2F;reporting do you? Is reporting query volume at the ASN or country level enough? Too much?<p>Thanks.')
