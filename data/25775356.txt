By deciding on what acts are shown, what actors are shown, where the camera is placed, what zoom level is chosen, etc. the creators exhibit no less opinion than any other author.<p>Viewed via a historical lens, the kind of pornography being created and consumed in a society can be very indicative of that society&#x27;s values and morals, and possibly quite influential in its turn.')
