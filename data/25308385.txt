If I just called prion disease &quot;contagious alzheimer&#x27;s&quot;... You&#x27;d probably be more scared of ebola, because the way that it kills you is more painful, and you&#x27;re going to be isolated, so you will die alone except for by people in spacesuits, with the only major difference being that the prion diseases are currently incurable.  But if an agent is being successfully weaponized, infrastructure for curing more conventional conditions would be stressed to the point where you would be likewise incurable (we were stressed in many places by COVID-19 and outside of the risk that you go critical, that is very much not a scary condition for a huge chunk even of people that get it).')
