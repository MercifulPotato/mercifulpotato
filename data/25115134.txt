Which would require youtube-dl to file a counter-notice, and then to wait some amount of time for the original complainer to respond, before reinstating the content.<p>I think there are few if any major other hosts who would have done this -- although perhaps with the example set here, more will going forward?<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t totally understand how you can get away with being as protective of the person receiving a takedown notice (in this case developer) as github has been, under the DMCA. It is unusual.<p>Compare for instance to gitlab.com&#x27;s DMCA workflow. (Which it is amazingly awesome that gitlab has all their policies&#x2F;workflows like this public and transparent, which github does not, true!).  Following this workflow, youtube-dl would still be down, until&#x2F;unless &quot;there was a valid counter-notice and no response has been received from the plaintiff within 10 days of the counter-notice being forwarded&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.gitlab.com&#x2F;handbook&#x2F;engineering&#x2F;security&#x2F;operations&#x2F;trustandsafety&#x2F;dmca-removal-requests.html#taking-action" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;about.gitlab.com&#x2F;handbook&#x2F;engineering&#x2F;security&#x2F;opera...</a><p>So yes, I would say that github has already acted in a way to stand up for developers, in reinstating youtube-dl already, and in changing their policies for the future further. Even in their present actions, they seem to be really pushing at DMCA safe harbor allowances.')
