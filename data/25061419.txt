Studies all prove that.  Called me a liar.<p>Well started dealing with other specialist because I was having severe problems due to this medication.<p>Vascular and others all gave me warnings as they had been seeing a lot of problems.\nI found out the studies were done mostly in China, and were suspect.<p>Hematologist let me know I wasnâ€™t allowed to come in because I wanted to switch.   Mocked me for looking things up.<p>I had not taken it in 3 days and was already losing vision. So waiting months for another practice was a death sentence.<p>That was my breaking point.   Stopped being Mr. polite.<p>First time I ever screamed and threatened  a lawsuit.<p>Got my new medication. Life got better.<p>Also yeah antibiotics definitely can have a powerful effect.<p>Oddly I was diagnosed correctly due to how I responded to certain antibiotics.')
