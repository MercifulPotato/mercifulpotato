It&#x27;s a very hard step to take.<p>Makes me think of a side project I&#x27;ve been poking at off and on for a little while. I had the same idea you did of having a single text file to store a bunch of notes. (which was inspired by a comment from someone who said they&#x27;ve been managing notes for years using a single txt file through Windows Notepad or something along that line) Though mine is more inspired by trying to do that while also giving the capability to do Zettelkasten-style note management versus sticky notes.<p>The only reason I haven&#x27;t completed mine is because I got &quot;stuck&quot; trying to code a parser that could in-place patch the AST and visual representation of the text instead of re-parsing an entire note on every character change. (at least for me, this has been extremely hard to figure out how to do correctly. Feels like an infinite number of corner cases to figure out somehow. Especially since I&#x27;m self-limiting to a pure plain text representation of everything, because I want the file to be grep-able and not lock someone into a specific UI) I find modern-day delays in UI interactions unacceptable, so I want to make something where even if you were to put an entire novel into a note with a bunch of different special elements in it that would need to be parsed, (and considering I want to offer the capability to turn a piece of text into a &quot;comment&quot; which is a clickable link to another note so if you ARE writing a novel you can still leave notes for yourself on things to improve) there would be zero delays when actively typing.')
