A big part of DD is QoE and there wasn&#x27;t much to audit there. This was a deal term that reduced any walkaway risk.<p>&gt; I have no idea how they managed to get the investors to walk with nothing, when the founders walked away with so much.<p>Deal flow and it&#x27;s not worth their time. Be nice to successfully exited founders and they&#x27;ll speak your praises for eternity. General Catalyst wants $1B exits. If the founder leads to dealflow that brings that in, the $800k will be an easy ROI.')
