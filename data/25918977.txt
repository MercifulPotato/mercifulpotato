They are given a lot of latitude in how they run elections, limited by state law and state constitution edits that are also controlled by state legislatures. State courts can only evaluate wrong doing based on those rules, laws, and such, if they are messed up, the courts can&#x27;t fix them unilaterally.<p>&gt; You can&#x27;t have video of people walking in with their outside clothes, without going through the processes and then say, &quot;You have to prove that it contaminated the room.&quot; You don&#x27;t; it&#x27;s enough to show the process was tainted.<p>That is not how law works in the USA or any country that I&#x27;m aware of. You have to prove that wrong doing occurred, not prove that wrong doing did not occur. The burden of proof is always on the accuser, not the defendant. Science works the same way (something is a theory if it can&#x27;t be disproven, not if it can be proven that it can&#x27;t be disproven).')
