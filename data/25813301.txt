I am a Linux person but if I squint hard enough I can use the Mac OS (with some swearing weaved in). But I cannot use that terrible keyboard.  Why do I need key combos for page up&#x2F;down? Why are they useless buttons like that top squiggle on the top left but no page up&#x2F;down buttons (there is space for them). Why some things are Cmd+ and some are Ctrl+? Why no key travel?')
