We all know this.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s heavily taking advantage of the moment.&quot; Umm yes. Regardless of whether you are a republican or a democrat, storming capitol hill during an election recount diminishes the validity of either party and the country as a whole. This country is the center for innovation and generally the most sought after democracy in the world. The entire world is watching. Taking advantage of the moment is exactly what he is doing. If you read about coups in the past there was never an explicit sentence that drew the line between now I am and evil dictator and now I am not. It was building an army of radicalized supporters, patriots, if you will while government officials around the person in power dropped like flies as things escalated much like what is happening now. We do not need to repeat history to say we proved he did it because by that time it will be too late.<p>It is clear for months trump has been warned of how this kind of inflammatory behavior will impact the people at large and potentially radicalize either side and he has been nothing but inflammatory.<p>If he really cared about securing democracy at large as opposed to his own power in office he would be taking extra precautions at this point.<p>He is doing the opposite.<p>I get what you mean though. Unfortunately both sides have significant radicalized sides now. And looting storming buildings and murdering law enforcement and lighting fire to buildings has been normalized now by both sides in 2020.<p>My parents are trumpers in the deep south and these are the things they have said to me in the past couple of days:<p>Mark Zuckerberg is an abusive dictator not Trump.<p>My mother condescendingly whispered to me poor thing noone told me all the protestors were antifa who knew if they didn&#x27;t storm the building and steal the ballots that trump would win. So they were all actually secret democrats.<p>They both believe trump is the rightful president for the next term.')
