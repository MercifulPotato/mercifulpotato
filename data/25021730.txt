Item(by='barumi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604797650, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25021325, text='&gt; You read the volume of news I do day after day and you’ll find some humor in how the common vocabulary morphs in unison across the channels, and it’s notable when it happens. “Widespread fraud” is right there with “mostly peaceful”.<p>I don&#x27;t know what you were trying to say, but you said nothing if substance. It reads like a red herring that desperately tries to conflate the world begging the Trump campaign to substantiate any of their myriad of claims regarding their so-called massive nation-wide wave of voter fraud, which succeeded their initial absurd and ridiculous announcement of having won the election, with other propaganda tropes.<p>&gt; But again, why spend your time arguing that there’s nothing to see here rather than advocating for improving the transactional integrity of the voting process?<p>The only problems that can be fixed are those which exist in the realm of reality.<p>Where is the massive wave of voter fraud that supposedly robbed Trump of his election? If that problem really exists, shouldn&#x27;t you be worried about getting to know the evidence of its existence in order to ensure the same thing doesn&#x27;t happen again?<p>Because otherwise these wild election fraud claims jus sound like a desperate red herring fabricated by a childish irresponsible man who decided to throw a tantrum instead of admitting defeat.')
