I think it&#x27;s increasingly rare to find companies that can&#x27;t see that value in code reviews.<p>What I&#x27;d like to see instead is some surveys of companies doing reviews to find out what&#x27;s hard. What parts go well, what parts to they struggle with.<p>For example, at my past employer, we tried to pull in a privacy expert on any privacy sensitive changes and a security expert on any security related change. But this was really hard for two reasons. First, it&#x27;s often not obvious that what you&#x27;re doing is security&#x2F;privacy related and probably the worst f-ups will be the one where you didn&#x27;t mean to do anything security&#x2F;privacy related. Second, it was hard to scale these &quot;experts&quot; who were domain experts but not an expert in the codebase.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are many many other things teams find hard and I think that&#x27;s really interesting to dig into.')
