All starch diets bring people to healthy weights. I&#x27;ve been doing (mostly) ketosis for years and I still know his all potato diet can work for weight loss. It&#x27;s just going to be a very… tasteless… few weeks&#x2F;months. Your poop is going to be unpleasant too.<p>It&#x27;s always interesting to me that people can succeed on extreme diets like this rather than adjust their lifestyles to whole food home cooked healthy eating. Like almost no one can tolerate ketosis but they can do extreme diets like day+ fasting or fad diets.<p>The shower thing is completely off base but whatever, this is all extreme. No salt &#x2F; olive oil on the potatoes is off base too, there&#x27;s no reason the diet needs to be that boring.')
