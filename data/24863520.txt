Do you not realize that &quot;less of it&quot; is still a whole hell of a lot of web? Take a look at Netsurf: 13 years of development and half a million lines of C and it&#x27;s probably the most advanced rendering engine after the big three. And yet, one of my websites, sourcehut.org, renders like this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;l.sr.ht&#x2F;_2pv.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;l.sr.ht&#x2F;_2pv.png</a><p>On WebEngine, it <i>should</i> look like this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;l.sr.ht&#x2F;bSdI.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;l.sr.ht&#x2F;bSdI.png</a><p>And this is one of the most conservative websites on the modern internet. The problem with using the web, but less of it, is that the web is still <i>incredibly complicated</i> and even conservative websites require a massive engineering undertaking to render properly, and it just takes one link to a more liberal page to ruin the experience entirely.<p>Gemini is a separate, self-contained network, based on a much simpler philosophy. I wrote my Gemini client in two afternoons, and it&#x27;s already pleasant to use with <i>all</i> Gemini pages.<p>We don&#x27;t want the web, but less. We want something else entirely.')
