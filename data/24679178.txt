It sounds to me like if a broadly interconnected network was found, that would be a failure on the part of the people trying to facilitate the tax avoidance schemes - the closer to homogenous noise the graph looks, the harder it is to trace.  Based on that, I&#x27;d say that there&#x27;s no utility in trying to prove the negative, i.e., that larger networks do not exist.<p>If the people hiding their assets actually did their job well, they would expect and hope that you (as an outside analyst) would come to exactly the conclusion that you have come to.')
