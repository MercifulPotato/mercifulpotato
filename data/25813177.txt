Perhaps AWS should be more selective in what they choose to launch, but once a service is launched you should have a very compelling reason to deprecate it. This creates a positive feedback loop that AWS is safe —- in the sense that if you build on top of their services you know that they will continue to be around.<p>It makes the AWS dashboard a bit more cluttered, but if you use one of AWS’ half-baked services you know it will be around for as long as you want. Maybe you outgrow it; that’s fine. You can opt to move off, but AWS won’t force your hand.<p>There’s a ton of value in that stability. Your MySQL server running on EC2 still works today if you haven’t migrated to RDS. And if you migrate to RDS, you can be confident that it will be around until well after you’ve moved to your next job.<p>Ironically, this is related to Golang’s strong 1.X backwards compatibility guarantee. Knowing that what works today will work tomorrow has tremendous value. You don’t have to wake up and migrate everything from vendor to modules. You can build on ECS today and have confidence ECS will be around tomorrow.')
