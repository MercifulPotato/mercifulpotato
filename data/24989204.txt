You get 51% of the party that controls 51% of the legislature, your measure passes.<p>Then support for it increases because that&#x27;s what it was doing to begin with, which was how it got to 51% of 51% from whatever smaller amount of support it had before it passed.<p>If you require a higher bar to change the law, it takes longer. But change inevitably still happens.<p>Slavery wasn&#x27;t doomed by voting, it was doomed by economics. Before the industrial revolution, working on a plantation (essentially serfdom) compared favorably with your other alternatives, which typically consisted of starving to death in the wilderness. After the industrial revolution, you could run away to a city and get a job in a factory, which is what everybody started doing and the whole system started to disintegrate.<p>And it was the same thing for women&#x27;s suffrage. It came about following economic and social changes that essentially made it inevitable in a modern society. It would have happened anyway. It <i>did</i> happen anyway, despite being passed by constitutional amendment in the US, which has a supermajority requirement for enactment.<p>By contrast, ill-conceived ideas that aren&#x27;t inevitable would die when they go out of fashion without ever being implemented.')
