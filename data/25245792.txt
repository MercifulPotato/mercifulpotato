If they really care about us people, they must either release Windows subsystem for Linux&#x2F;MacOS or contribute to wine to make it fully windows compatible.<p>Solely benefitting off Open Source Projects adding those to their closed system is not so nice imo , they must do it in other direction too.<p>Just imagine frustration to dualboot windows just because of one application which runs only in Windows.<p>On other hand, Just imagine the application running perfectly in subsystem in Linux&#x2F;MacOS without any dual boot. Many wouldn&#x27;t bother even if it&#x27;s paid application imo.')
