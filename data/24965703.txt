Yes, Zoom does it better, but it&#x27;s _still_ an excellent and interesting engineering accomplishment.<p>I&#x27;ve always wondered what proportion of modern real-time video effects rely on ML vs. classical image processing; this not only answers that question, but provides details down to the level of model architecture and the final latency and IOU benchmarks.<p>Of course I&#x27;d be <i>more</i> interested to read how Zoom manages to do even better, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath for them to publish those details.')
