But it strikes me no one ever actually changes their mind.  They just yell at each other till they move on to another hill to yell from.<p>It&#x27;s all so tiring, it&#x27;s like when I used to watch some friends do prep for school debates.  They&#x27;re just practicing arguing, the topic itself is secondary to the argument.<p>I&#x27;m probably too cynical, but I also know every time I try to have a real discussion online, it ends badly.')
