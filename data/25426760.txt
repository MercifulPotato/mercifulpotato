You seem to be suggesting that this was inappropriate though, yes?<p>&gt; Furthermore, the review process does not involve anonymous review. And no similar process does.<p>Nope. I&#x27;m in an SV company similar to two FAANGs and it totally does. If you submit a paper and want the company to sponsor it, you&#x27;d better believe it does. Before your manager lets you even start the process on work time they&#x27;ll have you meet with others above you to review the idea, and it goes to both your team&#x27;s architecture review board (in engineering) and an adjacent team&#x27;s review board. The reviewers aren&#x27;t anonymous, quite, because you can look at who&#x27;s in the groups, but they boil the requests down and present it as a list, not a set of feedback. You can ask to have anything reviewed, because it&#x27;s not a one-and-done process. Some people sail through, others do it as an iterative process. And then legal looks at <i>everything</i> and they insist on seeing the final release version, even if you only tweaked a comma.<p>Of course they&#x27;re stringent though, this is a new project you&#x27;re proposing to release with their name on it, made in lieu of your other job.<p>&gt; This was not scientific peer review: no scientific process has peer reviewers from one&#x27;s own institution.<p>Generally your research institution, in your subfield, won&#x27;t have more than 5-10 actual peers and they&#x27;re all assumed to know you and probably your work. So it&#x27;s not that it can&#x27;t be, it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s usually not useful.<p>&gt; almost certainly avoiding reviewers from the same institution specifically to avoid conflicts of interest.<p>Google has multiple interests. They&#x27;re very concerned with their reputation and even if the paper didn&#x27;t need more peer review (which it seems to) they clearly think it needed a second round of review.<p>&gt; If I made a code review, a coworker approved it, and my skip-manager said &quot;This was reverted because some people said we couldn&#x27;t ship it, but I&#x27;m not telling you who,&quot; I&#x27;d feel entirely justified in objecting.<p>You&#x27;d be fine if you just said you disagreed for technical reasons, but if you actually objected and <i>released it yourself over objection</i> you&#x27;d be escorted out within minutes and very likely charged with unauthorized use of the work resources to do so.<p>They pay your salary. This job is about your work product, not your feeling of entitlement. Want academic freedom, separate it from your 9-5.')
