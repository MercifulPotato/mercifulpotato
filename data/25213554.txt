One of the first things you learn while doing TypeScript is that interfaces don&#x27;t exist after compile time. So in general, it&#x27;s better to write interfaces and use plain-old-objects than to use `class`, which generates real JavaScript code.<p>Within reason, of course. Classes are still useful.
