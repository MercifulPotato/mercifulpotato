The question is whether those particles decay on their own, make their way into our food supplies, and how toxic are they.<p>I don&#x27;t know the quantitative answers to any of these. But I would hazard that wood decays fast; and glass and concrete particles are inert, very similar to soil and not very harmful in the amounts they make into our food supplies.<p>Plastics on the other hand, don&#x27;t decay, float in water (so easier to spread) and empirically make it into our food supplies. The fear is that they are carcinogenic and cause unwanted hormonal changes.')
