The global\npandemic not only brought about a public health\ncrisis but also caused a contraction of economic\nactivity at an unprecedented pace. Initially, the\npandemic reduced consumer spending, slowed\nmanufacturing production, and led to widespread\nbusiness closures. The unemployment rate surged\nfrom 3.5 percent in February to a record high of\nnearly 15 percent in April. Since then, extraordinary\nmeasures undertaken by policymakers have\nsucceeded in arresting the decline in economic\nconditions, initiating a recovery and lowering the\nunemployment rate to 7.9 percent as of September.\nHowever, a protracted virus outbreak poses\ndownside risks that can slow the recovery and even\nprolong the economic downturn.&quot;<p>...<p>&quot;With cash flows impaired due to the COVID-19\npandemic, many businesses may be challenged to\nservice their debt. Since March, nearly $2 trillion in\nnonfinancial corporate debt has been downgraded,\nand default rates on leveraged loans and corporate\nbonds have increased considerably. The growing\nnumber of bankruptcy filings could stress resources\nat courts and make it harder for firms to obtain\ncritical debtor-in-possession financing. It could also\nprevent many firms from restructuring their debt\nin a timely fashion, potentially forcing them into\nliquidation.&quot;<p>...<p>&quot;Money market funds (MMFs) offer shareholders\nredemptions on a daily basis while holding many\nshort-term assets that are less liquid, especially in\ntimes of stress. Stresses on prime and tax-exempt\nmoney funds in March revealed continued structural\nvulnerabilities, which led to increased redemptions\nand, in turn, likely contributed to the stress in\nSTFMs. Among institutional and retail prime MMFs,\noutflows as a percentage of fund assets exceeded\nthat of the September 2008 crisis. Outflows abated\nafter the Federal Reserve announced support for the\nCP market and MMFs.&quot;<p>...')
