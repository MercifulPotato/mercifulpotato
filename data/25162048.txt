My setup is that I have half of my external monitor with VSCode (the other half is the browser) and most of the times three columns in there - folder structure and two files on a split screen.<p>I compared Iosevka with the 3 others just as narrow fonts (Inconsolata, Nanum Gothic Coding, and Ubuntu Mono). Iosevka won for me because it is taller or bolder than the others (felt more easily readable in small fonts for me), but also because it is more unique in its shape compared to regular reading fonts — the “o” is more squared for example.<p>Thanks for your comment! I will change to it just now!')
