For low traffic, running them through ffmpeg and dropping a &lt;video&gt; tag works pretty well. For higher traffic, I think something like BunnyCDN can be used for a reasonable cost.<p>But the technology isn&#x27;t the problem. The problem is nobody is going to use your platform. We need to decouple discovery from hosting. We need a slick, simple aggregator that lets people submit video URLs from multiple platforms, then handles recommendations. If your video has an equal chance of blowing up regardless of where it&#x27;s hosted, it opens the door for competition with YouTube.')
