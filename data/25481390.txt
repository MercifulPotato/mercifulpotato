Yes, it does portrait many of the things that happen to people with early-onset dementia, but what it left out, is often the insight on what the disease has on the people around them, something that Alice in the movie has until almost the end of the movie. I also feel that the movie ended far to early.<p>Also in the cases that it is not running in a family (which is about half of the cases), it often takes years before a diagnoses is made. Often, people suffer from a burn-out years before the final diagnosis is made. Often, they show major behavioral changes, before they begin to show the first visible changes. In the six years before the diagnoses was made, my wife, who did not originate from my home country, managed to improve her fluency in the national language.')
