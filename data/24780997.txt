But in late 2017, my bitcoin holdings were going for nearly $20k per, so I decided to buy a pimped out Tesla Model S, and of course I think it looked and looks very nice, but again, I thought the 1996 and 2006 Saturns I had previously bought looked pretty nice too.<p>Question, if I may: do you think the Tesla Model S was in good taste when it came out in 2012?  I believe that there&#x27;s only been one or two relatively small exterior design refreshes since.<p>Thanks!')
