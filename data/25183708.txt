Doubtful, if you get fired, you&#x27;re rich. If your asked to work extra hard, you don&#x27;t, because you&#x27;re rich.<p>If you&#x27;re not rich, you can&#x27;t get fired: you&#x27;d lose your income, foreclosure, difficulty feeding your family, no retirement savings, can&#x27;t afford to fix your car, lose your healthcare, etc. You can&#x27;t say no.<p>Debt is the primary driver of the economy in this country and the major reason why people are unhappy. They buy things they can&#x27;t afford with money they don&#x27;t have because of marketing and then are trapped in their jobs and treated like garbage.')
