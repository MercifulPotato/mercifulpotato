Where I am none of the local candidates for things like city council, school board, etc. are on TV. Some yard signs, maybe a public forum for those interested enough to show up, but mainly they answer a set of questions and their answers get published by the local paper. That&#x27;s the only way I know anything at all about who is running for these local offices.')
