There is no notion of &quot;correctness&quot; for the pyramids of Egypt, the dykes of the Netherlands, Milan Cathedral, or the world economy and yet those huge-scale systems all function.<p>Wow, couldn&#x27;t disagree with this more, at least on your examples of civil engineering (buildings, dikes).  There are testable, comprehensive physical principles that govern whether any of these engineered products function in their most fundamentally-intended ways.  This is the reason most buildings are resilient and don&#x27;t collapse under load, or that dams keep water from flowing uncontrolled.  You can debate &quot;correctness&quot; in the sense of the purpose the product serves, but there is the principle of correctness of construction which your civil engineering examples (and anything truly engineered) satisfy.  Correctness in construction is not subjective.')
