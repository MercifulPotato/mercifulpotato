I can see how a phone holder with a magnetic charging cable can give similar functionality, with the addition that the home charger would also need to be magnetic so that there is no need to plug and unplug the adaptor. Also, I wonder how finicky aligning the magnetic connection would be in a phone holder -- it&#x27;s has not been a problem with my wireless charger: either the wireless charger in my phone holder has pretty wide tolerances in alignment, or the holding clips were well designed, as I have not had any instances where it did not align and charge.')
