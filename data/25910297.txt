You can just pre-program the machine to pick a candidate randomly every few votes and you skew the election. Do it after the first few votes to give you a distribution so as to only do it between the major candidates and not inflate any marginal runners. Do it only on machines in locations that vote against your preferred candidate and you skew to your candidate. If there are no paper receipts you just get away with it. If there are you can still attack democracy itself by sowing a bunch of doubt in the election. Electronic voting is a really poor idea. There&#x27;s no credible evidence the US election was stolen but the way it&#x27;s ran is appalling and makes this kind of mistrust easy, which is a very important failure mode as was evident this time around.<p>We had an election here yesterday. Each voter just filled in a pre-printed paper and dropped it into a box. COVID restrictions meant we had up to 10 minute queues depending on time of day, normally it&#x27;s much faster. Each polling table is self-contained and had less than 1000 votes to count at the end of the day. They&#x27;re just setup in school buildings on a Sunday when they&#x27;d otherwise be empty. Two hours after the election almost all of them had counted their votes, reported them centrally and that was available on a simple website anyone can see. There will be a central recount in a few days as a double check. It never finds any differences. Each of these polling tables is staffed with 5 or 6 people that double check what each of them is doing and makes it so there&#x27;s a lot of people involved in the election further increasing the trust of the population in the process, because a not insignificant part of them take part. The scaling of the process is embarrassingly parallel so is workable for any size of country or election. I don&#x27;t get why anyone would want to go through all the trouble of inventing these complex technology solutions to a non-problem that then create these huge attack vectors not only to actually do something nefarious but even more importantly to convince people that that has happened and rile up a mob.')
