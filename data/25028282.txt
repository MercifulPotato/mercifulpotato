I care about politics and about the policies of the society in which I live.  But I have removed every bit of political media and news from my life and my daily mood and outlook on life has increased dramatically.  People will say yeah, because &quot;ignorance is bliss&quot;.  I&#x27;m not ignorant.  I know what&#x27;s going on in the world.  I just choose not to be inundated in it all the time.  The news, even (maybe especially) local news, can never make you feel good.  It will only ever make you feel bad, or scared, or worried, or confused, or disheartened.')
