Super simple.<p>That is not actually true. Most people in war zone are civilians without weapons. The survival depends a lot on navigating power structures and negotiating. And luck. But it is not simple and everyone speculates.<p>&gt; When your mother or sister or daughter has been raped and you have to protect her for being raped or killed?<p>How exactly would you protect them? You don&#x27;t. Cause I had relatives survive war and read memoirs from civilians and it was more that everyone was looking for source of income. If males had to join army or guerilla (or died), then it is women trying to survive and trying to care for those who stayed (children, old, themselves). And that is not simple.<p>&gt; Are you going to study when you don&#x27;t know where your family is?<p>Hardly. But school systems in war countries and occupied countries do somehow move on, as malfunctioning as they are. People leave them to search for income and food. People clinge on activites too.<p>Mental health issues get worst under those conditions. The conflicts between people escalate while everyone being even more dependent on each other. People live in cramped conditions. And none of that is simple. Living in one household with mentally ill or abusive relative you would normally cut off is opposite of simple.<p>&gt; When they go after you because you abandoned guerrilla (or the army)?<p>Majority are civilians.')
