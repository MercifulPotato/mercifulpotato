As you are trying to point out, I think, it&#x27;s not the act of consumption that is problematic, but the process of getting the animal flesh to your mouth. My biggest problem with the current system is the welfare of animals, not the fact that someone is chewing <i>this</i> bit of matter rather than <i>that</i> piece of matter.<p>I am trying to point out that the scenario of treating animals well while desiring to consume them is counter to maintaining a system of care. There is also something problematic with ending a life that is full of enjoyment short, just so that some other individuals have a meal that is slightly different than another (similarly-tasty) meal.<p>I hope all these discussions will become obsolete &#x2F; moot when meat alternatives become more-available and cheaper.<p>We on HN likely have more resources to choose; I hope that more of us choose less meat.')
