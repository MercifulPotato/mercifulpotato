You&#x27;re only allowed to drive at the age of 18, so a bicycle is how you get around as a teenager. It helps that those are dense countries so you usually don&#x27;t have to cycle far to get to school&#x2F;friends&#x2F;city.<p>Because most of us grow up that way, later in life, when we drive a car, we have the proper respect for bicycle riders. We drive slower when we overtake them, we looks in our mirrors before taking a turn.<p>good infrastructure helps too, but from having lived in the US and Europe, I think it&#x27;s largely a cultural thing.')
