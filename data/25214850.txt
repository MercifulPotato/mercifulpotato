He said as much on camera: on the pitch he was fine, “beyond the midfield line I was the commander in chief”; it was off the pitch that he struggled and needed coke. He started sniffing in Barcelona, where he didn’t gel with the team off the pitch and probably felt lonely and restless, but his football was already fantastic. Without the addiction he would have had a longer career, and likely would have carried Argentina in ‘94 too.<p>I hated his guts as a kid because of 1990 (another hand of god, and the feeling he took from Baggio and Schillaci’s Italy a final that was our god-given right), but I’ve come to realize later that he was one of the last great footballers to be (flawed) men first and athletes second. The way he spoke of guilt and regret, his embarrassingly public mistakes... they made him more real than a robotic superman like Cristiano Ronaldo will ever be. And some of his highlight reels are ridiculous.')
