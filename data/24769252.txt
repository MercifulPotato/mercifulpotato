Item(by='toast0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602617194, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24767724, text='&gt; We need signal that goes farther, not faster.<p>5G can potentially help with that when deployed on existing spectrum, because increased transmission rates reduces airtime utilization, and some cells adjust their range based on utilization. It might not help much, depending on current utilization and terrain and what not, but it&#x27;ll probably help some, and I imagine carriers will do gradual deployments of that to lower density areas when there&#x27;s enough handsets that support it and base station equipment is cost reduced enough. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to be fast, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll be on the long, long time scale.<p>Of course, 5G on the new high frequency spectrum is unlikely to be useful in low density areas, and is unlikely to be deployed. Also, I think AT&amp;T has plans to declare their LTE coverage to be 5G :P')
