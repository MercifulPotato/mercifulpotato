I&#x27;ve soldered pins A0 and GND to that board and used the internal pull-up resistor of the ATmega32u4 on pin A0.  When you hit the button, a sequence of keystrokes is sent over a USB HID interface to the computer.  The keystrokes depend on the operating system so when I compile the firmware, it&#x27;s OS dependent.')
