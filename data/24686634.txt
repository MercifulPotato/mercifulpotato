It most certainly <i>does</i> &quot;have something to do with timing&quot; in that it lets you do I&#x2F;O <i>immediately</i>, without polling or incurring system timer interrupt delays... which is precisely what his description of the problem required. It&#x27;s kind of bizarre to see you trying to interject into it to argue with me as if you know his situation better than himself while even contradicting his descriptions in the process. I feel like the discussion already concluded on that topic. I&#x27;ll leave this as my last comment here.')
