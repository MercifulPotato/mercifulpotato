It seems to trump eye candy and (I hate to admit) even quality.<p>Basically, even if the quality is bad, and the interface spartan; if the workflow is smooth and intuitive (not “dumb,”  but grokkable), then the project has a real chance for success.<p>Simplicity is often mistaken for usability. In my experience, they are not necessarily analogous. If anyone has ever used a Japanese train schedule, they know that it’s possible to present a complex system in a fashion that, after “training,” becomes intuitive.<p>It seems that the “sweet spot” is an interface that may not be immediately apparent, but “gets out of the way,” once the user gets going.')
