Item(by='themodelplumber', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609631541, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25617653, text='I usually stream a lecture, a few favorite TV shows on random playlists, some thriller or action movies, and maybe a favorite Youtuber. The scripts I use for this really randomize things into 200+ item playlists per window, so I can quickly flip through anything I don&#x27;t want to watch right now.<p>IMO distraction and healthy prospective activity (stimulation, personal interest, cool new stuff) have become tragically intertwined and confused.<p>To me, distraction in the negative sense is the byproduct of a lack of what I call the &quot;three C&#x27;s&quot;, comfort, clarity, and confidence. Once I&#x27;m sailing through the day productively, singleminded focus is now a problem that can easily turn into productivity exhaustion. The streams help prevent this with entertaining mood support based on my core interests. (I wish everything I had to do at work was based on my core interests!)<p>BTW I don&#x27;t generally watch new material in this context. It&#x27;s usually from my favorites I&#x27;ve already seen, unless I&#x27;m ready to take a break.')
