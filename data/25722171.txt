Item(by='bigiain', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610324374, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25720074, text='&gt; but I&#x27;d frankly prefer to donate to tax-exempt orgs.<p>I would prefer to buy a new car from a &quot;tax exempt org&quot; to maximise the &quot;effectiveness to myself&quot; of my purchase.. That&#x27;s just not the way the world works though. libjpeg-turbo isn&#x27;t developed by a tax exempt org, and nothing that _is_ developed by a tax exempt or is a practical replacement for it.<p>If you want lib-jpeg to survive&#x2F;thrive, donating to The EFF or The Red Cross isn&#x27;t going to help, no matter what your personal preference for donating is.<p>(You don&#x27;t have to agree with the assumption that a single-developer open source software library should provide income to keep the developer&#x27;s bills&#x2F;rent paid. But you do not get to make demands about how that dev structures his personal finances either. If he says &quot;no more work unless more money comes in&quot;, you can choose to send him some money to help, or to allow him to freeze&#x2F;abandon the development. Arguing about his tax exempt status is just being dishonest about you choosing to not send him money. Not funding it is fine. Don&#x27;t hide behind some meaningless &#x27;effective &quot;cost&quot; to myself&#x27; excuse for not doing so. Not unless you&#x27;re prepared to set up a tax exempt foundation and guarantee him a salary from it...)')
