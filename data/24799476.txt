A plant reproducing is something the plant does.  It&#x27;s unclear whether you can be required by law to prevent it from doing its thing.  (Well, it&#x27;s actually not unclear; the supreme court says the law has that power.  The law should probably be changed, though.)<p>It would be more interesting with something with a bit more free will.  Someone will eventually patent a dog breed.  A boy dog will meet a girl dog and they&#x27;ll have dog babies.  Do you put the dog in prison for patent infringement?  Do you kill the babies?<p>All I can say is that nobody really cares about soybeans or grapes, but it will be a mess when the result is cute and fluffy.')
