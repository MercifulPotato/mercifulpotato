My point is that if I free myself from intellectual rigor and data&#x2F;evidence based claims, and allow myself to focus on emotion, vague statements, and anecdote, I can paint whatever picture I want. lots of good examples in replies about how dome of the wishy washy statements don&#x27;t really hold up - thats the point - I only mentioned spacex while leaving out the money pit that is SLS for example.<p>Ultimately the irony here is that the article itself is a pretty good example of self interest - its a bunch of the type of arguments they go after academics for making, and then uses it to try and sell their book.')
