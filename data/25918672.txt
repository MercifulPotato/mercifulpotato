They may not perfectly achieve that in all cases, but they come fairly close.  That plus bugs means that I won&#x27;t reach for option 2 unless I have <i>really</i> good reason to think I can do better.<p>That leaves using the builtins to do X safely, or not doing X.  At least that&#x27;s how it looks to me...')
