Item(by='wpietri', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609560558, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25605589, text='&gt; The primary lesson I learnt is that it doesn&#x27;t matter if you work hard.<p>I knew of one company, a pair programming shop doing the sort of financial software where bugs could get very expensive. To maximize quality, they had firm rules about all code requiring a pair, and that barring emergencies, everybody had to go home on time. It worked; they had very low bug rates.<p>They told me about a new employee they had, somebody who&#x27;d come from a company where performative overwork was valued. He&#x27;d stay until the wee hours, coding up a storm, expecting people to be impressed. In the morning, they&#x27;d thank him for his enthusiasm, revert the commit, and do the work again with proper pairing, testing, etc. I never heard what happened to the guy, but I imagine he pretty quickly unlearned his bad habits. That or he quit and went somewhere he could feed his heroism addiction.<p>In contrast, I remember a long-ago 6-month contract a major online auction company starting with e and ending with Bay. I was on some internal mailing list where I&#x27;d get promotion announcements. Every fucking one of them included a dramatic story about how the person had egregiously overworked themselves. The code was of course a giant fucking mess. It was simultaneously the result of tired idiots who never cleaned up and also the cause of so many bugs and schedule issues that people had to dramatically overwork themselves to hit arbitrary managerial deadlines.<p>It was a valuable lesson to me, the coding version of the Allegory of Long Spoons: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Allegory_of_the_long_spoons" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Allegory_of_the_long_spoons</a><p>Ever since I&#x27;ve done my best to work at places where sanity is rewarded and drama discouraged. And to bend things in that direction as I&#x27;m able.')
