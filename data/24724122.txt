I think ultimately it depends on how one views a fetus. Many (most?) libertarians think that a woman doesn&#x27;t owe a fetus the right to exist in her womb.<p>But there are some (specifically the Libertarians for Life[0]) who attempt to justify the act of abortion as a violation of the NAP. If I understand correctly, their reasoning is that human offspring are human beings regardless of their stage of development and thus terminating a pregnancy is literally killing an innocent person.<p>Personally, I think saying &quot;You aren&#x27;t pro-choice so you aren&#x27;t a libertarian,&quot; isn&#x27;t so cut and dry.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Libertarians_for_Life" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Libertarians_for_Life</a>')
