Best thing I&#x27;ve found is when facing tasks of little or no interest, think about the projects&#x2F;tasks that excite you&#x2F;you prefer that are on your list, and think of how you&#x27;ll get to those the sooner you finish the boring stuff.<p>Also, in terms of focusing, what&#x27;s helped me is to find a single, non-lyrical, instrumental, ambient track, and just put it on loop for the whole work day. It&#x27;s been easier to think&#x2F;less distracting to not hear and process language or have to find the next track that I&#x27;m in the mood for, and I believe in some way it helps my mind stay focused on my thought processes related to my work through patterns the mind makes with the looping of the track.')
