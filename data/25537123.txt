Such is life :) I&#x27;ll address each separately.<p>The misunderstanding:<p>It looks like you read me saying <i>all</i> women look for strong men and&#x2F;or that women <i>should</i> look for that. I have no interest in either. People should follow their hearts, be themselves, etc. I <i>am</i> saying that empirically, and with big individual variation, on average, that is a fact. An important fact.<p>I&#x27;m also not saying that men should pretend to be who they aren&#x27;t to get women. For one thing, they usually see right through that. But at the same time, if you don&#x27;t understand what your potential partners need from you, you&#x27;re probably not going to fulfill those needs.<p>The Taboo:<p>Saying it&#x27;s &quot;a toxic pattern&quot; to talk openly about these things is a way of saying this is a taboo topic.<p>And of course I know it&#x27;s sensitive, but I don&#x27;t think it should be. These are very important things, and they need to be talked about and understood. Even though it&#x27;s uncomfortable.')
