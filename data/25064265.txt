Item(by='TMWNN', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605137253, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25059692, text='&gt; Remember after Trump’s election it seemed like half of New York was reading The Hillbilly Elegy?<p><i>The New York Times</i> (yes, the <i>Times</i>) pointed out after Trump&#x27;s election stunned the press that (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;09&#x2F;business&#x2F;media&#x2F;media-trump-clinton.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;09&#x2F;business&#x2F;media&#x2F;media-trump...</a>)<p>&gt;Whatever the election result, you’re going to hear a lot from news executives about how they need to send their reporters out into the heart of the country, to better understand its citizenry.<p>&gt;But that will miss something fundamental. Flyover country isn’t a place, it’s a state of mind — it’s in parts of Long Island and Queens, much of Staten Island, certain neighborhoods of Miami or even Chicago. And, yes, it largely — but hardly exclusively — pertains to working-class white people.<p>In other words, it isn&#x27;t just a question of the <i>Times</i> (and the TV networks, and pretty much all of the rest of mass media) completely ignoring the rubes out in rural Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin (which all, strangely enough, unexpectedly voted for Trump), but their ignoring the residents of <i>their own city</i>, just across one bridge.<p>(Of course, as you point out, such open-mindedness didn&#x27;t last long.)')
