Other brokerages do this regardless of the security. But instead they specifically limited buying only certain securities that their hedge fund affiliates happened to have shorts in, thereby eliminating buy volume entirely and causing the stock price to go down. It&#x27;s too coincidental to ignore when there was clearly a more precedented alternative.')
