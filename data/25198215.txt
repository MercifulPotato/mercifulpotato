I find it interesting that Smoking is way down and in the conclusion it&#x27;s first as an important factor. Smoking clearly not impacting life expectancy at all.<p>In fact if you look at their data. Obesity&#x2F;Overweight is the only factor. Not surprising given &gt;70% are overweight.<p>Flipside, nothing here surprises me. The US governments actively subsidize unhealthy foods. Not to mention outright inform their people to eat unhealthy diets.<p>Worse than that, just look at your options for food in the USA. If you banned unhealthy foods and all current unhealthy food workers are banned for life from working in the food industry. You would be left with &gt;90% of their food industry unemployed and practically unemployable.<p>What do you do with those &gt;20 million people? Welfare system cant handle them. You might say unsubsidize these unhealthy foods and what happens? Fast food prices go way up and more people go unemployed. Same problem.')
