The shared experience of watching the movie gives you something to talk about and reflect on. One need not know everything about a person before beginning to enjoy spending time with them.<p>If someone is so interesting in pre-movie conversation that you mutually decide that the conversation is better than whatever the movie has to offer, the movie will be there tomorrow.<p>Also, movie theaters are dark rooms in a fairly safe public space, which is relatively unique.  It is a safe place to, say, hold someone&#x27;s hand for the first time without immediate societal visibility.<p>If movies don&#x27;t seem like a great date venue, there are other people out there who feel the same way.')
