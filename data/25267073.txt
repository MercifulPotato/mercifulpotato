And for that Arecibo was quite a good tool in the toolbox, but not the only one. And the other telescopes used for this are in the 25m to 100m range (the Goldstone solar system radar has a 75m dish and 500kW X-band transmitter).\nIn addition one doesn&#x27;t have to use the same dish as transmitter and receiver (as long as both telescopes can observe the object at the same time obviously).')
