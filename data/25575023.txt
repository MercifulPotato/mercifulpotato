If it&#x27;s &quot;you&#x27;re not a bad or less worthy person if you&#x27;re of weight X, and it&#x27;s ok to accept some realistic compromises&quot; that&#x27;s one thing. If it&#x27;s &quot;people only tell you to not be fat to comply with society stereotypes and you can be healthy at any weight&quot;, that&#x27;s something completely different. I&#x27;ve seen both and people don&#x27;t often clarify their position.')
