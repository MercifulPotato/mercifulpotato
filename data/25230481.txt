Having read the article, I think regardless of Sabine&#x27;s credentials, she has gone the wrong path in terms of science communication. Apple is a topic, Sabine is an author. It&#x27;s the physics equivalent of asking for a source other than the Daily Mail.<p>&gt; People who whine about being downvoted<p>I&#x27;m legitimately curious about the opinion of professional physics. I&#x27;ve worked with quite a few professional AMO physicists and the opinions of Sabine&#x27;s content there are very low.')
