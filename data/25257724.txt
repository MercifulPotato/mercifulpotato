I look at the rest of the market and wonder what the hell they&#x27;ve been doing for the past decade...<p>Why is it all &quot;gamer&quot; hardware that looks like a Michael Bay movie? Maybe there&#x27;s a carve out for things that look like they belong in a cubicle farm. Cheap plastic, laptops with bad battery life and worse cooling, inferior trackpads, and screens that don&#x27;t quite hit the mark no matter where you look.<p>I&#x27;m willing to accept that Apple buys the supply chain and makes it harder, fine - but why is there not one single company that makes something premium that I want to have in my office? I&#x27;ll pay a premium for it, cost literally does not matter - just give me something nice. I could get a good looking desktop from System76, but every other monitor makes me cringe now.<p>If the market is this much in disarray, I have no idea how they compete against the M1&#x27;s internals. Ceding the premium market to Apple is the most depressing thing ever.<p>And none of this is even touching on comparing macOS relative polish to Linux and its various DEs. I think that macOS is tricky with changes, sure - but if you know how the OS works, there&#x27;s really very little surprise with it.<p>tl;dr: would the rest of this industry please wake up and actually compete?')
