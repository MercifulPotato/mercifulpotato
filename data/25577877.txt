Item(by='zigzaggy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609296668, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25577676, text='Illegal lobbying happens all the time. First of all, if you&#x27;re involved in certain activities you must register as a lobbyist. People who walk the line with informal lobbying etc. are breaking the law. Secondly, obviously quid pro quo happens but is illegal. And finally there are those people that once worked for the government &#x2F; military who are now greatly influencing government spending at a contractor. Of course some of that is allowed to a degree, but the envelope is constantly being pushed.<p>My opinion is that someone should file the proper case(s) that would eventually lead to SCOTUS overturning the Citizens United ruling. Then we should move to publicly-funding races. And we should DEFINITELY remove PAC money from justice races (why is that even a thing?).<p>But this country has a long history of increasingly corrupt government cranking out pork barrel projects and ignoring us little people. That will not change any time soon unfortunately, without a massive revolution.')
