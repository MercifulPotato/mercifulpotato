It&#x27;s easy to do and makes them feel important. Tell them to work on something useful&quot;. Then as any self-respecting hackers will do, he wrote Sam text editor few years after making the remarks [1].<p>Writing text editor seems to be the second favorite hackers past time activities after perhaps writing a compiler for APL and Rob did it too :-)<p>Anyway, congrats to the Ox editor authors for having a go, and personally I like and commended the fact that on the project Github page they provide the comparison to the other popular text editors.<p>Since Ox is both front-end and back-end implementation based on Rust based libraries, it does shows that Rust based eco-system has been growing steadily.<p>I have two features suggestions that perhaps can take Ox editor to the next level and be more useful.<p>Firstly, as mentioned by the sibling comment&#x27;s buried towards the end of comment section, on the very large file (VLF) feature for opening big file. This can be implemented by the help of RRB-Tree data structure and the Rust library is already available [2].<p>Secondly, is the CRDT feature that can be implemented with the automerge library. It seems Rust based automerge library is still in its infancy but perhaps by more project adoption, it can further accelerate the development [3].This second feature is very useful for local-first text editing capability enabling both offline and online collaboration feature that can propel Ox to stand out from the crowd.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20607261" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20607261</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ArazAbishov&#x2F;pvec-rs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ArazAbishov&#x2F;pvec-rs</a><p>[3]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;automerge&#x2F;automerge-rs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;automerge&#x2F;automerge-rs</a>')
