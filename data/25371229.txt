Item(by='cannam', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607588746, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25370359, text='I may be misunderstanding, but I believe that the proposal was made much longer ago than 2017 and its original duration was closer to 20 years than 4. It became limited to 2017-2020 because the proposal was only accepted (by Pinker) in 2017, having lain unclaimed until then.<p>Hence Pinker&#x27;s remark about 15 years of hindsight, and the fact that some of the comments below the line were posted 19 years ago.<p>With this in mind, I&#x27;d suggest that 2020 was picked as an arbitrary &quot;sci-fi future&quot; date rather than for an arbitrary term of 4 years. Still arbitrary yes, but more understandable in my view.')
