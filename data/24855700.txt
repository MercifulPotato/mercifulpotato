Item(by='MrBuddyCasino', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603351857, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24851709, text='&gt; I would honestly pay significantly higher taxes if we could get Swiss-quality train service in parts of the US (and especially if they have good internet).<p>The US lacks the required density. Trains are by far the most expensive mode of mass transport per mile, both because of infrastructure and labor cost. Labor costs are higher than eg a plane because trains go much slower! In a personal car, there are no other labor costs. The natural monopoly on the network and the ensuing lack of competition doesn&#x27;t help either.<p>Planes and electric autonomous cars are the better alternative for the US.')
