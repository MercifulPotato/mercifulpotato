Apologies for the mixup, should have seen that in your handle. No, I&#x27;m not part of CHL&#x2F;TXR.<p>While not open source by any stretch, I see the personal EHR space being ushered along by companies following Apple&#x27;s lead. Aside from complex patients, I think the generally healthy&#x2F;mild-chronic person is uninterested in owning&#x2F;managing their health data unfortunately. Apple is contributing useful tools to understand fundamental determinants of health including cardiovascular, sleep, fitness at massive scale. It just happens to come with your watch and phone, and their vision for health is starting to come into focus. This puts the patient in the position of generating the primary data (sensors, etc.) and sharing it with their care team on their terms (more or less). As telehealth becomes more prominent, I suspect the patient will be required to engage with their data more often as it will be the means of conveying a shared understanding vs. observations recorded in the clinical setting and stashed away in centralized EHRs.<p>Furthermore, if labs and other diagnostics are available directly to consumers it puts the individual in a position of ownership. I think the default position is whoever generates the data owns it, and determines how easy&#x2F;hard it is to share with others. If the individual is empowered to generate information about themselves- this will start to swing toward &quot;patient owned.&quot; I too look forward to more of this, but it will have to come with more direct to consumer and digital offerings.<p>One of the coolest examples I&#x27;ve seen of individuals taking ownership in open source med tech is openaps.org . I&#x27;m not one, but T1D&#x27;s are some of the most resourceful and resilient folks around. Good on them for building a community to solve real problems together.
