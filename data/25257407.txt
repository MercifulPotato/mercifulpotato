If your strategy is to spit out tons of different ideas and productize the best, maybe a culture of &quot;move fast and break things&quot; makes sense. If you have a strategy of &quot;ensure both regulators and customers trust we manage money effectively&quot; maybe a culture of risk-aversion makes more sense. The &quot;Culture eats strategy for breakfast&quot; is really a shortcut for that fact that rapid business-change is a reality for all businesses now, not just startups, so a culture that supports innovation and creativity will trump others given time. But that needs to be integrated into other cultural values as part of the strategy and environment that will allow it flourish.')
