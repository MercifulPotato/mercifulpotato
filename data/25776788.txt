The SAT very explicitly does <i>not</i> test knowledge of high school curriculum. Importantly, the United States does not have any standardized national curriculum, so there is no way to write a national test of material all students are expected to know.<p>Originally, SAT was short for &quot;Scholastic Aptitude Test&quot; and it was designed to measure &quot;aptitude&quot;, not mastery of specific material. Many lawsuits later and SAT is now a meaningless initialism that stands for nothing.<p>&gt; your intellectually gifted slacker can walk into a SAT exam, and easily outdo their less gifted, but hardworking peers.<p>Is accurate and true of many of my lazy-but-smart secondary school classmates.')
