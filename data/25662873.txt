It will take 20 minutes and a bit of thinking.<p>Each item, classified, is linked to documentary evidence. Of the twenty that I checked to test if &quot;The evidence is just laughably bad&quot; was a lie or not (it was a lie):<p>- most link to serious articles describing a single item of election impropriety<p>- the links to twitter always include a photo of the evidence the tweet was supporting<p>- the remainder went to independent sources<p>- a valid criticism would be a reliance on secondary media, which are possibly as unreliable as MSM.<p>- No Mainstream Media source are relied on, which is  great plus.')
