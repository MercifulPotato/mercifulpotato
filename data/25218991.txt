Then he got fired. The NS&#x27;s were still pointing to Namechearp so everything continued to work, until the domain expired because neither company felt able to renew it, both referring me to nominet to resolve. Meanwhile the client was hard down.<p>After retiring to the bathroom to have a think I realised that 123 didn&#x27;t really care who accepted the domain as long as the tags were right. So I created a new account, initiated a transfer and went through the steps, and the domain popped into my account, able to be renewed.<p>I did wonder if there would be a way to mass import domains that people hadn&#x27;t accepted into their accounts yet but didn&#x27;t actually try anything.')
