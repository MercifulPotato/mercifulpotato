If I saw a liter of solid plastic sitting by the side of the road I&#x27;d be quite disappointed.<p>That&#x27;s like finding 20 empty two liter bottles just lying there. (Based on a bottle using 50 grams of plastic.)<p>So yeah, seems like a lot to throw out every year from every car.<p>Put another way, if every driver threw an empty two liter bottle on the side of the road every two weeks, you&#x27;d have an equivalent amount of plastic being shed into the environment.')
