Item(by='6gvONxR4sf7o', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606326955, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25209121, text='Reskilling is tough in a world where you have to compete with people with many year degrees for an entry level job. If you imagined people reskilling twice in their careers, that&#x27;s two extra times through college. Say they can skip the general education reqs the second time through and it&#x27;s just 3 years. That&#x27;s still 10+ years of undergrad in a 50 year career.<p>I think educational specialization is going to be a massive issue going forward. In the past, one industry had to compete with another for labor. As time goes on, it&#x27;s increasingly only within-industry competition that matters, because workers have sunk too much time and money into simply getting their feet in the door to switch.<p>If you could spend three months and $20k to switch industries, you&#x27;re much more likely to move compared to the friction of spending a few years and many tens of thousands (and who knows if that specialty will be flooded a few years later when you finish?).')
