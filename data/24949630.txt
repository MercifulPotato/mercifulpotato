The button was then blocked for eight minutes. She didn&#x27;t understand the system. Then I realized that it had two different beeps, one if the pump delivered a bolus and the different one if the pump was blocked. My wife and I we are both Deaf so we just didn&#x27;t know. I requested then the pump turned around so she could have a look at the GUI of the pump.<p>But my wife already lost her confidence, refused to press the button and a few hours later the hospital removed that contraption completely and switched to a different regimen.')
