But it was also clear that iPhone brings a completely new vision to the concept of a mobile phone.<p>M1 brings a nice performance at fairly low power, but that&#x27;s just a quantitative difference. No new vision. Perf&#x2F;watt improvements have been happening every single year since the first chips were manufactured.<p>&gt; I also think x86 cannot compete now and things will only get a lot worse as Apple&#x27;s chips get even better.<p>Why? Somehow Apple&#x27;s chips will get better, but competition will stand still? AMD is making currently great progresses, and it finally looks like Intel is waking up from letargia as well.')
