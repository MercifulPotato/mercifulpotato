PGP has been using RSA for a very long time now. There is no real chance that there are any of those errors in the PGP code.<p>The opening sections of the article are about how choosing the primes and exponents in RSA is fraught with error. PGP doesn&#x27;t prescribe any particularly algorithm for these operations, so PGP implementations are potentially susceptible to these issues.<p>&gt;  The writer has a section on padding oracle attacks. Such attacks are not applicable to PGP simply because the encryption is only done once and there is no reverse channel.<p>Wow. Just wow. There is actually quite a few ways to get reverse channels out of email, some that don&#x27;t even require social engineering. The most trivial one is the 1×1 tracking pixel that phones home, which is pretty common in email for tracking purposes.<p>Sorry, this is the kind of rebuttal that proves the actual point of cryptographers: designing cryptosystems is fraught with error, and amateurs are likely to fall into traps they didn&#x27;t know about. PGP is already decently well-known as being a bad cryptosystem; it&#x27;s basically a message format that wraps Enc(x) and Sign(x) for your given cryptographic algorithm, and we&#x27;ve spent the last several decades learning that these primitives <i>are not secure by themselves and do not naïvely compose</i>.')
