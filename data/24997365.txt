Here is the section in full: <i>&quot;If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy. If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via our convenient DMCA form or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses. We will terminate the Accounts of repeat infringers of this policy.&quot;</i><p>The relevant policy is here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;free-pro-team@latest&#x2F;github&#x2F;site-policy&#x2F;github-acceptable-use-policies" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.github.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;free-pro-team@latest&#x2F;github&#x2F;site-...</a><p><i>&gt; That is false. They could lose their safe harbor if they did not respond to a presumptively valid DMCA notice.</i><p>Had it been a valid DMCA notice, the required response under the DMCA is taking down the youtube-dl repo.<p>Their thermonuclear bomb was to take down other people&#x27;s repos, ban accounts, and make random threats.<p>&gt; <i>Pretty sure that the Legal Dept at Github knows more about the DMCA process than a random non-lawyer on HN. It&#x27;s something they deal with on a regular basis.</i><p>I&#x27;m pretty sure they do too, which is why their aggressive and technological legal response, combined with their CEO making public statements of sympathy for their victims, is so cynical, dirty, and dishonest.<p>They can be the good guy, and fight the RIAA. They can be a neutral party, and do their duty under DMCA. But fighting the RIAAs battles for then, and then making comments like Nat&#x27;s? Sketchy and sleazy.<p>Even eighties&#x2F;nineties Microsoft didn&#x27;t do that. They went after people, but they were at least open about what they were doing -- they called Linux a virus and all sorts of other nasty things. They didn&#x27;t pretend to like Linux while spreading FUD and mounting legal attacks.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;m pretty sure the other random guy on the internet (you) doesn&#x27;t know more than the first random guy on the internet (me).<p>&gt; <i>That is probably for the best. Customers with unrealistic expectations are not worth the effort to keep.</i><p>Depends on the cost, the context, and how those expectations manifest. Talk to any luxury good company serving the ultrawealthy for how not catering to customers with unreasonable expectations would serve them. Or any company selling to an athlete to promote a product. Or many small businesses who just won multimillion dollar B2B contracts. Or...<p>But in either case, I don&#x27;t think expecting github to act honestly is an unrealistic expectation. Each time I&#x27;ve dealt with a dishonest company, no matter how good the deal looked, I came out behind. I think people were holding their breath to see what happens with github post-acquisition, and we just learned.')
