But you have to sell it the right way and throw some numbers at them so they realize, hey, this is actually a better idea (financially and speed-wise). Can&#x27;t fall victim to sunk cost fallacy or end up with a bad system if you&#x27;re starting from a working one.<p>You could probably make a career out of being &quot;the optimization guy&quot;. Product isn&#x27;t working well? Ask the optimization guy to take a look before somebody spends a million bucks trying to replace it.')
