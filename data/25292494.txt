Item(by='smt88', descendants=None, kids=[25292811], score=None, time=1607019937, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25292290, text='&quot;GitHub has My Stolen Code&quot; makes it sound like:<p>1. GitHub did something special or intentional in this case.<p>2. GitHub is running the code.<p>In fact, when I saw the headline, my first thought was that GitHub was using someone&#x27;s library in violating of the stated license.<p>It&#x27;s also strange that this person published their source code along with the demand that no one reproduce it anywhere.<p>It&#x27;s like if Twitter complained about people reproducing tweets. Sure, maybe they are violating your copyright in some way, but copyright is very, very difficult to enforce on a product that can be reproduced billions of times per second across the entire world.<p>Especially after seeing the code itself (simple forum software that runs on PHP 5.6, which has been unsupported for 2+ years) and that the author has no intention of monetizing it, it just sounds like they were looking for a sensational headline. There seems to be no actual harm happening here.<p>And as others have said, this is how we&#x27;d prefer the web to work: copyright holders have <i>less</i> power, not more.')
