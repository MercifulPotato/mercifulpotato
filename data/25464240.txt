So the sub has to be moving under its own power.<p>But there is no need for high resolution and the wake of the sub stands out starkly even with a large field of view. So I&#x27;m not sure it can evade detection by halting propulsion and drifting. The point at which it halted would be known and it would be detected as soon as it restarted, unless it was carried by an unknown current far enough to be out of view of the satellite.')
