You can na√Øvely gather several immediate bits without knowing what the opcode is, and the source&#x2F;destination register IDs are also always in the same place. It does help to simplify the digital design, because your decoding logic can pluck out a few fields with no state dependencies.<p>I had the same response to the odd instruction format at first, but it&#x27;s grown on me over time.<p>&gt;And recently, RV supports big endian. Why?<p>Probably to support networking equipment. They still strongly recommend using little-endian.')
