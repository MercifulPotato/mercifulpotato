I don&#x27;t know how much water that argument holds, but there it is.<p>Sure, there were European groups that were themselves being actively colonized&#x2F;conquered (eg, Ireland), but it&#x27;s also true that the conditions in their home countries led many of these same peoples to seek their fortune elsewhere and to end up at the vanguard of colonization. For example, when the British were in India, there was an outsize presence of Scottish &amp; Irish fortune seekers in the subcontinent who made out like gangbusters.')
