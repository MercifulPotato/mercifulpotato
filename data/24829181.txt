It requires many more farmers but there is money to be made.  My hope is that some of the unemployed millions will see the dollar signs in the soil and start a new generation of farmers.<p>Most people outside farm country dont even consider farming to be a viable career.  Just look at the comments here.  High cost of entry to compete on an industrial scale and razor thin margins.  Who would want to even try.  But a small farm run like the article can be very profitable.')
