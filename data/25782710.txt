The downtown area is <i>stupidly</i> expensive now (it was higher than the Bay Area before Covid--I suspect that is <i>worse</i> now).<p>One of the problems going on everywhere in the US right now is that places <i>won&#x27;t drop rent</i>.  Apparently, you can tack missing rent onto the end of your financing, but if you offer <i>lower</i> rent the bank holding your financing can call you up and demand cash.<p>This is going to totally screw up recovery as everybody will leave places empty until they&#x27;re about to go bankrupt.  And then <i>everybody</i> will go bankrupt simultaneously rather than piecemeal.')
