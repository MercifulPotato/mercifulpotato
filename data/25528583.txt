Basic UX&#x2F;UI skills won&#x27;t transfer over, you&#x27;d need additional skillsets and an eye for it.<p>Complex-tight layouts will feel cluttered to people who have more difficulty with differentiation, visually processing contrast - or aren&#x27;t motivated&#x2F;driven&#x2F;interested to understand what they&#x27;re looking at. If you can expect the audience who needs to learn the interface will be motivated to learn it, then it can work.<p>I&#x27;ve had similar desire to see higher quality, more complex &quot;fantasy&quot; UIs and I could see parts of projects benefitting from such an interface - however I&#x27;m a long way off from having the funding and experimental budget to move in that direction. Maybe I&#x27;ll be blessed enough that it can happen in 5 years.')
