The US has existed for 150 years with stable peace (not to say there has been 0 conflict, but it has existed as a single coherent unit) and freedom to say and publish whatever you want. In contrast, every single nation that has a &quot;stable peace&quot; with speech restrictions has only been in this state since the end of world war 2, when they all destroyed each other, a defining characteristic of their evolution out of that state was freedom of expression, and many of the speech restrictions in many of those countries are relatively new or only recently enforced. Some countries with restrictions that claim to have a stable peace are currently involved in ethnic cleansing and internal armed conflict.')
