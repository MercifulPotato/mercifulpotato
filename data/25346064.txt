Item(by='Terrario', descendants=None, kids=[25346466], score=None, time=1607439854, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25345735, text='&gt; Why are so many people upset by this?\n&gt; It’s like they have some kind visceral reaction to seeing someone who isn’t being thrifty and researching every little thing out with spreadsheets.\nIt doesn’t affect you. They’re not telling you to do it.<p>Would you pay $100 for a 100MB usb drive? Would you not react and try to dissuade a friend from making a purchase you recognize to be ill-considered?<p>It’s your money, do what you want, but people are upset because there are (probably, since we dont know yet) better options that don’t have an Apple pricetag. The purchase would be based on complacency with a brand, and not conformity to rational principles and knowledge.<p>Few have already posted that they would buy this because it’s Apple, in order to avoid 1-2 hours of research. I really hope these aren’t the same people complaining about how terrible capitalism is.')
