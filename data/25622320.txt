Item(by='capableweb', descendants=None, kids=[25623316, 25622377], score=None, time=1609688258, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25622284, text='Yeah, credit history is something I never really cared about as I don&#x27;t have any interest in getting a loan or touch anything else related to credit histories, so I&#x27;m probably a bit biased in that. I also guess the cost of living is so low where I live so I (together with many others) don&#x27;t need to be able to take loans, not even to be able to afford a house.<p>Edit: not a complaint, just found it funny that someone thought of to downvote me a minute after I wrote my comment, because me and others around me don&#x27;t need credit to afford a house? HN sometimes is funny.')
