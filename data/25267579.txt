But that article is from 2011. So that perspective were correct at the time but no longer relevant now.<p>Example when the first iPad using NAND launched, Apple secured nearly <i>60%</i> of the <i>world</i>&#x27;s total NAND production capacity. That was not a monopoly or exclusive deal. It was out of necessity. Securing a <i>stable</i> supply of critical component is the norm is <i>any</i> industry. It is up to the manufacture to decide whether they should expand their capacity to meet demand ( from others ).<p>In again NAND example, since the cost of building a new fab and amortisation time is far too long, most would delay any Capex spending until it is <i>absolutely</i> necessary. With high demand and fixed supply, NAND and DRAM price were sky high, and Samsung managed to be the most profitable company for 3 quarters in 2017, only to be overtaken by Apple. The profits then fasten the capacity increase cycle because the risk are now comparatively lower.<p>Smaller players who do not have the volume, forecast and commitment will always be left at the will of their manufacturing partners. But partners &#x2F; vendors will always complain these players dont give ( accurate ) forecast. Capacity planning in itself is a profession. And these are common, if not the norm across all Manufacturing industries, from Food, Metal, Raw Mats or even Transport like DHL where they have Data Scientist working on Flight Space ( Their unit of capacity ).')
