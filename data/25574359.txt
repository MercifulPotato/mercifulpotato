Do Teslas have a sophisticated-enough physics model that you could reduce some constant for the coefficient of friction enough that it would be able to tell that it can&#x27;t safely drive at 30mph or take those corners at 15mph?<p>Or is the software just hardcoded to assume that if it turns the steering wheel at a specific angle that the car will move a specific amount in that direction?')
