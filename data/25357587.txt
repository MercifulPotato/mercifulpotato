Did you ever think about recreating the DOM in SVG elements in animating those with CSS, instead of using raster images? It would potentially be possible with MutationObserver, and optionally &quot;copying&quot; any  CSS animations in the source DOM. Will likely not be perfect but could still be a good trade-off for a little demo animation of e.g. how to fill out a certain form instead of using a GIF or video.')
