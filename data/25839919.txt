Item(by='gnud', descendants=None, kids=[25840628], score=None, time=1611096132, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25839034, text='&gt; Firefox containers allows things like automatically opening a specific site in a certain container.<p>I use this a bit. But the configuration GUI (provided by an extension) is soooo bad. So I only use it for about 10% of the sites I _ought_ to use it for.<p>I wish Firefox would work on these features, instead of for example messing around with the address bar on every other release.')
