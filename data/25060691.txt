Yep, metadata and quick reconnection is the key for birds and such - we are able to do it almost instantaneously. Regarding 4G, our networks are choked and as many towers that can be placed, have. The spectrum is packed and noisy and dense commercial areas get horrible signal and speeds, the situation in rural areas is worse. And to make matters worse, less than 30% of the mobile towers themselves have fiber backhaul - so we hope to make a contribution there too. And finally, the core of the network can&#x27;t be overhead fiber simply because it&#x27;s not reliable enough to be the backbone because you&#x27;re stringing it across trees, poles and over buildings. It&#x27;s fine for the last mile to the customer&#x27;s premises, but overhead fiber is not good enough for the core.')
