Your eyes lose the ability to <i>change</i> focus. People with normal vision will have their focus stuck near infinity and will need reading glasses for close up things. People with mild myopia will have their focus stuck at close range and therefore won&#x27;t need reading glasses. They will still need glasses to see clearly far away, but they always did, so it won&#x27;t be a change for them.<p>I guess if I had to choose, I would pick needing glasses for far away rather than up close. But I wouldn&#x27;t trade normal vision for myopia just to avoid needing reading glasses in old age.')
