Whatever happened to reading a map and making mental notes? What ever happened to people being able to follow street signs and using your common sense?<p>How did we become so utterly dependent on this technology that only a generation ago was unnecessary?<p>Driver-less cars with AI powered navigation coming to your house in the not too distant future. It will plot the most efficient course to get your meat-sack self from your house to the corner store to buy bread &amp; milk....and you don&#x27;t need to think at all about what your legs are doing. That is  if you even still walk. Maybe you are so lazy you will order by the  noise-polluting drone delivery service.<p>People marvel at tech, and don&#x27;t misunderstand my rant, Google Maps, Openstreet Maps etc are extremely useful in researching places, but, we should not become reliant to the point where we cannot function without them. Otherwise we are becoming mindless zombies in this ever tech-infested world of ours where we are loosing basic skills such as navigating from point A to point B.<p>Very sad state of affairs.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;09&#x2F;navigate-without-gps&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;09&#x2F;navigate-without-gps&#x2F;</a>')
