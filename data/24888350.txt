They could have stuck with Broadcom or Samsung chips for the iPhone but they didn&#x27;t. They wanted things that they couldn&#x27;t get access to through a supplier, and a competitive advantage.<p>If I were an executive at Apple I would look at the risk every supplier contributed to overall profitability and margins. And I would look to see how much value I could capture for Apple vs paying it out to third parties.<p>So for me the question is about &quot;How much of the user experience can I ensure will meet my standards?&quot; and having your own search engine would help there. There are other values as well when you can make large scale semantic queries against the entire web. And it can be extremely lucrative to tie the &quot;search experience&quot; as a feeder into your other products (which is part of what the Justice department doesn&#x27;t like about Google)')
