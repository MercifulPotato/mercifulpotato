As a professional technical writer, I&#x27;ve seen that some people bump the &quot;updated&quot; timestamp for any update, no matter how small. At other times it&#x27;s bumped automatically by the build system. I think the best practice is to only bump the timestamp for substantial updates, or to use an explicit changelog at the bottom of the doc. But that practice isn&#x27;t standardized across docs sites.')
