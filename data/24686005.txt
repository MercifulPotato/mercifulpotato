I just don&#x27;t see it as a massive scandal that renders the data useless - it just decreased the sample size. What particularly wound me up was a Radio 4 presenter this morning objecting to the guest (I missed the start, I&#x27;m not sure exactly who - a female public or civil servant) calling it a &#x27;glitch&#x27;. (&#x27;Really?! Really! 16000 missing cases is a glitch?!&#x27;) Well, yes. Glitches can have minor, severe, catastrophic, or no consequences.')
