They come from a place that recognises only binary divisions of humanity. Us, and them.<p>Oh, and that false assumption that the people who salute flags get to make the moral judgements.<p>Since I don’t have privileged white settler ancestry but come from a long line of the stateless and persecuted, my answer is that you can shove such false dichotomies up Satan’s privilege-assuming backside, because the only thing that experience reveals is that all patriotism is tyrannical.')
