I seriously don&#x27;t miss windows anymore.<p>At this point I&#x27;m not worried about compatibility, but rather shitty game companies banning you the second they figure out you&#x27;re playing on linux.<p>This is especially an issue in PvE heavy games that have only small PvP elements. Looking at you Destiny 2.<p>I really wish companies stopped their draconian policies about Linux gaming. Or at the very least just restricted PvP game play when Linux was detected. Heck I&#x27;d manually go in and press a button certifying that I&#x27;m a Linux player and I understand that I won&#x27;t have access to every portion of the game if that&#x27;s what they need me to do.<p>But these limitations have also pushed me to explore more indie, or small publishing games that are multi-player. Shout out to Northgard and Deep Rock Galactic (even though it doesn&#x27;t support Linux natively) for making an awesome cooperative experience that I can have with my friends on Linux.<p>Also, for developers making games out there. PLEASE test your game with the steam runtime OS thing, not with Ubuntu or a specific distro. The steam runtime is open source and can easily be bootstrspped for any game, even outside of steam. It also ensures optimal compatibility with every distro out there.')
