The definition of genius by &quot;impact on society&quot; is obviously wrong. And it&#x27;s easy to selectively quote people who have something bad to say about a person to make them seem like awful people. Also doesn&#x27;t seem rigorous: are ALL geniuses awful persons? That seems very unlikely. Especially as there may be geniuses in the field of being &quot;good people&quot;.')
