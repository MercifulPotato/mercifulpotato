Talk about the things that actually have anything to do with privacy, security, experience...<p>- Leanplum seems to be there for A&#x2F;B testing and doesn&#x27;t have access to anything sensitive.<p>- Firebase is partially unavoidable (GCM) and as far as I can tell, the only usage of it that impacts privacy is in Rocket (FF Lite) which barely exists anymore.<p>- Google Safe Browsing seems to be designed in a way that makes it nearly impossible to violate privacy, even if you wanted to. On top of that, FF takes extra measures to protect privacy &quot;just in case&quot;.<p>So where&#x27;s the problem? Yeah, Mozilla has done some dumb shit (like auto-installing some weird extensions and basically anything upper management does) in the last few years, and they aren&#x27;t the Stallman* utopia some people want them to be, but they never really claimed to be. Just like DDG, they give you the best privacy level they can while staying sustainable enough to survive.')
