My latest Lenovo Legion has a whole lot of issues, the biggest one being that the trackpad just doesn&#x27;t work. Sound also dies sometimes when waking up from sleep. But other than that it&#x27;s a beast of a machine with a killer Ryzen CPU!<p>That, in my opinion, is the deal breaker. My pc is a tool I use for getting things done, not something I want to tinker with every time I have to do something. I&#x27;m a literate computer user, programmer and sys admin, and I know how to change settings in Linux but I do not want to spend my time digging through mailinglists for a hack, every time I try to use my webcam&#x2F;soundcard.')
