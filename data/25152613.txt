Maybe better to advise how to have thanksgiving safely - pre isolate prior to meetup - whole scale of what you can do and outline the risk reductions each one has.  Give people an educated choice in the risk as like crossing the road - we all make educated risk choices each day and they won&#x27;t stop the holiday, but can manage it better with better advice&#x2F;approach I feel.')
