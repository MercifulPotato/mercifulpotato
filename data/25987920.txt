I downvoted two comments “criticizing China” into the gray, and upvoted this one “criticizing the West”. What now, gonna accuse me of being an agent, a shill, or something?<p>Of course I flagged this one for breaking site guidelines, too.<p>(Sorry dang for knowingly breaking site guidelines with this comment. Just feel like given the constant accusations whenever there’s a thread like this, sometimes one has to show themself. I don’t think your “I looked into the users who downvoted and they’re not shills” is actually working.)')
