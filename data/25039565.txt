Those are obviously related to engineering.<p>But the advice under the business category is rather generic and strategic, what to buy, what to focus on etc. I don&#x27;t see how any of that is related to domain modelling, I&#x2F;O etc.<p>Also I&#x27;m not an architect, I&#x27;m a programmer. I literally don&#x27;t understand what an architect is as stated above, especially not when looking at this document.')
