It&#x27;s not.<p>Nor did I say equality was equally distributed. It&#x27;s not.<p>I just said a significant number of people CHOOSE (chose) not to take whatever opportunities they were presented with. Now they&#x27;re upset because the world where you sit in 1 job for 50 year, get a pay rise every year, don&#x27;t have to worry about anything, and get a nice house and to retire early is long dead.<p>Some of the most deprived places in the country voted to stay in (London) because they choose opportunity. Plenty of well off rural areas voted out because people their don&#x27;t like others succeeding.<p>That&#x27;s the great irony here. The people with the least opportunity and the ones at the worst part of the inequality problem mostly want opportunity. It&#x27;s the ones further up the curve that are standing on the hose. Those who insist they&#x27;re middle class but are really just workers who inherited a bit of cash or got a free council house.')
