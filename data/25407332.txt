So in a year you would be able to store 6 terabytes. This would probably work out fine, because e.g. typical use of cloud storage is probably backups, and the first uploads are the largest.<p>I think some networks have operated in the way you want: you get full speed to some specified limit, and after that you are throttled (significantly). That works out fine to use the complete limit. On the other hand if you do want to use 15G, it&#x27;s easier to do, when the block gets charged automatically.<p>I think it would be very hard to have a lawsuit about this if the contract includes these details.')
