You&#x27;ll be much happier, and have lots of free time)<p>To debug its a massive arse and lacks any useful and friendly debugging tools.<p>One thing that does help is either to use VLANs or a second adaptor to separate container traffic from control. It makes debugging <i>slightly</i> easier. By easier, I mean that when you accidentally misconfigure it, there is a better chance that you&#x27;ll be able to get control of the host still.')
