Item(by='kevin_thibedeau', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608240117, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25460225, text='I bought a 3D printer that was missing a guide rod and couldn&#x27;t be assembled. The package the rods were wrapped in had been opened apparently at the factory given that the rest of the contents were pristine and sealed. I posted a negative review that was never put on the product page. It wasn&#x27;t worth my time returning it since I could order a replacement off eBay for less than RMA shipping.')
