With Zoom and Google we served as the backbone of the US education system as schools pivoted quickly to online learning.  I&#x27;ll never forget the early morning of Friday 13 Mar 2020 when our scale went through the roof and the team worked over the next 2 months to harden and improve our systems during this real-time load test.  And we did all this while transitioning to fully remote.<p>Our sales have also been strong (which created even more load fun!), and we are investing in both continuing to harden our systems and also launch a new coaching business.<p>We are looking for senior folks who want to serve students, their families, and teachers as we build a successful business on a solid tech stack.<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.remind.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.remind.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;engineering.remind.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;engineering.remind.com&#x2F;</a> for more reading.<p>Email me (kevin at remindhq dot com) for more info.')
