Early model S cars are only 8-9 years old right now. Still pretty young to determine true long term reliability. Tesla also kept the reputation decent early on by offering warranty repairs on pretty much everything. I&#x27;ve heard it is not uncommon when looking at an 2012 model S to have reports of 10+ door handle replacements. The real test will come at the EOL time for batteries. If it is similar to hybrids, that comes at ~15 years. I imagine in ~2027 virtually all original model S cars will be in junk yards&#x2F;salvage auctions when they are totaled by a dead battery.')
