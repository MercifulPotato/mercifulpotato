Item(by='Closi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611527634, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25896534, text='&gt; The goal of open source is to create a market for the product that is 10x or 100x bigger than a proprietary product would have. You won&#x27;t ever capture 100% of the market. But if you capture a fraction of that larger market you still come out far ahead of the proprietary product in which you capture close to 100% of the market.<p>The point of the post is that <i>even if</i> you capture a huge portion of the market, monetising it is very difficult, and profitability potential is the main reason you invest.<p>While open source databases struggle to be profitable, MS SQL Server and Oracle are both very profitable. Why? Strong product-market fit - these products are heavily targeted at enterprise who are willing to pay money, and there is no &#x27;free roll your own&#x27; solution to avoid paying the licence fees.')
