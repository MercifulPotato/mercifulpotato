The difference is that in the normal case, the per-meeting key is stable for the entire meeting and is available to Zoom (as is needed for POTS bridge, cloud recordings, etc...). When the meeting is E2EE, the key is generated by the host, distributed to the other attendees, and rotated as the meeting participants change.<p>Details: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zoom&#x2F;zoom-e2e-whitepaper&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;zoom_e2e.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zoom&#x2F;zoom-e2e-whitepaper&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;zoom...</a>')
