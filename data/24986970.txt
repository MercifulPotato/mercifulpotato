This is totally contrary to the rational logic implied by Prop 22, i.e., I am not a driver, therefore I&#x27;d like Uber and Lyft to be as cheap as possible.<p>It isn&#x27;t just the size of the bill (the cost of the pro-22 that is) that tips you off voters were bought, it&#x27;s their contrary viewpoints. It seems like what they really want is to flip the laws, in ballot initiatives at least, while also by and large re-electing incumbents. Crazy times.')
