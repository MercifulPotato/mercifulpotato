I know what you&#x27;re trying to say, reps at 5-10 will give you strength benefits.  But there&#x27;s a nuance you&#x27;re missing that&#x27;s quite relevant to the discussion.  There are different metabolic options for the muscle, since different muscle cell types behave differently and metabolize differently.  There is power, strength and endurance, broadly speaking, with a lot of overlap of course depending on your movement speed, resistance and volume.  Which is why that at above around the 5-10 range you mentioned, you begin to touch into the endurance&#x2F;hypertrophy area.<p>Your comment about 1-2 reps not being good for beginners is questionable, though.  It depends what you&#x27;re training for.  1-2 reps is good or bad, but it all depends on what percentage of your max output you&#x27;re attempting.  a 1-2 rep range at something like an 85-90% of 1 RM isn&#x27;t particularly offensive or dangerous, but it might not be optimal programming-wise if that is All you do.  But it&#x27;ll give you more strength increase faster than doing 8 reps.<p>Your &quot;there is no such thing&quot; comment is wrong, though.  I have in front of me Practical Programming for Strength Training by Mark Rippetoe, and there is a whole chapter that discusses the three muscle fiber types, twelve characteristics, and their relation to rep ranges. There is a continuum of strength v. hypertrophy, and the rep-range of 5 and below being optimally useful for strength training.  Sure, any rep range really where you&#x27;re not doing cardio will lead to both strength and hypertrophy, Especially for an amateur, but there is a rapid fall-off at either end of the scale (low rep = more strength increase &#x2F; higher rep = endurance + muscle hypertrophy).<p>In short: it&#x27;s nuanced and I think your 5-10 number is again, a sort of &quot;bodybuilding mentality&quot; seeping into popular discourse, instead of a &quot;good rule of thumb.&quot;')
