And I think the layer of skim off the top is well represented in centrally planned economies like the Soviet Union. It was taken by well placed government ministers rather than business oligarchs.<p>My comment was intended to be more tongue-in-cheek. People fear socialism, but capitalism is not the answer to all of the world&#x27;s problems.<p>People have basic needs: safety, sustenance, shelter, self-determination. They have higher level needs too, and we aren&#x27;t living in a post-scarcity society yet, but we have the resources to meet these basic needs for at least 328 million people.')
