Everybody <i>needs</i> time to do their own thing, away from their partner and children; as much as we love them we also need to take care of our own wants and needs.<p>So yes, absolutely, speak with your partner and figure out some time you both can step away guilt-free. And keep in mind that groups are more than willing to accommodate your needs.')
