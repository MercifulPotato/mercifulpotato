I know people who were doing just this with Max 4 Live devices sans Push.<p>If you are at all code-savvy it is very easy to make your own custom rig that does everything everything you need for live performing in Ableton. You can write your own control surface scripts in Python (unofficially, but google is your friend and Ableton said &quot;we know they&#x27;re out there and we aren&#x27;t going to try to shut it down&quot;) and you can make anything you want be your own customized equivalent of push with Max for Live. You can do anything you want with your clips and loops from either control surface scripts or M4L devices. Ableton itself was originally just a Max patch!<p>Sure they&#x27;ve made it easier, but it&#x27;s definitely not true that you can&#x27;t do this without Push.')
