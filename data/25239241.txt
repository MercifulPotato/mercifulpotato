All 3 of them working from home and shopping for entertainment &amp; to battle boredom. Those items above are examples of what actually shows up at the front door. Groceries as well, either from Costco (usually a large order) or Whole Foods (for stuff they can&#x27;t get at Costco). Sometimes baking HW (a new hobby for one of them). Sometimes, it&#x27;s boyfriends that drop off Trader Joe&#x27;s or In-n-Out...<p>None of us have set foot in a store since March.')
