I do find that layers are much more versatile if you&#x27;re going to be spending a lot of time outside or going in and out of spaces at a wide range of temperatures. with only a winter jacket and a t-shirt, I am likely choosing between being way too hot or way too cold. my winter coat is pretty bulky, so if I&#x27;m not wearing it, I&#x27;m carrying it.<p>when I&#x27;m going out for a while in the winter, I like to wear a cotton shirt, a wool sweater, insulated vest, a medium-weight windproof jacket, and a mostly empty backpack. if I get too warm, the vest and possibly the sweater can just go in the backpack. with this setup, I can be comfortable at any temperature from 30F to 60F without having to hold onto anything I&#x27;m not wearing. on really cold days, I swap in my heavy winter coat.')
