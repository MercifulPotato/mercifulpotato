Just press a button, and the remote control sends a RF signal at 433 MHz to switch it on or off, there&#x27;s no IoT complexity like firmware updates, Linux kernel, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, an Internet connection or other nonsense. It can either be a light switch installed on the wall, or an integrated unit that comes with the LED light fixture (which may also allow you to change the color). Also, neutral wire is not a problem, some wall switches don&#x27;t need it [0].<p>&quot;Smart&quot; lightbulbs are more flexible with more features, but personally I&#x27;m not a fan of them - many features with few additional benefits (with high price tags, possible bugs, and privacy concerns). Nevertheless, if you are not allowed to change any electrical wiring in the room, using &quot;smart&quot; lightbulbs can be a justified choice. Another genuine use may be controlling many wired-together lightbulbs on a large light fixture as separate groups without a laborious rewiring. Meanwhile I&#x27;ll keep using my dumb wireless light switch.<p>[0] They solve the neutral problem by using an always-on high resistance in series with the &quot;hot&quot; wire. The lightbulbs on the light fixture completes the circuit, a tiny current starts to flow, which is harvested by the switch to power itself. Clever hack!')
