The differences of the Pro vs Air are quite minimal. Where I do like the fanless design, I was concerned of thermal concerns on the Air, but there was no way that I&#x27;ll ever buy a touchbar product from Apple ever again, so I took a shot with the Air. Pleasantly surprised with heat&#x2F;energy&#x2F;battery, and couldn&#x27;t be happier to have the physical F key row back. M1 Air is hands down the best MacBook I&#x27;ve used since the 2015 MacBook Pro.')
