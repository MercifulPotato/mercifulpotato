I work in &quot;traditional&quot; industry, meaning the revenue we make is for saying widgets we make in factories. Having 10% profit margins or 5% yearly growth is fantastic in our industry. In the US my feeling is that a larger fraction of developers work in the type of tech that has higher room for growth. And more importantly, the entire industry has to <i>compete</i> pay wise with these tech companies that can pay based on exponential growth and almost unlimmited properties (like FAANG). Since I don&#x27;t have people across the street making twice my pay because they work at a FAANG, there is less of that.')
