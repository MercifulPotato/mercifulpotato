I&#x27;m a 6th generation Canadian who left and went to NYC to build tech companies, much to the dismay of my parents who continually asked &quot;why are you so interested in getting above everyone else?&quot;. While I agree with a lot of what the author said, I think that the Canadian tech scene doesn&#x27;t jive yet because Canadians haven&#x27;t really embraced ruthless capitalism fully.')
