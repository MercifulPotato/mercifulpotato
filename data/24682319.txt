Whereas before, they advocated affirmative action and similar solutions as ways to slightly tweak merit-based systems to benefit historically disadvantaged populations, there seems to now be a more widespread rejection of those systems as inherently discriminatory. The only transformative net effect, it seems, will be to significantly reduce the proportion of Asians across elite institutions.')
