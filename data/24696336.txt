For instance Denon AVR creates its own WiFi network that HEOS surrounds participate in, and the independent room speakers are all visible on the joined WiFi network as well.  So, wired, Bluetooth, and WiFi.<p>Agree with grandparent comment, the HEOS speaker sound is fuller&#x2F;richer, less reliance on Bose-style psychoacoustics.<p>Further, the Denon AVR with HEOS surrounds is the only receiver I know of supporting integrated amplifier for wired front speakers (separates) and WiFi wireless surrounds.  I run Definitive ProMonitors and ProCenter for front, and Denon HEOS for surrounds.<p>(Note: Many receivers support wireless for other zones, I’m talking about mixing amped and wired for front with wireless for surrounds, and also ruling out “kits” where you can’t mix and match your own choice of speakers.)')
