That&#x27;s better than just ending service abruptly like they did.<p>I wrote [1] about my own plans, but I know many devs (especially for tiny side projects) just don&#x27;t have the time to update them to something else, and we&#x27;re likely to see a number of smaller projects kind of fall into disrepair from this.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jeffgeerling.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;travis-cis-new-pricing-plan-threw-wrench-my-open-source-works" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jeffgeerling.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;travis-cis-new-pricin...</a>')
