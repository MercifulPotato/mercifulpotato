The hardware obviously cannot natively virtualize x86, nor can Rosetta cannot emulate privileged x86 code. x86 Docker images will also not work.<p>Homebrew itself will probably be ported to ARM by then. However, there will likely be a long tail of packages that won&#x27;t have ARM builds for some time.')
