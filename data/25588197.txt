It&#x27;s an interesting perspective.<p>As I commented in a sibling. Drs need these kind of tools to know who to treat first. But governments don&#x27;t (and shouldn&#x27;t).<p>There is a moral point here about the meaning and value of human life that can&#x27;t be ignored.<p>As a government you can (and sometimes do) reduce lives to economic value (young will pay more tax over their life time), but other times you need to assess life on a more humanistic level. If we all know we hit the age of 60 and society stops giving a fuck, then I&#x27;m going to do very different things, converging on 100% selfishness as I approach 60, as that is the logical thing to do... but a society would fall apart if we did that.')
