That makes their existence different to me than what we normally think of as existence.<p>Existence has two senses anyway - one is the empirically verifiable bottom of existence that science can work with: this is the one I was referring to.<p>The other is a philosophical notion of existence that is harder to pin down. In this sense, God may well exist, the nultiverse with many big bangs may be real, infinity may be real etc. But it is impossible right now to make any kind of scientific arguments about these things, so they can only exist outside the realm of science (as we know it today).')
