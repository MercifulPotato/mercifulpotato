I&#x27;ve posted this a few times so I&#x27;m just going to copy and paste it here:<p>&quot;If you are concerned about this, you may be interested in learning about Screen Pinning on Android devices or Guided Access on iOS. These features easily solve the above scenario. Basically, you can &#x27;pin&#x27; any app you want on your phone and hand it over. If the person presses the Home button or tries to exit out of the app, it takes them back to the lock screen. They can only access and view what you pin. In this instance, you would just pin your digital driver&#x27;s license app.&quot;<p>It is also a feature we plan to implement into the app in the near future where it can be interacted with on the lock screen and have a more &#x27;secure&#x27; method to access it.')
