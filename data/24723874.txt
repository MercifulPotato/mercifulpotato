I spend more time changing the library, updating each service to the new version, getting PR approvals, and deploying then with a monorepo. Additionally, identifying that changes in my library dont break <i>any</i> of my clients are more difficult in distributed repos.<p>This is all with a fairly robust CI&#x2F;CD pipeline so its not like i&#x27;m marred by inefficiencies elsewhere -its just an annoying process that makes me (and others) not want to write libraries.<p>edit: I should qualify that this is most annoying when you own the library and the services that consume the library. If the burden of the upgrade was left to my customers then the tradeoff might be different for me :)')
