It is at technical level from 90s. I wanted to have continuous integration, gigabit internet interface instead of multiple serial ports, fast DDR analog to digital converters instead of 400 kHz I2C. I coded, did project plans, calculated how quicker system will be after changes. Nobody wanted this. “Not a business case!” - I was told regularly. Then I was gone for 3 months. I came back to life and do not work more than 2 hours daily. This ancient stack recently failed very very badly, but I don’t care anymore. However, I work on my own idea for at least 4 hours daily. With longer break in the middle I can be productive for 8 hours a day.')
