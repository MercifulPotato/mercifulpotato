YMMV.<p>I keep the initial focus on them and I first introduce myself as a blank canvas with a known role between us. &quot;Hi, what&#x27;s your name, my name is yourapostasy your new neighbor&#x2F;who waves at you on your 0500h run every day&#x2F;who the mailman mixes up our mail all the time&#x2F;<i>etc.</i>&quot; Then elicit details of &quot;their story&quot;. People pretty universally love talking about themselves. Somewhere in that tapestry are common threads, and I build upon that. I&#x27;ve fortunately never met someone through this approach so odiously unrelatable we could not bond over something they care about.<p>After that, it is a matter of time and resources put in the relationship, as long as you maintain a Nash Equilibrium. The more time and resources, the more differences you both will generally tolerate; not a linear relationship, but everyone I&#x27;ve met has a &quot;clearing price&quot; to voluntarily associate with another.<p>I don&#x27;t think in terms of &quot;take back power and wealth from the rich&quot;, because there are too many layers between us for me to effectively address, and it doesn&#x27;t scratch my agile itch. I instead have worked towards increasing both mutual assistance capabilities and self-sufficiency at the same time, and reducing my and others&#x27; reliance upon capital in an organic fashion. My position is that the capitalists (the 0.1%) have for all intents and purposes &quot;won&quot;. They&#x27;ve &quot;taken their &#x27;ball&#x27; and gone home&quot;. The more I can decouple from capital &quot;churn&quot;, the more I can save of myself and those I care for. There are some extremely broken systems (real estate, legal, political, medical, <i>etc.</i>) in the US that take unreasonable levels of capital to access for ordinary income citizens.<p>Autarky isn&#x27;t my goal; it&#x27;s long-term consistent survival at an &quot;acceptable&quot; standard of living without requiring a poll tax of capital out of reach of ordinary income households. Sometimes that takes some involvement with capital, but preferably a more frugal method is used when feasible, trading off convenience&#x2F;time&#x2F;<i>etc.</i> that I have more readily available. I don&#x27;t hate capital nor capitalists. I&#x27;m just (in the scheme of a US reality where booking a billion in annual individual income doesn&#x27;t even place in the top 10 income list) capital poor and working around it as best I can. Let it be noted in this discussion however, that there are many US citizens who would give their left nut to be in my &quot;poor&quot; position; many of us by virtue of being on HN in a well-compensated industry (at this time, I never take good times for granted) are in a similar position. But if you&#x27;re talking about grand &quot;take them down&quot; terms, I&#x27;ve found I&#x27;ve achieved far more stability, sooner, by pursuing the above path than getting all pissed about a system I have neither the capital nor power to help change at this time.')
