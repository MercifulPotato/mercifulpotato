You only move your fingers, and keep your eyes away from the keyboard.<p>For that, you want such amount of keys which you can comfortably hit by moving  just your fingers. It&#x27;s normally 3 rows and 6-7 columns. And say 5+5 keys in the thumb clusters.<p>I personally find a layout like Kyria [1] optimal for such use.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;splitkb.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;cases-and-plates&#x2F;products&#x2F;kyria-acrylic-high-profile-case" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;splitkb.com&#x2F;collections&#x2F;cases-and-plates&#x2F;products&#x2F;ky...</a>')
