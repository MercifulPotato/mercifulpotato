You can specify multiple and a STUN server does not need to keep any state at all, it is simply a way for a client behind a NAT to get their public IP&#x2F;port, right?<p>STUN servers are cheap to run (they require very little processing and bandwidth as opposed to TURN), and setting up a few on each public cloud should be easy for anyone using ICE seriously. There are also public STUN servers still available, although I would not rely on them personally.')
