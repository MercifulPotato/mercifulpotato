If you don&#x27;t agree - comment, instead of downvoting. The post is not off-topic. Downvoting for disagreement is trolling, especially on HN where it triggers comments throttling which basically turns it into mob censorship.<p>UPDATE: really immature and cowardly reaction to criticism of trolling I see (i.e. downvotes to this comment ;))')
