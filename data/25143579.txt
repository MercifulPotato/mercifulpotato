Item(by='shripadk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605739517, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25142175, text='This is fine to analyze (and I am sure there are thousands of research papers on internet censorship) but what about big tech censorship? Will that ever be included in all these research papers? What about big tech violating their own policies vis-Ã -vis content moderation, shadow banning and banning accounts without a proper reason? I feel censorship is more layered that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to only hold Governments responsible. Hold everyone accountable. Not just the Government.<p>I find it funny that we crib about Government or ISP censorship while completely ignoring big tech censorship. When it comes to big tech, we give them a shield of &quot;oh they are private companies and can do what they want&quot;. The nature of the organization has nothing to do with censorship (which is more a moral issue than a legal issue).')
