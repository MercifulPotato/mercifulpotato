Item(by='Cookingboy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602793217, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24793219, text='&gt; Allowing Free speech still is the hill I&#x27;d like to die on<p>At this rate it <i>will</i> be the hill that the civilization dies on. The whole &quot;absolute free speech is a sacrosanct human rights for everyone&quot; is an ideal that simply would not scale with the 21st century civilization. Most users around here grew up firmly believing that value, and it is further reinforced by American&#x2F;Western exceptionalism, so I can see how this comment will be very negatively received.<p>But we can all agree that freedom isn&#x27;t free, at one point in the future the cost would be so high that the whole civilization would be facing a &quot;give me freedom or give me death&quot; moment. I can&#x27;t predict whether that moment will come in the form of anti-science driven misinformation campaign during a deadly pandemic or a mentally deranged, conspiracy theory supporting leader who has full control of the nuclear arsenal, but that moment <i>will</i> come one day.<p>The second law of thermal dynamics applies to more than just <i>physical</i> systems, entropy also plays similar role in a complex society that is getting ever more complex. Before our species can attain the ability to modularize our own society through interplanetary colonization to ensure survival, we have to face the very uncomfortable truth that we have to put in more rules and checks into our existing society to ensure the entropy doesn&#x27;t snowball out of control too fast. That means we <i>have</i> to put everything on the table and re-exam all of our values, because there is no value to speak of in a dead world.')
