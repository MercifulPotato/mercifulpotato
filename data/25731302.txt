Apparently Steam is such a cesspool of (pre)pubescent teenagers, with rampant account hacking and theft of funds, swag or whatever, that they feel the need to fortify the process if only to make it more inconvenient for the hackers.<p>- “Remember the password” barely ever works, even on desktop. Since I don&#x27;t quite log in every day due to being too old for that, I have to redo the process every time—on a machine that I bought with my own money just for myself and intend to protect with both technical means and physical force.<p>- Somehow copy-pasting passwords from KeepassX&#x2F;XC doesn&#x27;t work on Mac, with the shortcut. Not sure if this is a misfeature of Steam, but I have to paste the password to an editor first and then copy out of there into Steam. (Seems though that ‘paste’ in the context menu does work—this might&#x27;ve changed since I first noticed the issue.)<p>- And of course, the weird variation on 2fa, via email, instead of the good regular TOTP. As is tradition by now, I&#x27;m also given the choice of installing yet another app on the phone, which somehow doesn&#x27;t quite seem to serve <i>my</i> interest.')
