I got sucked into this instead.<p>Addict someone to drugs. Face criminal charges if you want to call yourself an USA citizen. Simple as that. Otherwise, we talk about if it&#x27;s okay to ex-parte kill the drug dealer who&#x27;s OD&#x27;ing my kid.<p>Repealing prohibition didn&#x27;t end crime at all. Gangs, first thing they do is buy the bar or a strip club.<p>I hate those people. They ruined my life. If they get to poison my family and make billions and flaunt it. I get to try to cook up something with CRISPR, and use them to reverse hemianopia from a stroke due to their poison campaign.<p>Only reason I write this is I heard that keeping secrets is bad for you. It&#x27;s a form of reversing the development process and creating a separate self. Only reason my life is over and I can&#x27;t pursue what I want is because I&#x27;m taking care of a blind former heavy drug user. I was one myself so I&#x27;m not blameless. Only reason he&#x27;s a drug user was because his parents were in battles you wouldn&#x27;t believe in a war my nation was dragged into by your horrible horrible world.<p>No amount of money or drugs will stop a drug user. The mania of drug use puts schizophrenia or bipolar to shame. True monsters who not only should be locked up, but are the root cause for why we have prisons and asylums in the first place.<p>America&#x27;s common portrayal is made by people who want our blood, want to take a shot at the king of the hill. Won&#x27;t work. America&#x27;s true character is really one of precision. Sun up, sun down, no mistakes. Perfection. We get to do that because of self-evidence. Not only does it need to be popular or be good and fun, but it has to stand on it&#x27;s own.<p>Legalize drugs, and what you&#x27;re really doing is making drug dealers a protected class. Addict and OD each other with immunity. We should be raising the next generation with an accurate representation to the world, that it gets ugly and cut throat quick, and also raise something better because sooner than you think we&#x27;ll need them to take care of us. Ten years, that&#x27;s about all you get, then it&#x27;s someone else&#x27;s chance.')
