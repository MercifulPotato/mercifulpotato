It&#x27;s great that you are making an informed decision and really thinking about it. People have different experiences. Mine is that as a baby you are just really into it, the whole baby thing and don&#x27;t really worry about individualism. As they get a bit older you think about that again - your career, maybe travel etc. and realize it is constraining having kids, and 90% of that is because of cost of living (IMO). I.e. if I had millions that&#x27;d fix it, ha ha! (maybe it wouldn&#x27;t!) but money does help - you can buy time with it by getting help like cleaners, working less, and can afford holidays etc.')
