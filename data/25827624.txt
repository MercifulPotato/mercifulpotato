Can you talk to someone with some data in this space? You will find pending deletion -&gt; restore is a surprisingly common pattern.<p>As to govt agencies - sure, many use .org and .com domains routinely. These do not get special treatment - and I do generalize my experience from .com and .org to these govt run websites without hesitation.<p>Despite ideas - just because a public agency is using these domains does not make them magic.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sfcdcp.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sfcdcp.org&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;acphd.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;acphd.org&#x2F;</a><p>to pick two domains within 10 seconds.<p>I&#x27;m going to stop here. Despite your claims that folks don&#x27;t go into pending deletion - they do. I am responding to top comment - people fail to renew their domains on time routinely. I&#x27;ve seen it happen with some surprise in govt agencies (ie, someone in a dept spins up a website, and renews when someone complains its not working and they get permission to spend the money to renew - which is not instantaneous even for small purchases) as well.<p>All my points stand and I remain unconvinced by your claims that these govt agency websites can&#x27;t expire (they do routinely), that pending deletion is a black swan event (it is not) or that folks don&#x27;t fail to renew on a timely basis (they do frequently).')
