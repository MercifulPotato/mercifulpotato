QAnon and other BS is a virus that exploits the way platforms determine recommendations and whatnot<p>And just like with HIV, we now understand its method of propagation, know how to curtail it, and actually hold people criminally liable if they knowingly spread it.<p>Why are mainstream social media platforms given a pass here, considering not only do they knowingly operate a system where such content thrives and spreads, but also <i>profiting</i> off its spread?<p>&gt; One side made the effort and came up short<p>One side did not make the effort. They profited off not making the effort despite having ample warning of the upcoming crisis. This doesn&#x27;t make the other side any better, but neither does it mean that the first side should somehow be treated more leniently than the first one.<p>I&#x27;m not defending Parler, but if we&#x27;re letting Facebook and others get away with this then so should Parler, so that it serves as a reminder to rethink our approach and eventually ban <i>both</i> of them or force them both to reform (as in <i>actually</i> reform, unlike Facebook which merely <i>claims</i> to moderate but only does so when they&#x27;ve been exposed).')
