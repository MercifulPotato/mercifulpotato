Item(by='ogre_codes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609950284, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25656581, text='&gt; on a platform that was much more transparent than what Apple will ever provide, given half the chance.<p>I spent 15 years screwing around with X86Config files trying to get Nvidia support working. The idea that anyone could be <i>less opaque</i> than that seems unlikely. Well into the early 00s I had a laptop with a worthless internal wifi card and an expensive aftermarket card because the internal card had zero support.<p>I have no idea how transparent Apple is going to be regarding their technology, but it can&#x27;t be any worse than what we dealt with with Nvidia prior to getting their binary blob solution out.<p>Apple is one brand, one stack. Even if Apple offers no support at all, that is going to be a hell of a lot easier than fighting hundreds of OEMs building one-off cards and onboard sound&#x2F; wifi&#x2F; video drivers with no interest in Linux.<p>I&#x27;m not talking up Apple here. But it really seems like people have forgotten what a shit-show driver support was on Linux for decades. And however uncooperative Apple is, just the fact that it&#x27;s a single monolithic stack is going to make it massively easier.')
