There have always been left, neutral, and right-leaning media, but in the last four years the neutral media was painted as being biased against the president because they reported the facts. The facts, they&#x27;re very unflattering. The president has brought the pro wrestling &#x27;heel&#x27; character into national politics and reporting on that reality is not bias.<p>I think it&#x27;s more the way they are playing both sides. The best example being the New York Times â€” a well-beaten, but still-living horse. They get painted as biased for reporting the facts about Trump, but simultaneously they engage in palace intrigue journalism that softens the administration&#x27;s image and run it well ahead of page 6. That&#x27;s not neutrality, it&#x27;s duplicity.')
