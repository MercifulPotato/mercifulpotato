No one (well, save literally a single person) can even see vote totals. Votes do one thingâ€”make comments more or less prominent within a thread.<p>I see voting as a sort of collective curation mechanism, and I vote accordingly. If I see a insightful comment that I think more people should read, I upvote it. If I see a dumb comment I think less people should read, I downvote it. Assuming others agree with me, the insightful comments end up higher in the thread, and the stupid ones become faded and easy to ignore.')
