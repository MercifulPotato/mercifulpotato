With a VAT, you don&#x27;t know, and it&#x27;s easy for the government to increase the VAT without purchasers realizing it. In fact, VATs are sometimes referred to as &quot;money machines&quot; â€” as in, you can just crank them up to generate more tax revenue.<p>Sales tax, on the other hand, is more salient because product prices are typically shown pre-tax. That means that when you buy something, you know how much of your money is going to sales tax, and people would realize if all of a sudden their $10 purchases were costing $12 with tax instead of $11.')
