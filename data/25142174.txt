Mmm. Ok. How about layout and sizing? A lot of that looks a lot more defined - I&#x27;ll pick a random example from their own homepage then: &quot;border-b border-gray-200 py-6 flex items-center justify-between mb-16 sm:mb-20 -mx-4 px-4 sm:mx-0 sm:px-0&quot; - if I wanted to change my approach to centring, justification, and sizing, it still seems like a lot of search and replace...<p>(I think I understand that the approach is that I&#x27;d then change what those definitions <i>mean</i> centrally - but that won&#x27;t help me if I decide that two properties which are currently different should be the same, or vice versa).')
