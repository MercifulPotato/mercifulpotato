I interviewed with Amazon twice and it&#x27;s like a 10-hour meat grinder. No offer either time and I have no idea what I did wrong.<p>I absolutely don&#x27;t get those wide open questions like &quot;How would you design 1-hour delivery?&quot; (real question btw). As someone who has done a lot of consulting work, my instincts are never, ever try to answer such a ridiculously broad question on your own with no context. The answer to me is to budget for several weeks of planning with a broad range of stakeholders to prioritize features and come up with an initial technical approach that we can refine after an MVP launch, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what they wanted to hear.')
