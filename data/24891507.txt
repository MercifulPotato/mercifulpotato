I think they&#x27;re cut from a similar cloth in some ways.<p>The story about Jarrett being frozen on stage and calling &quot;give me a note!&quot; and then riffing on it when somebody does, I want it to be true but I know, there is something deeper going in in a musician at these times.<p>Jarrett can range from emotionally intense, expressive, to freeform, to almost trite. He really is across it all.')
