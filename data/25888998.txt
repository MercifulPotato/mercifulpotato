Just even finding projects is awful. Google (and other general purpose search engines) is a disaster. They serve up obviously hacked websites before a GitHub page. GitHub&#x27;s search is better, but it&#x27;s hard to use. I <i>highly</i> recommend doing a really braindead naive search on github.com, then choosing the code tab, then filtering for Markdown. Now you&#x27;re searching READMEs. I&#x27;ve found a ton of amazing projects this way that I had no other path to without knowing their specific README language beforehand.<p>Edit: also if you&#x27;re using a regular ass search engine (or GH), just type &quot;awesome [whatever topic&#x2F;language&#x2F;platform]&quot; and unless your area of interest is insanely esoteric you&#x27;re probably gonna find some stuff you wish you knew about, because some nerd maintains an &quot;awesome&quot; list for basically everything used by more than 3 people.')
