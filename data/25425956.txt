My experience has been the opposoite When did you live in NYC? I&#x27;m not white (I&#x27;m of Indian &#x2F; South Asian ancestry.) I lived in NYC for years, and even owned and drove my own car in NYC for a few years (2017, 2018, and 2019). There were many times that I&#x27;d been speeding, and I&#x27;ve never been pulled over for speeding (not even once) inside of NYC. I&#x27;ve only been pulled over by NYPD once, and that one time was not without reason (I had made a right turn where right turn were not allowed). That one time they were pretty professional.<p>There was even a time when I was distracted, and <i>drove partially through a red light</i> (in Queens), and the car coming from the other side was a NYPD cruiser. If I hadn&#x27;t braked, I would have hit them. The officers inside the NYPD cruiser glared at me (with a very angry face), and I braked, and then reversed back to behind the red light. But they went on their way (and didn&#x27;t give me a ticket or anything). I&#x27;m not sure why my experience has been so different. Maybe the NYPD changed after wave of BLM&#x2F;etc. protests that started in 2014?')
