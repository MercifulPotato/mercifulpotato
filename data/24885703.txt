I love reading this type of grammar preppie school prose - a communication style designed for elites to recognize another deserving of status. It wasn’t until recently that I learned that most folks didn’t talk this way back then. This style of writing was what Ernest Hemingway “dismantled”. I love both Hemingway and Fitzgerald, btw ... concordantly, of course.')
