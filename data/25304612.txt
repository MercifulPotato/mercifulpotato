If not, then one use for OS threads is when running a bunch of compute intensive tasks and you don&#x27;t want worry about stalling everything else. I suppose in that case you could just use a separate executor for those expensive tasks. I wonder how many devs will spawn tasks using the default executor and then wonder why things aren&#x27;t working out so well? Will there be tooling to help identify such issues?')
