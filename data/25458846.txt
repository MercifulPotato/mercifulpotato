The Hadza, a tribe in africa, at certain times of the year, get about half their calories from honey, and they are very healthy. And fruit would certainly also have to be in the rocket-fuel category, no?<p>(If you&#x27;re already unhealthy (e.g. type II diabetic), there seems to be a lot of benefit in going very-low or no-carb.)')
