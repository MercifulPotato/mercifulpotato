So I disagree with the article that this will be an unqualified disaster. It&#x27;s quite likely that they will be a little faster, at least core for core. But it also seems like these are notebook chips hacked into a desktop socket and limited to just 8 cores.<p>That means the best case scenario for Intel would be (barely) scraping back their &quot;single threaded gaming performance&quot; crown while completely giving up against the multi-threaded performance of AMD&#x27;s higher core count Zen 3 chips. The only way Rocket Lake would make any sense in the market would be if these are priced less than $400 (probably a lot less), and so Intel&#x27;s margins will be much lower on what is likely to be a much larger die with more transistors.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to call this anything other than a pure desperation move.')
