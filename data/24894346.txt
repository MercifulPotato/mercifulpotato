You want advanced syntax highlighting, linting, automatic refactoring for your special features? Write it yourself! You want outsiders to participate (think: new employees)? Write all documentation yourself, too!)<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;avg.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;avg.html</a>')
