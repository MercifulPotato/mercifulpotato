If someone vulnerable you care about is still wearing cloth masks to go into buildings, you might consider sending them a box. For example, Julia and I both sent boxes to our parents: we checked in with them about what they had been wearing, told them about how it was now possible to get higher quality masks, and asked if it would be ok if we sent some.&quot;')
