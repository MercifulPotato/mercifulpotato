None of the top tier people I&#x27;ve interviewed (the kind where you start thinking &quot;this guy should be interviewing me&quot; during the interview, let&#x27;s say I&#x27;ve had 5-10 of those) had anything questionable or silly in their resume, and for all of them I was sure the person was going to easily pass the interview based on just reading their resume. This correlation is in fact quite strong in my experience - I can&#x27;t remember exactly, but I feel like the <i>best</i> candidates I&#x27;ve had who&#x27;ve had <i>anything</i> questionable in their resume were mediocre at best.<p>Note: just simply having a low-effort resume doesn&#x27;t count as &quot;questionable&quot; here, I&#x27;ve had low effort resumes where the applicants turned out to be pretty great. Of course, that doesn&#x27;t mean you should write a low-effort resume - it reduces your chances of getting an interview in the first place. People should just write honest, informative resumes. It&#x27;s not really that hard to do as long as you&#x27;re not thinking about how to manipulate the person reading the resume.')
