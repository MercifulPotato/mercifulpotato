It&#x27;s a thing I enjoy doing, just for the sake of fun, taking someone completely by surprise in a nice way, e.g.: I went to visit Brazil only once since I moved from there, during this trip I met a Swede who lived in Brazil for 20+ years, who runs a Swedish-Brazilian restaurant quite far from major cities and surprising him with a conversation in Swedish was a very cool experience, both for him and I.<p>I create a personal justification to why learning Swedish could be interesting beyond using it in the country, even more when I moved and had no idea if I was staying here for long, why would I bother to learn it if I didn&#x27;t find other motivations to interest me?<p>Learning languages is really interesting, it even helps to restructure your thoughts. People find different drives to do things, that&#x27;s mine.<p>And I have a job and other responsibilities.')
