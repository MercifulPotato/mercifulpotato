The home OS should containerize all externally obtained binaries, assigning limited resources to them, <i>as chosen by the user</i>.  The package distributors do not get to decide what level of access do they need; from their point of view, all resources are available; but the user must be able to add limits from the other side, unbeknownst to the (potentially hostile) package distributor.')
