The only tiling window manager I have used for a substantial amount of time is Sway, and it doesn&#x27;t actually make it any harder to move and resize windows however you want than it is in, say, Gnome or Plasma. You can move and resize floating as well as tiled windows with drag and drop, and you additionally have lots of automatic arrangement options when you need them.')
