ElasticSearch is trying to remove what makes open source appealing to businesses. No one wants to build their infrastructure on something with expensive IBM&#x2F;Oracle-costing support. Basically, from now on, ElasticSearch has removed that benefit from their product and businesses are at risk. It&#x27;s now much less appealing... is the remaining niche profitable? Only time will tell.<p>Note, why businesses find open-source appealing is not why developers find it appealing, or private individuals.')
