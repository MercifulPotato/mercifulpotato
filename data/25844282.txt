Why is that not a solution based on the free market? It&#x27;s because there is no reason for Comcast to actually provide the value it promised. It&#x27;s a monopoly and if there must be a monopoly then it should be in control of the government. Did the government become an investor in Comcast and receive voting shares to steer the company on the right path? No? You just donated money to the owners of that business. Don&#x27;t expect anything in return.')
