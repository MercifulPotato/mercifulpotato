People who create good things often become wealthy in our capitalist society. That doesn&#x27;t mean that the accumulation of literal mind-boggling generational wealth is somehow a good and natural thing.<p>I am so tired of this idea that the natural goal for everyone in the U.S. should be to become a billionaire. If you wanna get radical about it, in my opinion <i>there should not be billionaires</i>. I think the accumulation of that much wealth is <i>inherently</i> immoral. No one person could ever, ever, ever spend that money on themselves, so why should it be theirs?')
