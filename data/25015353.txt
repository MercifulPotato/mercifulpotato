DMA Designs is&#x2F;was a british studio. DMA later changed their name to Rockstar. At one point yes, a subsidiary of Rockstar created GTA.<p>Rockstar was later purchased by Take-Two. This was during the era publishers often strong armed their developers into acquisitions so no doubt there was some bullying involved. Take-Two receives a large portion of the major UK games development subsidy pot[1].<p>Take-Two has now, as per this article, buying yet another UK devloper&#x2F;publisher.
