I don&#x27;t remember exactly now, but my friend and I tried to verify each other, but one of us quit the device verification (with the five emojis) half-way through and uninstalled the app, so now there is a half-verified device that we can never remove. My icon with him always shows up red because of this device, and there&#x27;s nothing we can do.<p>UPDATE: I just checked now, there&#x27;s a &quot;manually verify by text&quot; option, I clicked &quot;verify&quot; and that device finally turned green, so at least now there&#x27;s a way to fix this.<p>One major source of confusion for me is that one-on-one chats and multi-user rooms are different, but one-on-one chats seem to be multi-user rooms with just two people in them? That is confusing to me, because I see &quot;people&quot; and I see &quot;rooms&quot; but apparently people are rooms too.<p>All that having been said, I am very pleasantly surprised by the overall experience, and especially the pace at which it seems to improve. I use Element semi-regularly with a friend and it&#x27;s been working okay. Hopefully all these kinks will be ironed out, because I really <i>really</i> want a better IRC, and Gitter has become infinitely better now that I can just use Element to access it.<p>&gt;  At the moment the vast majority of negative feedback on HN has been &quot;it sucked&quot; without giving a hint of what actually went wrong.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what the majority of users are saying (and I certainly never said and don&#x27;t think Matrix sucks). I&#x27;m saying &quot;this is not good enough yet that my parents could use it&quot;, which is an extremely high bar, and I think that&#x27;s the way you should take the feedback.')
