There are so many useful services people are used to have for free on the internet, which will need to be paid without ads. Most of those could be subscription-based though. As for blogs—IMO articles that are written for money aren’t blogs, they are just old-school magazine articles that happen to be on the internet. So having them in a subscription-based closed platform seems appropriate.')
