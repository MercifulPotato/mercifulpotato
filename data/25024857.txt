Item(by='stone-monkey', descendants=None, kids=[25025161, 25025184], score=None, time=1604833019, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25024525, text='&gt;It&#x27;s also disingenuous to suggest the extreme left isn&#x27;t dominating the messaging from the left.<p>Except it&#x27;s not disengenuous to say that at all. We can see that by the candidates each party has supported. Biden is considered a pretty centrist democrat by pretty much any metric. Trump, however, can&#x27;t be considered a moderate. He&#x27;s enabled fascist White nationalist supporters. Biden hasn&#x27;t done the same.<p>Also, for the record, BLM and SJWs aren&#x27;t equivalent extremist left compared to literal Nazis - the left wing extremist equivalent is Communism and the position to kill and eat the rich. That is the level of extremism that Trump has facilitated in office. If Biden also enabled people who explicitly call to overthrow the US government, I&#x27;d say you have a fairer point.')
