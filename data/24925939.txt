No where near being ready for &quot;form and fit&quot;<p>From the article:<p>&gt; Cut and stripped wires, point-to-point soldered breakout boards, anchored everything to the proverbial breadboard, and after four hours sat back to realize you only had five more devices to build?<p>&gt; Found yourself with a great idea, but unsure of how to bring it to life?<p>&gt; Had an amazing prototype but needed to create a demo ready proof-of-concept?<p>Proof of concept is well before what you&#x27;re talking about')
