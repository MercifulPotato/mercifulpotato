Op provided a list of items, and my question is very simple - what is the net impact? What has Trump actually achieved? What is the result?<p>From your last comment, are you implying no action can be taken that isn’t simply symbolic except for a land invasion?<p>Interesting that you turn this into a personal attack. If you agree with the OP, that’s okay. The goal has always been delivering results, not empty, feel good rhetoric that makes you “feel” good. If it’s about your feelings, then okay, I’m sure his strong man rhetoric is good enough over any actual policy shift.')
