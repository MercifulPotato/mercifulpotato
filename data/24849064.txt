After you put together a certain number of soap bubbles they&#x27;ll collapse into a black hole. Furthermore there are concerns of speed of light or speed of sound.<p>Nature might give efficient solvers for specific problems up to a certain size, but we already have &quot;practical&quot; NP problem solvers in classical silicon in the form of SMT solvers.')
