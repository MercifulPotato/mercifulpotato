So, if we can engineer digital products and generate such wealth, can we engineer something to help people so they don&#x27;t work 3 jobs to pay rent in the middle of the next pandemic?<p>How about a Digital Nation, DN<p>Create a new country which exists on the internet. \nA country without a physical border, which means, doesnâ€™t matter geographically where you are on the planet you have an electronic passport. For example, a local doctor who is a citizen of the DN is paid by DN to provide care for other DN citizens who live in the same geographic area.<p>The new nation has its own digital currency which is guaranteed by an electronic ledger that is funded by the citizens, and a charter which is designed to deliver basic standard of living for citizens.  \nA basic income paid in local currency to pay for cost of living such as: \n   - Internet (partnership with Starlink?)\n   - Shelter\n   - Medical etc.\n---\nHow does one go about building such a thing ? Breaking down the basic needs by overcoming logistical problems?<p>Thank you, for time and sharing your thoughts.')
