If mistakes were made with roughly equal frequency in both directions on the political axis, that is an example of being flawed but is not a serious concern. It&#x27;s potential political bias  that favours a specific party or election outcome which is the concern. The power to swing elections being bestowed on a small group of unelected, unaccountable people is the concern.<p>It&#x27;s not valid to compare vetting by the social media oligopoly with legacy media curation. Social media companies are like the new public commons through which the plurality of conversation and debate flows through  nowadays. It&#x27;s not practically possible to opt-out unless you want to exclude yourself from public discourse. There&#x27;s also a distinct difference between legacy media bias, which is worn on the sleeve, and the shadowy undocumented impact of vettors whose bias can&#x27;t be scrutinized by the public.')
