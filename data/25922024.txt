Item(by='prepend', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611701813, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25921940, text='&gt; The other problem with ultimate is that it strongly incentives you to NOT let anyone else on the platform.<p>This is my biggest problem as their pricing model discourages collaborative development.<p>We use GitLab to generate docs that are read by hundreds of internal users. On the free tier, if a user wants to suggest a change it’s no problem. Even though that is a very rare user and might only create one issue a year. Or maybe they add a tutorial or something to a project.<p>They aren’t developers, but having them involved in the git lifecycle is really helpful. Also data scientists who just want to archive their pipelines.<p>But with the ultimate tier those users suddenly cost $1200&#x2F;year for minimal features. We can’t upgrade for free for the developers because we’ll disconnect all those “casual users.”<p>The suggestion to run two instances is stupid and confusing to users who now have to learn about mirroring, etc.<p>It’s weird that they don’t allow individual users to have tiers, we would buy more GitLab.<p>As of now, we will likely have to switch off of GitLab because there’s not a clear dividing line between software developers who need GitLab features and staff who write software who just need git, issue tracking, wikis and pages.')
