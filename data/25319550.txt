Item(by='pmoriarty', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607212199, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25319498, text='<i>&quot;There are many flat out wrong interpretations of him, and someone like a professor or a secondary source can definitely help avoid common misunderstandings and pitfalls when trying to read him.&quot;</i><p>That really depends on who you read.  If you read only a secondary source instead of the primary source, and that secondary source happens to have misinterpreted the primary, you&#x27;re going to be misled.<p>If you read the primary source you&#x27;re at least going to have the chance to make up your own mind, even if it&#x27;s difficult to do so... and even if you can&#x27;t, you might at least see that what the primary source actually says might not be as straightforward and obvious as the secondary source maintains.<p>But please don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m against secondary sources altogether.  They can be a useful adjunct to reading the primary sources.  Ideally, though, you&#x27;d have multiple secondary sources (ones that disagree with one another), so you don&#x27;t fall in to some one person&#x27;s reality tunnel.<p>This is especially important in philosophy.  I can&#x27;t count the number of times I&#x27;ve read secondary sources which I consider to have completely misunderstood the primary sources they were commenting on, and how frequently secondary sources disagree with one another (especially on the more &quot;difficult&quot; philosophers).')
