Also if you think there&#x27;s anywhere you can run where things like the fascist tide, globalization, and white supremacy cant reach you you&#x27;re extremely naive. It would be far better for your child to grow up in a better world, and know how to fight for that, than to grow up on some shrinking islet of comfort without learning anything from their parents except how to run. Good things don&#x27;t just spring up out of nowhere, they&#x27;re built and fought for.<p>Furthermore, the people of comfort in the US (read: the people who have the means necessary to leave) are largely the same people who have benefited from this extremely racist&#x2F;violent system. That is almost true by definition... For those they very people who are most comfortable because of the exploitation in this country to deem it &#x27;too uncomfortable&#x27; and leave is just incredibly gross. It has been far less comfortable for the people being oppressed, who could never dream of having the means to move, than it has been for you forever.')
