A handful handed out password cards to guests only, but those ones were almost always &lt;place name&gt;2013. Back then I didn&#x27;t have much choice as mobile phone reception in the Alps was non-existent. The campsite owners were aware of the law, they&#x27;d often mention that they weren&#x27;t happy about it.<p>Last year I was in Paris, but didn&#x27;t have to fight the system any more, 4G reception was fine. So, no idea what it was like in cities, but in the countryside they followed the law.')
