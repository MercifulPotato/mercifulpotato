As one of the people WFH with simply <i>reduced</i> expenses, all I ever hear on the news are about the people who have been adversely affected, other than obvious winners like Zoom. Of course, &quot;average savings rate is up&quot; may not even be newsworthy, but I had no idea until recently this was the case.<p>Also having talked to a few people adversely affected by the pandemic, I think a lot of people don&#x27;t understand how not everybody is hurting.
