I would classify myself as a Boglehead and I believe in the fundamentals of investing in bonds because it all its technicality (and given the buy-and-hold strategy), you are indirectly lending to a government by buying its bonds, which naturally means that you will and do get returns on it, both in terms of the interest (coupon payments) and value growth (further decline in those bond yields).<p>That being said, again, why would negative yield bonds ever be considered a good investment vehicle? Isn&#x27;t it analogous to me investing in my money in a depreciating car, which will only lose value unless the car happens to have a random spurt of high demand that lets me unload it at a profit?')
