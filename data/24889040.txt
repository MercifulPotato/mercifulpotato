Item(by='tenebrisalietum', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603653314, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24886106, text='&gt; Why do you need hundreds of people to maintain a simple software that downloads videos from YouTube?<p>There&#x27;s more than one video site that doesn&#x27;t simply offer the browser a link to an .mp4 or other media file, but uses Javascript to download storage blobs, which aren&#x27;t referenced by filenames, and then stream them using complex Javascript code.  I know for YouTube the Javascript code is important and has to be reverse engineered.  The YouTube mobile app probably does the same in native code.<p>The &#x27;hundreds of people&#x27; also comes in because youtube-dl supports much, much more than just YouTube (almost want to say &#x27;hundreds of sites&#x27; but I think it&#x27;s more like 50 or so).<p>&gt; Is it that complicated to assemble the query string?<p>Again there&#x27;s much more going on with some video sites than the query string.')
