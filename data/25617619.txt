Furthermore, an emulator would naturally have a global notion of time, synchronously updating all internal states in a linear sweep.<p>However, in hardware this model could be made clockless &#x2F; asynchronous, such that computations go as fast as they can.  The extra state of &quot;unknown&quot; can be interpreted as &quot;not all required inputs are ready yet&quot;.  Some care would be needed to buffer loops in a recurrent circuit, but that&#x27;s about the only extra complication.')
