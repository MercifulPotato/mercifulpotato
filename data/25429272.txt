I think the issue exists in general with any abstraction: from highest levels where users have to understand and maintain a text document to deepest level of maintaining and understanding computer code.<p>Making a text article understandable isn&#x27;t just about the syntax or the structure or the images; you have to have knowledge in the subject to be able to grasp its contents.<p>With this in mind you can probably create the most amazing UX for allowing end-users to program a system. Problem is that if the user doesn&#x27;t have any domain knowledge then there&#x27;s no amount of syntax-system-trickery one can do to make it easier for them to program it.<p>The space is also highly subjective: something that might work for me might be completely alien to others.<p>With that said I think the work by Harel et al on &quot;scenario based programming&quot; is fundamentally something that will impact this space greatly [1]. Their vision calls for not just making it easier for &quot;end-user programming&quot; but to shift the way we think about software as something that is more aligned with how we generally think about systems. I gave a talk about this earlier this year: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1oKzTrq0gMM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1oKzTrq0gMM</a><p>1. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il&#x2F;~harel&#x2F;papers&#x2F;Runware.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il&#x2F;~harel&#x2F;papers&#x2F;Runware.pdf</a>')
