I choose one of the top three submissions.<p>When I started, I had no idea what to write. It was a struggle to write a paragraph. It&#x27;s weird how it gets easier to create ideas. It&#x27;s the same people say about improv class - overtime you get better at coming up with reactions to things.<p>For daily running, I finally gave in and bought bluetooth headphones after thinking they couldn&#x27;t be that much better than wired headphones. Though I&#x27;m sure most people already have a BT headset solution here.<p>But what I do is have a podcast or audiobook I only listen to on runs. For example, maybe it&#x27;s a Joe Rogan interview with someone I like. Or a thrilling work of fiction. Currently listening to Dark Matter by Blake Crouch, kinda fun (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;audiobookreviews.com&#x2F;Dark-Matter&#x2F;1357" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;audiobookreviews.com&#x2F;Dark-Matter&#x2F;1357</a>).<p>I now look forward to running. Especially if it&#x27;s a good episode or book that I want more of. Sometimes, during the climax of the book or a great twist, I&#x27;ve even gone out to run again just to get another hour in.<p>I also just look at runs as some personal time. Running sucked when I was out of shape, but now they are some nice time away from the world. Oh, and if you&#x27;re just running on a treadmill, there&#x27;s nothing that will make that pleasant, I don&#x27;t think.')
