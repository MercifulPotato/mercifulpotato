Item(by='GuB-42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607943875, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25403145, text='Cobalt Flux pads actually have the simplest sensors imaginable: on the bottom of the pad is a large steel plate, connected to the control box. Under each arrow is another steel plate, also connected to the control box using a wire and separated from the base plate by 4 velcro patches, one on each corner. Step on an arrow and the plates make electrical contact.<p>The reason these pads worked so well compared to other home pads is that they used more robust materials: steel instead of aluminum and polycarbonate instead of acrylic. It still had issues though, the wiring and wood screws in particular.<p>Arcade pads use rubber sensors: press the arrow and the sensor get squished, connecting two carbon tracks inside it. These were notably finicky, at least for the early models. They progressively became more sensitive as they wear out, before they fail and get stuck.<p>The linked pad uses load cells, which allow to adjust the sensitivity. I don&#x27;t know how it works in practice but in theory that should be great for high level play.<p>As for the &quot;TX&quot; series of pad, they come from a long line of questionable quality pads. Some were great, other not so much, but it was mostly due to the build quality and materials rather than sensor design.')
