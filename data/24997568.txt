Because Florida and Texas alone were so far off, 10% odds was definitely “way” wrong. Nate’s model predicted that if Florida went Trump the odds were at 33% or so. Texas moreso, etc. Since Florida went incredibly strongly Trump, we can say with certainty he was completely wrong on the 10% chance. That’s the point: he was way overconfident his past model would fit, it should have been closer to a slightly advantage, which would read something like 60&#x2F;40 at best.')
