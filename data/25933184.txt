Its their connector which will only be featured on Tesla cars. You really think Tesla would be going along with retrofitting in Europe if it wasn&#x27;t for regulations? That they&#x27;d just willingly give up their market dominance position in charging network just because they feel like it and have some altruistic desire to embrace some future connector?<p>The industry standard answer to the Supercharger connector exists. Its available on multiple brands of cars today. The day for a single shared plug could be today if Elon says so. Retrofits for charging stations could start happening tomorrow. They could probably start cranking out CCS compatible cars for the US market within a quarter. But Tesla doesn&#x27;t want a single shared plug, they want to own the market for chargers. They want to use the wide spread proprietary connector as a selling point to sell their cars. Which is <i>exactly</i> the concept in my &quot;straw man&quot; post. Its not really a straw man when its <i>literally</i> the exact scenario that&#x27;s currently playing out in the market though, a car manufacturer using a dominant position in deploying chargers to push their cars. For evidence, see TFA. Do you think Tesla owners are installing J1772&#x2F;CCS chargers at their homes and using adapters, or are they installing Tesla chargers? When someone sees an article like this, is that not convincing shoppers to look at Teslas first over other brands of electric cars? Seems less like a straw man and just taking a hard look at the objective reality of today.<p>Buying Tesla is supporting vendor lock-in. Its obvious to you that a single, open connector is better for the market and yet you&#x27;ll continue to support a proprietary one.')
