All of the components of my computer, both internal and external, have RGB built-in. It would be practically impossible to replicate that by just buying some dark blue LEDs, and there&#x27;s barely any additional complexity involved with RGB components. There are literally only two additional connections in my machine due to the RGB, and those are for the LEDs in the case and the water cooler. Every other component uses the data lines it&#x27;s already connected to.')
