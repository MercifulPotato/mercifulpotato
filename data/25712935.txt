To me, this looks like someone saying &quot;we&#x27;re going to go protest&quot;, which people have said many thousands of times in the last year. It does not advocate for violence or anything illegal there. The last bit where he says &quot;youâ€™ll never take back our country with weakness&quot;, seems to be misinterpreted by some - what Trump was saying is that the legislators who weren&#x27;t challenging the results were being weak, and that to win [the election] you have to show strength.<p>All of this reads to me like very typical motivational bluster that accompanies situations like protests. BLM organizers also use phrasings like &quot;we&#x27;re going to take back our city&quot; and &quot;show them our power&quot; and so on.')
