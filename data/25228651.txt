They don’t need to buy some new base station and then worry about if it speaks the right protocol as all their other devices. Historically there wasn’t a ubiquitous, push button, cross-vendor wireless protocol that fit the bill. I’m really hoping that everything actually moves to local comms over zigbee.')
