Adjust the cap on entrants annually. No showing of specific market need required, or educational background of the applicant. Just criminal background and health checks on the applicant.<p>The bid is the (gross) pay of the role with a minimum commit of 36 months. Winning bids are paid to the <i>employee</i> (i.e. as regular income) over the first 36 months or until their employment with the sponsor ends, whichever comes first. (The fee paid is de minimis, just what&#x27;s required for processing.)<p>Employees who voluntarily quit or are terminated are free to take any other job paying at least what the sponsor&#x27;s job paid, provided they do so within 3 months. The new employer does not need to bid or sponsor them. If the employee can&#x27;t find a new role, they have to leave. In any case sponsor then pays the remaining bid&#x2F;salary to the government over the remainder of the 36 month term.<p>After 5 years keeping your nose clean and remaining employed making more than the starting pay at entry, get a green card and eligibility to apply for naturalization.<p>At a stroke this would eliminate the abuses of H1-B - lowball salaries, exploitative conditions - and open a legitimate market for global talent. The sponsor has a strong incentive to vet the applicant and not abuse them, as they are on the hook for 3 years of comp whether or not they retain them.')
