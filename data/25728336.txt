Item(by='AnIdiotOnTheNet', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610370274, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25724465, text='&gt; Makes me angry that retro computing gets special criticism.<p>Part of me wants to cynically say that it is because people spending time with retro computing tech will realize how ludicrously bloated and slow things are nowadays despite several orders of magnitude more computing power. Almost all of these machines boot faster, have no input latency at all, aren&#x27;t riddled with complexity for its own sake, and can still accomplish a lot of the tasks we use computers for today (albeit with some limitations like only running one program at a time). Even the interfaces were often much more coherent and understandable because they lacked the same obfuscating abstraction we have today, and the non-GUI one&#x27;s at least were also incredibly responsive.')
