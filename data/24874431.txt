Item(by='theshrike79', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603488688, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24868500, text='I don&#x27;t work around the clock.<p>Normally I&#x27;d leave for my commute at 0700 to get to the office at 8, and again leave around 1600 and be at home around 1700.<p>When remote, most of my work gets done between 0800 and 1700. There are a few late-night calls (15-30 minutes) due to time zones and maybe a handful of times I need to consult a team on the other side of the planet during the evening.<p>Basically I get to sleep an hour longer, since my commute is 60 seconds and doesn&#x27;t require me to be dressed. Also I get to take breaks during the day any way I like - that&#x27;s how I played through Spider-man on PS4 :D')
