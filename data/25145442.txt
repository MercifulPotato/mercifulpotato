If an ISP were allowed to filter the internet however it pleased, it could have a substantial impact on our personal freedom.<p>Same goes for smartphones. Given that there&#x27;s only two realistic choices, the Apple&#x2F;Google duopoly means there are real restrictions on what kinds of apps&#x2F;services you&#x27;re allowed to access. Yes Google allows you to sideload apps, but if you use the same arguments about &quot;they built the platform, they can charge&#x2F;restrict whatever they want&quot; that people use for Apple, what happens if Google takes that away and you&#x27;re left with no real choice?<p>I would have a hard time defining a legal principle of which industries are so critical that they deserve regulation, but I would say there&#x27;s definitely an argument for applying it to smartphones, and less for something like game consoles. Ultimately it comes down to political discussions to decide what is worthy of regulation; over time, we&#x27;ve decided that things like transportation, finance, communications, food, medicine, and so forth require regulation, while other areas are very loosely regulated if at all.')
