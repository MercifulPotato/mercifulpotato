But to be honest, why is a well designed REST API with a developer portal and amazing documentation not capable of delivering exactly that? Take Stripe for example. Would Stripe be as successful as it is with GraphQL? If yes I believe they would have had to build a lot of additional tooling to make it work. The same they did for their REST API by the way. They invested a tremendous effort into their documentation and developer portal. I guess that&#x27;s the essence of a successful API strategy. Whatever technology you choose, you must invest in the developer experience, hence build good documentation, example use cases, etc..')
