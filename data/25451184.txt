There is nothing &quot;minority&quot; about this, every group needs same protection and no one should be targeted. A reasonable person can not even guess how evil the government can get.<p>- Trump wanted to target certain folks with work authorizations. There was no legal way for him do end the program easily. So he insisted they are a threat to national security. Then he demanded they submit their biometric data every time they want to renew they authorization&#x2F;visa (note that DHS or State Dept. already have their biometric data). Then all they had to do was to reduce work force in the biometric collection centers. As a consequence now the processing of these visas&#x2F;work authorizations can take upto 18 months. Which effectively forces these people out of jobs. This is being done in the name of protecting Americans from terrorism.<p>There are number of ways this health data can be weaponized against immigrations or minorities.<p>- A rogue administration can classify infected immigrants as a public threat. (If that sounds a stretch remember kids from Iran are already a public threat, and children of Indian H1B holders have to submit their fingerprints every 3 years to ensure they are not public threats).<p>- If you ever have lied on any form about your covid infection or knowledge about it, but government data suggests you had covid during that time and you knew about it, that can be considered &quot;bad moral character&quot; and you naturalization can be denied or even revoked.<p>- Imagine a poor neighborhood where a particular &quot;undesirable&quot; group lives and a lot of people there test positive, now government can engage in propaganda that this evil group is spreading COVID.<p>Secondly, trust the creative ability of people like Stephen Miller to come up with more wide ranging excuses.')
