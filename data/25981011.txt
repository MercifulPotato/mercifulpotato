I played around with the demo and launched an SSH session for the last layer (hosting the website). And I was able to trigger a VM reboot from the shell. And now the website is not up anymore. Curious to know if there&#x27;s any monitoring or alerting that I can see when something like this is happening? And how do I go about debugging it&#x2F;restoring functionality?')
