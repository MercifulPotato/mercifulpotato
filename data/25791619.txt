I met a family of immigrants. I learned through their eight-year old son his parents lost their jobs, couldn&#x27;t find legal employment, did not speak english. As they were at a shelter, I imagine they were decent candidates to be picked up by ICE.<p>Nonetheless, I agree with your post. This is a solvable problem but it is only solvable at the housing level.')
