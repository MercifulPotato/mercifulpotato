Ultimately I formed a small company around it and sold it 6 months later to a hosting company for $75k.  I was stoned for 90% of the development work, and was also coming down off of an MDMA trip when I pitched the idea. I literally walked into a hosting company owned by a friend at random (after not seeing him for 3 years) and told him I&#x27;d built this thing and that he needed it for their cloud offering.')
