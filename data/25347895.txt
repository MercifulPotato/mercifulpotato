It functioned exactly as an ancient fortress did - providing high ground, spotting enemy movement, safety of supplies, etc.<p>Another recent example is:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Second_Battle_of_Donetsk_Airport" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Second_Battle_of_Donetsk_Airpo...</a><p>This was NOT fortified, but allowed concealment, and was held through heavy bombardment, offering a tactical advantage.<p>Yes, US&#x2F;Russia&#x2F;China could pound it into the ground, but that takes a LOT of ordinance.<p>Btw, WW II is FULL of these examples.<p>I think the misconception comes from the fact that &quot;modern weapons&quot; - jets, radars, comm sites, missiles, etc cant be &quot;secured&quot; in these facilities. This is true. But that doesn&#x27;t mean they can&#x27;t be held through heavy bombardment and house mortars, snipers, ATGMs, small supply caches, etc.')
