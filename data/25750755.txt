They even bombed a court house. There&#x27;s videos of &quot;antifa&quot; who tried to molotov police but accidentally self-immolated instead. It&#x27;s a meme that the media will call these &quot;peaceful protests&quot;.<p>As someone who has no dog in the race, and hates violence -- is this &quot;fake news&quot;?? Do these rabid maga idiots actually have a point?<p>If these protests were organized using FB or Twitter then why aren&#x27;t they also removed from the app stores?<p>FB profited from radicalizing people using &quot;engagement metrics&quot; and machine learning at a massive scale just to sell ads. Now they want to wash their hands clean?<p>These billionaires weren&#x27;t democratically elected and they shouldn&#x27;t be shaping our democracy.')
