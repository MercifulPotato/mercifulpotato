Other than the marketing term &quot;posix file system&quot;, there is not any proof on such claim.<p>I am also not sure how it is a &quot;distributed&quot; file system given its storage is entirely done by S3. Should I call my backup program that backups my data to S3 every night a &quot;distributed system&quot;? When running on top of Redis, it explicitly mentions that Redis cluster is not supported. I haven&#x27;t used Redis for many years, did I miss something here? A &quot;distributed&quot; file system built on top of a single instance of Redis? Sounds not very &quot;distributed&quot; to me.')
