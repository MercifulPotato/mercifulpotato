It easy to not notice someone pop in into the datacentre if no one knows who they are, or is it really the case that no one knows? Like for example some contract worker, let&#x27;s say a &#x27;cleaner&#x27; who was not vetted. Enters the datacenter with a laptop in a cleaning bucket. And you can imagine what kind of damage can be done.\nNow this a clear vulnerability of a datacenter, So let&#x27;s take into account that it is the single point of failure. And Probably there will be another social engineering hacks in the future does to the fact that datacenters are that vulnerable. To avoid this level of vulnerability which further consider embracing the distributed systems design of the internet.')
