After the revolution, the government became loose and dogs multiplied. Where I live, there is a pack of 40-50 in front of the building. They survive on trash and some neighbors feed them regularly, so they are well fed and friendly. Most people here are not married or don&#x27;t have kids, plus most of them have cars. I would not be comfortable having a kid walking around with these dogs (although they are friendly so far).')
