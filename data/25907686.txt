What if it&#x27;s an open problem. What if It&#x27;s a wrong question, based on poor representation of the problem?<p>Ok I see, and yes I agree.<p>Although to me, I don&#x27;t think this is necessarily as big of a problem as people <i>seem unable to stop</i> making it out to be, which I tried to point out in my comment:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25904058" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25904058</a><p>As I see it, the <i>fundamental</i> problem is the infinitely dimensional (recursively self-referencing, paradoxical, etc) nature of reality.  A &quot;right way&quot; to model it is impossible - the best we can do is try to find a &quot;good enough&quot; (across all variables) approach, acknowledge (and gather opinions on) where we have fallen short and could improve, and iterate as you go.  Kind of like life itself, &quot;coincidentally&quot;.<p>In the super short run, even adding a &quot;middle&quot; column would be a huge improvement.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m actually making tool for this exact same thing and the issue is most noticeable in kialo (which I argue is the same thing, with more mature UI). If you made all the research, conversations and planning to know, that answering this &#x27;A or B&#x27; problem solves it, then Kialo (or that app) are perfectly fine tools. But most of the time people don&#x27;t.<p>&gt; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loomio.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loomio.org</a> is another attempt at solving the same problem. It does provide some improvements, but also fails in interesting ways (mostly, I think, through not considering temporality very seriously).<p>I think this is the most interesting (and largely unrecognized) niche out there - in no small part due to the obvious inherent complexity and no obvious business model, but I feel like those may not even be the main reason - I truly that this space is &quot;hard to see&quot; for most people.<p>As for design of your product, what do you think of these pie-in-the-sky ideas (from the link above):<p>&gt; I think that approaches like this website are a not yet a perfect solution, but it feels like a step in the right direction. An improved implementation would have some clever means of allowing a crowd-sourced decomposition of the issue into it&#x27;s constituent entities and behaviors, graphically displayed in some magical way to maximize the likelihood of everyone seeing the big picture free from misunderstanding, which &quot;all&quot; parties could agree upon (no agreement means more refinement is needed) and refer to in their arguments (so we&#x27;re all talking about the same thing), and arguments&#x2F;thinking could take place with precision (attached to the the specific entities and behaviors where the true disagreement resides).<p>&gt; A lot of people may have a strong aversion to this approach as it would turn easy argumentation into a painstakingly laborious &amp; pedantic process, which is a natural consequence of using slow but accurate cognitive processing, rather than fast but unreliable heuristic processing (the root problem in the first place). Arguments under such a methodology would also more closely resemble the scientific method, or systems analysis in software (where one does not simply throw together an analysis and insist that it is 100% free of material flaws).<p>So if you take Trophi as a working prototype, could we add a <i>second phase</i> onto an argument, where &quot;someone smart and unbiased&quot; goes through all the arguments, and decomposes them into some &quot;proper&quot; representation, essentially comprehensively aggregating all the distinct points made in the arguments into a master summary, ideally with some sort of a &quot;properly representational structure&quot; between all the points.  Perhaps then, in a phase 3, there could be voting &amp;&#x2F;or further discussion on this summary, the results of which would be passed back through phase 2 to expand and refine the model, also noting where <i>genuine</i> disagreement remains (<i>specifically where</i> in the complex, multidimensional model), and this process is repeated <i>indefinitely</i> - and when some new event occurs in reality, then that could be run through this very same process, updating the <i>multiple related models</i> based on the results of the process.<p>Obviously this is an incredibly ambitious idea, and is fraught with difficulties (<i>gosh, why is reality so darn complicated!!</i>), but even a half-assed version of it might provide some value - and, perhaps along the way, the true nature of reality might slowly start to dawn on some people, which plausibly might improve the performance of the participants in the overall process, <i>recursively over time</i>.')
