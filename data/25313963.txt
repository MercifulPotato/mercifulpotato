For example, Julia has 1-based indexing and I appreciate it for that when doing computational mathematics. It is closer to familiar notation: A[1][1] is the element of matrix A in row 1 and column 1. In a language with zero-based indexing, it is sometimes easier for me to allocate an extra row and column, wasting memory, than to shift indices and risk an inevitable off-by-one somewhere.')
