CentOS AFAIK doesn&#x27;t get any advance warning, only once RHEL pushes out a security update they rebuild and release.<p>Of course, with this it might be even slower, in that first RHEL pushes out the security update, and then people will start looking whether that change needs to be forward-ported to CentOS stream, or whether it can be used as-is etc.')
