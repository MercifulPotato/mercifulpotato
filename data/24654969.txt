Item(by='pawelk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601579280, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24654698, text='I&#x27;m well aware that Paul Sellers uses machine milled &#x2F; planed &#x2F; dimensioned lumber. I am quite comfortable starting with rough sawn boards straight off the mill (I&#x27;m not crazy enough to re-saw logs by hand). Yes, it requires effort and depending on the size of the project I will either use S4S wood or rip, flatten and true boards by hand.<p>However if I were to have machines in my shop I&#x27;d get a bandsaw first, then a jointer&#x2F;planer. I&#x27;m mostly limited by physical space, not self-imposed constraints, although it is very fulfilling to build something without electricity.')
