What I do know is in many cities they run 2-4 train in for those who start work at 8am, and then run them back out at 5 pm after the people get off work. If this is your case, as it is for many, then I agree. They don&#x27;t want you to take the train to those evening events.<p>It doesn&#x27;t have to be this way. A train could run every 5 minutes all day long. If your city did this would you still insist on driving?')
