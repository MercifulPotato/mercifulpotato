Actually, I&#x27;m not totally surprised, since it was really the Switch that reversed their trajectory of long term decline.  Unless they keep coming up with more nifty little gadgets, I can see them digging their own grave over the next few decades in the sense that they&#x27;ll exist through owning valuable properties but they may not be relevant as a game hardware company.')
