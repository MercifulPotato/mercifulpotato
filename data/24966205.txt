I convinced him (grudgingly) to use a setup much like this (we ended up with Box instead of Dropbox because I got sick of Dropbox trying to grab all my data).<p>Seeing things from his perspective, I was amazed at how successful Google has been in convincing other businesses to take on Gmail, Google Docs, etc. When I think about the enterprise focus of Google, as well as the continuous rebranding, product EOLs, and crappy user interfaces, it&#x27;s hard for me not to see Google as the new Microsoft. As a former Linux desktop user who lived through the whole MS antitrust thing, I find it absolutely bizarre that today, I&#x27;m much happier with Office 365 on the web, than I was with Google Docs.<p>I still worry about all my photos being in iCloud, but it seems like less of a risk since I&#x27;m a customer of Apple, rather than a product of Google.')
