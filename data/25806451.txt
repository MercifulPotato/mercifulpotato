It uses the deaths of 3 people to push some sort of BS agenda.<p>&gt; and tall become suicide magnets<p>You can engineer a reduction in suicides.  And cities do. Moving suicides from jumps to pills saves people.<p>But it&#x27;s a complicated conversation. Some things of beauty use a false risk as part of the beauty, you <i>could</i> fall off. Unfortunately people use that.<p>All the time we do things that kill. Like Skiing.
