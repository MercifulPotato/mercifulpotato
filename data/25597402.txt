That aside, I like rogues. Specifically I like starting games out. Assessing one&#x27;s starting positioning and creating a long term strategy is fun. It&#x27;s a lot like board games. It also asks you to learn generalized strategies that work well, vs. other games which, when there&#x27;s no consequence for loss. In a rogue, you need to play in a style that is consistently effective. In a traditional game, you might as well trend towards a high variance strat instead, that&#x27;s kind of dumb but might just work.<p>I&#x27;m growing weary of progression systems though. Darkest Dungeon, Enter the Gungeon, and 20XX are a few titles I&#x27;ve played in the past year where I got annoyed at feeling like endgame content was designed for having certain permanent upgrades and didn&#x27;t really want to grind them out. A lot of these games have an inflection point at the very end where the difficulty ramps up suddenly. Playing through the first 90% of a game many times is a bit dull after a while. Especially if you feel like practicing early levels does nothing for efficacy later on.')
