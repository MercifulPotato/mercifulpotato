I just think if you think the way you describe it, it&#x27;s not very empathic and also not very thoughtful. And I wanted to tell you that in an attempt to give you another perspective on what padolsey wrote. I can live with you not being empathic or thoughtful. I just failed to give you another in my mind morally and intellectually superior perspective. I wanted to give it to you for free :)<p>You seem to have a problem with me thinking that about you. When I try to explain my perspective, you seem to try to dismiss my arguments by making up ways I might not be empathic myself etc.<p>You constantly ask &quot;What is the point?&quot; Why do you think the woman wrote about her spoon theory? What is her point? Do you really think padolsey wrote the comment on relativistic thinking to play thought police?')
