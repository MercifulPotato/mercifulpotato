This does not provide anonymity (likely requires ID to sign up) but does provide an encrypted channel through the extra shady ISPs that provide the actual network connection (even worse if you ever use free wifi).<p>I&#x27;ve been doing this with RamNode for a few years with their $15&#x2F;year OpenVZ mostly via SOCKS with DNS passthrough (the main disadvantage of this is that it doesn&#x27;t allow direct DNS resolution and some adblock techniques require being able to do that).  This includes a fixed dedicated IP address.  Presumably they will eventually support wireguard and then everything should work without fuss (you could setup OpenVPN if you are so inclined and I think would need to if you want to additionally use anonymity providing VPNs on top of that).  There are still a few issues with various sites but it sounds like it is quite a bit less annoying than anonymous VPNs, at least once Google and Cloudflare figure out what you are doing.  The 500GB bandwidth is per month and generously accounted so I&#x27;ve only once reached it (it would be $4&#x2F;month for an additional TB).  I&#x27;d guess there are a number of low priced ISPs that would work.  Most software I&#x27;ve used seems to respect ALL_PROXY=socks5h:&#x2F;&#x2F;... these days although not all.')
