Mirrorless cameras cost a couple thousand dollars (I have one) and the last thing I am going to wear down&#x2F;abuse this equipment with, is to jump into daily meeting lol. \nAt the low end, there are decent webcams, like Logitech HD 1080p, but it costs over 100$ and honestly, it&#x27;s a couple of years behind the current. There don&#x27;t seem to be webcams of around 100 to 200$ that are state of the art. If you look at mobile phones, you see the difference. Those mobile cameras are like 1&#x2F;5 or 1&#x2F;10th of the size a webcam could be, so there is LOTs of room for improvement, even in this price segment.<p>I am pretty sure we could easily get 4k recording with decent, artificial depth-of-field (LIDAR &amp; all) under decent lighting conditions (which is why this can be done cheap) at a price point of 100 to 200$. Just nobody seems to be doing it.<p>And yeah we definitely do stream 1080p over meetings and most people are always like &quot;Oh wow, what kind of webcam are you using&quot;. That&#x27;s for my years old logitech... The bitrates are pretty low, even for 4k. You can definitely have a couple of those over almost any current internet connection without issues.<p>My main gripe is depth-of-field. Add some LIDAR and I am happy. Apple webcam anyone?')
