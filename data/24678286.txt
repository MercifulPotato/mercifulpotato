But I think this is the right choice: if people really, seriously started getting hurt because of freedom of speech, it seems right for people to take the privilege away. But, to be honest, I can’t even imagine how that might be possible.&quot;<p>IMHO, this &quot;safety&quot; argument makes up a large part of the argument made by many proponents of modern authoritarianism. This makes me think that Aaron may have supported many of the modern restrictions on free speech, but I certainly don&#x27;t speak for him. IMHO, many people (particularly in the West) not only &quot;imagine&quot; that it &quot;might&quot; be possible, but actively believe that it is a reality that is already happening. IMHO it is irrelevant whether people get &quot;seriously hurt&quot; because it is a ridiculous metric to optimise for. People get &quot;really, seriously hurt&quot; on a daily basis by: access to sugar, access to alcohol, access to tobacco, the right to bear arms, vehicles.<p>Edit: s&#x2F;speach&#x2F;speech&#x2F;')
