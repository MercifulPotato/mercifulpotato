How utterly self-congratulatory.<p>Another problem I have with EA is how incredibly fragile it is: because it is so reductive and narrowly-focused, you are likely to optimize for the wrong thing (the map is never the territory) and might even do more harm than good.  In the best case scenario you might do a lot of good, though.')
