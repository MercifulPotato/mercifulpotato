It&#x27;s an authoritarian one-party state that happens to hold elections. These elections are always won by the same party.<p>The democracy index rates Singapore at 6.02&#x2F;10. About 0.03 away from being a &quot;hybrid regime&quot; and currently rated a &quot;flawed democracy.&quot; It&#x27;s ranked as worse than places such as Ukraine (currently in a civil war), Thailand (run by a military dictatorship), etc.<p>Having been stuck in the lockdown they imposed earlier this year, which was widely unpopular with the city&#x27;s residents and which lead to the biggest support for the opposition in the country&#x27;s history, I would not at all call Singapore a democracy.')
