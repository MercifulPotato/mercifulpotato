Believe it or not, there are people outside the extra privacy-conscious bubble who do not at all mind their devices listening.<p>Like I already pointed out this is nonsense.<p>Always on listening even with perfect parsing would INCREDIBLY noisy. There are a million and one reasons for a term to come up in speech. The simplest conversation could surface hundreds of targeting terms.<p>Meanwhile they literally own the device and the services most people use. They have your search, they have your email, they have social graphs. They can literally make inferences before you even think to talk about them with other people! (and we&#x27;ve seen this happen before with things like disease and pregnancy reveals)<p><i>We&#x27;re at the point where most people&#x27;s cell phones hold more personal data than they could even recall on demand.</i><p>So why on earth would they go and muddy all that easily weighted data with noisy data like everything you say, literally every other form of interaction is already giving them better more concise information about you...<p>-<p>&gt; There is no proof it happens, and no proof it doesn’t happen, because it’s non-trivial to detect based on network activity. The only evidence is observing content relevant to what was being spoken about being suggested across apps.<p>I can&#x27;t believe people are entertaining this kind of stuff on HN.<p>You make an unreasonable claim... then act like <i>because</i> you yourself can&#x27;t prove your unreasonable claim it should be entertained? What?<p>That&#x27;s not how that works. You have no actual proof for your unreasonable claim... then that&#x27;s it. It ends there. <i>The burden doesn&#x27;t suddenly fall on others to prove the contrary!</i><p>Come back with even a modicum of proof. Literally any real proof other than anecdotes where the ad companies who literally have almost all the data in your life anyways are able to come up with topics you&#x27;re interested in... and maybe someone will entertain this.<p>And no, talking about something and getting an ad for it after is not proof any more than having a leaf fall on your head while you stand under in a mid-autumn forest right after you whispered &quot;gravity&quot; is proof that the forest is listening to your words.')
