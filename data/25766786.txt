It was an exercise they gave to a bunch of scientists and mathematicians to see if it was plausible that they could even decode the meaning behind an alien message, if one were ever found.  (And also probably to provide some credentials for candidate experts to consult in such a scenario.)  They did quite well.  That said, the code itself was created by a human, so I&#x27;m not sure it has the value they think it does.  One thing higher education in STEM taught me was that human thinking is actually really easy to spot.  We, for the most part, really just use the same tired old tricks again and again in different contexts.')
