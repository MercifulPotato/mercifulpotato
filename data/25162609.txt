I wanted the Homepods because they&#x27;re omni-directional, they sound great, and I think they&#x27;re really cute! I would&#x27;ve happily paid extra for that set of traits, but Apple seems determined not to have me as a customer.<p>What I ended up doing is getting two of the Bose Home Speaker 500, which has sideways-firing speakers. I leave them in aux mode all the time and arranged them so that no matter which side of the shelf you&#x27;re on, the left audio will be on your left side and the right audio will be on your right side.')
