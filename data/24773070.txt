I really hope that this state can pull it&#x27;s head out of Joe Arpaio&#x27;s ass, and wriggle leftwards a little bit.<p>I think the weirdest and most noticeable thing is people riding motorcycles without helmets.<p>That said; yeah, the heat is not really that bad (it took me about 2 years to acclimate), and there are options for relief.  Surprisingly, I think we get more rain in Arizona than in California (not this summer though), and winters are definitely much colder in Arizona than they are in California.')
