Highly regulated availability of safer substitutes for the worst drugs might reduce uptake of those worse drugs.<p>Hold on, that logic isn&#x27;t sound. You are saying because the illegal drug trade is enormous, therefore the illegal status of drugs has no suppressive effect on new user uptake? Why can&#x27;t both statements be true? &quot;The illegal trade is enormous <i>and</i> making drugs legal would make the drug user base even <i>more</i> enormous&quot;<p>Illegality status might suppress 50% of new users and impulse buyers, who knows. You can claim illegality does <i>not</i> suppress 100% (that much is clear), but I guarantee illegality has suppressed some non-zero % of potential users from trying it.')
