The CEO just does not seem to have any common sense, openly taunting regulators on Twitter, racking up defamation lawsuits and SEC penalties, etc. There&#x27;s a lot of startup era hype and showmanship projects that don&#x27;t come out as promised.<p>As for crypto, I definitely see a future for it and plan to invest soon, but I will wait to see if it dips back down a little bit before buying at such a large high.')
