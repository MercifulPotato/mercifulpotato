Not very successful, but it tried its best. Running this through explain while thinking of daloks revealed some dependent subqueries. Those are the devil in mysql because they are evaluated per row in the outer query. That takes a lot of time very quickly. Eventually we wrangjangled the dependency into a terrifying group by such that the dependent query could be precomputed and the outer query just joins with the result. Boom, runtime down to 2 minutes.<p>In another case everyone panicked ... until one of my dudes added an index - which took about a day - and slashed runtimes from 18 hour to 12 minutes. Learning to optimize queries on your RDBMS of choice is very powerful.')
