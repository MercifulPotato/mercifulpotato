Item(by='BeetleB', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603486221, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24873037, text='&gt; Some knives (switchblades and gravity knives especially) are illegal in most places.<p>I think it&#x27;s usually about carrying them in public outside your house. Likely not as illegal to have them at home.<p>Gravity knives are scary in that the police have occasionally argued that certain common pocketknives (e.g. Leatherman) can be used as a gravity knife and arrest people (usually minorities of the wrong color). I once was going on a road trip across multiple states and had to research the laws of each state because I was carrying a Leatherman.')
