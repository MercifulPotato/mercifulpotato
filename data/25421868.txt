In similar analogy you can maybe make some friends by getting addicted to heroin or becoming homeless too.<p>Just to be clear - I&#x27;ve wasted much of my youth with single player gaming. It was pretty addictive, no question about it. I&#x27;ll do my best to get my kids have better life than that - no active screen around their young age, being very active in sports, nature, mountain activities, travel around the world backpacking etc. If they will choose to get hooked on games, so be it, but at least I&#x27;ve shown them many other, for me better options.')
