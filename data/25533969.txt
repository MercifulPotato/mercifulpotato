There&#x27;s a low &quot;skill floor&quot; on it.<p>Programming has a much bigger skill floor - syntax, memory management, indirection, and other conceptual forms of knowledge. But once you have the concept, it doesn&#x27;t matter a great deal what exact things you type if it&#x27;s implementing that concept successfully.<p>But music has tradition, and not just one - it&#x27;s one per instrument, with subsets for different playing styles. When you get classical training(which I did) there&#x27;s a lot of pedigree built-in to being a &quot;student of so-and-so&quot;. You learn technical competence - how to not injure yourself by playing(RSI is a big one but it also occurs with posture, breath control and so forth) - but also to express the music interpretively, a translator who turns notes on the page into a dynamic performance, and this involves both repetition and attention to detail that is suited for coaching. Music can be very athletic at the world-class level!<p>Over time I&#x27;ve been able to cross over the two worlds - finding ways of programming that are a little more iterative, more like performance - and approaching music from a more theory-and-concepts perspective has helped me understand compositions beyond the surface expression. But the broad differences still remain.')
