A cleaner at a quarantine hotel caught it from  a returned citizen in quarantine (they&#x27;re still not sure how), and spent 5 days in the community while infected. So far, it looks like we got very lucky, and the only person they&#x27;ve found that she infected is her partner.<p>From my point of view, the US (and UK and India and many other countries) have a categorically different problem to Australia (and New Zealand and Singapore and Taiwan and a few other countries).<p>We&#x27;ve _largely_ got things under control in Australia. Most of our cases in the last ~3 months have been hotel quarantine, with worrying incidences of outbreaks where it&#x27;s escaped from quarantine but been tracked back and identified. Sydney currently has 3 clusters, with about 200 locally acquired cases between them in the last 4 weeks. I&#x27;m pretty sure every single one of them has been contact traced back to it&#x27;s source of infection - and that contact tracing has also proactively got forward to get a very significant percentage of close contacts of infected people contacted and tested, and the places they visited while infectious identified, contact traced where possible (lots of venues are required to have covid checkin so people can be contacted an informed if they&#x27;ve potentially been exposed) - and any venues where they are not confident the covid checkins are comprehensive they publicise fairly widely and strongly encourage testing for anyone who visited during similar times.<p>This _only_ works because the numbers are so low. It all went to shit in Melbourne when a quarantine hotel breach happened and it got up over 700 cases a day, the contact tracing ability totally fell apart, and Melbourne went into a hard lockdown for several months to get it back under control.<p>In the US? Our approach just won&#x27;t work. The virus is out and prevalent in your community. You have no hope of comprehensively contact tracing all of your positive cases, or identifying and mitigating all the venues they were in while infectious and contacting all the people who are at risk of exposure. The scale of your problem is totally insurmountable using the tools that work for us. If vaccination and&#x2F;or herd immunity doesn&#x27;t work out soon? You people might be totally fucked. ~1% of you will probably die from the virus, and quite likely a lot more will die from your medical system breaking under the load.')
