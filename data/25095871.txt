Twitter and github?<p>At one point I was signed up in over 300 places using my Google account. Eventually the thought occurred to me, &quot;what happens if I get locked out of this account?&quot; And I don&#x27;t really mean shutting it down. I lost a Microsoft account with over $3000 worth of purchases and 10 years of history, because I lost access to the recovery email address it used. So since then I&#x27;ve made sure to &quot;spread the risk&quot; so to speak.<p>Through 2 years of effort it is now only a handful. Some of them remain because either a) there&#x27;s no other way to sign up or b) there&#x27;s no way to convert it to an email based account.<p>But still - that&#x27;s 2 years. 2 years of weekly, sometimes daily, moving yet another thing off that login (but it still uses the email! that&#x27;s the next step -- kill the email).<p>The level of effort has been gargantuan. For some people, it would simply never ever happen. To lose a Google account would not only be damaging, it would be like your entire life being erased.<p>The level of damage here is enormous and Google has to take responsibility for the power it has amassed.<p>If they want to terminate all free accounts, it&#x27;d be a wonderful thing. Either people would finally be free of the behemoth, or Google&#x27;s incentives would change to finally care about users (well.... hopefully).')
