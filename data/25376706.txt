It is possible to make large, complicated apps without creating a monstrosity. That you are making something like this is a manifestation of an engineering culture that has too many cooks in the kitchen, a lack of specific engineering talent spent on finding issues and telling the teams shipping them to stop, people shipping libraries that they don&#x27;t need and tech debt that was never pruned away. An app with 100x more people working on it should not be 100x larger, because it certainly won&#x27;t have 100x more features in it. Sure, Uber is more than &quot;a map and a couple views&quot; but the fact remains that their app should never have been in the state that it was.')
