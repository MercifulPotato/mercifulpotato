Item(by='twblalock', descendants=None, kids=[25312691, 25312734], score=None, time=1607151634, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25312294, text='&gt; But that whole &quot;I&#x27;ll get a loan to get a degree&quot; is a tool for servitude. US really needs to get out of that.<p>You might be surprised to learn that the average student loan balance on graduation in the US is about $30k. That is actually a bit less than the average price of a new car sold last year, which is about $37k.<p>That is not a life-crushing amount of debt. It represents 4 years of college education for the price of a Toyota Camry. Why is it that we think that it&#x27;s OK to spend that much money on a car, but unconscionable to pay that much for four years of college? Keep in mind that unlike car loans, college loans have public service loan forgiveness, can be postponed when one is unemployed, and have income-based repayment programs. If you don&#x27;t pay for the Camry it&#x27;s gonna get towed.')
