It&#x27;s literally saying &quot;because they&#x27;re the only ones who have access to their proprietary system that we already locked ourselves in too.... they get the business&quot;.<p>&quot;...so the staffs are ever more transient&quot;. Yeah, there&#x27;s some idea that &quot;company X&quot; does ABC.  The people at company X do ABC, but you are at the whim of institutional knowledge and tribal info systems within that company.  The superstars who made ABC work 4 years ago may all be gone, and the current people are trying to make a name for themselves by making &#x27;The New Process&#x27; so any success from ABC isn&#x27;t at all guaranteed to translate to your new project.')
