For an existing house, it&#x27;s already there.  It takes over 100 years to turn over the housing stock, so you&#x27;d need to maintain the gas infrastructure for quite some time before you&#x27;d start saving any money.<p>&gt; Then there&#x27;s the gas consumption, but I don&#x27;t know how that compares to electricity<p>Here in the Bay Area gas is a lot cheaper than electricity.  But that&#x27;s because our utility is a crappy monopoly.  In cities with their own power generation, like Santa Clara, they&#x27;re on par with each other.')
