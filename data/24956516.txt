SIP is complicated in unexpected places and even with the best intentions ALGs broke packets by rewriting wrong parts or making header formats invalid.<p>But specifically regarding your question, sip looks like http. Same structure &#x2F; similar response codes. They probably didn&#x27;t want to write a very strict sip-detector and ended up checking &quot;looks like a verb+destination+ headers? Good enough&quot;. Or maybe it&#x27;s to support http proxies where a http CONNECT session can turn into sip-tcp? (Never seen that in practice, but I guess it&#x27;s possible)<p>Or maybe it&#x27;s just that the alg processing is per-packet, not per-session? Who knows. Just login to your router and turn off ALG. Your SIP phone most likely already knows how to deal with NAT using stun&#x2F;turn.')
