It&#x27;s painful for me (I hold my pen badly, and always have done), and I have pretty bad writing unless I pay attention to it.<p>I definitely make better notes when I&#x27;m writing, but also I -think- about the problem at hand when I do so, and this generally means I come up with better solutions.  While it&#x27;s anecdotal, I think it&#x27;s the same as speaking to someone.  I can think of conversations in my head, and they don&#x27;t go anywhere compared to when I speak with my girlfriend about the same topic - even when it&#x27;s something technical that she doesn&#x27;t have any particular input in, I can come up with new ideas when doing this, and she&#x27;s a counsellor so she has taught me the value of talking, anyway.<p>There&#x27;s more to systems than just the &#x27;efficiency&#x27; that a lot of commenters are mentioning here, IMO.')
