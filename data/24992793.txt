I guess that would need a second SDR, or perhaps you can cycle through the two frequencies and get enough messages to still be usable?<p>Edit: Or maybe support for ATC radio traffic? Again, it probably needs a second SDR, but it would make it much easier for those who are interested than it is now. I would love to be able to just run some daemon and get an audio stream on a local port and maybe an audio player in the web client.')
