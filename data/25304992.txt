These people are selling the fantasy of success&#x2F;self-efficacy to those vulnerable people lacking executive functioning and prone to daydream their life.<p>I can&#x27;t count how many &quot;techniques&quot; I came up with myself over the years. Enthusiastic, convinced and most importantly, of course, not successful. Motivated, getting-things-done people don&#x27;t have some secret methodology, they have enough dopamine to take a risk in energy expenditure. You know which totally secret behavior will increase productivity? Taking a pill of amphetamine every morning.<p>Not saying y&#x27;all got ADHD, but there is a spectrum and it&#x27;s not bullshit. If you constantly feel the need to explode tasks and compulsively need to get to the &quot;root&quot; of the problem, thoroughly prepare each new project, but got a hard time actually starting (or finishing) anything... Another guide is not your solution.<p>You need to learn to endure the unfair pain of extra boredom and the feeling (self)stimulatory deprivation; help your brain to dopamine with diet, with timing sugar and frequently exercise. Or get  ADHD diagnostic, if things were like this since childhood and you always struggled. &lt;3')
