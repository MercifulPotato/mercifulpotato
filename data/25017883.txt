I think that&#x27;s OK. Marketing works, and it&#x27;s a critical component of any company. A lot of good marketing isn&#x27;t trackable, because it plants a seed inside a person&#x27;s head far before that person buys anything. It tells a compelling story. The world is full of data-addicted PMs and sales VPs and ad purchasers and CEOs, but good marketing is more than that.<p>But how do you know it works if you can&#x27;t track it?<p>I get your point about it being more than hyper-focused short term metrics, but how do you actually know it&#x27;s working if you can&#x27;t quantify it?  Imagine if Tesla spent a ton of money on advertising (compared to the $0 they currently spend), would people not just assume the strong brand is tied to whatever marketing campaign might exist?<p>I am not in marketing (although I have had to do limited marketing in the past), but it <i>feels</i> like most of it is just carried along by cargo-culting and inertia.  Similar to how everyone wants to be like Google so they copy their interview process, their monorepo, and other things without actually understanding <i>why</i> Google does that.  Obviously some people are great at marketing but I&#x27;m not convinced most marketing money is actually seeing a positive ROI.  That said, I&#x27;m genuinely happy to be proven wrong.')
