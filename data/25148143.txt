As anachronistic as it sounds, mailing lists might be the past, present, and future of community building. No &quot;platforms&quot; needed.<p>Edit: Ok, HN <i>is</i> a forum I obviously participate in, though for some reason I was thinking about forums with a narrow tech, hobby, or product focus<p>Edit2: the end of classic phpBB-based forums was that pages were plastered with ads at the top, bottom, left, right, and in-between; this was the result of (untargetted) ad prices going down, which, in turn, is the result of &quot;platforms&quot; and the attention economy we&#x27;re enduring')
