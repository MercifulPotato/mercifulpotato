Best case, that seems it might be covered under the secondary processor exception, worse case, the FSF would not endorse it. Since you have the ability to reverse engineer this and fix the situation once and for all, why not do it? What is the real problem here? If you are trying to get Purism to pay you for this work, I would suggest contacting them about that privately.')
