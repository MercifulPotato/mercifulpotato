Each time you donate, you select either one genetic test panel or one blood test panel. The organization uses the money saved &#x2F; earned from the blood donation to pay for the test. Possibly it also requires signing off on providing information to a research study as an additional revenue stream to pay for the testing &#x2F; subsidize the creation of new panels.<p>I&#x27;m guessing this may not be economically feasible though. Additionally, you have the issue that people who can&#x27;t afford health insurance would be literally selling their body for healthcare. Strictly speaking, it might be better than the alternative, but it&#x27;s still not good that it&#x27;s even necessary to consider something like this.')
