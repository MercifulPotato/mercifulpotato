I used to be part of the latter, but the reality is they lack a huge amount of context and experience. Being a talented developer-employee, even an early employee is jut not the same as being the founder &#x2F; maker &#x2F; starter. I sincerely doubt any of these people spent every single day of the past seven years worrying about the fate of their entire company; if you did, you&#x27;re an incredible employee but you should have been running your own gig.')
