Canada has fixed it. Interac settlement is 30 minutes max, with a $5000 limit, and interbank transfers are end-of-same-day. This is even assuming you have to change banks: there are only five banks, and they&#x27;re regionally divided. Settlement in the same bank (and their investment arms!) is 30 minutes, even if the money is going to a different person. I paid for my house with this, and the payment was received before we walked out of the room!<p>It&#x27;s only America&#x27;s payment system that&#x27;s woefully behind.')
