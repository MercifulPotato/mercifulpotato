At this point in history, her words are deafening relevant:<p>&gt; “Evil comes from a failure to think. It defies thought for as soon as thought tries to engage itself with evil and examine the premises and principles from which it originates, it is frustrated because it finds nothing there. That is the banality of evil.”<p>The failure of Twitter isn&#x27;t active editorializing or the lack thereof.<p>The failure of Twitter is to not provide the necessary affordances in its design, its functionality, its business model, its values, its policies, its mission and its vision that allows a userbase of over a billion people to self-govern itself in a way that helps prevent what happened yesterday.<p>... and that&#x27;s absolutely, undeniably a failure to think about the consequences of the product that Twitter has pushed into the world for the past 15 years.<p>... and it&#x27;s not only a failure. It&#x27;s a failure lost in it&#x27;s own pure and utter banality.<p>Twitter isn&#x27;t free of from criticisms. It&#x27;s not a force of nature or the universe that disrupted lives in unfortunate ways. It&#x27;s a product designed with a clear intent by humans for other humans. And therein lies the responsibility of Twitter, and everyone who provides a soapbox for others, to which it should be held accountable.<p>History doesn&#x27;t repeat itself unless we repeat - remember, reflect, rehash, re-tell - history. And we do that from a place of empathy and understanding. Everything else is inconsequential.')
