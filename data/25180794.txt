Such as wanting to get some work done, or being tired of endlessly debating the same things over and over again. (Or not wanting to get fired if it turns out that your opinion is somehow different from the majority, even if it does not support the status quo. There are more than two possible opinions.)<p>By similar logic, if you are not arguing about politics 24 hours a day, you spend the rest of your time defending status quo. Would you agree that this is a fair description of the moments you don&#x27;t spend talking politics?')
