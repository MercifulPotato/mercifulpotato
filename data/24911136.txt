Maybe the correct answer is an &quot;anthropic principle&quot;-style non-answer: External stimuli have to affect the human brain and body <i>somehow</i>. There has got to be some internal representation of what you percieve. Now we have the capability of reflection. To some extent, we can think about how we think, and we can perceive how we percieve. Naturally you then can wonder: Why&#x2F;how does this stimuli lead to this internal state? But if the states were different, you would be wondering about <i>those</i> states. And you only wonder about it, because you <i>can</i> due to reflection.')
