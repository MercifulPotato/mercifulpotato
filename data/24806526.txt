E.g., several Denes Agay classical+romantic compilations, the standard basic Bach + Beethoven, simple Chopin, John Field, Philip Glass (repetitive patterns help), etc.<p>Another frustrating thing is it&#x27;s not just long-term finger memory that kills me, my real-time memory bus is slow when learning a piece -- the transfer of &quot;what notes comes next&quot; down to my fingers, just very slow and error-prone.  I&#x27;ve tried a mental exercise where I try to only think about what to play &quot;next&quot; and just let what I&#x27;m playing &quot;now&quot; take care of itself.  It kind of works and feels very different.  Basically, to stay 2 beats ahead of the music at all times.<p>Ugh, but it&#x27;s still a struggle.  My finger dexterity is fine.  My musical knowledge is actually pretty advanced and I can play expressively and convincingly -- but only when I can remember the damn piece.  My memory is like a balloon that won&#x27;t stay inflated.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Classics-Moderns-Intermediate-Grade-Millions&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0825640377" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Classics-Moderns-Intermediate-Grade-M...</a>')
