I&#x27;ll roughly assume with a second launch full of fuel, a purchaser with the right gear could put close to 100 tons on the lunar surface for 200M or so, once they get the kinks out and the price down.<p>So why not just pre-purchase 20 of these for your favorite lunar project, such as the ULT? If they bring prices down you get a cool lunar base. If they don&#x27;t, you don&#x27;t pay. That much payload delivered to the moon for $4B would be an incredible bargain, and it also serves to further incentivize SpaceX.<p>I&#x27;m sure I have something about the economics wrong, but I don&#x27;t know what. Seems to me like we should be <i>very</i> close to a lot of back-burner space projects getting off the drawing boards.<p>What don&#x27;t I understand?')
