But I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;ll be much discontent just because immigration is not as heated an issue in the US, and we have more room to grow (especially on the infrastructure side).<p>However, we do have to consider that immigration does allow for businesses to grow faster, because our main bottleneck -- population, becomes less of a concern. Automation is a big concern in this regard, but we can just kick that can down the road.')
