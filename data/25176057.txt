You take the lead identifying issues and finding ways to mitigate how problems impact users. Yet, that doesn&#x27;t mean you should be attaching debuggers to running processes and adding breakpoints here and there. You are expected to avoid downtime, meet service levels, and coordinate with all teams to fix operational issues and increase code quality.<p>If you&#x27;re not the primary dev and you stumble on an issue, you are expected to file a ticket and bring it to the attention of anyone who is in a position to address the issue.')
