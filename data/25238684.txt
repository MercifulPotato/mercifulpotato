What&#x27;s wrong with water? Simple plain water, not even carbonated. I don&#x27;t get why so many people out there &quot;can&#x27;t drink it&quot;. Apparently it doesn&#x27;t taste good. WTF? I mean yes you can taste differences in different waters based on mineral content and such but you get used to it. It&#x27;s the _difference_ from what you&#x27;re used to that makes it bad usually (again exceptions exist where the water just tastes bad - find other water). Ever been to Iceland? If not go look up what their water is like.')
