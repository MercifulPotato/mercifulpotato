They&#x27;re nice to have, but its probably going to be quite rare that I will use them. I am, however, interested in coroutines and modules too (the other two of the three main things 20 adds). I also agree on the initializers, that&#x27;s something I wish C++ had added long ago, since C has had it for so long.<p>Funny thing is, I didn&#x27;t even think of ranges while writing my comment above. I like the idea of them and they do allow some nice code, but its not something I&#x27;ve been wishing I had.<p>For C++17, there&#x27;s a bunch of small things that I like: standard attributes like [[nodiscard]], nested namespace definitions are a nice convenience, constexpr if statements and some of the library additions are nice (string_view, optional, etc). Destructuring auto, as you said. Nothing as exciting as what C++11 or 20 adds, but still nice to haves.')
