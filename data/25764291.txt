What about time off? Pension? Parental leave? Medical costs? Way of life ( as in, work stops at 6pm or 7pm or whatever, and then it&#x27;s your free time; weekends are usually off limits; you don&#x27;t have to own a car and waste hours in traffic depending on where you live, etc.)<p>Furthermore, the rest of what you said is painting hundreds of thousands of business across more than 30 countries with the same brush. I work in a European company, and it&#x27;s nothing like that. You shouldn&#x27;t generalise like that.')
