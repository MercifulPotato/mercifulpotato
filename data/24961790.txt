After I learned rust and tried to mix it with C code I believe that Stroustrup made a mistake by making C++ compatible with C on a syntax level. Strictly defined FFI boundary is a good thing. It liberates. It allow to track precisely what boundary APIs are, it makes boundary APIs the separate documented thing.<p><i>&gt; An opposite example to use Rust for an Nginx module is CloudFlare&#x27;s Quiche, an Nginx extension to support QUIC and HTTP&#x2F;3 protocols. While it&#x27;s definitely possible to use Rust for such kind of tasks, the guys, besides the FFI code for C&#x2F;C++ bindings, still had to write some C code to patch Nginx.</i><p>I took a look at the patch, and it is not clear to me, that the patch was needed because rust wouldn&#x27;t allow to do it the other way. It seems that cloudflare split their code into rust and C for some other reason, because there is a LOT of C code, it doesn&#x27;t seem to me as a glue code at all. I believe it does more than just glue rust module and nginx. I&#x27;m not sure what the reason, but I could guess that the idea was to add possibility to use different implementations of QUIC and HTTP&#x2F;3 in nginx, not just this particular rust implementation. So they extended nginx for this, and then implemented rust module.')
