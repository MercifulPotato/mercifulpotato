Adam Smith and Ricardo already showed that you should abolish your own trade barriers unilaterally regardless of what the other guy is doing, no need for any agreements.<p>That&#x27;s obviously stupid because it would undermine all regulation because you can always ship products to an unregulated market and then ship them back.
