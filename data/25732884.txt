During quarantine I&#x27;m a part of several Online Social circles, which are basically bi-weekly zoom calls to crack jokes on. The owner of the group still needs to ban people from time to time for saying racist or sexist things.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t think it can scale much beyond 20 people, with 1 person determining if certain conduct is okay or not. And say you get kicked out for making a joke or whatever, then like in real life you have to find another Social circle')
