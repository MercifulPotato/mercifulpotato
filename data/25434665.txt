When the thread is new, the only things to object to are the article and the title, so comments come from people objecting to those. Such posts tend to be reflexive and shallow because those are the fastest reactions to feel and the quickest to write. Such comments are made of pre-existing thoughts and pent-up energy; there hasn&#x27;t been time yet to absorb (let&#x27;s call it) the fiber of a story—the specific information, the diffs, the curious bits. Thus they tend to be generic and angry, and are usually just triggered by some detail. Not good, but here we are.<p>Then there&#x27;s a second wave of people who post objections to the objections. Those usually get upvoted, and that is how we so often end up with a &quot;I can&#x27;t believe these comments&quot; or &quot;WTF HN&quot; comment at the top of a thread.<p>It&#x27;s a mechanical process which has nothing specifically to do with either the content or the community. The community is large enough that for literally any $X there are sufficient readers who will reflexively object to $X. We&#x27;re all full of reflexive objections, just to different things.<p>Is that what we want here? No it is not, but it&#x27;s important to diagnose it correctly. The objections-to-the-objections wave (and yes, we get third waves too, and on it goes) can be just as reflexive and shallow as the original posts. So it&#x27;s not about the content, not about the specific views being expressed. It&#x27;s about what level of (let&#x27;s say) the nervous system is producing them. If it&#x27;s a fast, reflexive, cached reaction, that&#x27;s not interesting. It can&#x27;t be, because by definition it&#x27;s about something else—something one has seen or felt or argued about before—while interest means being interested in <i>this</i>, what&#x27;s new about it.<p>Responses of interest, which are the interesting responses, are slower to appear and come from slower cycles.')
