But if everyone votes strategically, then score voting and approval voting are the same.  (This makes sense because tactical score voting is mostly just score voting with maximalized votes, which is basically the same as approval voting.)<p>Using approval voting basically forces everyone to use tactical voting.  Which might be less good in some metrics but it ensures that all voters have basically the same amount of influence, as opposed to tactical voters having more influence than honest voters.  I think having equal influence is pretty important.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if this simulation that everyone likes to cite has been run more recently with STAR voting.  That would be interesting.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ncase.me&#x2F;ballot&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ncase.me&#x2F;ballot&#x2F;</a>')
