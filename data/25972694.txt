I can see myself checking back on this regularly. It&#x27;s certainly a more positive stat to track than numbers infected &#x2F; deaths.<p>I&#x27;d love to see a chart showing the number of people vaccinated per day&#x2F;week, as well as the cumulative total - it would help interpret if the prediction made in the &quot;UK vaccinated over time&quot; graph is overly optimistic (i.e because last week was a dip in the numbers vaccinated) or pessimistic (more people are being vaccinated every week, so the curve will likely steepen)<p>I would also really enjoy reading a post going through how you made it - what tech you chose and how you&#x27;re pulling the data from the NHS website. Although conceptually quite simple, I imagine there&#x27;s some nuance to the implementation and if the tech isn&#x27;t particularly exciting it&#x27;s still good to read about pragmatic tech choices.')
