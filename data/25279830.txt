They&#x27;re not having any incentive to do so now, they&#x27;ll have even <i>less</i> once Starlink is up and running because half the target customers will be happy with that.<p>That is why basic telecommunication infrastructure should be built out by the government, similar to roads, sewers&#x2F;drinking water&#x2F;gas pipes and postal service. Letting private companies do the job without mandating equal service will <i>always</i> lead to rural areas being dropped off the radar, and besides it&#x27;s an enormous waste of resources if two or more service providers have to dig up half the country to bury infrastructure.')
