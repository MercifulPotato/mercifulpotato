They have a certain set of tools and fix those types of problems, which usually aren&#x27;t the ways to lead tech companies. \nI think every company should be lead by a person who has a strong background in the company&#x27;s main role. I have seen finance background CEOs get replaced and the Company began to thrive again. Its not a bad investing idea!')
