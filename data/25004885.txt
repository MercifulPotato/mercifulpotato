At least, it&#x27;s a single file instead of a workflow and any number of actions.<p>This is to say, if I were in Jeff&#x27;s situation, I would seriously consider moving to GitLab (with mirrors in github for visibility), or at least setting up their ci to trigger from github.<p>Though maybe I&#x27;m just speaking from lack of experience, as I&#x27;ve only set up actions in one project so far.')
