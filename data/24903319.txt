To stop seeing the illusion.  So either life is pointless and hopeless, or we are seeing some illusion that hides a completely different reality.  It is impossible to prove with certainty whether this apparent existence _is_ real existence or if it is some illusion.<p>If in fact what we see now is all that is, then frankly everything is doomed and humanity (and all other life) is pointless.  We can distract ourselves with TV, social media, politics, money or power gains, sexual conquests, or even humanitarian successes.  But the logical conclusion of the current apparent reality is complete destruction, and therefore pointlessness.')
