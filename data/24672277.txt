There is no package, package is outdated, it is hard to make package, it is hard to publish package - these problems already solved.<p>Hard problems may be<p>* I want several versions of the package<p>* I want entire environment like it was 6 years ago so I can run &#x2F; compile application (in parallel with current)<p>* I want to run application in sandbox - no network, no file access, no mic etc<p>* I want proprietary application and they don&#x27;t play well with Linux ecosystem<p>Hope Flatpak will address them while keeping security in check.<p>---<p>Debian Sid is claimed to be not more unstable than Arch [3].
