I had the Nokia E90 communicator.  It felt like such a powerful device for the time.  And I mean the true sense of powerful - not processing power, but the ability of a pocket device capable of multitasking, audio&#x2F;video recording, GPS navigation (it had google maps and TomTom), 3G data (which felt similar to our home broadband at the time) and a nice wide screen with a keyboard.  It browsed the web before mobile pages were a thing - so you always got the full website.  It felt so liberating back then - I felt that no matter where I travelled, I has such ability and power to do what I liked.  Booking hotels, couriers, getting train timetables, never getting lost etc..<p>I don&#x27;t know when the inflection point happened that smart devices became a ball and chain.  Maybe when everyone had one, and instead of being magical, it became standard.  That and the attention-grabbing addictive nature of social networks never being more than an unconscious reach-into-the-pocket-unlock-and-browse away.')
