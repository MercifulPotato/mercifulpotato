Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605298185, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25085980, text='&gt; If governments enforced COVID restrictions as well as they enforce speeding and DUIs, we wouldn&#x27;t have to rely on people being smart and considerate.<p>odd comparison to make. I find that in the midatlantic US, speeding and DUI are not enforced very consistently. with speeding, there seem to be only a couple days of the month (usually the last few days) where a bunch of cops are out with radar&#x2F;lidar pulling people over. with DUI, you are quite likely to get away with it if you aren&#x27;t intoxicated to the point where your driving is noticeably erratic. the exception would be the few times each year where they actually have checkpoints on certain roads.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s the easiest thing to enforce, too. In my city alone, a single police officer with two functioning eyes could probably issue hundreds of mask violations a day. It&#x27;s not like you have to search someone or go out of your way to see they aren&#x27;t wearing a mask.<p>this seems like it could be counterproductive. for one thing, issuing a ticket is necessarily a close physical interaction. for another, what if the interaction goes south and the cop has to grapple with the offender, arrest them, and take them to jail? does this really serve the goal of preventing covid transmission?')
