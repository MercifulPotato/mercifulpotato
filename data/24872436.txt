Item(by='biolurker1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603478105, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24870908, text='Trump has made enemies worldwide &amp; ridiculed allies, is delusional as he has lied <i>provenly</i> 20.000 times, is personally responsible for promising the virus will go away when it has killed 200k and will kill more than half a million and is the perfect man to not give a damn about things going on in the mediterranean and other parts of the world that could start a thermonuclear war. If one starts ever, there is a great probability it starts during his second term. He has polarized America and endorsed terrorist &amp; underground groups such as Qanon &amp; white supremacists and can bring total chaos in usa which frankly I don&#x27;t live in. If after all that you still don&#x27;t get it I understand, it&#x27;s how evolution made some humans. My comment will be downvoted but it&#x27;s directed to you and I hope you read it and reflect.I wonder what made you think I am threatening something that&#x27;s really interesting btw. You can&#x27;t deduct this from my comment unless you are totally pro trump.Sorry I have forgotten climate change that will doom us and he opted out from the global effort.')
