Calling them collectively &quot;evolution&quot; is not a subtle mistake to make.<p>In fact placing together memetics and genetics in a single sentence doesn&#x27;t even compile for me. It&#x27;s like stamp-collecting and murder. Yes, my whole point is that we are operating on memetic engine and it works wonders.<p>I&#x27;ll point out one thing &quot;that just edits our patterns out of the population as it always has&quot;, just like not eating or not having sex: being infected by tuberculosis bacteria. By your reasoning developing a vaccine is just silly. Do we even want to rescue any Chopins or Orwells or Kafkas. Vaccine (which is effectively a meme) &quot;just changes evolutionary pressures rather than eliminating them&quot;. If it happens, good, if it doesn&#x27;t happen, no worries? That&#x27;s the message?<p>Iguanas surely don&#x27;t give a fuck about their Chopins.')
