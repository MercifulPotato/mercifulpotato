This is important related to things like calibrating probabilities, which decision trees do very poorly on even if they get good scores on the metric they&#x27;re trained on.<p>Even better if you have a generative model which can &quot;hallucinate&quot; parts of the decision boundary which don&#x27;t have points. Now you can &quot;probe&quot; your model and have a human intervene if they think parts of the decision boundary are wrong<p>I suppose a human can modify a decision tree as well - but in practice human generated rules may be better for some domains.')
