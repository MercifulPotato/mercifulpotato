On the other hand, I do believe in the “fire in a crowded theater test.” I am starting to think that certain forms of public speech, namely that which harms large numbers of mentally ill people or has the potential to create a huge outburst of stochastic terrorism, may fail that test.<p>The Internet changes things because now you can have a billion people in a crowded theater and one person can yell fire.<p>On the stochastic terrorism front: a less ethical person hacking the President’s Twitter account could have tweeted “The storm is upon us! Where we go one we go all!” followed by some instructions and probably killed more people than the 9&#x2F;11 attacks.<p>One person. All they would have had to do is guess “maga2020!” as a password if reports are to be believed. Meanwhile we spend hundreds of billions on defenses to prevent such attacks... which would have been worthless in the face of one person guessing a dumb password and leveraging a meme-plex to mass trigger the mentally ill.<p>This is what is possible today. Attacks only get better.<p>We do have a problem. I am not sure going after the platforms is right or will work, but I can’t think of anything else.<p>Sure they can move to Tor, less popular boards, etc. but the point is to shut down the mass scale propagation machine that depends on access to wide platforms. This will at least contain the cult to a smaller and thus less dangerous group.')
