Most universities simply cannot afford such big and expensive AI. So I suspect that DeepMind is Google’s way of expanding the frontier of AI knowledge through charitable donations. It’s ultimately good PR for them and maybe influences businesses to pick Google Cloud Services for brand appeal. Also I’m guessing since it’s research, they get a huge tax write-off.<p>Perhaps they will deliver once-in-decade unicorn breakthroughs that can ultimately be monetized? Maybe Google’s next phase will be AI generated content. With that they can completely cut out other content creators, and thereby collect affiliate cash through sales. For example, generating those “Top 10 Holiday Toys” guides automatically.')
