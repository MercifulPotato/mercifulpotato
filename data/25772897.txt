Maybe I&#x27;m interpreting your comment wrong.<p>&gt; in defiance of the actual outcomes<p>Is that true, though? I think wisdom comes into question here, and if you do &quot;virtuous&quot; things with bad outcomes, it&#x27;s not very wise and therefor not very virtuous. Good intentions with bad results are nice in that you meant well, but good intentions don&#x27;t make us virtuous on their own.')
