Item(by='thorin', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1604002407, title='Ask HN: Django or rails for full stack website on Windows', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;ll be developing on a Windows machine (I do know Linux but won&#x27;t be using it in this case and don&#x27;t have a mac). Historically I have done the most basic stuff with both python and Ruby but it was often painful to set up on Windows. Which would you recommend? I have a working knowledge of several programming languages but am mainly a database or data guy.<p>I did consider .Net core as I can already write some basic mvc controllers etc, but I don&#x27;t know any front end Microsoft stuff and I assume Django or rails would make the front end easier. I can already do html&#x2F;css&#x2F; basic js.')
