Most of my experience is in JavaScriptâ€”and I&#x27;m looking for some good resources to get up to speed quick with Swift. The training&#x2F;resource landscape is a bit confusing since I&#x27;m not familiar with the language, as a lot of the tutorials seem to focus on older versions.<p>Outside of hackingwithswift.com, Swift Playground, and the official Swift docs, does anyone have any favorite resources, books, videos, etc?<p>Thank you!')
