Who wouldn&#x27;t, at least on this extremely text-oriented site? But one goes to war with the internet one has.<p>Twitter is unique in its intense back-and-forthness and the opportunity to broadcast to a large audience, especially for anyone of prominence or standing. That plus network effects has made it the default for people who have an interesting line of thought to share.<p>That it&#x27;s not the &#x27;right&#x27; medium for this is related to why people do it anyway: the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. The spontaneity of the platform makes it easy to reel off what one is thinking or has just figured out. To make a blog post would be more work and wouldn&#x27;t reach nearly the audience.<p>Weaknesses and strengths are often conjoined like this. When something gets used in a way that it isn&#x27;t particularly suited for, there&#x27;s a lot of vitality in that—otherwise the activation energy wouldn&#x27;t be enough to overcome the downside. It&#x27;s interesting that this unsuitable medium gets by far the most usage for thinking out loud by influential people. The alternative is not a more suitable medium—it&#x27;s not hearing about e.g. the historical influence of obscure clams in the first place.<p>I do think there&#x27;s something to mourn, though. In the first years of Twitter the founders were incredible at following and adopting the inventions that the community itself came up with (e.g. hashtags) for developing the medium. That genius approach eventually died and got replaced with top-down design, which led to a mess. I assume this was crucifixion on the cross of growth-at-all-costs, but who can say. I hope I live to see the civilizational shift in which we start optimizing for quality rather than quantity. <i>That</i> will be interesting.')
