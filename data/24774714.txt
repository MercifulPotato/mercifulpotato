Unless &quot;small business&quot; actually means a firm that uses an internal video link for many dozens of people, I would think that small businesses are actually overprovisioned. Consider that you could easily support several people watching youtube or similar streaming media at the same time.<p>Suppose you have a small firm with 10 office workers. They&#x27;re doing what? Downloading excel spreadsheets or word documents, working on them, then uploading them. For that they have a 20-50Mps line. It might be asymmetric, but chances are that it&#x27;s still fast enough to get most documents very quickly, and your 10 staff will barely ever be using the line at the same time.<p>Even remote desktop sessions are not all that bandwidth hungry, and chances are if you&#x27;re doing vidconf, you are using the provider&#x27;s infrastructure, eg zoom.<p>IMO if you&#x27;re a small business your problem is more that you don&#x27;t have anyone who knows how to configure the router, you might have lax security, and your infrastructure is brittle (net goes down, no fallback).<p>That&#x27;s what I&#x27;d focus on rather than VPN capacity.')
