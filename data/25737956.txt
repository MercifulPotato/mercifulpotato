Nutritional labels are comprised of factual content to the product. The government can&#x27;t force political or other government opinion onto it. Or at the least politically fueled labelling should not be allowed. For example forcing a company to  host images on their cigarette packs. This should be unconstitutional.<p>General opinion especially political is protected, or at least is meant to be. People can make political products, but they have to be factual in their contents.<p>This isn&#x27;t very related to the issue of social media - the posts are from other people including the government. You can&#x27;t compel a company to host your opinions. You could compel them to list factual information about its content&#x2F;origin though.')
