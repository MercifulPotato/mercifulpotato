We offer a comprehensive set of tools that help our Fortune 500 clients to understand and improve how theyâ€™re perceived in the marketplace, how aware consumers are of the value they provide, and how much consumers trust them to provide the value they promise.<p>About the Roles:<p>Upwave has built an excellent backend system for gathering and statistically analyzing data on consumer sentiment. But our revenue and client list are growing fast, which means we&#x27;ve got to adapt to new levels of scale in our data pipelines.<p>We&#x27;re looking at doing a substantial overhaul of our data pipelines to prepare us for our next stage of growth. We need an experienced technical leader to help us rationalize our cloud costs, architect a new high-efficiency system, and help us develop a highly scalable, highly maintainable set of pipelines.<p>We also are building out a suite of interactive, visually compelling, self-serve analytical tools to help marketers ask and answer sophisticated strategic questions (and visually communicate their results to internal stakeholders). We need an enthusiastic, quick-learning full stack developer to work on our Web API and our React&#x2F;Redux-based data visualization dashboard.<p>See and apply for these roles at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.upwave.com&#x2F;careers" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.upwave.com&#x2F;careers</a> and&#x2F;or email me: george@upwave.com')
