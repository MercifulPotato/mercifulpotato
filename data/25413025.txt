How is electricity, indoor plumbing and abject poverty cherrypicking? Those are the basic necessities of modern life. It&#x27;s almost 2021.<p>&gt; I guess being a &quot;democracy&quot; should just magically solve a millennia of colonialism and thousands of years of rigid class hierarchy?<p>Except that china also had the exact same issues. In many respect, china had it worse than india when it came to colonialism. Yet look at china and look at india.<p>&gt;  And even if it absolutely should, the wealth gap in india is at an all time low due to Reservation policies.<p>Talk about cherrypicked. Who cares about wealth gap when you don&#x27;t have electricity?<p>&gt; Interesting, I never saw nets along the company housing in japan&#x2F;us preventing workers from killing themselves,<p>Once again, that&#x27;s foxconn. A taiwanese company and a major supplier for japanese and american tech goods.<p>&gt; nor have I heard of american workers sneaking letters in products begging for help.<p>You mean the silly propaganda you hear every 10 years? Ever wonder what becomes of those stories?<p>&gt; Also, I love how you&#x27;re equating humans rights with &quot;virtue signalling&quot;.<p>No. I equate hypocritical virtue signaling about human rights as &quot;virtue signaling&quot;. Never mind that we benefit from chinese &quot;slave labor&quot;, we have been murdering millions of people world wide. We cause more human suffering than the chinese in the name of &quot;human rights&quot;.<p>&gt; Spoken exactly like a privelaged fool who doesn&#x27;t understand the value of right, yet deems them unworthy for others.<p>I guess I am privileged since I&#x27;ve always had electricity. Something millions of indians sadly do not. So virtue signal about democracy and human rights some more like hundreds of millions live without electricity, plumbing and food in india.<p>After ww2, both india and china were in the same position. 70 years later, india has fallen behind considerably leading to immense human suffering. Instead of focusing on that, hypocritical virtue signalers whine about nonsense.')
