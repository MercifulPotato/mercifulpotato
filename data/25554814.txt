The GPU has eight cores (vs. four), and the neural engine seems to be the same 16-core block as in the A14. The secure enclave appears to be a SoC implementation of the T2 security chip used in earlier MacBooks.<p>It is Apple’s second 5-nm part, almost certainly made on the same process as the A14, with 16 billion transistors, compared with the 11.5 Bn in the A14 from the latest iPhone. We obtained a Macbook Air (13-inch, 256 GB) and removed the M1, and our speculation that the package was like the A12X was correct.&quot;')
