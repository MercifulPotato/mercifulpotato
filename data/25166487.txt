Of course, no matter what you decide, someone is going to be angry. But you can&#x27;t just <i>not</i> decide, you do have to take a stand and by refusing to do so, you have effectively already decided something (that&#x27;s the whole point of Sartre&#x27;s philosophy btw, which was inspired by WW2).')
