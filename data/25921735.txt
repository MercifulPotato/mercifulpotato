It has really won me over versus GitHub over the past couple of years. I&#x27;ve found it to be much more suited to enterprise use.<p>That said, they really need to work on the pricing model. We have 1,000 potential users. But only 300 of them would really use all of the features. It is a tough sell to pay equally for all of them.<p>I&#x27;d really love to use some of the features of ultimate, but the pricing model makes it a complete non-starter. It is an order of magnitude more expensive than the hodgepodge of tools it would replace if we have to pay ~100k a month for it. Our account exec has offered to talk about discounts and stuff, but it is just too far out there and too much risk since the lock-in would be so high.')
