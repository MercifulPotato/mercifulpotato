Here people who&#x27;s wage is above average are taxed as &quot;rich&quot;... so yeah that creates another issue.<p>Also, the rich are rich because they offer very need services to the middle class. You tax the rich and they increase the prices of their products, which means you&#x27;re basically increasing taxes on the lower classes instead of the rich.<p>The solution? An overall decrease of taxes.')
