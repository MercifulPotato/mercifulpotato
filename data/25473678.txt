It would have the same effect.<p>Yes but the difference is that in this case, the plan already exists from the moment the coin is flipped until the result is revealed to the generals. In the QM case no one (not even God) knows what the result will be until it is actually measured,but once that happens the result is known &quot;instantly&quot; at both places (assuming both coins arrive at the same time), so in that sense is a FTL communication (of course it is not real communication)')
