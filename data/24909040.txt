Waymo cost a ton of money to create. The most significant thing Google has ever given up on was Google+ and that wasn’t until the product had basically been dead for 7 years. Sure, Google likes to shut down dead products and unmonitized side-projects when nobody wants to run them anymore, but there’s no basis for the idea that Google shuts down products more significant than Google+ was in its dying year.')
