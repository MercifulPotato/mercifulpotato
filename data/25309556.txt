As a high-schooler from a lower middle-class family in Greece, I feel this pain every single day. It&#x27;s therapeutic to see it is not as personal as it feels.<p>I know my generation has free access to almost all of human knowledge online, I know hard work and study can pull me out of this hell. I start every day hoping to do just that, but my accomplishments remain depressingly few regardless. Honestly, it&#x27;s even getting worse over time, I was a far brighter and gifted kid once. I live in fear of how much smarter some of my peers are getting and I can&#x27;t catch up.<p>It&#x27;s like, every time I try to escape this mess, I fall back to a predetermined state of idleness. Most of the blame is on me; I was actually given some good opportunities to better myself by teachers who cared, I was a step away from scholarships at private schools and studying abroad etc. and I blew it all away. I never worked hard enough. Some of my failures may just boil down to luck.<p>Still, it is sad to think (with hindsight) how much different everything could&#x27;ve been, if my starting conditions were just a bit better. If I had been given a nudge in the right direction at challenging moments, instead of having to rely on self-study and self-help. If my parents had made me play an instrument, learn math earlier, read more books or make friends. God, it would&#x27;ve been so much better had I known somebody who had already done the things I wanted to do.<p>Breaking out of the loop is very, very hard without help. It is like the MÃ¼nchhausen Trilemma. Anyway, I hope this comment is not inappropriate for HN, I just have nowhere else to vent. Sorry.')
