We know that password systems don&#x27;t work in the long run. There&#x27;s been lots of reasons to get people away from passwords for day-to-day things. Some canaries are going to die sooner than others, and I have some ideas why this particular canary of mine died early. There are other complaints out there about Steam specifically of hacked accounts where passwords were &quot;guessed&quot; and then email accessed. Additionally, I have a pretty good idea of why, for what I think to be very dumb reasons, my account is a particularly well known to be &quot;high value&quot; account (going back to the parent comment way above that depending on how you value it, my Steam account is worth more than the PC I connect to it with). Steam itself is also in the weird &quot;entertainment&quot; place where it has bank-like features, but not quite the same pressure to have bank-like security (because it&#x27;s just &quot;games&quot; and &quot;hats&quot;). The article here itself points to things likely written prior to 2012 that are still in active use today in Steam&#x27;s login path (whether or not you believe age&#x2F;tech debt implies &quot;broken&quot; most banks have upgraded their login systems likely four or five times since).<p>(My account is one of the oldest accounts on the platform, predating Half-Life 2&#x27;s launch, and originally accessed via dial up internet. It has several now rare collections of games and at least a couple now &quot;impossible to buy&quot; games. Most critically to it being &quot;well known&quot; to have such value, it has several of the most rare&#x2F;valuable &quot;TF2 hats&quot;, which I think is incredibly dumb and that the marketplace is a huge gambling mistake, and those were known at the time when all Steam inventories were public [oh, the spam and phishing attempts that generated back when that was public and easily accessible]. My limited regard for the marketplace and limited use of it would make it somewhat obvious if I had &quot;sold them&quot; in the time since inventories allowed going private.)<p>As for a keylogger, specifically, I would go insane if I ever had to type 50+ character passwords. The keys you will log are Ctrl and V. Sure that opens up questions to clipboard logging and&#x2F;or Password Manager incursion, but as I mentioned above, I have enough reason to suggest the threat isn&#x27;t that sophisticated (in part because it is just &quot;games&quot; and &quot;hats&quot;), and paranoid circumvention in place already (even beyond the ones mentioned specifically in the above comment).')
