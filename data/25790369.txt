A bit like a zettelkasten system for the digital age.<p>We recently did a major overhaul of how sharing works on Supernotes [1], and added ability to share &#x2F; embed your note-cards around the web like tweets. With no strict character limit, the ability to edit and full markdown + LaTeX maths support; Supernotes cards are a lot more flexible. Some great examples include reusable checklists, highlighted code snippets and interactive study cards; see them in action here [2]<p>A bit of background. We came up with the idea for Supernotes while at university a few years ago, while being frustrated with a mess of folders and long-form docs that were a pain to share and collaborate on. We found that storing everything on note-cards made it a lot simpler to link thoughts, ideas and knowledge together. Everything, from the design to the code of Supernotes has been built by just the two of us.<p>We&#x27;d love for you try out Supernotes (all our features are available for free), and hear what you think. Also feel free to ask any questions and I will be happy to answer them!<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supernotes.app&#x2F;changelog" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supernotes.app&#x2F;changelog</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supernotes.app&#x2F;blog&#x2F;posts&#x2F;embed-your-knowledge&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supernotes.app&#x2F;blog&#x2F;posts&#x2F;embed-your-knowledge&#x2F;</a>')
