They want standard designs that they can throw up as cheaply and quickly as possible. Frankly some of the developments I&#x27;ve seen in my area are just hideous - like if they had just run the streets the other direction people would have had view lots, but they were too effing cheap and lazy to even do that, let alone hire an actual architect.<p>2) Distribution networks of building supplies are ineffective and feels like a market ripe for disruption. Just because there exists some cool new material or energy-saving option out there in the world doesn&#x27;t mean that one&#x27;s local builders have access. So, whatever is available to them is what&#x27;s going into local houses.<p>3) Consumer tastes. Human beings have notions about houses. Lots of humans like house designs that are conforming to local norms and traditions. So thermally efficient designs like below-ground homes often end up as outliers that don&#x27;t sell particularly well to buyers who don&#x27;t understand the benefits.')
