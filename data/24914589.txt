Look around at any mature software and you start to notice that it can be worked with at <i>multiple</i> levels. Perhaps it’s a bunch of built-in features to most users, with a smaller group of users tailoring things with “add ons” and “plug-ins” and “apps”, and finally an even smaller group who writes their own extensions or integrates another application with the API.<p>“No code” is <i>always</i> what software vendors sell <i>in the beginning</i>.
