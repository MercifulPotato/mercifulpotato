That might mean that it&#x27;s not any less ethical, but equally scummy.<p>The fact that it&#x27;s not a surprise (and implying that everyone does it) is not an excuse to keep manipulating people at a mass scale when they&#x27;re browsing the internet in (primarily) good faith. I&#x27;d say that pointing that out and accepting it as a good justification is in and of itself unethical.')
