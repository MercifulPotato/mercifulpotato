This thread is about a new project called InfluxDB IOx. It&#x27;s under development and we&#x27;re not producing builds, so any kind of operational comparison would be very premature.<p>Its architecture is dramatically different than InfluxDB. You can do a comparison of the design goals. Read the post this thread refers to. I think you&#x27;ll find it has very different goals than Postgres, an OLTP database, and Timescale, which is built on top of it.')
