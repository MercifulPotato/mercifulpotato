Why isn&#x27;t there ever a intuitive explanation in text books about this?\n    - [edit]: Many book trumpet that classical mechanics is just an approximation of QM, but unlike in special relativity where speed going to zero obviously gets you back to classical mechanics, I&#x27;ve never seen a clear example of a system where the quantum behavior &quot;transitions&quot; to classical behavior as a variable (e.g size) increases or decreases.\n    - the list is long</code></pre>')
