Item(by='bsder', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603833984, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24908009, text='&gt; I just have never seen the use case for FPGAs beyond niche prototyping &#x2F; small run applications, which by definition make no money.<p>You are precisely correct.  FPGAs are useful when your volume doesn&#x27;t reach volumes where an ASIC would get amortized.<p>Networking companies (Cisco, Juniper, etc.) are classically big consumers of FPGAs.<p>Tektronix seems to make quite a bit of money and there is at least one FPGA in practically every test instrument they make.  This holds true for practically all test instrument manufacturers.<p>I know a <i>LOT</i> of industrial automation and testing companies that generally have FPGAs in their systems.  Both for latency and for legacy support (Yeah, GPIB still exists ...).<p>Yes, they aren&#x27;t &quot;Arm in a cell phone&quot; type volumes, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t quite profitable if you can aggregate them.')
