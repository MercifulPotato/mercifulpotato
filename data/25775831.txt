Take for example terrorist incidents, with this things are significantly different, because these are not things we can test by repeatable experiment as we can in science.<p>For another example, no experiment is available to me to check whether or not Lukashenko rigged the election of Belarus in 2020. I suspect he did, but I don&#x27;t know. It is a matter of fact though, so can I now no longer say I expect he did? What if I find evidence, can I then say he did?<p>Take also a murder trial, does a conviction mean someone did it? Does an acquittal mean that someone did not do it? I mean if you truly believe so then how do you explain wrongful convictions and acquittals?<p>Should we eliminate courts as they make claims of facts with no ability to guarantee their correctness?<p>What if some witness was mistaken? Should they be convicted? Should incorrect statements about matters of fact be crimes? And if so how do we judge them? Can&#x27;t use courts, because courts can make mistakes.<p>Libel and fraud are already crimes, both in US and most of the western world, but I think restricting freedom of speech to exclude statements about fact is a misunderstanding of reality.<p>No person is an oracle, no person has a monopoly on truth or fact, just because someone says something, does not make it so.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Positive_statement" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Positive_statement</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Falsifiability" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Falsifiability</a>')
