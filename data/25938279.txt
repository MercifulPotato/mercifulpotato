They could try to buy back all the stocks, but they would run out of money long before they finished. Given that, they would most likely skip the crap and jump straight to declaring bankruptcy. So it doesn&#x27;t seem like they really need to buy the stock at $350. At a lower price, where they could feasibly pay for it all, they might give it a go, but as it stands there is no chance. I haven&#x27;t seen anyone else saying this, but I also don&#x27;t see any way around it.')
