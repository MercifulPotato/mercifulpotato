The main cost is digging the last mile. Generally, having multiple ISPs put cables to your porch will n-fold their cost. Who&#x27;s gonna pay for that in the end? You, the customer. It&#x27;s best to have one ISP lay fiber cabling to your home and then have them rent it out to others, on terms set up by regulators in advance. Maybe that last mile ISP could even be publicly owned.')
