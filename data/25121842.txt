Item(by='bipson', descendants=None, kids=[25123367], score=None, time=1605606450, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25121416, text='What I often experience (see also a lot of comments here):<p>Some people, however smart, try to <i>force</i> git to do something in particular, without asking first &quot;How can I do x with git&quot; (I don&#x27;t think I ever had a use case where stackoverflow didn&#x27;t have a solution for).<p>Then they end up with a borked repo, everything is confusing (because it should have almost never been in this state), angry at the tool they abused so badly.<p>Git is solving complex problems, and it obviously has certain idiosyncrasies. But just because you think the developers chose poorly, doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean git is terrible in the first place (might also be true though, but please prove it by showing a better alternative). I heard mercurial has a lot of fans, but I had a terrible time cleaning up behind colleagues though - everything was easy for them, but they did not know what they were doing and why it was bad. The git branching-workflow helped a lot there.<p>Often the obvious solution of an outsider is not really a solution.<p>Could git have named some commands better? Yes, of course. If you don&#x27;t know what git is doing internally on a checkout, it makes little sense.\nBut this is being worked on.<p>I would argue that if someone comes up with his very own perfect distributed versioning system intended to be super intuitive and simple, he will in the end also build in complex constructions that make no sense to outsiders that didn&#x27;t participate in thinking about the complex problem these concepts are trying to solve.')
