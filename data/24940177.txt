Item(by='triceratops', descendants=None, kids=[24941309], score=None, time=1604045769, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24937562, text='&gt; with the idea they acted more like a common carrier than a publisher.<p>This is pure invention.<p>Information services&#x27; closest publishing analogue is letters to the editor. In print, the publisher has a far lower inbound volume of letters, and has to satisfy a less stringent SLA (letters are published daily or weekly). Publishers are able to moderate submissions effectively. Thus they can be held liable for user submissions they publish, even though they didn&#x27;t write them.<p>Information services cannot do this. If they adopt the moderation model of a traditional publisher, their usefulness is lost because:<p>a) you&#x27;ll need way more manpower to moderate (or the service cannot handle a high volume of submissions)<p>b) you&#x27;ll lose the low-latency of an information service (i.e. nobody wants to wait 10 hours for their tweet to be posted).<p>Given these facts, treating information services as publishers by making them liable for what their users posted would have killed an entire industry in the cradle. Which is why Congress wrote the safe harbor into law. It has nothing to do with them being a &quot;common carrier&quot;. You can read the law and it explicitly allows them to perform as much moderation as they wish.')
