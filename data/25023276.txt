Web UIs and mobile UIs often have different views, so they want different data, and fetching it in one request or many is up to the preference of the UI.<p>I don&#x27;t have to build different REST endpoints presenting some data in a different shape for performance reasons or because different applications wanted to request the data in a different way.<p>As a frontend engineer, all the data is often already there unless I&#x27;m building some new feature the backend doesn&#x27;t understand yet. I&#x27;m free to refactor my application without bothering changing the REST API - and GraphIQL lets me inspect the api and mock queries for how I might fetch the data for a given view.<p>It&#x27;s a cleaner contract to let different people get their job done with less fuss - game changer.')
