Most of them evolved next to each other and borrowed the shorthand of each other and copied each others API&#x2F;GUI&#x2F;CLI (mostly), and the shorthand of a physical library.  git on the other hand stands alone in its interface.  in many source controls &#x27;checkout&#x27; for example means I get exclusive control of this file on this branch.  Where as in git it does not mean that at all.  That is where much of the misunderstanding comes in for git.  The commands are kind of the same names but do very different things.')
