They (the people writing and administrating) the tests bend over backwards to offer the same test in many different languages. They provide unit tests and examples.<p>To be quite blunt: These tests just verify very basic programming skills. They&#x27;re meant to filter out people who just can&#x27;t code. Someone who&#x27;s struggling with these kinds of tests probably needs to consider a career change.<p>Edit: A common gripe early in my career was the amount of incapable programmers we had to put up with. I suspect the author isn&#x27;t capable of learning how to program well.')
