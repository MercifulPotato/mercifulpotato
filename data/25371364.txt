Item(by='simonebrunozzi', descendants=None, kids=[25372220], score=None, time=1607590100, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25358149, text='It&#x27;s a great article; somehow, though, it clashes with some deeper feeling I have about &quot;social&quot; stuff.<p>An example: &quot;Music, on the other hand, is an inherently social experience.&quot;. Not for me, at least not always.<p>I&#x27;m 43, I try to limit how much my phone&#x2F;computer&#x2F;social media can interrupt my life, and music for me is mostly listening to it, by myself, in the quietness of my home office or living room. Sometimes, less often, I listen to it with my wife.<p>From a VC perspective, this is of course terrible. I&#x27;m a &quot;customer&quot; that could potentially spend much more, if only I could &quot;connect&quot; with friends over spotify or whatever music app I use. Heck, I don&#x27;t even use Spotify much: I enjoy listening to my music on VLC (a great open source media player).<p>I feel &quot;old&quot;, but I&#x27;m tired of this incessant need that businesses have to monetize me. Leave me alone.<p>But again, this is not against the article. They&#x27;re talking about business opportunities, and unfortunately they&#x27;re mostly right. Some people will make a lot of money, squeezing every last drop of humanity out of each one of us.<p>We can&#x27;t be alone. Alone, we don&#x27;t spend much.<p>We can&#x27;t be happy. When happy, we don&#x27;t spend much.<p>Sorry for the rant.')
