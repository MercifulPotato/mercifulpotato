GNOME is popular, so it sucks for a lot of users.<p>That is not a statement about Wayland, so fucking knock it off. If you really want to fix this problem for this large number of users, you ought to make it about GNOME, to pressure them into fixing it and make more people aware of the problem. Making it about Wayland is (1) <i>wrong</i> and (2) makes it worse for the people actually doing something about it.')
