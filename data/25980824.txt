Anyone that assumed there&#x27;s a conspiracy theory is pretty much right. Now, if you mean the &#x27;Brokerage X is in cahoots with this particular hedge fund theory&#x27;, then yes, it&#x27;s fair to argue that&#x27;s debunked.<p>But the overall conspiracy theory of &quot;there are forces conspiring against the natural supply&#x2F;demand market forces&quot;, well, they&#x27;ve pretty much all had the nerve to come out in the open and admit it.<p>It&#x27;s not the stockholders fault that all these clearing intermediaries use shitty fragile risk models that haven&#x27;t accounted for rare events and instead of facing the music they&#x27;ve artificially turned the marketplace for these stocks into sell-only in order to stop a further price rise and exposing themselves further.<p>To be clear, the rest of your comment seems that we&#x27;re in agreement, expect that I would go further to call a spade a spade, it&#x27;s absolutely a conspiracy.')
