(And yes, when the CCP employs mass sterilization to prevent Uighurs from having children and interns millions in concentration camps without due process, it is genocide). Amazing that the world can basically ignore an ongoing modern-day Holocaust. If the US, Europe, and their allies purport to believe in universal human rights, they must put economic pressure on the PRC until the CCP ends these horrific actions.')
