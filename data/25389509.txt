More than just a payment UI? Driver&#x2F;passenger matching? Data analytics? (Doesn&#x27;t that require information from multiple clients?) On the client?<p>I mean, you could push some of that to the client, but I&#x27;d understand why your app is gigantic and doesn&#x27;t do app-ly job very well with all the background processing.
