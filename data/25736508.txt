Conservatism is not a brand. But what you are referring to is actually the vilification of the people who insist on wanting to keep (something they see as a right) what they have and built or was built for them by people who freely gave it to them. I suspect your misunderstanding of what conservatism is, is also a driving force that will destabilize things further because it is such a fundamental misunderstanding that conservatism is not like the brand of the Democratic party.<p>You appear to think of it as some kind of opposing sports team. I know the following will incense a lot of people here, but reality though is that the basic dualism is those how have and built something wanting to keep that; while those who did not build or have, want to acquire and take what they did not contribute to, build, or have. A thief is a person that wants what he did not create, deserve, or earn; yet wants to benefit from (or he would not steal it).<p>Essentially a person with such a mindset is a &quot;liberal&quot; with other people&#x27;s things, opposed to a conservative that wants to keep what he earned as well as you keep what you legitimately earned. It&#x27;s really just age old conflict captured in Aesop&#x27;s fable of the Ants and the Grasshopper.  That model manifests itself in the real world through things like the &quot;communists&quot; who want to take over what they don&#x27;t understand and did not build and yet think they can operate, let alone even maintain;  the people that object to huge student loans they willingly agreed to and want to benefit from, while not wanting to pay the cost; or immigrants to anywhere who want to receive what is essentially a part of the wealth and what others of a country built, not only zero cost, but to immense benefit and profit at the cost of the local population.')
