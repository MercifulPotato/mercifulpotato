Their entire attitude, from their words to their daily actions, smacks of an unconcern towards the affairs of others.<p>I see elsewhere in this comment thread, where you are being a denier about the severity of COVID-19. I have family who work in an ICU, and I&#x27;m going to trust them over you. This cramps the entirety of your whataboutist rant somewhat.<p>If you want to think globally, you&#x27;re going to have to consider how we&#x27;re trying to lower the HIV and AIDS rates in southern Africa. Safe sex is akin to wearing a mask and social distancing, and it requires government support, including discouraging gatherings which are likely to spread disease.<p>Finally, your edit. You&#x27;ve seen the rest of our society, outside our homes, right? Abusive family and roommates are not the ultimate cause of all mental health issues. These folks were free to do what I have the rough equivalent of doing: Going to a <i>nearby</i> park, with <i>a mask on</i>, to get fresh air and exercise and communion with nature.<p>As a long-term sufferer from depression and suicidal ideation, I think that it is infantile for you to take the stance that you&#x27;ve taken. Your selfish attitude, when shared by millions of others, has killed thousands of people over the past year. We can conquer measles, we can conquer ebola, but COVID-19 is somehow special? No, what is special is the politically-motivated and ignorant response that you&#x27;ve espoused throughout this thread.')
