It has crossed a tipping point.<p>Since I&#x27;m not aware that there has been any drug discovery that has strongly depended on computational protein folding, this possible benefit remains to be seen.<p>[I worked in a lab which was heavily involved in CASP, the protein folding competition, but I was not myself involved]')
