They created a app&#x2F;website.  But, that&#x27;s not an entire platform (as we see today).  An entire platform in this context includes servers, fiber optic networks, routers, etc.  If Parler wants to speak on the scale they envision, they can build their own infrastructure to do so.  Yes, that&#x27;s expensive, but it&#x27;s also no different than the pre-internet era, where similar speech would be relegated to self-published fliers, because no newspaper or TV would carry the message.')
