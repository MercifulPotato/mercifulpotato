I cited specific examples of ludicrous things he&#x27;s said that have come true, and you cite small lies he&#x27;s told. I can do the same for any politician you name, that doesn&#x27;t mean they never say something worth listening to.<p>Like I said though... Keep going. People like you have converted me from a never Trumper to a Trump supporter. And people like you have converted my aunt, a former Obama-supporting liberal, into avid pro-Trumpers. Honestly, from my perspective, I say keep going on and do whatever it is you do. It&#x27;ll just make more people like me.')
