It is aiming to give users some control of tracking. If FB wants to engage in such tracking, it is up to them to convince users of the benefit so that they will choose to enable it.<p>When it comes to defaults being rolled out to millions of users, I like this approach. They aren&#x27;t blocking everything a la uBlock Origin, or putting themselves in the middle as the gatekeeper like Adblock Plus.<p>Ultimately, though, I think Facebook&#x27;s business model is the problem. It depends on users giving them something for free that the user really has little incentive to provide. Sure, on its own the argument that users prefer personalized ads over generic ones makes some sense, but when I think when users have to consciously evaluate that trade-off (personalized ads BUT you have to allow someone to track everything you do on the internet), that is a hard sell.')
