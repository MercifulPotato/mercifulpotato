Databases are concurrent, you can&#x27;t guarantee that a different session will not insert a record that invalidates your current statistics.<p>You could argue that it should be able to use it if the table has a check constraint preventing severity_id above 7 being ever inserted. That is something that could be done, I don&#x27;t know if PostgreSQL does it (I doubt it) or how feasable it would be.<p>Is SQL Server able to make an assumption like that purely based on statistics? Genuine question.')
