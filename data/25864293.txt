We manage to organize subatomic collisions that occur in femto-seconds, and we manage to build things that last thousands of years. All this despite the fact that our own lives are measured in units that are several orders of magnitude smaller or larger.<p>So I can imagine (just about) an intelligent system that can also effectively build systems operating in time domains orders of magnitude from their own experience&#x2F;lifetimes. If they were very &quot;slow&quot; then certainly launching objects into orbit may appear almost impossibly fast to them. But it wouldn&#x27;t be notably different than what we do with particle physics (or even firing a gun), where the timescale of the event is essentially impercetible to us, and far beyond our ability to control with our own bodies.<p>The other way around is harder, because creating things that last much longer than an individual&#x27;s lifetime has to fall back on culture, and that seems to evolve (change) much more rapidly. There are very few buildings still in use that are more than a thousand years old, even though the physical construction of such a thing is relatively trivial.')
