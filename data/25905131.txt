I wish Python 3 had strings as byte sequences <i>mainly</i> in UTF-8 as Python 2 had once and Go has now.  Then things would be kept simple in Japan.\nPython 3 feels cumbersome.  To handle a raw input as a string, you <i>must</i> decode it in <i>some</i> encoding first.  It is a fragile process.  It would be adequate to treat the input bytes <i>transparently</i> and put an optional stage to convert other encodings to UTF-8 if necessary.')
