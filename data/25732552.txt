Here&#x27;s some thoughts:<p>1. Like most gossip networks, it uses tcp. Since most consumer devices won&#x27;t allow for incoming tcp connections, the end result is that most traffic gets routed through the small fraction of nodes on cloud servers. While this is true for most gossip networks, it is particularly problematic when you&#x27;re using it bandwidth intensive applications (a twitter&#x2F;parler alternative).<p>2. Using PoW for spam prevention is better than nothing, but the PoW algorithm is a simple sha256 hash. Sha256 ASICs will keep spam cost effective. Not sure if there&#x27;s any solution. I think using some kind of crypto based incentive would be better economics, though of course have an increased user burden of acquiring crypto.<p>3. Bitmessage IMHO tries to be too many things with a message storage&#x2F;rebroadcast protocol on top of a gossip network. All of these suffer from less than great documentation.')
