Item(by='rurp', descendants=None, kids=[25586414], score=None, time=1609349856, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25582289, text='Unfortunately Walmart seems to be doing their best to be just as bad as Amazon. I had good luck ordering from them for the past few years but more recently it&#x27;s gotten almost as bad. They now have a lot of fake&#x2F;junk products being sold by random parties, plus I had a really awful experience with their customer service recently.<p>The product page for one item that my partner was looking to buy for her Mom&#x27;s birthday said something like &quot;Free 2-day shipping, receive it by the 4th&quot;. Well when she went to check out the only option to get it by that date cost $30+ dollars. I ended up getting on the phone with a support person who fully acknowledged that the shipping info was wrong but to my shock completely dismissed it as not being a problem.<p>I said that people were putting items into their cart based on false information and the response was basically a dismissive shrug. We went back and forth a few times to make sure I really understood his response and there&#x27;s no doubt that he did not care that they were displaying false shipping info.<p>Since then I&#x27;ve been wary of buying anything else from Walmart.')
