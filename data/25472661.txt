It seemed to me it&#x27;s a different beast altogether and it doesn&#x27;t make sense to just compare numbers and say that more is better. Apple allows you to buy a computer with more than 8 GB RAM, but I think it&#x27;s just a trap how to satisfy and charge those who don&#x27;t believe the reviews and just want more RAM whatever it takes.\n--<p>I think the reason I would always buy more RAM is not because it needs it today, but because it may need it in 2 or 3 years, as app inevitably eat into the performance gains with bloat.')
