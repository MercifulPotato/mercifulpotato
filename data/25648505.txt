At least 30,000 deaths&#x2F;year in the USA alone. Because humans drive tired, drunk, while texting, etc, and sometimes just make mistakes.<p>With fully automated driving the number of crashes (and therefore injuries &amp; deaths) will go down -dramatically-. So you can argue all you want about the ethics &amp; morality of the ~100 deaths&#x2F;year or so from automated car crashes. But that&#x27;s far preferable to the current situation. Even if we still have 10-20k deaths&#x2F;year from automated driving systems, that&#x27;s still a large improvement.<p>This argument about the ethics of contrived car accident scenarios totally misses the boat. In my opinion the only ethical argument is to move over to fully automated driving systems as soon as -safely- possible.')
