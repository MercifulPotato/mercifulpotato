It&#x27;s right there at the start:<p>&quot;Years ago, we did a study to determine whether anyone at Google is particularly good at hiring. We looked at tens of thousands of <i>interviews</i>, and everyone who had done the interviews and what they <i>scored the candidate</i>, and how that person ultimately <i>performed in their job</i>. We found zero relationship.<p>...One of the things we’ve seen from all our data crunching is that G.P.A.’s are worthless as a criteria for hiring, and test scores are worthless — no correlation at all except for brand-new college grads, where there’s a slight correlation. Google famously used to ask everyone for a transcript and G.P.A.’s and test scores, but we don’t anymore, unless you’re just a few years out of school. We found that they don’t predict anything.&quot;')
