And the reason it doesn&#x27;t always look great is that everyone has decided to do integer scaling and then scale down for fractional scaling instead of just rendering at the destination resolutions. Most things you care about for sharpness are already resolution independent (fonts, images) and would just work. Both Chrome and Firefox already render the whole browser in a resolution independent way but end up being rendered at 2x and scaled down for less sharpness and performance than just asking them directly to render whatever window size and scaling factor is needed. Hopefully Wayland will end up fixing this IMHO bad decision.<p>To avoid all this right now it&#x27;s possible to just pick 1x or 2x and tweak font sizes to get a good mid-step. For a single screen this always works, but it makes combining different ones harder.')
