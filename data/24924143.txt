Really good feedback on the private RSS url. It&#x27;s in the product&#x2F;eng queue.<p>Also, noted on DIY + tooling as a way of making Artifact more accessible - I&#x27;d be really curious to learn what features you&#x27;d want as a user (i.e., what are your needs and what would feel like annoying feature creep, etc.).<p>If it&#x27;s not too much trouble, as you start interviewing your family members, I&#x27;d love to learn about what kind of tooling would be helpful. We&#x27;d also be than happy to provide some pointers around the interview set up, sound quality control, etc. You can email at contact@heyartifact.com')
