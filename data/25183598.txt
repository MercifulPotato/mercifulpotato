I should not have said &quot;alleged&quot;. But yes, I share your confusion. I don&#x27;t understand how Weinstein is an example of someone who &quot;learned that one days&#x27; popular moral action is the next&#x27;s reprehensible mistake&quot; and thus should &quot;avoid politics&quot;. What was his &quot;popular moral action&quot; that became considered as a &quot;reprehensible mistake&quot;? I&#x27;m confused too, thus my question. Including Weinstein as an example here is extremely strange and rather disturbing.')
