Has anyone else thought about this issue? Does anyone do something against this scenario?<p>-Storing a physical backup might be okay but doesn&#x27;t work in threat models that include physical access.<p>-Storing in a safe has similar issues to the above but also the security is lowered to the complexity of the safe combination. And there would be the hassle of cracking the safe if your forget the combination.<p>-Maybe storing in a secure box in a bank with ID verification. Can law enforcement get access to this?<p>-Sharing the password with a trusted person. Seems a good compromise at the start but then you&#x27;re trusting that they&#x27;re storing it securely.<p>-Maybe using a secret sharing algorithm with multiple people?')
