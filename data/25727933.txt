The story is valid because it&#x27;s not being covered? Millions of stories are not covered by the news every day. A functionally infinite number of non-stories are not covered by the news every day. The non-coverage of a story has no bearing on its validity.<p>Your claim is also invalid on its faceâ€”the election theft narrative is being spoken about endlessly. Trump&#x27;s claims are headline news every single day. A significant fraction of the population believe it. So to claim that the story is being &quot;censored&quot; is simply wrong on the facts.')
