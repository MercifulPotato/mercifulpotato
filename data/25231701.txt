FWIW the word synergy in the 90&#x27;s would instantly raise red flags for me, today - not at all as less abused.  Also speed reading enables you to gloss past all that filler and pull out the salient facts.<p>But I try not to let it get to me and made me wonder - how would somebody who couldn&#x27;t see feel about the use of `content` over the word `read`?  Text to speech been around long enough, possible somebody hearing this will have some interesting perspectives.')
