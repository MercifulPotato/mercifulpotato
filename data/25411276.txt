It turns out that riding a bike does not change who you are, fundamentally. If those cyclists owned diesel pickups, they&#x27;d be coal-rolling with the best of them.<p>I used to cross a bridge to get to work. There was a shared pedestrian&#x2F;cycle pathway, about 6 feet wide, with cycles yielding to pedestrians. I remember walking across that one time with my family, including my daughter who was about 3. This one jerk rang no bell and blew past my entire family, about a foot away, at 20+ MPH. I didn&#x27;t even hear him coming from behind.<p>3 year olds are prone to random movements. If she had moved by a foot or two at exactly the wrong time, it would have been a very bad situation.<p>On the plus side, the cyclist behind the asshole (who properly rang his bell and passed us) stopped at the end of the bridge to <i>apologize</i> for the first guy.')
