That&#x27;s more an act of shutting everyone else off from access to technology.<p>Instead, a good leader will help lift others. Take Microsoft Research. For a long time, they were a leader in scientific publications in CS, with many awards. Compare that to Apple, and imho any sign of &quot;leadership&quot; is completely non-existent in comparison.')
