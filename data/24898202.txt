They have been impacted by racist policies too: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Internment_of_Japanese_America" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Internment_of_Japanese_America</a>...<p>It&#x27;s ridiculous to say that Asian Americans have experienced anything near the racism that black people have in the United States. I don&#x27;t think they should even be included in the conversion when talking about racism. The racism they experience is mostly prejudice-type racism, not systemic.<p>&gt; the growing number of fatherless homes that correlate with many factors influence positive outcome.<p>Well yeah, that&#x27;s another systemic problem, that&#x27;s partially caused by fathers being in prison and such.<p>&gt; You want black people to get out of this cycle? Dont be a criminal, comply with police, educate yourself, help others do the same. But somehow this is called &quot;acting white&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t follow your logic. If it&#x27;s so easy for black people to get out of the cycle, why don&#x27;t they? Why is it that so many black people are in the cycle vs. white people? Are you saying that black people are inherently worse?')
