Item(by='blululu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608403213, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25478611, text='California also has one of the lowest property taxes in the country. Income tax is high and so is sales tax but to look at a single form of taxation and conclude that taxes are high in general is a non sequitur. Texas, for instance, has high property tax but it would not be considered a high tax state for this reason alone. At the end of the day it costs a certain amount to run a modern government, the question is simply a matter of what taxes are the most fair way to finance it.<p>Note: California’s government probably could be leaner, but there is also broad bipartisan support for more prisons, police and firefighters. The California republican party’s focus on cutting spending overlooks the deeper problem that we aren’t getting good value on a lot of the spending and budget cuts only exasperate the problem. More meaningful institutional reforms are needed.')
