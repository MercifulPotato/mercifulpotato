Item(by='gfody', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606973981, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25285003, text='&gt; I&#x27;m not clear on your &quot;all sorts of limitations&quot;; you&#x27;ll have to fill me in on them?<p>this feels like bait but honestly I&#x27;m under the impression that incrementally updating materialized views (where optimal = the proportion of changed records) just isn&#x27;t always possible. for example, max and min aggregates aren&#x27;t supported in SQL Server because updating the current max or min record requires a query to find the new max or min record - that&#x27;s not considered an incremental update and so it&#x27;s not supported and trying to materialize the view fails. there are a number of cases like this and a big part of problem solving with SQL Server is figuring out how to structure a view within these constraints. if you can then you can rest assured that updates will be incremental and performant - this is important because performance is the feature, if the update is slow then my app is broken. if Materialize has a list of constraints shorter than SQL Server&#x27;s then you&#x27;re sitting on technology worth billions - it&#x27;s hard for me to believe that your list of constraints is &quot;there are none&quot; especially when there are explicit-but-vague performance warnings in the docs.')
