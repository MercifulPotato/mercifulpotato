They are definitionally 1&#x2F;3 as productive as they should be. Also in terms of stakes, please show me even a modicum of work that suggests the downside risk of approval is greater than the delayed vaccinations. What reason have I to believe there is great risk in approval? Again, the UK approved this over a week ago.<p>&gt; And are you suggesting that it’s easier because the data isn’t as extensive as what the rest of us deal with? That only makes it harder.<p>No, I&#x27;m mocking the idea of it being extensive data. It&#x27;s not.<p>&gt; but this is a vaccine the whole fucking world has been waiting for for most of the year.<p>And that&#x27;s reason to go slower!? There&#x27;s no need for this delay!!! <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thedispatch.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;fda-career-staff-are-delaying-the" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thedispatch.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;fda-career-staff-are-delaying-the</a>')
