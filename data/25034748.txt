Give me a few billion dollars and a year and I can set up another factory, but it would have been too risky an investment 1 year ago (before COVID), or even 3 months ago .  Even now it is too risky an investment as the current factories can produce a lot of vaccine, and there are other candidates that also have factories, so odds are the world will be vaccinated before my 1 year factory comes online.<p>A 1 year factory build is extremely fast - freely trading money for time.  A more reasonable schedule would be several years (a lot cheaper)')
