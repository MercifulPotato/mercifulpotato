I&#x27;m always mashing the up arrow, so I installed this in anticipation of making my life easier :)<p>I didn&#x27;t have `cargo` or any other rust language support installed. However, that seems pretty straight forward: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rust-lang.org&#x2F;tools&#x2F;install" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rust-lang.org&#x2F;tools&#x2F;install</a><p>You may want to throw that into the README.<p>Anyhow, I&#x27;m running this on WSL2&#x2F;Ubuntu 20.04 using zsh + ohmyzsh. It installs cleanly, and I just added `alias hh=hstr-rs` to ~&#x2F;.zshrc as the only additional step. Works nicely!')
