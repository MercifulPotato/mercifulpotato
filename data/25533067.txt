Can we have some functionality in HN comments that are not liked by majority for &quot;some reason&quot;, to be visible? \n&quot; \nLeoNatan25 31 minutes ago [flagged] [dead] [–]<p>People got excited about the m1 machines Apple released, but remember, those machines are tied to some of the worst tested and often regressing piece of software out there—Apple operating systems. Had they released these machines ten years ago, things would have looked very different. But knowing that macOS—Big Sur in particular—is the only supported OS in these machines just kills any curiosity I have, let alone excitement. And my career is basically in the Apple software ecosystem in the last 10 years.\nWhat I don’t understand is how shilling and fanboyish the Apple developer community is with regards to such bugs. Apple can do no wrong. “All software JS bugs.” “Privacy matter the most, the hell with basic computer functionality.” And so on. It boggles the mind. The amount of people that seem to have tied their personal identity to the Apple brand is very large, almost cult-like.&quot;')
