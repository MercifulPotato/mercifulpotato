People are really furious with Airbnb for violating zoning and hospitality regulations? Really? Did they also jaywalk on the way to their YC demo?<p>I think people are mad that the Airbnb founders are rich (fair, but there are a lot of rich people) and that they have arguably raised rents, though I&#x27;m not 100% convinced of that.<p>EDIT - There is some good data out there suggesting a correlation between airbnb activity and rent increasing. Still researching.')
