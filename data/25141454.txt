When your graphics card starts working harder, it uses more power than your PSU can supply, which makes the voltage drop and causes the PC to reboot. I&#x27;d get a new PSU from a reputable manufacturer that is rated for more than the maximum combined wattage of your components. There are heaps of PSUs on the market that are advertised at a much higher rating than they can reliably supply.')
