We had magazines, we had manuals, we had libraries.  It used to be that a &quot;home computer&quot; came with a programming language (usually BASIC) and some introductory material out of the box so a whole generation of programmers learnt that way.  But I guess there was some gap where this wasn&#x27;t a given any more...  In some ways today is worse than the &quot;old days&quot; because you don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to program these things to do stuff with them.')
