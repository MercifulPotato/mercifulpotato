I have the HL-3170CDW but it has a known issue with Macs waking up from sleep; it isn&#x27;t a problem on Windows, Linux, or iOS, but with the latest firmware and latest drivers on the latest macOS patches, freshly power cycled and then allowed to sleep in low-power mode, it will intermittently not power up, though I see the print job spooling down from the flashing LED. Power cycling the printer always kicks the print job out, but I&#x27;m not a fan of that much power cycling.<p>Has anyone else run into this with their Macs in one of the older generation model Brothers and found a later Brother model that permanently fixes this behavior?<p>Other than that I agree, Brother all the way.')
