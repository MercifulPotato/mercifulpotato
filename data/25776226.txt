But that aside, maybe these companies have a lot more to offer in general.<p>However this statement from Gab isn&#x27;t one against FB or Twitter, it is a recruitment drive:<p>&gt; The only way we can beat Big Tech is to build an internet of our own – and financial system of our own – where Big Tech has no power.
