I love the guy and think he&#x27;s dead-on prophetic about 95% of the time.<p>That said, RMS seems to demonstrate a poor understanding of how his messages will be received. Time after time, he&#x27;s said things that are perfectly reasonable and defensible <i>when you actually think them through</i>, but on the surface sound awful and turn people away. A big component of communication is tailoring your message so that it will be heard, and I just don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s very good at that. In political terms, he&#x27;s great at speaking to his base but not so hot at converting non-believers.<p>Let me invent a purely fictional example of something he did not say. Suppose you open an article with &quot;Hitler wasn&#x27;t completely bad.&quot; That&#x27;s defensible! By all accounts he loved his pets, and it seems like he was nice to his officers&#x27; kids. But really, that doesn&#x27;t matter: that opening sentence has lost an enormous part of the audience, even if the rest of the article built a case that would make sense to people who read the whole thing. Most ordinary people would see that and say &quot;that&#x27;s crap and I have no desire to hear what else this person has to say&quot;, and that&#x27;s perfectly understandable because most authors who open that way are going to end up saying something absolutely despicable.<p>Well, when RMS wants to say things implying that maybe pedophilia isn&#x27;t always bad and perhaps it gets a bad rap because some parents aren&#x27;t OK with their kids growing up, he needs to be exceedingly careful how he phrases every word of it because he&#x27;s commenting on an extremely charged subject. And yet, he doesn&#x27;t. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether you have a good point to raise if your wording makes most people shut down and reject your idea immediately.<p>Again, I dig RMS. He&#x27;s an incredibly smart guy who has some brilliant ideas. But wow, I sure wouldn&#x27;t want him defending me in front of a jury. I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s a pedophile, but I absolutely see how easy he made it for some people to claim that.')
