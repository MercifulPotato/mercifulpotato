And globwalk is a great crate, when you really do need high performance glob walking. I think there is room to improve it so that it doesn&#x27;t use so much code, but it&#x27;s a bit of work to do that. (I see this as largely my failure, as the &#x27;ignore&#x27; crate is primarily to blame here.)')
