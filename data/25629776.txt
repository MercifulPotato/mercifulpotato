If they want highly skilled employees, which will constantly be in demand, then the cost to hire them will still be high. Salaries will drop in cost for less skilled roles, and will likely be outsourced to countries such as india, but quality will also drop.<p>So if employers want to be competitive then they will have to pay well regardless of location. In Europe we see a lot of US applicants these days, some good some bad, but we pay equally for most part depending on skill set.')
