Item(by='macspoofing', descendants=None, kids=[25588255], score=None, time=1609373566, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25587756, text='&gt;Please indicate how the policies you support,<p>You can&#x27;t stop straw manning me, can you?  Please indicate where I showed support for &#x27;tough policing&#x27;?<p>The only policy I argued for was this drone program because that has real potential in getting criminals out of the community.<p>The argument about &#x27;tough policing&#x27; is not one of support, nor is it a justification of any police brutality. Police officers should be held responsible for breaking the law and &#x27;police brutality&#x27; is against the law. All I argued is that the type of policing you get is a result of the environment. I made this argument as a counter argument to the trope that somehow policing causes crime and if we can just fix policing that crime will magically go away. That&#x27;s not how it works. You can put as many regulations as you want (and police are already highly regulated - for good reason), but you&#x27;re not going to get easy-going Nordic-style policing in one of the most violent cities in the world. You&#x27;re also not going to lower crime rates either. Again: that&#x27;s neither support for, nor a justification of police brutality.')
