Apparently it&#x27;s so bad that for the next version of the TIFF specification they are taking that insane approach out completely.<p>I can&#x27;t do justice to the article on TIFF&#x27;s problems with JPEG (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.simplesystems.org&#x2F;libtiff&#x2F;TIFFTechNote2.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.simplesystems.org&#x2F;libtiff&#x2F;TIFFTechNote2.html</a>), but my understanding is that:<p>1) Some JPEG-specific data is moved outside of the actual JPEG bitstream tag, and into separate TIFF tags, making editing JPEG-in-TIFF files non-trivial. 2) Size is not encoded in some of these fields, so the TIFF editor you&#x27;re writing will have to <i>partially implement a JPEG decoder</i> just to know the size of some of those TIFF tags, and 3) Some tags&#x2F;fields are pointers into other parts of the TIFF file, meaning if you edit the file, you&#x27;ll have to update the file in many places.<p>(As a quick aside on insane formats, may I also mention the EPWING dictionary format?)')
