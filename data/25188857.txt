You&#x27;re not asked to engage with the darker parts of your psyche at all<p>What is the alternative, from a game design perspective? Every time one of your units takes a Victory Point on a town, a window pops up: &quot;You captured $townname! Do you want to execute all of the civilians here? [Yes&#x2F;No]&quot; If you click YES, it shows you a real image of a mass execution from WW2? Can you imagine the uproar THAT would cause? I suspect that players would either click YES on all of them, or click NO on all of them, so as a mechanic it adds no meaningful choices. If you just want to force exposure to the brutality, you could throw in a random &quot;You clicked &#x27;NO&#x27; but your soldiers disobeyed orders and killed everyone anyway&quot; and display some shocking content, but all that will accomplish is to turn off some segment of your customer base.
