One level up is “CA knows CA better than the Feds”. One level down is “I know my family better than my town”.<p>And one argument against it is that the lower level that &quot;knows better&quot; may not actually have the resources or capabilities to actually address the problem with that knowledge.  That&#x27;s pretty easy to see when you get down to the “I know my family better than my town [does]” level, when the only individual-level solution is some improbable pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps fantasy.')
