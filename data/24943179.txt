The core of the conversion algorithm appears to be based on doing a series of floating-point multiplies, which of course will tend to trash the last few bits. Using volatile to try to avoid reassociation here. But there&#x27;s no comments indicating why the rounding is going to be correct in the range provided, and my gut is that it&#x27;s not going to be correct. (Especially since the double-to-int conversion is truncating, and I&#x27;d na√Øvely expect half the rounding error to round down, which means the last digit is off by one).')
