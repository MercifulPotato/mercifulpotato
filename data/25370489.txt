I can&#x27;t speak to the capabilities of the new M1-based machines, but historically no Macbook or Mini had the hardware for 3D-intensive games. Statistically-speaking, there are zero Mac Pro users, and none of their other hardware is up to the task.<p>I&#x27;m a Unix nerd. My first PC ran Linux for years before I ever installed Windows on anything. I&#x27;ve maintained a Windows-based game PC for the past 20 years solely for gaming. It&#x27;s my most powerful and capable hardware. I wish I could get something remotely as powerful from Apple (for a comparable price) because I prefer MacOS as my daily-driver desktop for professional purposes.')
