Holy shit I had to sign waivers and get a special Unix acount just to ACCESS the RTL model with Intel&#x27;s 64-bit iHDL.<p>I kinda laughed when AMD beat Intel to the punch not once, but TWICE. (1GHz, then 64b).<p>I also worked on the 740, 810 and 815 (both hardware and drivers, oddly, I did a lot of stuff). Game devs HATED us for the 810&#x2F;815 because it was such huge volume they had to target it as the LCD.')
