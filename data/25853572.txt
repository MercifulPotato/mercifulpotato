I&#x27;ve been following the qanon phenomena for a while. My real curiosity is whether January 6 fizzled out the energy enough that it no longer becomes such a large phenomena.<p>I&#x27;m sure we all know a few people who have slipped into sheer lunacy down internet rabbit holes and seem to more or less be literally insane from the various wild stories.<p>The best I can imagine is for it to occupy the same fringe space as other wild conspiracies from the grifters like David Icke and Alex Jones.<p>These people will always exist in society but they should be a small enough group that we aren&#x27;t forced to deal with them as a political force.<p>We shouldn&#x27;t have to spend time, for instance, showing how Vincent Fusca isn&#x27;t the secret alias of a JFK Jr faked death... it&#x27;s such a waste of public engagement.')
