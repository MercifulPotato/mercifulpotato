With an additional century&#x27;s experience, I think it&#x27;s clearer that teaching media literacy just isn&#x27;t enough.<p>One reason is the bullshit asymmetry principal: &quot;The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it.&quot; Another is that liars get a lot more practice in selling their lie than people do in analyzing and refuting a particular lie. A third is that people who live on their lies usually have a much stronger incentive; if I blow $10 on a stupid purchase due to lying ads, I&#x27;m out $10, but the liar is making a living. And that&#x27;s before we even get to the asymmetry in mass communication, where a liar can reach millions. Or the modern micro-targeting era, where lies can be tuned to the audience and hidden from debunkers. Or the way the whole idea of truth can be weakened by authoritarian behavior and mass disinformation.<p>So we really can&#x27;t expect individuals to keep up on their own. As much as I love cynical skepticism, it&#x27;s not enough these days.')
