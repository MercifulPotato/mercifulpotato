For English use it is quite nice except I do like the &#x27; and &quot; keys close to the center, and as a general rule I think switching the 6 bracket keys ()[]{} over two keys to the right would be nicer for programming use to avoid needing to over-extend the pointer-finger (Put ù and Ù on the 5 key anyways, to match with the other accented vowels). I really like the extra basic maths keys as well, since too often there is no LaTeX or Markdown widget in websites.')
