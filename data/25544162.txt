The amount of math and theory was too much for me. One graduate of the university is a prof. of AI at Harvard, another one teaches graph theory at Berkeley, another one who thought me math is a prof. of AI in Toronto and director at Nvidia.<p>So I dropped out, went working for a few years, then enrolled at an another university, then went working again abroad. Now I&#x27;m preparing myself for my last exam and will write my Bachelor thesis in the first half of next year.<p>I plan to graduate, even if it&#x27;s the last thing I do in life.')
