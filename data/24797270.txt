Had little luck sadly.<p>First I tried the Mario theme song, it got it, but with very low confidence and had about equal confidence for a Bone Thugs song lol.<p>Tried it again with a rock song that was at least popular enough to show up on an official Spotify Playlist for its decade and genre. It got that with pretty good accuracy.<p>Finally I tried some sludge metal and punk tunes. I can&#x27;t vocalize the sludge sound worth shit so I&#x27;m not shocked it didn&#x27;t come back with anything, but I&#x27;m mildly disappointed it didn&#x27;t find anything for the relatively simple Choking Victim song I vocalized, but I assume song popularity is a big component.<p>Cool feature though, unfortunately I can&#x27;t hold a tune for as long as the snippet it wants lol.')
