If I were to run into a problem where that was an issue I would question whether or not erlang&#x2F;elixir was the right tool for the task, but in my experience there&#x27;s always been a way to spread that load across multiple processes so that work is being done concurrently and eventually across multiple nodes if the throughput demands keep increasing. If the workload truly does have to be synchronized I&#x27;ve always had the experience that sending a message to another tool was the right answer - maybe a database query or another service, for example.')
