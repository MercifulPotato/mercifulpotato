This is similar to shuffling content in textbooks so that students cannot use the previous version of the textbook<p>2) UI bloat - all options are compressed and displayed on the screen at once, many of the features that may not be addressed to you make it hard for you not to get distracted from what you are doing. Combine that with #1<p>-3) The opposite of 2 where things are hidden and the interface is very unintuitive. Makes the user feel powerless and insecure<p>3) Fast technology cycles and too much innovation in too short of an interval. Sometimes that innovation is pure recycling and coupled with hype<p>4) The decay of the print media together with notetaking with a pen on paper. The endless possibilities that come with using digital notetaking or content consumption come with the explosion of information which we&#x27;re subjected to. We can store more but we remember less. Search engines contributed to the weak outsourcing of our memory externally. Of course, there are plenty of advantages in the digital realm, i&#x27;m only pointing out to a few ways that I feel made my memory much worse over the year. As I said, all these could be subjective and my age (40) as well as my own genetics which can be taken in as a factor. But I noticed that I make less and less effort to memorize things in general')
