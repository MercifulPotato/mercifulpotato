The question is whether they&#x27;re going to pose a threat to the regional galactic order, and if they haven&#x27;t got their cultural act together, do you let them?<p>Seems a strange position to take. Look at our own case. Do we evaluate &quot;un-contacted&#x2F;lost&quot; tribes in the Amazon to see if they may pose a risk to the current Global Order? No, because that would be absurd. They are so far behind technologically that they pose about as much of a threat as a troop of chimps do. For galactic scale civilizations the difference in capabilities is probably at least as extreme as that.')
