Of those the only ones where there is a decent chance of funding at negative rates are bonds&#x2F;money markets and central banks.<p>Bank profits have been squeezed by negative rates precisely because they&#x27;ve been forced to pass on more of the rate reductions to borrowers than they&#x27;ve been able to recapture for themselves.')
