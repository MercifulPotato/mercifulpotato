Report the overage on the next month to give yourself some breathing space), is utterly commonplace within sales culture generally.<p>I&#x27;m sure it doesn&#x27;t happen everywhere, but where your compensation and value is entirely determined by sales goals, this kind of thing goes on rampantly. For example, the Wells Fargo Account Fraud scandal came from exactly the same kinds of things--A massive drive to meet your goals at the expense of all else. Someone is close to their goal one month, and fudges something ever so slightly to make it; other people hear about it, and then it is routine.<p>Executives don&#x27;t care because the numbers look good. Sales people don&#x27;t care because they are hitting their numbers. Only when an outside force comes along does the house of cards come tumbling down.')
