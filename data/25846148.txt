It&#x27;s not like a chunk of &#x27;memory&#x27; in your C program corresponds exactly to a physical location on a DRAM chip anymore. There&#x27;s N layers in-between, not just in the OS&#x27;s virtual memory model but also in the chip&#x27;s caches, etc.<p>We&#x27;re all dealing with abstractions over abstractions at this point, so it&#x27;s really about finding what model of understanding works for the learner and then going from there.')
