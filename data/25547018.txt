Item(by='joe_the_user', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609022571, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25546822, text='Indeed, the murder and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi is distinctly horrific, the mass starvation and other horrors in Yemen merit mention too and the kingdom of Saudi Arabia itself is home to many abuses of its immigrant workforce.<p>Still, one has to note that attention to the horrific abuse of journalist Jamal Khashoggi is also related to him being in an extremely powerful Saudi family (he was the nephew of Adnan Khashoggi, once the world&#x27;s large arms dealer, just for one data point). Notably a family also with strong ties to Turkey (where he was murdered). Khashoggi&#x27;s murder was a logic part of the campaign of the current effective ruler of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, to establish himself as absolute ruler of the kingdom, a campaign that also included kidnapping the various billionaire princes who&#x27;d looted the Saudi treasury and literally torturing their billions out of them (given the billionaires had no doubt engaged in similar to violence to whatever underlings, one might be tempted to enjoy such violence but one should avoid such temptation).<p>And indeed, some might look to MBS as being in the tradition of earlier &quot;enlightened despots&quot; as he also pushes some degree of modernizing measures. I&#x27;d tend to just point out the fundamental rottenness of the Saudi regime as well as the general power structure of the entire area.')
