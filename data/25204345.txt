Thus allowing for massive instantaneous communication across vast interstellar distances.<p>Furthermore, by standing in front of the QTD device, and eliciting an audible command, the device will scan the subject in front of it, and allow himself to be dematerialized and transported to any other node in the interstellar QTD network. Some may call this a Stargate.<p>Or it was planted there by some hippy high on shrooms.')
