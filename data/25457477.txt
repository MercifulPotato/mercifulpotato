It&#x27;s fascinating reading and made me think carefully about how much sleep I was getting.<p>I used to think of sleep as something that I could put off on a whim and catch-up on over the weekend.  I would stay up later to play video games or program if I felt like it.  Now, I&#x27;m a lot more rigorous in keeping to my nighttime sleep schedule.  Whatever I&#x27;m doing can normally wait until the next day.')
