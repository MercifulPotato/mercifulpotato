Lamport even says[2]<p>&gt; I know of no purely logical system that is currently available. Systems like Scribe and LaTeX permit the user to describe the visual appearance as well as the logical structure of the documentâ€”for example, by inserting a command to add a quarter-inch vertical space. The need to provide the user with such commands is a symptom of the deficiencies of these systems.<p>[1] Leslie Lamport, &quot;Document Production: Visual or Logical?&quot;, page 6, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;research&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;prod&#x2F;2016&#x2F;12&#x2F;Document-Production.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;research&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;prod&#x2F;2016&#x2F;1...</a><p>[2] supra, page 2')
