We released to Android first. Then in 2018 we built a UWP variant of our app. This process barely took a week if I don&#x27;t include the technical debt that took an extra week to sort out. Then in 2019 we built an iOS variant of our app too - again barely taking a week to do so.<p>Xamarin Forms let us build 4 years worth of tech for Android only. And then, when we had time and the customer demand to do so, with a small amount of work - port our app to 2 other platforms in fairly short order.<p>I don&#x27;t know of any other platform that could do this - particularly when considering the years involved.<p>Our app uses local databases on the device - so a web based app would not have cut it. And our app has roots in 2014 tech when many possible alternate approaches did not exist yet.')
