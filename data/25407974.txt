Item(by='tasogare', descendants=None, kids=[25408134], score=None, time=1607878834, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25407898, text='&gt; vocabulary acquisition shouldn&#x27;t be constrained to the typical or more salient nouns and adjectives<p>My recent research finding (that needs to be confirmed with new data I collected) is that East-Asian L2 learners of English have a gap in knowledge of adjectives&#x2F;adverbs in comparison of nouns. The nouns causing them problem are in the 3000 frequency vocabulary band while the adj&#x2F;adv they don’t know are in the 2000 frequency band. That’s a very huge gap. So you are totally right that other part of speech that nouns should be given more attention.')
