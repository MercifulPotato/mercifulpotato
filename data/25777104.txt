Got most of my friends and actually all of my coworkers to switch.<p>The one thing that really bums me out is that the desktop app is another Electron app.<p>At the time of initial development and even now, there&#x27;s really been no good cross platform way to build a desktop app with a team as small as Signal&#x27;s, but they recently had an AMA on reddit where I asked if they had considered migrating to a Flutter based desktop app in the future. Their answer was generally positive regarding Flutter, but also a fairly firm no to future migration, so it seems we&#x27;re stuck with Electron unless something changes.')
