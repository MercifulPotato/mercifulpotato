Why is this useful? Because otherwise you have to carry the qubit over by hand. It&#x27;s really just &quot;quantum ethernet&quot; not &quot;quantum teleportation&quot;.<p>There are actually other uses, too, about error tolerance, allowing you to quality-control some steps of the computation and repeat them if necessary without risking damaging the results of other steps.')
