And I think it also helps explain how pretty much any Apple product announcement is contentious on here. Most people buying status goods won&#x27;t say, &quot;I buy it so people think I&#x27;m more interesting and important.&quot; They instead justify purchases in conventional terms like quality. That makes objective discussion of quality fraught because they create feelings of status threat and cognitive dissonance.')
