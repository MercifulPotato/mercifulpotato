Personally I can&#x27;t imagine a scenario where someone actually feels any pain from this naming decision. Adding &quot;nim&quot; to your prologue search is par for the course for many categories of search. I laugh about how often I get guitar string ads because I&#x27;m always looking up &quot;elixir string&quot; documentation xD but it&#x27;s not a pain point.  Who suffers here?  It&#x27;s FOSS so the &quot;marketing&quot; of the project has little to do with the name I&#x27;d suspect. I mean who is going to pick a technology based on the search-ability? We&#x27;re talking about decisions being made by people who are highly skilled internet searchers.')
