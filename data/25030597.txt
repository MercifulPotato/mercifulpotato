The tech industry could have implemented the requirements differently, but they haven&#x27;t done that, instead taking the most annoying and obvious route. The closest thing to a technical solution that <i>was</i> widespread is do-not-track, but since it gets thoroughly ignored nowadays, it&#x27;s worthless. As an example, since the DNT header is a pretty clear signal that you don&#x27;t want to consent for various tracking, websites wouldn&#x27;t have to display the consent-form for that and could only use essential cookies (or leave a choice for cookies for other purposes, if there are any).\nRecital 32:\n&quot;This could include ticking a box when visiting an internet website, choosing technical settings for information society services or another statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subjectâ€™s acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her personal data.&quot;<p>And according to the ico (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ico.org.uk&#x2F;for-organisations&#x2F;guide-to-data-protection&#x2F;guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr&#x2F;consent&#x2F;what-is-valid-consent&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ico.org.uk&#x2F;for-organisations&#x2F;guide-to-data-protectio...</a>), the common click-this-button-to-get-through or do annoying things is <i>not</i> valid consent: &quot;You may not rely on silence, inactivity, default settings, pre-ticked boxes or your general terms and conditions, or seek to take advantage of inertia, inattention or default bias in any other way.&quot;.<p>The reason why you <i>don&#x27;t</i> want a specific technical provision in this law (and almost all laws) is that they get outdated in less than five years. For example, imagine a framework based on http-headers fixed in law. That would&#x27;ve made it (almost) impossible for google to introduce spdy in europe, since it <i>isn&#x27;t</i> http. Or, more general, the EU initiative to use micro-usb connectors would have made the switch to usb-c impossible, if they were written into law. And that&#x27;s a comparatively slow moving field, with a very specific applications (charging mobile phones).')
