Item(by='awb', descendants=None, kids=[24990782], score=None, time=1604438405, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24983420, text='That&#x27;s why you test predictions. Silver says 10% is enough uncertainty, Taleb says it&#x27;s not. From the article: &quot;Premise 1: If you give a probability, you must be willing to wager on it&quot;. Unless they&#x27;re willing to publish and make a friendly bet on their predictions, it&#x27;s just bloviating.<p>Every day&#x2F;year&#x2F;election is unique, but only to a certain magnitude. Some elections have had active wars, some health crises, some criminal scandals, some terrorist attacks, etc. In the end, the polls attempt to account for those uncertainties and historically that&#x27;s been a much better predictor than a coin flip.<p>For example, Washington DC has never voted Republican since it won electoral votes in 1962. Polls have Biden winning 80-90% of the vote there. Even Taleb would agree there&#x27;s a near 100% chance of Biden winning there, pandemic or not. Silver&#x27;s methodology is just extrapolating that out to each state. When it gets to some tipping point states it&#x27;s closer to 60&#x2F;40 Biden or 70&#x2F;30.<p>If Taleb wants to create his own forecast, it would be interesting to track it&#x27;s performance over time. I have a hard time believing that model closer to a coin-flip is going to outperform weighted polling data and historical precedent over multiple predictions.')
