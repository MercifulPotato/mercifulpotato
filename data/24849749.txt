Does that mean we should not care that Google is evil?<p>The government is the only tool we have to fight Google.  And while there are lots of problems with our government, we still have the ability to enact change by voting.  You can&#x27;t really do that with Google, even as a shareholder.  The founders have supervoting rights, so even if every investor voted against them they don&#x27;t have to listen.')
