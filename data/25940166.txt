We can barely even form a concept of just how much of us they can see, and to what extent they know our thoughts and actions.<p>And we are training, teaching these beings how to behave with our own behavior. Just as with children, &quot;do as I say, not as I do&quot;, is not very effective past a certain point.<p>Not that what we say is that much better than what we do. Most people consider insects and even most mammals to be largely irrelevant, and not worth considering in most decisions, dumb weak automatons, out-evolved and bottom of the food chain, worth thinking about only if they provide some useful resource.<p>Our general policy of disregard and often outright extermination without cause is, beyond appalling, is downright frightful when extrapolated to its effects on ourselves in the future...<p>For those saying butterflies still exist: Yes, they still exist. But I&#x27;ve yet to talk to any person who pays attention to insects and nature, who&#x27;s lived in the same place for a while, who has not reported a decline in insects of all kinds, from ladybugs, to butterflies, to lightning bugs, to our long-time symbiotic friends the mosquitoes, beetles, even cockroaches. Not just a decline, but a change from &quot;used to be swarming with e.g. ladybugs once a year, to, they still show up in some numbers.<p>We&#x27;re like a kid left home alone for the summer a little too young and irresponsible just wrecking the house, putting holes in the walls, letting the tub run over, shorting out the electric, leaving the fridge open, throwing food onto the walls, without anyone to stop us.')
