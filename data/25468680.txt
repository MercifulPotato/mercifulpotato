AlphaGo took me by surprise, but apart from the occasional cheater, its consequences are mostly great:<p>- I have a superhuman teacher available anytime, ready to analyze all my games and answer all my questions (though the &quot;why?&quot; question sometimes takes a fair bit for the teacher to explain).<p>- A lot of widely accepted dogmas in go were shaken, that was just a whole lot of fun.<p>- Learning joseki (corner sequences) finally makes sense (they used to develop and change every year, which on my level wasn&#x27;t worth keeping on top of).<p>- It&#x27;s a sneak peek into what&#x27;s coming with AI. I watched the Lee Sedol match live, some of the AlphaGo moves were amazing. The human commentary was enlighteningly wrong: &quot;oh he lost the first game, surely he&#x27;ll win the next four&quot;')
