Item(by='roenxi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605185868, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25068895, text='&gt; Do people read this and think that is the sort of life they would want in the future?<p>I think the author purposefully avoided saying anyone that.<p>But the part of the story that stood out to me viscerally was the neglect of maintenance crews and the design work, etc and how that plays into a status hierarchy. It is the same frustrating arrogance I sometimes see in city dwellers who just don&#x27;t understand how many people are physically labouring to to maintain the artificial environment of a large city.<p>A handwave and &quot;robots will do all that stuff by 2030&quot; is too fantastic to stomach.')
