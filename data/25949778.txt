They short the stock because the fundamentals say to short the stock, regardless of the games being played. The short interest is high because the underlying company is in very bad shape. It should probably already be bankrupt.<p>Short trades are dangerous, and dangerous in a new way. The old maxim remains true that the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. Or in this case, retail investors will pay to enjoy your suffering longer than you can remain solvent, and consider it a cheap price to pay.<p>Still... if I had bigger appetite risk, I&#x27;d short this stock myself. The price is obviously too high, and there&#x27;s a ton of money to be made by shorting it. But the horizon on that profit is longer than I have the stomach for.')
