Leaving a phone at home that is not answering calls or creating traffic during the time of interest is also a lead (if you already have a suspect).<p>Won&#x27;t most phones being left at home generate no traffic because it&#x27;s connected to wifi? AFAIK most phones turn off their mobile data connection if connected to wifi. It&#x27;s also not too unreasonable to have very little baseline voice traffic, since everyone&#x27;s texting these days. As for texts, it might be suspicious if you have a high baseline amount of texts, but it&#x27;s also not too unreasonable for someone to communicate almost exclusively using chat apps (eg. signal, imessage).')
