Literally, that would mean hitting them with a soft foam hammer.<p>&quot;<i>Oh, but for good measure... &quot;The radical right is a scourge ... They need to be repeatedly smacked down until normalcy is achieved.&quot;</i>&quot;<p>owlbynight&#x27;s entire quote:<p>&quot;<i>Our political representatives are corrupt and generally represent whomever gives them the most money, namely large corporations.</i><p>&quot;<i>We, the people, are represented through our wallets now by the corporations that control our politicians because social media has unionized us. We&#x27;re able to use online platforms to leverage companies into giving us what we want socially by threatening them when they step out of line. The companies that led to Parler shutting down were acting on public sentiment as a boon to their brands, thus ultimately reflecting the will of the people.</i><p>&quot;<i>It&#x27;s kind of like a single payer system for social justice.</i><p>&quot;<i>It&#x27;s weird end run back to representation but I&#x27;ll take it for now. The radical right is a scourge that, unchecked, will lead to us having no rights at all. They need to be repeatedly smacked down until normalcy is achieved.</i>&quot;<p>I could be wrong, but I&#x27;m also not reading that as a call for violence, much less &quot;hang and quarter&quot;. It&#x27;s not a particularly attractive metaphor, though.')
