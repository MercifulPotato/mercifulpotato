But that was true in the previous elections too, though to a lesser degree. Something like 40% of Democrats thought the 2004 election was stolen due to voter fraud in Ohio. There were hearings in Congress. RFK, Jr. peddled the Ohio fraud story. 67% of Democrats believed that Putin “altered vote totals to help Trump win” in 2016.<p>I’m not comparing the impact of two situations! What Republicans did was shameful. Grandstanding and symbolically calling into question the legitimacy of the administration based on a big lie is worse than doing it based on a small lie. (Though, I think folks underestimate how many people with authority genuinely believe the election fraud lie, and also believed the Russia changed the votes lie. The vast majority of Americans don’t believe the official story about the Kennedy assassination! People are extremely prone to conspiracy theories.)')
