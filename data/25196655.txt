But it seemed to be your point that existing processes which turn energy into money are a hindrance to clean energy investments. The previous commenter offered an example of aluminum smelting. Which is not exactly what I meant, because I was being more literal when I was talking about an energy-into-money process, and that example appears to really mean energy-to-aluminum-to-money. I understood this example to mean that the reason other existing &quot;energy-to-money&quot; processes have been a hindrance to clean energy investments is that they have byproducts which negate clean efforts. In contrast to this, renewable crypto mining has no physical byproducts. Dunno if I misunderstood something.')
