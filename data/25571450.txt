I&#x27;ve been wanting to write a reader that RSS-like ingests things and gives me a throttled digest - to reduce the frequency of the slot pulling behavior.<p>The problem i&#x27;ve been struggling with is how i properly summarize. The slot behavior is useful because slot-wins have material impact of finding content i do, actually, want to consume. Reducing the slot-pulls to once a day puts more weight on something else doing the filtering. Meaning i fear missing things i care about.<p>I wonder if there&#x27;s some type of non-ML pattern seeking implementation that will let you refine your filter to improve signal:noise. I say non-ML because i&#x27;m interested in non-trained, smaller locally hosted datasets.<p>Anyway, i digress. This is cool! I think i&#x27;ll let this thing be my slot-machine for the next few days and see if i feel like i&#x27;m missing anything. Appreciate it!')
