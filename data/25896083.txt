If anything, we’re heading away from that, with a much wider array of companies actively investing either cash or employee time in open source.<p>What&#x27;s actually changed, IMO, is that it&#x27;s a lot harder to get traction with commercial software than it used to be, so even forms that have no open-source-compatible business model in mind launch as open source, meaning that they have to figure out a unexpected business model or pivot out of open source at some point.<p>And, for PR reasons, they want someone else to blame for the pivot out of open source, so we get all the AWS-blaming and “the market has become radically less favorable to open source” stories, neither of which is grounded in reality.')
