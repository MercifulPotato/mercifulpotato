CGNAT is expensive to run, but carriers do it because it can be less expensive than getting more IPv4 addresses, and it&#x27;s faster to add capacity than to get addresses. IPv6 addresses are very low cost and quick to ger assigned, so if you&#x27;re supporting IPv6, and you run low on addresses, adding CGNAT doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>It&#x27;s much more typical to either have cgnat IPv4 and public IPv6, or just cgnat IPv4 and no IPv6 than to have cgnat both.')
