Item(by='pjmorris', descendants=None, kids=[24753863], score=None, time=1602506016, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24750417, text='&gt; It&#x27;s amoral and when owned by the &quot;good guys&quot; (whatever your definition), it amplifies those morals and ethics and vice versa for the &quot;bad guys&quot;.<p>I think my main point is that it is the technology-wielding side that prevails, independent of morality. Which means that technology has a moral impact, in reshaping what would otherwise be a fairer fight. Having won, the tech-wielders claim they are the good guys, independent of the actual morality of the situation. &quot;Might makes right.&quot; &quot;History is written by the victors.&quot;')
