If the public wants its way, they can vote for it. For what it&#x27;s worth, the public did not support gay marriage until after the federal courts made it a fait accompli. E.g. In a referendum, <i>California</i> voted to <i>ban</i> gay marriage in 2008. What the federal courts in America did is overturn the standing will of the people as it existed in the laws of the majority of US states.')
