The recruiters I was contacted by then was very professional and all the interviews was actually quite good matches competence wise. Now lately I did the mistake to check a box in LinkedIn that I was interested in a new job, and I have been in contact by recruiters that clearly play a numbers game and try to send me on as many interviews as they can. And that becomes a waste of time when both I and the interviewer within minutes realise that either I don’t have the specific experiences they are looking for or it is a position I’m not at all interested in. And that the recruiter knew before the interview. I often don’t hear from those recruiters again until they have another interview they think they can send me on. All of this second kind of recruiters have been based in the UK, while the first ones have been physically present in Stockholm.')
