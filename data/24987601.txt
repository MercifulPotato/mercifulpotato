The main difference is that this time is holding opinions against itself. Previously, opinions were held against Java, that&#x27;s why there are features such as case classes, traits, and immutability by default. They answer to Java problems.<p>Scala is now mature enough that some issues have emerged. Typeclasses are cool, but programming typeclasses in Scala is a bit clunky. The type system is very powerful, but it could be even more powerful and that would actually help people write simpler code. And there are a bunch of unused features that could be removed. This is what Scala 3 is about.')
