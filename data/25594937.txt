So if  you&#x27;re working with her and she&#x27;s rude to you, it has nothing to do with anything you did. 99% of how someone reacts to you is based upon what they&#x27;re going through. And plus getting upset over someone else doesn&#x27;t improve anything.<p>I also have some Buddhist leanings, which are so important to me I told a girl it wasn&#x27;t going to work when she said that Buddhism was satanic.<p>Finally learn to appreciate and love yourself, this is by far the hardest lesson I continue to learn. It&#x27;s very easy to look at maybe a job you didn&#x27;t get or a relationship that didn&#x27;t work and think that you&#x27;re some type of broken thing. But you realize no one really has it figured out we&#x27;re all just trying to get through the day, you can make peace with who you are')
