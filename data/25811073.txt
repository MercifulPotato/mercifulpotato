I have lived in small isolated towns a couple of times.  These were by no means social utopias, yet I did find that people were more interested in the ideas of other people within their community.  This is in stark contrast to the Internet where you look around for communities that reflect yourself, and that are more trigger happy when it comes to dissenters.')
