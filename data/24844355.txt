We started this year, so we definitely have a lot more work to reach feature-parity with Firebase. Since we are using existing OSS products though, we&#x27;re moving pretty fast.<p>We have made some technological decisions which we feel are better than firebase too. A developer sent us a note today that they converted a query from Firebase to Supabase and the result was a reduction from 27.9 seconds to 1.3 seconds. This is because we are building on top of Postgres. We also benchmarked our smallest servers yesterday - we were getting around 1200 reads&#x2F;s on our smallest servers (FB was doing 1540 reads&#x2F;s). We aim to get closer to 2K over the next 1 month and we&#x27;ll publish the benchmarks.<p>&gt; It doesnâ€™t, however, support offline use cases<p>This is correct - it could take a few more months to get this out. Right now we&#x27;re focused on stability&#x2F;performance.<p>I&#x27;m happy to answer any other questions')
