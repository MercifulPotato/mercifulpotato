Then, conformal coat the circuit card with sufficient thickness for tin whisker mitigation.<p>Conformal coat really is the saving grace for tin whiskers. It&#x27;s not perfect, a whisker can push through sometimes but then the whisker has to push back through the conformal coat again which is much harder.')
