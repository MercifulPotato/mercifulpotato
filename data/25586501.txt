In fact, I was given a team nickname of &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot; because they know I&#x27;ll come in and find tons of issues when it&#x27;s time for review.<p>A few reasons why I think this happens:\n1) Developers and QA teams optimize for testing happy paths, not the combination of every potential path.\n2) Tests are performed within the scope of the current work, not the scope of the application. That&#x27;s how you end up with bugs where edits in one section of the app inadvertently affect another part of the app.\n3) Automated frontend tests aren&#x27;t thorough enough or aren&#x27;t implemented by the development team. I&#x27;ve found teams are more likely to test backend code than frontend.\n4) Errors often don&#x27;t affect application usage and have easy workarounds. These get noted but continuously deprioritized.\n5) The majority of users don&#x27;t vocalize the issues they run into because of the effort involved. They either get frustrated and stop using the application or they find a workaround. As a result, bugs continue to exist due to a lack of awareness and the proper channels to report bugs.\n6) Software is increasingly reliant on a web of internal dependencies. As those dependencies get updated, due to their own bug or security fixes, developers must update their own software to accommodate these changes. Every change is a new opportunity for something to break.')
