Every inch of land on Earth has been &quot;reused&quot; many times over, too.  That doesn&#x27;t change the fact that there&#x27;s a finite amount of it, and the possession of any quantity of it is at the expense of everyone else needing it.  Same goes for water; yes, the water itself doesn&#x27;t magically disappear, but of the 1,386,000,000 cubic kilometers of water on this planet, if you&#x27;re storing a trillion of those km³ for yourself in water tanks, that&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> less that other people can use.<p>That is: as defined above, consumption ≠ destruction, but rather consumption = possession.<p>(This ain&#x27;t even mentioning the distinction between actual potable water v. water contaminated with salt or outright toxins - and the resulting labor and energy costs of converting the latter back into the former.  It also ain&#x27;t even mentioning the labor and energy costs of moving water from where it&#x27;s abundant to where it&#x27;s scarce.)')
