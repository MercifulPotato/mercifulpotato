It takes a couple decades of education before a person can even begin to enter the workforce. Raising kids was once an investment, now people can barely afford to raise 1 or 2.<p>Our inefficient stuff is made by people in foreign countries working in factories whose lives really aren&#x27;t any better than middle ages Europe.<p>Also, People like farming and hard physical labour. In the suburbs every household has a little miniature hobby farm that yields a useless crop, and people farm it for fun over and above their regular job. When people don&#x27;t have to do any hard labour as part of their job, they go to a gym and pay money for the privelege of moving heavy things around even though it serves no practical purpose.<p>All this inefficiency is destroying the planet, which is the dumbest thing of all.')
