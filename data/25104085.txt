It does depend on who you follow and if you <i>choose</i> to click on things so again it is my original sin to try to have productive conversations... so yes, if I choose to put myself in a bubble on twitter, I probably wouldn&#x27;t see that stuff... but I tend to click on articles or discussions on <i>any</i> social media. I &quot;try&quot; to use it as intended.<p>Just look up &quot;mayos&quot; or &quot;yts&quot; or &quot;white people&quot; in the search bar and you&#x27;ll instantly see racism.<p>Click any articles about start ups or business or billionaires that make their way to the &quot;general population&quot; of twitter and you&#x27;ll see tons of hatred.')
