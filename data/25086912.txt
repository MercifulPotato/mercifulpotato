I&#x27;m staying on Mojave for the foreseeable future, but I&#x27;ll stay with Mac because Logic Pro is not available on any other platform.  Sometimes applications are fungible, or you&#x27;re lucky and your critical application is available on multiple platforms, but sometimes there are only certain applications that can do what you want. I run a MacOS System 7 for software to edit my Yamaha VL-1.  I run MacOS 9.2.8 due to hardware drivers for a Korg OasysPCI.  I run MacOS 10.6.8 Snow Leopard because is is the last OS that runs rosetta and keeps numerous PowerPC apps that never made the jump to Intel.  I&#x27;ll keep Mojave running when eventually I have to jump to Arm because I&#x27;m sure a lot of the software I run won&#x27;t make the jump to Arm.  I&#x27;d LOVE to drop any of those systems, but each exists because there are applications that do not have replacement on modern OS&#x27;es.')
