You must use different browser profiles or a similar sandboxing method. Definitely out of the question for mobile.<p>&gt; 2) No way to transfer your old servers, friends, roles, etc, to a new account.<p>&gt; 3) Making a new account isn&#x27;t always a reasonable option even if you are willing to lose all of your old data. Moving from one role to another to another in a gaming career often is done gradually through connections and community (but that doesn&#x27;t imply you should have to be forced to expose your system username and user id to everyone everywhere).<p>&gt; 4) Even if you do make a new account, that new account might get disabled automatically until you provide a phone number. Throwaway numbers don&#x27;t work.')
