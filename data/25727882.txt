I have no reason to. I can switch to Signal with my most important contacts in the space of one hour if I wanted to. I never invested any money in them either. I won&#x27;t get sad if they get nuked from orbit tomorrow.<p>But it&#x27;s really baffling how non-constructive most Telegram HN coverage is, both articles and comments. Sure, they have no bulletproof end-to-end encryption of messages. So, like 99.9% of all apps on all app stores then? Some generic marketing on the homepage using vaguely non-accurate language (&quot;secure chats&quot;)? So, again, like 99.9% of the apps that have a page and put marketing lingo on them?<p>What&#x27;s so uniquely awful about Telegram?<p>It&#x27;s legitimately intriguing how hostile HN gets at the mention of Telegram. There might be some interesting sociological study hidden there somewhere.')
