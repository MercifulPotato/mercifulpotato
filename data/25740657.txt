Care to cite a historian?<p>Tell me the literature you looked in first, because I want to know which books can miss such <i>basic</i> facts, and hence what I should avoid. The history of Europe is soaked in blood provoked by differences over what can be said by religious people, to religious people, and of them and their views. Entire wars have been fought over it - are you going to tell me there are historians that are credible who&#x27;ll claim Europe was a land of toleration? Locke wrote his letter of toleration specifically <i>because</i> of the widespread intolerance and bloodshed.<p>If you use the word <i>heresy</i> instead of blasphemy and your search may prove more fruitful. It was effect in Europe from the Edict of Thessalonica, which brought the first execution, and in some countries hasn&#x27;t been repealed from law.
