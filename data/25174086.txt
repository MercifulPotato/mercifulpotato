The focus is on women in this instance for one reason: the data gathered and referred to in the comment you so disingenuously took offense to shows that women are disproportionately affected by this issue. Are men with small hands also affected? Yes, but that is not an identity half of the people on this planet identify with. I&#x27;d hazard to guess there are not a great deal of people who feel defined by the size of their hands (or discriminated against systematically).<p>Fortunately breaking down this barrier benefits everyone, regardless of sex. Feminism benefits all.')
