Oldhats hate being hawked to, but novices really enjoy any info.  Ask oldhats what they use and why, what are the pain-points.  For novices, offer free info that gently points towards your product.  Redditors in general have an aversion to paying for stuff so use it more for knowledge and generating positive buzz by sharing valuable information.')
