Everything happens with 100% certainty.<p>Then, what is probability? If everything will happen with 100% certainty, but probability certainly <i>appears</i> to exist, then probability must reflect something about <i>our information about something occurring</i>.<p>The author refers to two foundational approaches to our state of knowledge. The first is the objectivist approach, which states that everyone who has the same state of knowledge about a system will evaluate the same probability of something occurring. The second is the subjectivist approach, which states that a given individual with a certain state of knowledge will evaluate some probability of something occurring. To me, these appear to be the same thing except insofar as the former requires a consensus of many while the latter a consensus of one.<p>The author asks how we might actually define Bayesian probability without resorting to the frequentist approach (i.e. hypothetically simulating many trials of the same event, however infrequent in reality it may be).<p>First, he says this would mean &quot;interpreting [the credible interval] like a confidence interval&quot;. I am no statistician, but is that necessarily true? I don&#x27;t see why confidence intervals would suddenly emerge in order to interpret a credible interval.<p>Second, I am not sure the frequentist interpretation is so problematic. When we interpret the plain-English definition of a probability, are we not mentally simulating repeated trials in order to evaluate something&#x27;s occurrence? What else could a probability imply? If something has a 20% chance of occurring, then it does not occur 80% of the time, and so we must envision 80% of universes (part of the hypothetical trials) where it does not occur. I don&#x27;t see any other way around this, frequentist or not.<p>(Note: I am not a statistician, while the author is, and the above is simply my layman&#x27;s understanding of the article.)')
