We&#x27;re never going to. Again, the US functioned just fine allowing &quot;hate speech&quot; to be legal. Would there be consequences to such speech? Sure, and deservedly. But the <i>government</i> couldn&#x27;t do anything to you, that&#x27;s the point. And I would strongly argue that Facebook, Twitter, et al have de facto replaced the government - they are a new governance for society whether we like it or not.<p>And why would we engage in a &quot;complex negotiation&quot; (that sounds to me like a euphemism for right&#x2F;left extremists and massive unprecedented violence) to reach a &quot;less than ideal&quot; outcome over an issue that 250 years of history prove is not only unnecessary but in all likelihood <i>extraordinarily</i> dangerous??? Again, why was free speech the first one???? It f-ing works, that&#x27;s why. It&#x27;s the foundation for the best governance human beings have ever achieved. To have people now in 2021 just kinda shrug about its importance is mind-blowing to me.')
