It&#x27;s entirely possible that the latter is better somehow!<p>However, the reality is that nearly the entire web is pretty consistent in how you can navigate a page - space bar will jump down a bit, pages usually respect my scroll speed settings, tabbing between elements works if the dev didn&#x27;t fuck it up, etc.<p>I value consistency in how I interact with my computer. I would rather not use an app&#x2F;buy a thing&#x2F;etc if it works differently from other similar items purely for aesthetic reasons. If it works demonstrably better, maybe there&#x27;s an argument to be made, but when it&#x27;s strictly a matter of _opinion_, I&#x27;m inclined to say that consistency &gt; doing some one-off behavior.<p>Imagine if the brake and gas pedal were reversed in one specific car, just because the person who designed&#x2F;built it thought that it was more comfortable&#x2F;looked better&#x2F;etc. That would be an extremely dangerous car to drive (at least for me). I have a lot of years of muscle memory built up, and if I&#x27;m in some kind of dangerous situation on the road where I&#x27;d need to hit the brakes in a hurry, I want to be _damn_ sure that I&#x27;m pressing the correct pedal.<p>For websites, it&#x27;s an inconvenience that can be explained away as a difference of opinion. For many, many other kinds of interaction, this approach is actively hazardous.<p>(and to be clear, I&#x27;m not saying that we shouldn&#x27;t try new things or attempt to redesign things that people are used to, but I _am_ saying that a large business trying to sell a new thing is probably not the time nor place for it. Experiment with it on your portfolio or something and don&#x27;t go out of your way to degrade my experience if you want me to buy something from you!)')
