You can fork websites, edit them - and you can script this functionality. (For example, I have a wiki software in Beaker that will handle all the forking and editing behind the scenes - using Javascript to make it happen.)<p>You could say that Brave is a read-only HTML browser with wide support for decentralization protocols. While Beaker is a read-write HTML browser with its own protocol. And they both use the regular web as well.')
