FF was awful, and so was IE.<p>It started that way, then it dominated because every google search not using chrome popped up “Better with Chrome” or “Try Chrome.” Same with all of Google’s properties. There’s no way to disable this. That’s billions of free adverts every day. It adds up.<p>I think similarly back in the 90s that IE4 took off because Netscape4 was horrible and then stagnated, but dominated because Windows bundled and required it. They had bundled and required IE2&#x2F;3 but those were inferior to NN3.<p>So being good gets them to critical mass and then anticompetitive forces got them to owning.')
