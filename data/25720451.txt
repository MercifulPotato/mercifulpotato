Their own staff have to use extensions (that break every update), even Fedora (!!!) has to patch GNOME packages now.<p>They kept fighting that their workflow is superior and now they are going to change it all over next release. They keep butchering their toolkit, I can only use Qt applications now. Hell I&#x27;ll take even Electron over GTK.<p>For me the Linux desktop with a WM is the perfect balance of exposing the internals and UX. It could be better but that&#x27;s true to every OS, at least here I have my freedom. I&#x27;m keeping my eye on KDE, seems like they rewrote their less than ideal compositor (legacy X11 is a burden) and maybe in a year I could be using that.<p>I&#x27;ve once heard someone say that GNOME is Microsoft&#x27;s favorite DE. You can guess why.')
