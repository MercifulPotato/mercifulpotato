It inspired some small parts of the Git UX like the `--patch` mode for `git commit`.<p>The author of Darcs, David Roundy realized that Git was going to dominate so started a &quot;best of both worlds&quot; project that used the storage format of Git but the UX of darcs.

By having experienced Darcs, it&#x27;s frustrating to teach Git to newcomers knowing the experience and ease of use could be so much better.<p>More context:<p><pre><code>   * https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mark.stosberg.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2008&#x2F;11&#x2F;darcs_vs_git_annoyances_push_-dry-run.html\n   * https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mark.stosberg.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2008&#x2F;11&#x2F;darcs_vs_git_annoyances_pushing_specific_patches.html</code></pre>')
