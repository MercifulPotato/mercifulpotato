We were unable to express things in such a way that the other person wouldn&#x27;t get riled up by it. We both did a course and started applying it actively in our life. Our fights immediately became a lot intense and we were able to explain our needs way more carefully, and at some point we decided to break up in a good way because these needs weren&#x27;t met. I still deem this a success because if we didn&#x27;t talk properly or clarified our needs we would maybe still in this rollercoaster.<p>Work wise, as a developer I apply it a lot when I see that there is some form of miscommunication. As a developer I am sort of used to fight for my opinion in discussions but before I was not able to voice it that I was mostly concerned. For instance. I work with startups, and the founders talk a lot in meetings, but don&#x27;t really seem to listen to clients want (because they are passionate of their product&#x2F;idea_. Instead of saying you should listen more (actually I did this a lot in the beginning), I&#x27;m voicing that I&#x27;m afraid we&#x27;re missing out on clients and we should work on a way that we can ensure that clients feel heard.<p>In the beginning I was a bit unskillful, so I weirded out some people, but it got better over time.\nI don&#x27;t really use the template as-is anymore.<p>In terms of failures. It&#x27;s a bit of a balancing act in opening up and vulnerability. If you apply it properly you&#x27;re basically an open book, and not always the people opposite of you can return the favour. There will come a moment that the person opposite of you can&#x27;t open up just yet.<p>I still think NVC is a good base to start from. On top of this I also started practicing deep listening in the practice of Buddhism at Plum Village in France which also helps me in life.<p>It takes energy and practice and it will always be work, but I see it as a good addition in my life.')
