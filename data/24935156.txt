Item(by='ryanbooz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604002295, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24934185, text='TimescaleDB is purpose built for time-series data on Postgres. We offer native compression on this data and smart, easily adjustable partitioning, continuous and real-time analytics, automated time-series data management (retention, reordering, tiering, etc) and so forth... again, all focused on time-series data. With a few specific commands, we abstract all of the time-series partitioning for you and provide time-series specific functions to make queries more efficient and useful.<p>Citus is a great product that primarily focused on multi-tenant SaaS analytics, where you typically shard your queries on the tenant_id, but didn&#x27;t focus on time-series. So, their current documented solution for time-series uses other extensions (pg_partman), doesn&#x27;t provide for compression, and all the other essential tools to make massive amounts of time-series data useful, which TimescaleDB is hyper-focused on solving.')
