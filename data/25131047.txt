If the tax is high enough then the &quot;status quo&quot; will change in months, because it&#x27;ll be trivial for new or existing market participants to offer cheaper alternatives.<p>And this gives the equation for calculating the minimum carbon tax rate. It has to be high enough that it covers the in&#x2F;efficiency premium and the overhead costs (R&amp;D, marketing, approval, implementation&#x2F;construction, distribution, upkeep).<p>We already see this in case of coal plants. Coal was cheaper, but as the natural gas infrastructure expanded, gas turbines became more efficient, oil&#x2F;gas price have fallen a lot <i>and</i> emission standards became stricter, and now it just doesn&#x27;t make sense to even keep existing coal plants online. Because upkeep is high and they are so dirty.<p>Now the next step is to push out oil&#x2F;gas plants, but first put carbon capture on the smokestacks.<p>Since carbon capture basically &quot;doubles&quot; the cost of electricity it makes sense to have a tax that is higher than that so power plants will opt to install carbon capture.<p>And so similarly we can calculate for transportation, space heating.')
