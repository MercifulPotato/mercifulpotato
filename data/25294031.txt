I believe a huge portion of the budgets for movies also revolves around marketing in general. Maybe those budgets can be reduced substantially if the movies are all being placed directly on streaming services. For instance, does it really matter in a streaming only world if your movie does huge numbers on the first weekend it comes out? I&#x27;d imagine success will be measured more in retention and possibly new subscriptions corresponding with a specific movie release.')
