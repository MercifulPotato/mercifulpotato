So even if you don&#x27;t add macro fusion, you are still getting advantages from fewer cache misses or less money spent on cache.<p>You seem to talk theory, when in practice we know the BOOM RISC-V CPU outperforms a ARM-32 Cortex-A9, while requiring half the silicon area. The RISC-V is 0.27 mm2 while the ARM is 0.53 mm2 using same technology.<p>And what you are missing from the overall picture is that a key requirement for RISC-V is that it is useable in academia and for teaching. It is supposed to be easy for students to learn as well as to implement simple RISC-V CPU cores. All of that is quickly out the window if you go down the ARM road.<p>That RISC-V pulls off all these things: higher performance, smaller die, simpler implementation and easier to teach validates IMHO their choices. I don&#x27;t see how your argument has any legs to stand on.')
