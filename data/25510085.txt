Item(by='gnusty_gnurc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608665217, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25509678, text='&gt; it’s worth throwing in there that the democratically elected leader Donald Trumps pledge to “clean the swamp” has left the government controlled by family and loyalists<p>He&#x27;s certainly put on display just how horribly the system functions and it&#x27;s clear he&#x27;s more of a symptom than a cause of the dysfunction. There wasn&#x27;t even a pretense of a good faith effort to try to cooperate and start cleaning house.<p>By virtue of beating Clinton and easily taking the nomination as the Republican candidate goes to show how hollow <i>both parties</i> were already. The void of competent and appealing politicians - that represent <i>anyone</i> - was begging for someone like him to enter the scene.<p>And that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s funny to watch all the horrified &quot;decent&quot; politics nerds of the establishment try to find the perfect insult or scandal that would destroy him - they don&#x27;t get why he was elected. He was elected as an insult to Washington. Trying to insult or pick apart <i>the insult</i> is useless.')
