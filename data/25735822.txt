I do not watch CNN or fox news, or get my &quot;news&quot; from twitter. For the last 5 years, I&#x27;ve mostly kept in touch with reality through youtube. There were tons of independent journalists that I followed. Some that were covering the election had paid subscriptions to pollster data and software. They could drill down into county level and precinct level data and it was shocking to see vote totals that exceeded the population of the entire precinct! You could go back historically and see every election 2016,2012, etc and see the turnout rates were always 50-70%. It was these precincts that flipped the entire state from red to blue. I thought surely this would be going into audit and court territory and did not bother to save the data or videos as I figured &quot;all would come into the light&quot;.<p>Then youtube banned all these channels. They were not even republican! They were banned for comparing voter turn out numbers with data they paid money to access! Fast forward to this last week. I&#x27;m watching another youtube journalist interviewing people at the Jan 6th protest. She was mostly talking with older people, asking what made them show up, etc. There was music, food, and people just generally hanging out. I go back to work for the rest of the day and ignored the news cycle only to get a notification of her posting another video later in the evening about how she just found out about the siege on the capitol. She was there and knew nothing about until getting back to the hotel! And then the entire left wing media labels the event as terrorists and white supremacists. Her next video the next day was about her now being on a no fly list and couldn&#x27;t get on a plane. Now her entire channel is deleted and I have no idea what happened to her! All this for interviewing grandmas at a protest!<p>My entire way of getting news for the last 5 years is now non-existent. And you tell me that I am supposed to &quot;reflect&quot; on this? That somehow because I don&#x27;t drink everything that CNN makes up means I need to be removed from society? That I should only get my news from one &quot;official&quot; source?<p>I try to engage with people on the left, and it&#x27;s always &quot;show me the proof!&quot;. I had great proof, and numbers, but the left removed it all and now I have nothing and am told the BLM protests were so much more honorable than the capitol protest when all of the videos on youtube of people organizing through facebook and telegram groups with slogans of &quot;good cops are dead cops&quot; are now also deleted and people act like the protests never happened. We do not have a state run media in america, but it is clear that we have a media run state and every one on the left is the very definition of &#x27;Koristne Budale&#x27;. All the way to the point of voting for a man who the KKK applauded in the 60&#x27;s for his pro segregation policies. Now he is somehow the face of &quot;anti racism&quot; and &quot;defund the police&quot; when in the 90&#x27;s he pushed for the death penalty for repeat drug offenders.<p>Why don&#x27;t you try a thought process? How would you feel if it was herds of trump supporters marching through cities lighting everything on fire for 6 months while everyone talked about how peaceful they where? So you think, &quot;We&#x27;ll show them come Nov 4th&quot;. And on Nov 4th, Biden takes an immediate lead only to loose in the middle of the night because Trump&#x27;s &quot;mail in ballots just arrived&quot; and there&#x27;s no need to check signatures. And then it bounces around the courts for nearly two months, none of them speaking on the matter at hand, but instead claiming that somehow it is not the court&#x27;s problem to solve. So you attend a protest at the capitol only to be labeled as a terrorist because some really fringe people were all the media focused on. You&#x27;d be absolutely loosing your mind. If you think it feels bad being on the left, trying being on the right!<p>Oh and Trump is not my leader. It took him two weeks before he started talking about the numbers I had on the 5th. He in many cases this year has been late to the game. Our only hope is extreme voter reform, but the democrats love a loose ballot. They do not orchestrate fraud, they only make sure the pool stays too muddy to clean.<p>We are about to have 80 million americans that will never see Biden or the DNC as legit. It will be like fighting over Jefferson Davis all over again.<p>I hope you reflect deeply. I&#x27;ve been an agnostic, a leftist, a libertarian. Telling me to get enlightened and go back ain&#x27;t happening.')
