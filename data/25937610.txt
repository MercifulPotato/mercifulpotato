(or something very similar to that)<p>It&#x27;s a big enough problem on its own. Tacking &quot;p2p&quot; on as well makes it a different thing, which is not what Signal are doing.<p>I want my Signal messages to arrive at my friends Signal clients, even if that&#x27;s later after they&#x27;ve recharged their dead phone. I don&#x27;t want my Signal messages to vanish if I (or a friend) is on a WiFi network where p2p is blocked. There&#x27;s a serious need for a centralised server for Signals goals to be achieved, so they have one. The fundamental design then means the added benefit of _also_ implementing p2p where possible is small, while the effort&#x2F;cost is high. Of course that didn&#x27;t build that.')
