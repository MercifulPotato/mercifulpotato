The underlying mechanism is more &quot;Infrastructure as Configuration&quot;. Terraform syntax is called HCL &quot;HashiCorp Configuration Language&quot;. The &quot;code&quot; aspect of (consuming) Terraform is oriented around providing dynamic configuration capabilities utilising reusable code Modules. As GraphQL has led people to question the applicability of REST type API&#x27;s in SPA contexts, so I believe IaC will eventually suggest a transition towards single Cloud API endpoints where the entire required state is described; reducing IaC to configuration. Currently the programming or Code aspect is required as a function of API design and the corresponding wiring of components together. Potentially not necessary and not particularly helpful.')
