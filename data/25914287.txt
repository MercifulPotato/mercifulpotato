Sorry, what? There is no value of actually securing systems here? It is frustrating to know that in real life, some developers are not really concerned about the security of their dev machines.<p>Try to install Android Studio (make sure to initialise it!) or Eclipse on your system and tell me where it put its executables. Go and indulge in the horror that your local adb binary can be replaced <i>silently</i> without your knowledge. When most mobile operating systems are designed to isolate components together, we <i>collectively</i> are hindering effective security by allowing these low-hanging fruit on our systems.<p>Sorry but often I just see countless developers that are not that concerned about security and then ask themselves why are users irresponsible about security.')
