(assuming you don&#x27;t have something weird like several microservices manipulating the same data sources directly), so architecturally it&#x27;s easier to understand code&#x2F;data flows than the same monolith system that hasn&#x27;t properly enforced modularity.<p>The main problem is most folks rushing head first into the silver bullet don&#x27;t understand is things have trade off, and in microservice land it&#x27;s versioning, testing, deploying, and monitoring.<p>Nowadays, though the tooling is pretty good, and if you put your microservices in a monorepo (seems backwards, I know) you can avoid the versioning, testing and deployment difficulties, and use GKE + istio and you&#x27;ve got tooling to help handle the ops problems, so actually, maybe enforcing code quality is actually the harder problem, and limiting the size and scope does sorta make sense.')
