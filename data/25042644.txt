What prevents students from colluding over their tablets&#x2F;mobiles&#x2F;laptops while taking the exam from another device? Can&#x27;t the student mirror the screen elsewhere, leading to interesting possibilities for cheating?<p>Proctoring is not a solution that I am comfortable with. I do not want to peer into the private lives of students and their home environments. Not every student is well-off, and has a private space all to their own for 3 hours.<p>I think taking tests from home does not really work with any of the models I have seen discussed this year. Cheating is real. It has nothing to do with rote learning. I am out of ideas which are foolproof.')
