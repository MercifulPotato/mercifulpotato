At that time an ALU was a very large part of a processor design and the idea was that Lisp didn&#x27;t need it and not having one would allow the project to fit (barely) in the limited area allocated to each student.<p>You can define numbers from scratch in Lisp by using lists and having their length (for example) represent the number&#x27;s magnitude.<p>If we define the empty list as ZERO, and the successor of a number N as (CONS &#x27;S N) we can build a whole math library from there:<p><pre><code>    (DEFINE ADD &#x27;(LAMBDA (A B)\n        (COND\n          ((NIL? A) B)\n          ((NIL? B) A)\n          (T (ADD (CONS &#x27;S A) (CDR B)))\n        )))</code></pre>')
