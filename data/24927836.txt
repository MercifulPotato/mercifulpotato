He&#x27;s doing it for fun and stay up late at night reading text books. I&#x27;m gonna probably grow up to be like that too.<p>I think the main reason for our love of learning is &quot;good&quot; boredom. When I&#x27;m bored and have nothing fun easily accessible, then learning something is very attractive. My hypothesis is that learning motivation is a function of boredom, entertainment accessibility, and stress. More boredom, more likely to learn. More entertainment available, less likely to learn. More stressed, less likely to learn.<p>This applies for both young and old people. Older people just tend to have more things to entertain them in life and&#x2F;or more stressed.')
