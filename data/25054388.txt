I seem to recall that they have fixed it in newer models, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it still persists.<p>I hate to admit it since I&#x27;ve drunk the mechanical keyboard koolaid, but I like the mbp flat keyboard. I easily prefer it to the 2015 keyboard, which imo is really nothing special (at least it doesn&#x27;t gunk up). I hear people say great things about the thinkpad keyboard, but from my little experience with it, I&#x27;d still rank the mbp flat keyboard higher.')
