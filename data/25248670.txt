The average person will never carry a dedicated camera again and the average company won&#x27;t be satisfied with something apple would produce so the only market they could sell to is youtubers which are probably fairly satisfied with what they have now.<p>I have a sony camera and I find the UI and physical interface to be pretty good. What its lacking for me is some of the more advanced features like video stabilization (on their lower models) 4k 60 (also on their &gt;$2000 models) and long exposure photos with shake reduction so you can take it from your hands.')
