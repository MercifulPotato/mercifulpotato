My son struggled with his motor skills when he was little so we got him interested in gymnastics and he loves it and it&#x27;s really helped. I&#x27;d like to do the same for my daughter when she&#x27;s old enough but I&#x27;d hope she doesn&#x27;t want go into competition. She also likes dance so that might be a better option.')
