I worked at a company that similarly had three projects that were &quot;competing&quot; with each other, unofficially. It was more like three different teams working on a spellchecker, all with different upper engineering management VPs or directors vying for more influence in the organization. Many other teams standing by were not choosing what project to integrate with because we didn&#x27;t know which would be completed first (or if they made a choice, it was because VP &#x2F; director told them they had to).<p>In any case, it seemed silly, and worse, it revealed a lack of vision or leadership in upper management to just choose one of these projects instead of having multiple people working on the same thing, which would inevitably lead to two projects being canned and some number of engineers feeling demoralized and quitting.')
