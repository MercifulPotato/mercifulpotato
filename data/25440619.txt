I&#x27;ve worked on two big AAA releases in the last 6 years and my total overtime was statistically zero, I did some extra hours in the last 2 weeks leading to release, but that was mostly to watch over the server infrastructure to make sure the launch went smoothly.<p>We&#x27;ve had people join from Rockstar, EA, CDPR, and one thing everyone is always surprised by is how good the work&#x2F;life balance is. I&#x27;m personally in around 8am and always done by 4pm(7.5 hours a day).<p>[0] - now, all Ubisoft studios set their own policies. Please don&#x27;t extrapolate my experience in the UK to experiences in other Ubisoft studios in other countries.')
