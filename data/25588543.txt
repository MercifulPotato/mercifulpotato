With those they could do even more specialized accelerated tasks.<p>On a wild imaginary train of thought; I&#x27;m not sure how well a FPGA can be integrated into an existing CPU but it could maybe be possible to define new instructions using them. That way Apple can make the chips forward-compatible with new instruction set extensions. Or if Apple finds a serious security problem with one of the existing instructions (in the unmodifiable silicon) they can make Rosetta transpile all untrusted programs to use a fixed FPGA&#x27;d replacement for those instructions.')
