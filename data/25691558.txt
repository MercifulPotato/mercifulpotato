No one company wants to take the first hit of educating users and the incompatibility with other systems.<p>It might complex processes like the engineers asked to implement it think users give a shit about mailing lists (maybe they did in 2004 when Gates told Davos he&#x27;d kill spam). Maybe marketing drones on about big business in all the meetings, crushing a good idea. Or maybe Microsoft went for micro payments over PoW, not realising micro payments was in itself an impossible dream.<p>Ask Bill next AMA on Reddit.')
