I&#x27;ve pentested huge clearing systems before. But I&#x27;m not going to lie and say I understood what the hell they were doing (also, the people at those firms made fun of clearing as the most boring conceivable stuff to look at).<p>But (1) lots of experts keep saying that Robinhood can&#x27;t use customer cash as collateral to DTCC, and (2) DTCC&#x27;s published rules seem to say that Robinhood owes collateral margin or not.<p>So like, I&#x27;m willing to bet that the margin stuff is a red herring, but I&#x27;m not willing to WSB-bet it.')
