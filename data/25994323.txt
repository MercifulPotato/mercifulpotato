The last one involved a guy who had a seizure at the wheel and barrelled through a red light in a truck. There wasn&#x27;t any way to avoid it, fortunately it was a light swipe though.<p>My most expensive repair was in a parking lot where someone scraped and dented the entire side of my car trying to get into a space they really should not have. I&#x27;m under the impression most damage to cars happens in parking lots or street parking.<p>Still, as I wrote above, I still agree that insurance for the car isn&#x27;t worth it, even though at some points it would have had positive value for me. In the long run it statistically won&#x27;t.')
