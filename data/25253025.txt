Since PHP 5.4 (released in 2011) everyone should just use PHP in FPM mode instead. The fact that mod_php only supported preforking caused a lot of spite and angst against PHP the language, which was understandable but perhaps a bit misguided.<p>None of this has anything to do with Apache, of course. No web server should have any trouble serving static pages at any speed and you could do much worse than Apache.')
