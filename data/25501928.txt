When people talk about the size of &quot;the universe&quot;, they talk about the part whose light has reached us, the <i>visible</i> universe. What&#x27;s beyond is pure speculation. Also, due to the expansion of space, large parts of even the visible universe are inaccessible to us. Even if you started today at 99% light speed, you wouldn&#x27;t ever reach them.')
