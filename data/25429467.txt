Habitat loss from slash-and-burn agriculture is a huge problem for lemur populations, but from a conservation point it&#x27;s not effective to visit Madagascar and tell people not to do it. To the Malagasy you&#x27;re just a rich tourist telling them off for living without offering any help.<p>So instead they focus on education. Two of the initiatives they mentioned were teaching people more effective methods of cultivating food (such as setting up fisheries), and providing them with plans for more efficient wood-burning stoves.')
