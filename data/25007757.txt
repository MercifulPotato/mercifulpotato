Item(by='smoyer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604672628, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25007478, text='We&#x27;ve seen so many cases where research is actually invalidated because the researcher made a hypothesis after collecting their data (most often discarding the hypothesis they had before collecting their data).  This process occurs with enough frequency that it&#x27;s even earned the moniker &quot;p-hacking&quot;.<p>So I&#x27;d propose the opposite - and this is in line with people who are way smarter than I am - publish your hypothesis before you start your study.  I&#x27;d recommend the &quot;Everything Hertz&quot; podcast for a lot of cogent discussion around both study quality and open access.<p>As an aside, I think that we should be rewarding those who publish the results of their &quot;broken&quot; research.  There is value in knowing a negative result - something we use frequently in engineering (one reason we prototype everything before sending it off to production).  Right now, there&#x27;s almost an institutional shame in reporting &quot;no results&quot;.  In theory, there should be a bunch of really short papers &quot;no results&quot; published for every break-through study.')
