It should be avoided in general for safety and portability. Support for NUL must not be assumed.<p>I believe it&#x27;s easier to force awkward languages to support nul character than deal with the chaos of not knowing if it&#x27;s supported or not. They&#x27;re are other places where they say &quot;this is hard, we&#x27;ll let implementations to not support it&quot; and it&#x27;s a ticking time bomb.<p>Also it doesn&#x27;t look like you can deduplicate map keys:<p>&gt; A reference must not be used as a map key.<p>Which means as much repetition and space waste as in json.')
