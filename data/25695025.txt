(during which time AMD will be leapfrogging to newer fab processes as they become available)<p>We&#x27;re already starting to see OEM&#x27;s use AMD cpu&#x27;s like we haven&#x27;t in nearly 2 decades. The server and datacenter markets are coming around to AMD and it&#x27;s Threadrippers as well. Eventually Intel&#x27;s sweetheart OEM deals will expire, and who knows if they&#x27;ll be renegotiated or ditched completely? That will be exceptionally painful for Intel... as those OEM deals are largely what Intel has been coasting on for all this time.<p>I just don&#x27;t see an option for Intel, unless they want to gamble their competitiveness possibly permanently. They&#x27;re not quite in dire straights like AMD was when it spun off Global Foundries... but the outlook is much the same.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s the type of one-move-ahead thinking I expect investors will love right up until AMD and Intel give up all their margins bidding against each other for the kingmaking process.<p>Seems like a major win for consumers. There&#x27;s no reason to have a $10,000 consumer CPU today, with the exception of lack of competition in both price and performance.')
