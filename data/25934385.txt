We have to ask what the engineering specs were.  $10k for an ISS toilet seat might be reasonable.  And that $10k might be buying something else they don&#x27;t want on the budget, which is near enough to graft as makes no difference.<p>But paying $1mil for many toilet seats probably isn&#x27;t graft if you run 10,000 profitable paid toilets.<p>Until someone can successfully decomission a fleet of oil rigs for way less than $24bil, we don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a good price or not, but especially if it&#x27;s a small fraction of the overall lifetime value of the oil produced, it might not be a big deal.')
