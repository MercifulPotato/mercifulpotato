E.g. developing nations with dollar denominated debts. Central bankers will tell you they can’t go bankrupt but of course they have to say this as the whole system is based upon confidence and trust.<p>Indeed, there have been certain periods of time where privately issued money &#x2F; bank deposits were “safer” than central bank or government issued currency. Also keep in mind that bank deposits are not a promise to pay base money as people mistakenly believe. It’s just that commercial banks are a market maker between their money and the government&#x2F;base money and it just so happens that the exchange rate is 1:1 unless the solvency of the bank, central bank or government is brought into question.\n Commercial banks also don’t “invest money”. Instead, they are in the business of swapping IOUs. When you get a loan, you swap your IOU (a debt from you to the bank - the bank’s asset) for the bank’s IOU (debt from the bank to you - bank’s liability). You do this because the bank IOU is readily accepted by everyone and yours isn’t. If you just have a deposit, you get it by swapping the IOU from another bank or an IOU from the government (notes and coins) for an IOU with the bank you hold a deposit with. Note that the deposit is not your money either.')
