Everyone obeyed it. It was strongly enforced [1, 2]. They beat coronavirus. And now they can enjoy their summer.<p>I live in London. At one point in the summer, our covid rates were lower than Melbourne&#x27;s. But the UK&#x27;s messaging was confused and contradictory (&quot;eat out to help out&quot;, test and trace was shambolic, rules were not enforced). So no one is the least surprised that it has got out of control again so quickly.<p>[1] My parents live half an hour&#x27;s drive from Melbourne. Police stopped every car on the highways to enforce no travel, fined the drivers and made them turn back home.<p>[2] One party of 26 people got busted ordering KFC to the same address and fined $26,000.')
