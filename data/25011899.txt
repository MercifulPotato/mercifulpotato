Every time the school gets a new Master Archivist they come in with bright and ambitious ideas about how the catalogue should be organized and abandon their predecessor&#x27;s scheme, with the result that centuries later there are dozens of overlapping and even explicitly competing systems extant in the library and many books are basically impossible to find. This, too, reminds me of basically every large codebase I&#x27;ve ever seen.')
