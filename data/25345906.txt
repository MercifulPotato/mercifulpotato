Currently he&#x27;s geeking out on animal facts.<p>What I&#x27;ve done as a bit of a middle ground is to use ublock to strip away the recommendation sections and comments. He can still search and watch whichever videos, and even look at all the videos on a particular channel, but at least he&#x27;s not getting sucked down a rabbit hole. I&#x27;ve had the conversation with him that its not that I don&#x27;t trust him rather I know how distracting those things can be and have found them detrimental even to my own attention&#x2F;life.<p>Of course he&#x27;ll probably go around them eventually as he learns how things work and finds some motivation to do so, but in the meantime he gets a cleaner experience of the internet.<p>FWIW these are the rules. They might be breaking something, but they&#x27;re working alright for now.<p><pre><code>    www.youtube.com###related\n    www.youtube.com##.ytd-comments\n    www.youtube.com###content &gt; .ytd-rich-item-renderer.style-scope</code></pre>')
