SQL Azure might be a good pricing model for your system but if it makes sense for everything else to be in AWS (features, cost whatever) then I am more likely to spend more on AWS RDS or whatever. Might cost Â£1000s more but I cannot simply split my load across two providers, that is two points of failure.<p>2) The level of support you get from OVH is nowhere near as good as AWS, which is to be expected when comparing a &quot;budget&quot; provider with the &quot;gold standard&quot;. OVH can rent stuff to you cheaper because their support team is presumably much smaller.<p>3) Even the UI for OVH gives me the heebie jeebies. I use them for personal stuff because they are cheap but the UI is far too slow to use for fast work. I see notifications that I have previously cleared and I get random emails occasionally about things I don&#x27;t quite understand. I can live with that for cheaper personal sites but if I was using that every day, I would quit!<p>Of course, for many people, there are issues with marketing (I haven&#x27;t of some of the other providers) and the basic, and probably fair, assumption that with AWS you know the sort of quality you expect - a bit like buying Toyota. The time and risk involved in evaluating other providers is not worth it in many cases, especially when you only learn 6 months later that OVH don&#x27;t have a configurable load-balancer or they don&#x27;t have proper zone redundancy or you cannot upgrade certain hardware without literally copying your files into storage and trying to copy them back to a larger machine.')
