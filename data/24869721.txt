And it wasn&#x27;t always that way, and it didn&#x27;t because of the jungle primary change (Schwarzenegger was an exception to it, but not because he was before the jungle primary, but because he came through a route entirely outside of the party system, despite being a party member; the effect had already set in, though it wasn&#x27;t yet as deep as it is now.)<p>&gt; That type of dismissiveness of an entire party is exactly the issue.<p>You are confusing cause and effect.')
