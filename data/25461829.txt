Some of the other comments mention using it for ETL jobs.  The webpage makes it sound like a generic job scheduler.<p>Jenkins is also a generic job scheduler, but it is primarily used for CI&#x2F;CD.  It seems like there&#x27;s some overlap here though; I&#x27;m interested to hear other peoples thoughts on &quot;I have a bunch of jobs that need to be run; they aren&#x27;t necessarily ETL or CI&#x2F;CD; what tool is good for this, and how would I differentiate between them.&quot;<p>It seems that mostly people use whatever they have setup, so if someone already does CI&#x2F;CD through jenkins, they will add other unrelated jobs to jenkins just to avoid setting something else up.  Any thoughts on if things are being left on the table here, as even generic tools can make you feel like you are &quot;swimming up stream&quot; if you are doing things that the rest of the community is not with them.')
