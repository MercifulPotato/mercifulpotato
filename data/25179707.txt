There were a bunch of other projects (like Mithril.js, Elm and Swelte, amongst others) where I&#x27;m not sure if they already were around &#x2F; popular enough for us to know them, and (perhaps understandably) an existing, healthy ecosystem and some popularity &amp; traction for other people to be able to use &amp; extend what would eventually become Matestack were other contributing factors, and I think Vue.js continues to shine here.<p>Since we&#x27;re getting a lot of requests on being able to use React (and now Stimulus) with the same DSL this is definitely on the roadmap, not sure on how it&#x27;s going to get prioritized though. Perhaps best if you reach out to Jonas (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;JonasJabari" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;JonasJabari</a>), he&#x27;s a lovely guy!')
