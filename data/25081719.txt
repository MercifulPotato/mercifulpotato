I&#x27;ve never heard people complaining that some shampoo free sample is no longer free or that some discounted item is no longer discounted.<p>Second, another mistake people make is personification of companies. Company is not a human being, it cannot be honest, nice, make promises, etc. Company is a business entity, it just have contract with the users (officially signed or some TOS, like Google has that people agree with). Companies typically reserves the right to change terms of such contracts and it just happened.<p>Some companies might have good PR and make PR driven promises - if someone believes that, it is only that person problem.<p>If someone really thinks that companies support gay community because they &quot;like&quot; gay people, they are wrong. They support gay people only in countries where gay people are accepted and such PR move will bring them popularity (putting six colors rainbow as a company logo background costs companies $0, and they get good, cheap PR in return).<p>If companies really wanted to support gay people they would do all those &quot;gay pride&quot; stuff in countries where gays are sent to jail, but, as one can easily check, they carefully omit those places.')
