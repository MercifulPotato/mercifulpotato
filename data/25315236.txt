There&#x27;s a difference between running a private, not for profit, Mastadon node where anyone who signs up presumably knows what the forum is about versus Twitter who pitched their company to investors as merely a platform for people to tweet.<p>Nobody is upset with Twitter moderating content that violates existing Federal Law, but they were never meant to be a moderating like a Mastadon node on the private side or even like a sub reddit on the public side. Again, looking at Reddit, most don&#x27;t have an issue with moderated content on the sub reddit, the issue is when Reddit removes entire sub reddits because THEY don&#x27;t agree with the content.<p>BTW, I think Justice Thomas&#x27; recent remarks have made Twitter and Facebook take note because he hinted that the misrepresentation to investors was the attack vector, not the 1st Amendment.')
