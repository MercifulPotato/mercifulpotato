Higher leverage is beneficial if you prefer not to use all available funds for trading and deposit them to your trading account. For example, lets say you are trading with 100 000 account and your risk is based on that amount. You deposit only 10000 to your trading account and take advantage of the leverage while keeping the other 90k safely in your bank account instead of having all of it on your brokers account.<p>The brokers market has evolved in recent years as well and has become much more solid than what it used to be. Thankfully, a lot of solid brokerage firms have entered the market by now.<p>Forexbook will also try to provide some transparency around forex. To start, there&#x27;s ability to share your trades. As there is no manual trade entry on the app, all trades are as is. For example, the trade example shown on the frontpage can be seen here with greater detail (what broker and if it was Live or Demo account) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forexbook.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;trades&#x2F;2da6ed44-d1fd-4028-a8a0-3203f42b2336" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forexbook.com&#x2F;s&#x2F;trades&#x2F;2da6ed44-d1fd-4028-a8a0-3203f...</a>\nPS! Sharing feature is manual and only you decide which trades to make public.<p>Disclaimer: Maker @ forexbook.com')
