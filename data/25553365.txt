The proportions and maybe even the connector are reminiscent of a Compaq iPaq.<p>On initial start up, the start menu and desktop can be invoked before the Glucometer application starts up. I always hope that maybe Solitaire or some other mundane application didnâ€™t get cleared out by the OEM when the firmware was created.')
