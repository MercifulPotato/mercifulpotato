I initially tried ranitidine but famotidine(safe at low doses and no longer than 21 days at a time for me) was better. I tried explaining to my doctor who kept brushing me off. Eventually I quit telling her and sorted it out myself.<p>Worked fine for me. Having said that.. I am female. Frequent and very high doses of famotidine can cause ED for some. Cimetidine has the highest risk and ranitidine the lowest.<p>ETA for OTC ref in the US:<p>cimetidine aka tagamet, ranitidine aka zantac, famotidine aka Pepcid<p><i>This is not medical advice</i>')
