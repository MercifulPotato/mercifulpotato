Otherwise, it is slavery, and it is indeed feasible to argue against any slavery. The animals in the farm get nothing in return, don&#x27;t have a choice. It is hard to argue their life is better than no life at all.<p>No matter how philosophical you get, it is possible to be vegan, you only have to sacrifice some pleasure. If you value your pleasure over the miserable life of the animal, that certainly is something one can criticise without being inconsistent because &quot;humans also need to work to buy food&quot;.<p>If you actually want to argue for better workers&#x27; rights and redistribution from the rich to the poor, to end the missery of the working man: I think that is a good point :)')
