We would modify &amp; shuffle around the pieces of the page.<p>React&#x27;s components were there to let you re-render the app quickly. When state changed, a new render happened, with new elements emitted. You didn&#x27;t think of what elements used to be there.<p>React was about the virtual dom. It was about creating an abstraction to let us not have to regard what was on the page, when we were deciding what is on the page. Incidentally, imo, that involved components, but components, while comprising numerous html elements, serve a very similar function to html elements (especially to web components), and were not, imo, a particularly novel part of React. Yes, there was a lot to their creation &amp; implementation, there was a lot of tech work that went into making Components a thing. But components, to me, are far outshadowed by the vdom, by the performance &amp; speed of a data-system designed to go diff &amp; en-act desired state into the live DOM tree.<p>In kubernetes world, we&#x27;d call the vdom a controller. It reads the canonical state, the component tree, and insures the target DOM machinery is kept up to date &amp; reflects this desired state.')
