My comment was mostly made in the context of running macos desktop apps in docker. Windows would be largely the same, though the existence of WSL might make some things easier.<p>Linux desktop apps running in docker would work better because there&#x27;s no VM in between the native environment and the application. You&#x27;d still need to forward GUI calls across the LXD container boundary. That used to be easy with X11 forwarding, but AFAIK wayland removed that feature. I don&#x27;t know enough to guess how difficult that would be to implement.<p>But, if you solved that it should be mostly smooth sailing. Linux desktop apps distributed via docker would just be the same apps, but unnecessarily bigger, with probably less access to the filesystem. They would be harder to patch for security errata. And they would leave extra junk in your docker images cache. Docker&#x27;s sandboxing would be nice though.')
