I don&#x27;t need to &quot;give it a go&quot; to learn what it&#x27;s like.<p>1. First, the infra to automatically deploy again introduces complexity. And waiting for the Docker push to complete and then until the new container is started takes away from my time.<p>2. Yes, it is a pain.<p>3. I do what&#x27;s necessary to fix problems. Sometimes that means looking at production. I use PyCharm not vs code and because I don&#x27;t find value in Docker for my projects have no incentive to look into how to set up local debugging.<p>4. &quot;Prune weekly&quot; you say. But it&#x27;s just another complication I have to deal with when using Docker. What for?<p>&gt; The value is the simplicity of deployment<p>I would argue my deployments are simpler than yours. Give me git and ssh and I&#x27;m good to go. No need for Docker, pushing to some registry, looking at a dashboard or waiting for the image to be deployed. And my setup is much easier to debug.<p>But it sounds to me like you are coming from a more enterprise-y environment. There, the things you say probably make sense. In my case, I&#x27;m a sole developer. Any unnecessary process or tool slows me down and incurs a risk of bugs due to added complexity.<p>&gt; Need to host a well-known software?<p>I don&#x27;t have this need.')
