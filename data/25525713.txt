Item(by='jacobolus', descendants=None, kids=[25525721], score=None, time=1608795101, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25525697, text='Well... livability for who then?<p>For someone who wants to have a large home workshop to build boats in, built on cheap land, yeah, it&#x27;s not a great place. For someone who wants to live on a farm and grow all their own food, not so great. For a childless couple who needs a 5 bedroom house and professionally landscape-architected decorative garden to show their coworkers they have made it (I know several such people in the South Bay), not great. For a family of 7 who want each kid to have their own room, not so great.<p>However it is great for anyone who doesn&#x27;t like making every trip by car, or who wants to live somewhere where there are constantly new things to do.<p>&gt; <i>Is it really the city to start or raise a family in?</i><p>I have a 1.5 year old and a 4 year old, have been living in SF for about 8 years and intend to stay indefinitely. So for me, yes.<p>But many middle class families have different criteria. e.g. there are many families who move out of SF because they feel they have run out of space in a small rent-controlled apartment and can&#x27;t afford a bigger one; or they need childcare help from family who live elsewhere; or they don&#x27;t want to send their children to public schools alongside working class children (&#x27;the average test scores are too low&#x27;), but can&#x27;t afford expensive private schools. Etc.<p>In my personal opinion, for anyone under the age of 20 it is a much more fun place than almost anywhere in the USA, with a much wider variety of resources available. Suburbia sucks for young people (speaking from personal experience after growing up in a &quot;nice&quot; suburb). YMMV.')
