For example, how do you design a system that can automatically call for help in the event of an accident without giving that system access to the sensors that also trigger airbag deployment and similar safety features? How do you build &quot;self-driving&quot; automation (or even less ambitious driver aids that are already in widespread use) without relying on sensors observing the environment around the vehicle, which may be subject to interference or deliberate deception?')
