The biggest reason I’d give is consistency and ease of adoption, which might be coming down to “do you spend much time on-boarding new developers?” or “are you supporting an open source community where this causes friction?”. If you aren’t spending much time on it, perhaps try it on new projects to see what people think in a low-friction situation - in my experience that’s basically been “I like spending less time on tool support”.')
