Ex: Fn(SystemParam), Fn(SystemParam, SystemParam), etc.<p>The .system() method uses the SystemParam type information to determine what resources are being accessed, which gets converted to logic that can pass the resource data in. It also uses the extracted type information to inform the system executor how to safely run each system in parallel.')
