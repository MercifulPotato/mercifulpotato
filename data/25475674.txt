Item(by='redis_mlc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608361004, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25475619, text='&gt; Problems are easy to see in retrospect.<p>Excuse me, that&#x27;s nonsense in the case of the 737 MAX.<p>MCAS problems were known in advance by Boeing factory pilots. They sent each other sms messages about it, for which one Boeing manager was fired.<p>The certification paperwork filed with the FAA misrepresented the MCAS behavior, under-reporting the rate and number of pitch downs.<p>MCAS was designed to rely on a single AoA sensor, which was external and subject to damage from jetways, birds and weather.<p>And the software was outsourced to a low bidder paying programmers $15&#x2F;hour. We&#x27;ll see how that works for safety-critical aerospace software.<p>But the most sinister thing is that this all resulted from a contractual item - that Boeing would have to pay Southwest $1 million per plane that required re-training. So any concerns about safety were side-stepped to meet that perverse incentive.')
