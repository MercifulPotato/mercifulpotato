But in general, yeah, &quot;security&quot; wasn&#x27;t actually a thing on planes then. There was no security checkpoint at all to get to a gate before the 70s; you didn&#x27;t need a ticket or to show ID to go through the security checkpoint that did exist before 2001. It&#x27;s easy to forget or not realize how much thing have changed.<p>Or, it&#x27;s just one of those rumors that people like to adopt and claim as a story that happened to htem, when really they heard it from someone else that claimed it happened to them, etc. That also happens.')
