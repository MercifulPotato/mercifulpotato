Is it worth it?<p>I use mutt with gmail account (and with everything else, although primarily I use my self-hosted email server). Works fine with gmail.<p>&gt; But gave it up for Gmail web interface.<p>The web interface is so inferior, I can&#x27;t imagine using it by choice (I&#x27;m forced by $EMPLOYER to use the gmail web interface, so I suffer through that pain daily).<p>Anywhere that I have a choice, I use mutt.')
