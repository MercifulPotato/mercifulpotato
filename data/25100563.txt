But even if we aren&#x27;t - the onus is upon us to make this clear to the users. It is perfectly reasonable for a user to assume developers will accept bug reports (which is not the same as assuming the bugs will get fixed promptly).<p>Also, as a FOSS developer - I believe the author is underestimating the significance of accepting bug reports from the public. This has saved me some embarrassment in the past and even got me some collaborators which I would otherwise not have had.')
