We do have a roadmap that is documented. We do decide what is next, and maybe lay out a month or two of a swag at what we&#x27;ll get done, but mostly we just keep moving forward, delivering at a reasonable and sustainable speed.<p>Sure, leadership gets their own idea of what schedule we&#x27;ll hit. And we often do meet their expectations. When it isn&#x27;t correct, we tell them what stopped us from hitting it. But we do not approach such things as a &quot;delay&quot; - it is just how software dev works.')
