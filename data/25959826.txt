The link you provided seems to prove that?<p>&gt; When you sign up for a new account, youâ€™ll automatically start with a Robinhood Instant account, which is a margin account.<p>&gt; 2. Yesterday, all Cash accounts were disabled from trading GME<p>Yes, but I didn&#x27;t say that this was because they were &quot;margin&quot;. I said that this appears to be because Robinhood, as the broker, still requires additional cash on hand to cover these positions until they settle. This is a different thing than the margin issue.<p>&gt; 3. Trading with a margin accounts and trading on margin is different.<p>Yes you&#x27;re right. But a new user that just signed up may be thinking they are using a cash account, but it&#x27;s actually a margin account. It also appears that you have to <i>manually</i> downgrade from an &quot;Instant&quot; (margin) account, to a &quot;Cash&quot; account[0], and I highly suspect that most people didn&#x27;t do that, and thus are still using a margin account.<p>[0] (yes, it is really bad that this link is broken at the moment) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;robinhood.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;support&#x2F;articles&#x2F;downgrading-from-gold&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;robinhood.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;support&#x2F;articles&#x2F;downgrading-fro...</a>')
