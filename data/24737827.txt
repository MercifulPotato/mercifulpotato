If anything, while programming for microcontrollers I learned C is too remote from hardware and leaves too much implementation-defined. Struct padding? Implementation-defined. Bit field implementation? So implementation-defined you&#x27;ll have to roll your own with shifts and masks. Accessing anything mapped to memory address? The pointers as defined in C standard aren&#x27;t what you think, but fortunately the implementation often is. Even standard variable sizes are only 21 years old, which means that there is still legacy code that either doesn&#x27;t use them or wraps them in layers of typedefs to work with toolchains or libraries that don&#x27;t. And good luck if you have 24-bit registers.<p>Of course it&#x27;s frustratingly low level at the same time. I don&#x27;t know what could be a good choice, and C is what everyone already uses anyway.')
