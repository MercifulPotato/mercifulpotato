DNA replication relies only on particular structures and enzimes to transform these. There is no notion of time whatsoever. Only availability of structural elements, and concentration. Everything is decoupled and feedback loops based.<p>And sequences of actions are maintained by pipelining of physical molecular structures - each enzime recognizes it&#x27;s own unique patterns. That is it.<p>In old times this was called principle-guided science.<p>Understanding of principles spares one from knowing all the details.')
