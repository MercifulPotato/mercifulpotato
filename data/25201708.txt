But I&#x27;ve been keeping an eye on Rust because I like the language expressiveness, the safety provided by the stronger type system, the smoother integration with C calling conventions, the generics, the error handling. But I&#x27;m hesitant to switch to it because it feels like the learning curve is steeper in Rust than Go, and that&#x27;s important for my team where we want to be able to onboard new engineers quickly. What&#x27;s your experience in that regard?')
