Still, don&#x27;t froget the working hours you put in there :) plus the fact that usually technicians get their materials for cheaper than you do (also because in my case it&#x27;s only 6% VAT instead of 21%). I did many such calculations when renovating and for some things it was actually cheaper to get a technician.')
