Item(by='t-writescode', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610947992, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25818470, text='&gt; Are there good features to help lower the distraction level?<p>Disable all notifications on it and it quickly evolves into a regular watch on your wrist.<p>&gt; Do you find it useful (and worth the price) for the passive health tracking stuff?<p>It&#x27;s a nice companion to an Apple device in the Apple ecosystem; and, if you&#x27;re someone that&#x27;s not into Fitbit for whatever reason, I&#x27;ve found it fine.<p>I also own the least expensive Apple Watch 6, as I was using it as a test device to see if I&#x27;d be interested in staying in the ecosystem. I don&#x27;t see a reason to leave it.<p>I&#x27;ve also bought one for my mother - who immediately disabled all notifications, too, for herself; and, she quite likes it so far. I asked her to turn on fall notification and we&#x27;re friends on Apple Fitness Sharing or whatever it&#x27;s called.<p>I think it&#x27;s fine and it serves my needs. I would need to look at the market again for another device that has over a day of battery life (always-on screen off, no notifications), an O2 sensor, heartrate sensor, doesn&#x27;t fight with my PiHole or VPN (Fitbit did not like me being on a VPN) and other features if I&#x27;m in the mood for them.<p>I use Apple Pay all the time, so it&#x27;s nice there, as well.<p>I mean, I&#x27;m happy?')
