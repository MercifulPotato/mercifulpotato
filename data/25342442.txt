Personally, I believe it&#x27;s dangerous to conflate the two -- modern police departments are very, very different than the more community organized (or elected) folks who watched over small towns. Organized, uniformed, powerfully armed standing patrol police forces like we have today are a relatively new phenomena.<p>That said, we&#x27;re skidding towards a semantic argument, so if you are comfortable agreeing to disagree here, I am too.
