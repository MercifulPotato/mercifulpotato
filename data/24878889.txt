If you need photo storage you should be able to walk into any store and buy something the size of an external hard drive that you can just plug into your router and it just works. Same thing for email, private messaging, social networking, calendars, whatever. Most people don’t use enough data on these things to make it a problem. The biggest challenge would be security but you should be able to buy an off the shelf firewall and have some form of automatic updates. We’d need to all agree to use existing open protocols and there’s a decent amount of code to write to enable federation but it’s not an impossible task.')
