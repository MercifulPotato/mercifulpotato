The very last message Trump put out was telling people to go home. I&#x27;ve covered both BLM and Trump reallies and I&#x27;ve always felt safer at every Trump protest than at BLM. Even in the case of yesterday, we&#x27;re seeing clear media manipulation. No one is covering how Trump supporters were let in; how Capitol Police lowered barricades.<p>Either Capitol Police were terribly incompetent at protecting one of the most secure buildings in the US, or they let this happen. There are videos of people taking selfies with capital police and patting them on the shoulder, thanking them for their service inside the building!<p>&gt; But if you believe inciting violence and other kinds of things should be punished by law, then you can hardly disagree with this.<p>YES! Lets&#x27; arrest every single person who burned and looted a building during the BLM protests and put them all in jail! Every last one.<p>Same with the people who went in to the Cap building and stole things. Those are federal crimes; that will get you 3 ~ 8 years! I&#x27;m for that too.<p>Oh and that Federal Guard that shot the Air Force woman, he certainly needs to go to jail.<p>Only some of those things will happen. Pay attention to which ones.')
