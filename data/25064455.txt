I am a long time collector of Victorian and Edwardian Erotica. There is a sub sub genre of Cyberpunk erotica.<p>I was reminded of this story about a madame who runs a cyberpunk pleasure house with mechanical delights and persons of various genders and combinations thereof and is taken to task by the owner of the already established whorehouse in town. And then they take each other to task and so on.<p>Which makes me wonder when will we have customizable Real Dolls and robot courtesans.
