Most people know about My Lai, but that was just an incident which managed to break through into American awareness - it wasn&#x27;t unusual, it was more like the norm.<p>Nobody ever faced consequences for any of it.<p>I gotta be honest, the idea that things like this &quot;damage American moral authority&quot; is just such a purely America-centric view.
