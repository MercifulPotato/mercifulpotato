While I agree most of them are baseless and ridiculous, I would say, let them expose themselves as ridiculous on their own merits. If you say, but they&#x27;re a lie!! Then I don&#x27;t understand why the same criteria is not used with religion, any religion (they&#x27;re all equally ridiculous and lies, and pry on the vulnerable to extract their money), and other baseless superstition (tarot, astrology, etc).<p>Imagine in the year 2300, 95% of the population is atheist and they deplatform anyone talking about religion because they&#x27;re spreading dangerous lies. Imagine if on the year 1400 there was internet, and they would deplatform any atheist debunking religion as spreading dangerous lies. You can find examples in the political realm, imagine in Nazi Germany, or in Stalin Russia, that they would deplatform anyone spreading ideas not aligned with the regime.<p>As you said, &quot;I don&#x27;t agree with what you said, but I Will Defend to the Death Your Right to Say It.&quot;')
