They&#x27;re degrees removed and just throw stones from their glass houses.<p>Guess what, I&#x27;m not picking Spring to make a simple REST api when it takes 5 lines in Expressjs. Why? Spring is complete overkill. So along those lines, should you use React&#x2F;Redux&#x2F;Redux-{Thunk,Promise,Observable}&#x2F;Navigation&#x2F;etc if you need a simple 2 page site? NO! Jesus christ, you pick the right tool for the right job.<p>There&#x27;s a reason though, when you have a highly complex app with insane business rules (that could very well be hidden from the airmchair HN crowd) where you need that complexity. And guess what, if you&#x27;re highly versed in these &quot;complex&quot; frontend tools (spoiler: they&#x27;re not complex), then it makes building sites, generally, very easy.<p>So go ahead, believe what you want and continue to parrot the &quot;the frontend ecosystem is hopeless, needlessly complex and godless&quot; while the rest of us continue developing with these &quot;complex&quot; tools because they make our lives as developers easier.<p>I&#x27;ll sleep happy while you wait that one more second for the page to load.')
