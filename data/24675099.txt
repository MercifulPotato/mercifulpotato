If they were true perhaps you can get a Nobel, but you must wait in the queue for a few years. If you break the Second Law you can skip the queue and even the voting.<p>&gt; <i>No power numbers. Are they talking about generating a picowatt or something like that?</i><p>The figures in the research article claims ~1pW. I still can&#x27;t get the research paper, but reading the information that is available, and some enlightening discussions in HN I guess they measured a ~1pW exchange of heat in the other side of the device (the &quot;lamp&quot; in the animation). But it is ~1pW in one direction and exactly the same amount in the other direction. There is no net energy flux or &quot;useful&quot; energy.<p>This may be an useful experimental result in the research branch they are working, but not &quot;Limitless Power&quot;.')
