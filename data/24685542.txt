If you need full blown relational db support, you could for example utilize PostgreRest to get db API with minimal effort that you can use as a service. This is not generation time (it could be), the point is to work run time. This is similar to how you would handle comments via for example discuss service. You basically have full SQL capabilities via REST interface - you can choose, order, sort and filter any db column, 100% of CRUD and even have actions via stored procedures. After taking a time to learn it, you can create a production grade service in few hours.<p>Data onboarding is as trivial as creating a table in a database - it will get automagically exposed as REST endpoint.<p>Performance is epic (my tests show ~2K req&#x2F;s).<p>There are alternative services, such as hasura, you might wanna take a look at.<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;postgrest.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;v7.0.0&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;postgrest.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;v7.0.0&#x2F;</a><p>Here is my Windows setup&#x2F;test and in the notes section you have another one for Nix.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;majkinetor&#x2F;postgrest-test" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;majkinetor&#x2F;postgrest-test</a>')
