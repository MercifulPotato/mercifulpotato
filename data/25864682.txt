All the timing stuff, start and stop bits, parity, flow control, ideally a FIFO, etc.  You only have 32 words of instruction memory in each PIO.  I wish they had made the PIOs more capable.  It&#x27;s not like they take a lot of die area compared to 264k of ram etc.  The Beaglebone PRU&#x27;s are closer to the right thing.')
