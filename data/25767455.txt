It&#x27;s something that most application developers have no idea exists. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s been very successful.<p>We didn&#x27;t use the other Ory offerings, instead opting to create our own user management and permissions suite. We already had LDAP as a competing source of truth, so this colored the picture. In 2021, I&#x27;d probably advocate for buying all-in to Ory tools.<p>If you&#x27;re a shop that employs capable engineers, Ory is a strong recommendation. If you want something with a wide product surface area, you might want to look elsewhere.<p>To make a doubtlessly crude analogy, Hydra is kind of like the Kubernetes to the other options&#x27; OpenShift.')
