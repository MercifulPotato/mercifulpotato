So at first glance I&#x27;d be tempted to say no, but...<p>Two overlapping polygons in a 2D space also define another 2D polygon. Two overlapping line segments in a 1D space define another line segment. You only get a reduced-dimension object at the intersection if they&#x27;re intersecting in a higher dimensional space. Otherwise they can&#x27;t intersect &quot;at an angle&quot;.<p>So I&#x27;d say purely by following the pattern that it must be that two 3D spaces intersecting &quot;at an angle&quot; within a 4D space define a plane by their intersection.')
