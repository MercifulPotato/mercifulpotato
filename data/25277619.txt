Zero cases for nearly 5 weeks, with 10-20k tests each day, from 700+ cases per day in July&#x2F;August.<p>The outbreak was painstakingly contact-traced, transmission patterns modeled in great detail.<p>The transmissions were indoors; initially in workplaces and homes, then it tore through aged care homes.<p>Transmission outdoors just wasn&#x27;t a factor. The government still imposed limits on how much outdoor interaction could happen, and mandated masks after things got bad, but the number of outdoor transmissions didn&#x27;t change; it was always insignificant. Indoor contact was clearly the driver.<p>To be fair, the facts here probably don’t contradict your point much; severe restrictions were imposed, and adhered to by our largely compliant population, including significant limits on outdoor contact (exercise with only one person outside one&#x27;s household for up to one hour per day) and requirements for distancing and mask-wearing.<p>Incidentally, Melbourne is the only large city in Australia that has cool&#x2F;dark winters and a high incidence of Vitamin D deficiency, and was the only city to have a major covid outbreak. The other (warmer&#x2F;sunnier&#x2F;higher Vit D) cities didn’t limit outdoor contact at all, and had no trouble preventing outbreaks.')
