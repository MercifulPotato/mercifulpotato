Yes a email client <i>can</i> examine dkim headers and do something based on that. But it&#x27;s much better used as a method for influencing a metric of spam or not spam on your MX smtpd that receives incoming traffic. Not as a guaranteed 100% &quot;this is legit&quot; indicator. It&#x27;s a thing used to influence a weighting score on my postfix setup.<p>Note that there is not a lot of technical barrier preventing a spammer from setting up a very basic opendkim daemon and key, and using a one time throwaway domain name to spam from, along with the appropriate dkim records in the DNS zonefile. But it&#x27;s a barrier that not a lot want to jump through.')
