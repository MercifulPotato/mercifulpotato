Correcting people can be considered impolite. In discussions marked by conflict, it&#x27;s often more useful to get the other person to arrive at your conclusion themselves, by simply presenting the information and your evaluation of its meaning. It depends a lot upon the audience, the prior conversation, the circumstances etc. People are marked by a great deal of hysteresis (not to be confused with hysteria lol).')
