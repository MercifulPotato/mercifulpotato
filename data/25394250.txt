Assisted suicide unavailable?  Parental leave &#x2F; sick leave laws non existent?   Access to abortion restricted in some states to sufficiently quality it as inaccessible to those who need it?<p>Did I imagine growing up without dental care or healthcare because my immigrant small business owner parents could not access affordable healthcare?  I personally know small business owners that are open about supporting politicians because they don&#x27;t want the minimum salary for exempt workers to be raised, so that they can continue to exploit immigrant &quot;managers&quot; to run their businesses and pay them $32k per year to work 60+ hours a week.<p>These are real matters that have affected me and many others in the country.  To say politics isnâ€™t significant is ridiculous.')
