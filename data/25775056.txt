[0] Libraries, should they accept donations to operate (or public funding!), accept some restrictions as well. There are commercial libraries as well, incidentally, which don&#x27;t get to accept donations, but are funded by some associated commercial business - my local bookstore had one before the current pandemic has started, though it is unknown if they will continue to have one by the time it ends.<p>Churches are &quot;complicated&quot; - and less said about the funding the better, especially in context of the US. Suffice to say I very much prefer the German model - which happens to come with quite stringent accountability requirements.<p>I have no problem sending money in appreciation for the work with no expectation of any return on it (not even a tax deduction). I do not have a problem with someone making a profit on those &quot;gifts&quot; - I wish them all the best, in fact. I do, however, firmly believe that you can&#x27;t have your cake and eat it too: you receive the ability to accept donations in a way where you enjoy various exemptions (in this context, from Apple&#x2F;Google delisting you or taking their cut) in exchange for actually going through that bureaucratic rigmarole to get registered. It&#x27;s not a $DEITY-given FOSS right.<p>Side note - as I wrote before, my local tax office would like to know who the money is going to, to either try to get their pound of flesh (cynical and realistic view) or to identify the money going to &#x27;bad actors&#x27; (take your usual terrorists&#x2F;criminals&#x2F;think of the children BS excuse the politicians always make up to pass the relevant law), doubly so when the money is sent internationally - if I wanted to actually send an one-off gift to Jason&#x2F;zx2c4, I can only assume he is not in my country.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;producing-pbs&#x2F;funding-standards&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;producing-pbs&#x2F;funding-standards&#x2F;</a>')
