What even is the use-case for plausible deniability? The way I heard it, is if your conversational partner is from the FBI and you want to whistleblow something, the plausible deniability can be used to plausibly deny that you said something to the agent. But who&#x27;s the judge going to believe: the agent that claimed message X was sent to them, or the user who said that the agent must have forged message X? Heck, if the government is that suspicious of someone they can also order the ISP to setup a tap and see that the right number of bytes at the right time were sent. The feature requires extra complexity in security protocols, plus might give people a false sense that they can just deny anything afterwards when that is not the case.<p>Checking Wikipedia to make sure I understand the point correctly, it claims it&#x27;s more about denying that encryption was used at all (good luck with that one in an encrypted chat) or that there can be multiple plaintexts (so you can later come up with a completely different chat log, lying in court and claiming the other party has forged everything, which has the same issue as above).<p>Transcript consistency on the other hand seems to me like an expected feature for any &gt;2010 multi-party encryption protocol. That can be practically used to change the conversation shown to a third participant (taking a &quot;yes&quot; of mine from one place, pasting it elsewhere while withholding the original reply...).')
