These states have laws about how elections are run, most&#x2F;all of them criminalize election fraud, and none of them allow the legislature to select electors directly.<p>The theory here is that the US Constitution, because of wording in Article II (&quot;Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors [...]&quot;) that if interpreted hyperspecifically[1] implies that the legislature alone, and not Governor or state law, has the power to appoint electors.  That has never been tested in practice.<p>But regardless, it would still be a state crime to do it.  So no, he doesn&#x27;t have the right.<p>[1] Obviously the reasonable interpretation of this line is &quot;States decide for themselves how to choose electors&quot;, not something that makes assumptions about the structure of state government.')
