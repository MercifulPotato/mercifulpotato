If you demonstrate you can&#x27;t pick up on the cues you are a less desirable match -- not undesirable but less desirable -- because people around you will have to put a lot more effort into communicating with you than they do with other people and there will be more instances of miscommunication. This is unpleasant. It&#x27;s not fair that people with a communicative handicap should be found less desirable but them&#x27;s the breaks. It isn&#x27;t fair if you&#x27;re born poor or graceless or self-centered or too fat or too thin or with ugly features or bad skin or a gut that produces too much gas or with an inclination to be cruel and so on ad infinitum. The people judging you know it isn&#x27;t fair, but they also know there are other choices. Also, there are plenty of unfortunate women willing to give the unfortunate men a chance to show their <i>good</i> qualities.')
