I&#x27;m not sure how common they are, but Apple supports up to a terra-byte of RAM (maybe more). I could easily see SOCs with 64GB of RAM, but I&#x27;m struggling with them putting 128 or 256GB+ on the SoC.<p>Maybe some kind of hybrid?<p>Very curious to see how they are going to work around this.')
