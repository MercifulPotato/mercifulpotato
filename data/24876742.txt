I can&#x27;t use my youtube account, and I have to use my google account to access my tranferred music. And if I switch to my google account, I am logged out of youtube, and all my subscriptions are gone.<p>I listen to very uncommon music that&#x27;s not available anywhere to be streamed. Google Play Music was the only solution for streaming all my collection. I am looking for replacements... please let me know if you have any. My current bet is something like owncloud.')
