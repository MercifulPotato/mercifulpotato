Item(by='pgwhalen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608238493, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25457138, text='&gt; Robinhood executing orders at prices that are not only worse than what is available on the market, but also worse than competing brokers<p>This sentence doesn&#x27;t make much sense given how PFOF works.  It would make sense if it were flipped around and said &quot;not only worse than competing brokers, but worse than what is available on the market&quot; because brokers typically provide retail traders <i>better</i> than what is available on the market (assuming: public exchanges = market).<p>I agree with GP that the press release suggests that Robinhood was not giving worse prices than NBBO, but was instead giving prices better than NBBO (like every broker), but intentionally not _as good_ prices as other brokers, in exchange for greater PFOF.<p>I am not fundamentally against PFOF, but the &quot;honesty&quot; required on the part of the broker in situations like this has always troubled me, and it&#x27;s interesting to see it rear its head.  I think an ideal market structure might keep PFOF, but in a more public way, such that payments were more transparent&#x2F;competitive in real time, and not something arbitrarily negotiated between brokers and wholesalers.')
