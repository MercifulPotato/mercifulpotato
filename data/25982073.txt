If you think that, you don&#x27;t understand what DLL hell was.<p>I assume that by deployment of software, you mean &quot;someone other a distro maintainer building and packaging software&quot;. That&#x27;s no harder on Linux than it is on Windows or macOS (*) , it&#x27;s just that Linux users have the <i>additional</i> option to get software from their distro too.<p>macOS: you put everything your app needs into ... well, a folder (with some required filenames and organization)<p>windows: you put everything your app needs into ... a folder (with some required filenames and organization)<p>linux: you put everything you app needs into ... a folder. Full integration into &quot;the desktop&quot; needs a few additional steps, easily carried out by an install process.<p>What is missing on Linux is a nice, clean, commonplace way for users to actually carry out the installation process for 3rd party (ISV) software that isn&#x27;t packaged using the distro packaging system.<p>(*) other than issues with certain, ahem, toolkits that make it hard or impossible to statically link against them (and note: these are typically cross-platform toolkits, ironically).')
