I had a Thinkpad running windows (I&#x27;m in my early 30s today), and 2 days before an assignment was due, my brother knocked it off a table, it hit every step down to the ground floor. The board was pretty much done (it was an old Thinkpad) and I had to figure out a way to salvage some of the data, so I did some research online.<p>I ended up downloading Ubuntu, created a bootable USB and managed to fish out my documents from the disks. Fast forward to today, and I&#x27;m part of an Ops team running and developing software to manage around 10K Ubuntu servers across several colocations.<p>I don&#x27;t have children (yet), but for the parents out there - push your kids to tinker with technology, don&#x27;t just buy a new one when it breaks. \nFor me it started out with breaking and assembling back almost every toy my parents bought me, to understand its internals. Please nurture this instinct.')
