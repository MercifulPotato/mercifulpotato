My server is a computer I got for free (some dell optiplex with an i3 in it), it eats 20W of power. It works more or less well depending on available bandwidth (on ADSL attachments were a pain).<p>These days it&#x27;s mostly fine. The database is about 15GB (including media), there are scripts around the net to clean it up (rooms you&#x27;ve left, etc). Joining big, federated rooms is ram-expensive with synapse, though you now can specify a maximum complexity on your server to prevent joining those. Other small federated rooms are completely fine to join, and don&#x27;t cost much more than a local room (IMO, there&#x27;s little point in hosting a non-federated matrix server).<p>I use yunohost to simplify deployment, though it has some limitations. I did give access to a few friends, but I feel like I cannot guarantee uptime even though it has been pretty good so far. Once profiles-as-rooms land, that might change, as a user could just hop on another server if mine is down.')
