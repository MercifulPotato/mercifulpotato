Item(by='dsaavy', descendants=None, kids=[24783921], score=None, time=1602714350, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24781156, text='Reddit absolutely revises written record, like this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;23&#x2F;reddit-huffman-trump&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;23&#x2F;reddit-huffman-trump&#x2F;</a><p>So I&#x27;d certainly say Reddit is at least comparable. Additionally, I see fact checks on tons of conservative posts on Facebook and Twitter (rightfully so most of the time). But the same procedure isn&#x27;t followed for liberal posts.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen any possible misinformation warnings on Facebook or Twitter for something like: people claiming the BLEXIT supporters at Trump&#x27;s recent speech were paid. According to ABC News, some supporters travel and room&#x2F;board were paid (but they didn&#x27;t release any of the emails, just allegedly quoted them). So it would be misleading to say that BLEXIT supporters were paid to attend the speech, it should be labeled as a &quot;possibly misleading&quot; statement like the claims from the right typically are. I mean, the emails haven&#x27;t even been released and&#x2F;or verified as existing and people are just running with it because it&#x27;s ABC?<p>Edit: would love to know why I&#x27;m getting downvotes for providing a comment with a source and a different viewpoint?')
