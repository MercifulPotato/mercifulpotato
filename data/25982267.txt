Item(by='drdeca', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612125012, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25975557, text='I believe that twitter shouldn’t be legally forced to share whatever things someone wants to say on it, but I also think that it can be bad for twitter to choose to exclude certain positions.<p>Sometimes someone should do (or refrain from doing) something, but shouldn’t be made to do (or refrain from doing) that thing.<p>I think my major expectation for what claims a website allows users to make on that website, is that they make their policies for what they allow, not just technically stated in a ToS somewhere, but actually generally understood by viewers of the site. If someone wants to make a website which forbids any speaking in favor of putting orange juice on cereal, but allows lots of other things, then as long as what they forbid is clear, that’s not something I would think is bad. (Weird, yes, but not bad.)<p>Now, for handling libelous speech on a platform, I guess that is an issue maybe?  \nHonestly, “what about libel” seems like the most convincing argument I’ve heard for “websites should know who the users they automatically publish submissions from are”. But I’m still not convinced.')
