Item(by='wahern', descendants=None, kids=[24777982], score=None, time=1602657249, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24773611, text='SF spent $1.5 billion building housing. Newsom&#x27;s budget allocates $550 million <i>over</i> <i>several</i> <i>years</i> for the <i>entire</i> <i>state</i> to build new housing. (SF population is ~800k as compared to the state population of over 35 million.) The rest (~$750 million) is for general homeless services, including mental health care. Note that alot of the beds purchased with the funds have already gone to house people displaced by wildfires.<p>As I said, it&#x27;s clear from the sums and structure of the funding that Newsom isn&#x27;t actually trying to replicate the SF program. But it&#x27;s easy for conservative pundits to make hay out of things (especially when the <i>announcements</i> themselves are tailored to placate the left) rather than support actual reform efforts. As I said, the politics in California is fscked up. But using Newsom as a scapegoat merely evinces partisan blinders.')
