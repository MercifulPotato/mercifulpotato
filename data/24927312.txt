Item(by='sli', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603946669, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24927282, text='&gt; This kind of thing makes me yearn for a solution that does this in VR.<p>I would absolutely love a VR take on this. A year or so ago, I figured I could manage running games in TTS as a VR player while everyone else just played. Turns out that TTS in VR is far and away less usable than TTS normally is. Just feels like they checked a box to enable VR support in Unity and left it at that. Fuzzy interface that made everything hard to read, clunky VR controls, and basically zero assists. One wrong move and you accidentally clear the whole table. It made TTS&#x27;s regular controls seem nice, that&#x27;s how bad it was.')
