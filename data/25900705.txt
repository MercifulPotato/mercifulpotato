You also get simple file-system based routing if you want it (thanks to next.js) and very easy deploy, that is also gets you letsencrypt certificate automatically.\nIt does not have database part of the story atm, but you can use dynamo&#x2F;fauna&#x2F;mongo and alike.<p>Really simple thing is dark lang though! it has all of these concerns integrated in, have IDE and incremental automatic deployment. Absolutely love it. But it is still quite early beta.')
