Accusing me of &quot;giv[ing] them up to the lynch mob&quot; is not that. Knock it off.<p>Here&#x27;s the issue, either you&#x27;re advocating for something useless, or for the suppression of speech.<p>On one hand, you have the idea of criminalizing violent responses to unpopular speech. This is completely superfluous; we already criminalize violence, what will adding <i>another</i> law do, really? The theory might be that it&#x27;ll dissuade action, but someone furious enough to literally lynch their neighbor over speech isn&#x27;t rationally balancing the pros and cons. &quot;I strongly disapprove of this and therefore I want whoever does it to be locked up forever&quot; might feel viscerally good, but we <i>know</i> it&#x27;s a bad way to run a country.<p>On the other hand, attempting to protect people from non-violent responses involves the suppression of speech based on popularity. You might have the right to say whatever you want, but I also have the right to tell you exactly how I feel about that. You can&#x27;t abridge my legal right to say that because I happen to be in the majority any more than you can suppress my speech if I was in the minority. And if my push-back to your original speech is noxious in its own right, then maybe <i>I&#x27;ll</i> suffer social consequences for my own speech, as is completely fair.<p>Oh, and remember that any tool you give the government might be abused. We&#x27;re already seeing local cities trying to pass &quot;hate speech&quot; laws against anti-cop sentiment, which is probably not what the original authors had in mind. The path between &quot;we need to suppress the mob&quot; and &quot;my political opponents are a mob and must be suppressed&quot; is very straight and very short.')
