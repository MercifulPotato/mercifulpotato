I hate QtQuick controls with a passion. They don&#x27;t generally feel better than Electron widgets. I say that as a linux user, which also happens to be a dev with tons of Qt experience, which understands the appeal of QML, but simply can&#x27;t digest the user experience.<p>Most of the UIs designed with Quick (I&#x27;m thinking about some matrix clients I was playing with, but not exclusively) are also designed in a way which is totally orthogonal to what I would expect a desktop UI to be.<p>I&#x27;ve seen some of my favorite programs being ruined in the transition from QtWidgets to QML. One part being the horrid controls, the second being the &quot;new way&quot; of UI design QML easily adapts itself to.<p>I&#x27;m saddened by this. I was hoping Qt to be the escape path from the mess that Gtk was going to, but QML is worse.')
