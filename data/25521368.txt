Including for businesses. And if you think this is going to stop with personalized ads . . . well, then I disagree.”<p>Allowing users to choose whether they want to be tracked passes the decision of &quot;how the internet should work&quot; from companies that sell ads to the users.  It sounds like Levy just wants to remain in control of that decision.<p>Then he has the audacity to mention &quot;democracy&quot; despite wanting to remove power from the majority of the affected people.')
