Stalking laws exist, even if the person is following another in public.<p>There are limits, you see.<p>Further, as others have eluded to, this is not about &quot;a person seeing another person&quot;.  Instead, this is about:<p>- a non-entity, a device, &#x27;watching&#x27; you\n- exporting that data from the locality it was taken in\n- storing that information forever, if desired\n- also scanning you directly, looking for RF signals<p>To claim that &quot;a person seeing you walking down the street&quot; is the same as this, is not valid.<p>For example, &quot;stalking&quot; entails following a person, where ever they go.<p>What else is all of this surveillance, if not &#x27;following&#x27; a person where ever they go?  And in most legal jurisdictions, this is a crime.<p>Try this same behaviour as a person?  And individual?  Follow a person where ever they go, take notes, never leave them alone?  Bam!  Stalking.<p>But because it&#x27;s a corporation doing it, that&#x27;s OK I suppose?<p>You keep trying to say that &quot;a person seeing you in public&quot; is the same as &quot;mass surveillance being leveled against you&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not.  Full stop.<p>So why not discuss this as it truly is?  Please stop this conflation.')
