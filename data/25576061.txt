Hence 61 days with no cases - any false positives in that time have been identified as such, so the process taken as a whole has a very low false positive rate indeed.<p>But even the raw &quot;one in 10k&quot; false positive rate they see is low enough that almost all positive tests anywhere with an active COVID outbreak are true positives.')
