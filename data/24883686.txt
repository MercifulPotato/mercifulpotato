I made a simple Emacs script that I use to output files, and I use it constantly for Latex PDFs, HTML output, RevealJS slides, and odt&#x2F;docx&#x2F;etc. All with bibliographies fron Zotero in zillions of formats. As a professor and journalist, I need to use a wide range of output formats, but as a human being I like to work in clean, simple text files that will never be obsolete. Pandoc, way more than any tool, gives me the freedom to work in any writing environment I like and keep that distinct from whatever weird formatting preferences a journal, magazine, or publisher might have. I&#x27;ve written two books with Markdown and a huge variety of articles. I am so thankful for the care with which it has been built and maintained. Thank you.')
