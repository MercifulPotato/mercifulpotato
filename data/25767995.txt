Wonder why Cisco didn&#x27;t take that angle with WRT54GL derivatives. I had one and it was quite nice.<p>Only thing I can think of is that the hardware was plenty capable but the software is where feature differentiation is and they didn&#x27;t want to end up being commoditized.<p>It appears that approach has been successful.')
