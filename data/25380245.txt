Managing fundamentally stateful components was always a nightmare for me in Java and Java-related languages: you&#x27;d never know which class was in charge of initializing what, would always be tearing your hair out trying to keep track of when you can assume certain components have been successfully initialized, etc.<p>With mount on the other hand, you tell it how to start and stop the component (and stores a reference to the component in the same var where you specified this), keeps a reference to the component in exactly one place, and then it automatically makes some reasonable assumptions about the order in which they need to be initialized, while allowing you to opt out as needed. Re: your example of finding a reference to the db, shouldn&#x27;t it just have been in the var set up by a call to `defstate`? (Also, which web framework was it? Luminus?)')
