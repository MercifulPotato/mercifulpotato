I decided to go to a vintage Sony TV, just to simplify that mess.)<p>I&#x27;m not 100% happy with the vintage TV approach, and would like to move to 4K+ someday, while keeping decent integrated speakers&#x2F;soundbar and be able to plug video&amp;audio&amp;limitedcontrol right into my PS4 (PS5?) and random other HDMI-spitting devices.')
