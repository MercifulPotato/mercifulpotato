The Western ideology after WW2 was that liberal markets (eventually) implied (rise of) a democracy with civil liberties. China showed that this ideology is false by creating liberal-enough markets while retaining absolute state control (and the Chinese state has vastly concentrated its power, and the power within the Chinese state has been vastly concentrated as well, to the point of it effectively being a Fuhrerstate). Meanwhile The East has shown that so-called illiberal democracies can be widely accepted by the people. And the US are currently testing the hypothesis whether free speech is survivable for a democratic society in the presence of so-called social media. I strongly suspect these are going to be the sucker-punch for The West in combination with Covid-related economic crises. It is likely the liberal era is going to end within this decade.')
