A proper infosec analyst looking at this would first wonder why there is HTTP traffic related to .NET assemblies at all (this sounds weird). Then comparing two requests or so would likely show a suspicious pattern of all the hex changing randomly while the rest of the payload is cookie cutter the same.<p>Unless the outer layer <i>is</i> a legitimate service that&#x27;s actually in use, this kind of thing only fools people who&#x27;d dismiss this traffic as &quot;something I don&#x27;t know about, but which is probably benign&quot;. Then there&#x27;s the whole figuring out what IPs this is going to part, which would raise more alarm bells.<p>Cute, but I think you could do better. Hiding from someone looking at your traffic is very hard. The more important part is how well you hide from dumb automated tools that people rely on for initial detection.<p>Then again, a huge portion of the auditing&#x2F;&quot;infosec&quot; market nowadays <i>are</i> untrained random people running automated scanners who actually have zero reverse engineering or proper security research experience, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d work well against those.')
