When developers say they &quot;want a mac instance&quot; they often &quot;want a mac instance that can talk to apple services like a normal mac instance&quot; in order to sign apps and such.  I&#x27;m not sure but I think arranging for that capability probably involves round trips with apple services to get required key signing artifacts into place ...<p>If instances are totally ephemeral in the same way as we are used to with linux vm&#x27;s maybe that runs the risk of creating a real problem for apple services?')
