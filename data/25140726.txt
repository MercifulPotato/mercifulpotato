My two best advices are:<p>- if there is a paying tool where you thought &quot;yes it&#x27;s cool but I don&#x27;t really need that I can do without&quot;, don&#x27;t do that and buy it. You will feel a lot better buying a tool that you ultimately don&#x27;t need much than discovering after 10 years that you were wasting your time that a 100e spend could save you<p>- try a tool that is diametrically opposed to what you are used to, and force yourself to use it for a while no matter what, see if that different way of thinking works better if or if your original choice works better<p>Eg if you&#x27;re a vim guy, don&#x27;t try emacs or vs code (small steps); but intellij or similar, discover an entirely opposite way of doing things. It may convert you, or you may learn that you were right in your choice. Mostly all such tools have a free trial time. Hard part is to force yourself to use the new tool no matter what for a while.<p>My eye opener was debugging a hard problem in PHPStorm and noticing that instead of fighting&#x2F;trying to extract information from its debugger, I was helped and supported by it. Suddenly that tool became my assistant and I couldn&#x27;t do without, and I have been subscribed to jetbrains ever since (their intellisense is also miles ahead but I don&#x27;t know if that alone would have converted me)<p>&gt; I bought a gamer laptop<p>Ah, I have one too ! Love it ! Used to be Asus ROG serie, now is MSI G-serie. Awesome thing. The keyboard is the worst thing ever made for coding (especially on msi, they&#x27;re steelseries keyboard, re-arranged for gaming).<p>I don&#x27;t know your personnal situation, but if you can afford it and assuming you are a coder, buy a dedicated work laptop. Only thing that matters are screen and keyboard. Lenovo Thinkpad, Dell XPS, that kind of thing. Price in the 1000-2000 range usually. Not having anything but work on it will end up as a bonus and net positive, I promise you that (no distraction).<p>My current laptop is a thinkpad matte screen with semi mechanical key, if I need to show it to someone it looks terrible (and right out of the 60s), but it&#x27;s awesome. If you spend more than 5 minutes a week fighting against your keyboard, you need to change it. If you need to &quot;change position&quot; because of the glare, change.<p>&gt; Monitor<p>High refresh rate (120&#x2F;144&#x2F;240 hz, look for gamers latop they care about that), good color rendering (eg look for srgb screen) and contrast. In this one, opposite the laptop one, gamer&#x27;s things are actually pretty good because rendering fast and clearly matters a lot there. The contrast is important because you want something that you can see clearly without being at 100% brightness, so the gamers 120hz&#x2F;hdr compatible screen are a welcomed thing.<p>Do not think 60hz&#x2F;75hz is enough, you won&#x27;t see the difference going up but going down after being used to it makes it clear how better it is. This is a ~300e spend max.<p>&gt; Chair<p>The rules are: it should not be an effort to be sitting in a good posture in it, and it should be your natural posture in it. If you don&#x27;t sit better on it &quot;unless I force myself to sit that way&quot;, forget it you won&#x27;t do it. I bought a &quot;medical&#x2F;ergonomical&quot; chair meant for people with back problems, for 240e.<p>&gt; Standing desk<p>Absolutely agree, I bought one from autonomous during a sale. One thing I can tell you is it&#x27;s a lie to thing standing is always better, so I would really suggest a switching that can do both. I&#x27;m still not sure it makes my life better per se, but I know at least I&#x27;m not sitting all day anymore and I don&#x27;t feel terrible working standing up which is what I scared of.<p>&gt; Quality noise cancelling headphones<p>Of the entire list this is probably the first one you should go for (if you can, eg don&#x27;t need to answer your colleagues every 5 minutes). You will be very surprised by how much many distraction you didn&#x27;t notice it removes and how much more centrated you become when it&#x27;s only you, the screen, your mind and maybe some music.')
