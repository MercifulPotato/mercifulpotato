An SVG document has a DOM and a navigatable  accessibility tree just like HTML documents (including ARIA attributes etc). There is more that happens for sighted users too - text becomes selectable in the SVG, links are clickable, etc. All that probably needs the context of a browsing context and DOM created in an &lt;iframe&gt; or &lt;object&gt; and not in an &lt;img&gt; and is specced in detail. I really don&#x27;t blame browsers for implementing the spec.')
