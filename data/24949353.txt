The cost for renewables + storage is at least the cost of nuclear, but that cost also doesn&#x27;t matter to some advocates.  (If grid storage was cheap, we would have built it decades ago.)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lazard.com&#x2F;perspective&#x2F;levelized-cost-of-energy-and-levelized-cost-of-storage-2020&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lazard.com&#x2F;perspective&#x2F;levelized-cost-of-energy-...</a><p>Some advocates recommend massively overbuilding solar or wind to deal with seasonal differences.  This is obviously a cost multiplier but that doesn&#x27;t seem to matter to some advocates.<p>Advocates also describe how we will rebuild the electrical grid to move vast amounts of solar or wind power across the USA.  This will not be cheap or easy.  Even the relatively small proposed Tres Amos SuperStation hasnâ€™t been completed yet.  This cost doesn&#x27;t seem to matter to some advocates.<p>Advocates for renewables seem happy with relying on natural gas peaker plants to get around the costs of building grid storage, but methane is a very potent GHG in the short term and there are lots of methane losses in its capture and  distribution.  No one seriously thinks that natural gas is a long term answer to climate change.<p>It is possible there will be some major advances in grid storage that will allow us to stop using natural gas to cover for the intermittent nature of wind and solar. In that case - great! But... what if that doesn&#x27;t pan out? The dangers we are facing in the coming decades are immense. If you were forced to choose, would you prefer the world to suffer through catastrophic climate change rather than use nuclear power?')
