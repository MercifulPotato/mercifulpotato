Is that a fair trade off? We can directly connect the dots from &quot;I wanna do what I want!&quot; who then get sick or make other people sick who then end up at a hospital who take up a bed and someone else who isn&#x27;t sick but has a plumonary or cardiac episode dies.<p>If we had perfect information, we could trace the liability back to people&#x27;s behavior and fine them properly for non-compliance. But that would run up against privacy concerns wouldn&#x27;t it?<p>What about a general strike by health care workers and grocery stockers and food delivery service workers? Right now. In the middle of a pandemic. Can you imagine the outrage? And why would people be outraged? Because they think these workers are slaves. They shouldn&#x27;t have a choice. It&#x27;s everyone who isn&#x27;t on the front line who should get to choose whether to comply with public health orders.<p>It is certainly more civilized for health care workers to just quit en masse right now, than to propose people should just get to flaunt public health orders without any kind of penalty. But I&#x27;m getting the strong indication this is not a civil society.')
