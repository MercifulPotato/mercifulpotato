The line that resonates with me a lot is &quot;<i>working a regular software developer job. Which is what I&#x27;m doing now, and am very happy.</i>&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve been trying to make it on my own (actually me and my best friend and also my business partner) for approximately the same amount of time and last year he said enough and left everything to me. He is now a full time employee and looks quite happy.<p>Me on the other hand is still waiting for the light at the end of this tunnel.<p>I&#x27;ve put so much time and effort into this and have very little to show for it. Had I taken the old tested job route maybe i would have been better off too I think.<p>My mistake definitely boils down to one thing which I&#x27;ve learned the hard way:<p><i>There are only two roles in a company: Sales and sales support.</i> So if you aren&#x27;t doing sales directly you better be doing something to support it and every dept including product dev, customer support, etc must work from that angle.')
