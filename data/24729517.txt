When I was younger I used to write bands that I love. I&#x27;d contact them with praise, or asking with help on chord progressions, and never received anything back.<p>One day I mailed an indie band from Canada and told them how much I loved their record and how incredible it was. I received an email back saying thanks that was signed with a name that I didn&#x27;t recognize. I looked at their website and it was their drummer. I loved it. One of the very happy moments in my musical journey.')
