Maybe not with laptops like this, but most government entities and corporate boards do have software-driven processes to collect info and documents, provide them to the leaders, and run meetings to make decisions. Those who don&#x27;t have specific software for it typically at least use something like google docs to share info.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if those of us who write such software are making governance any more efficient, but at least we are no longer printing massive binders of info every time someone has a board meeting.<p>BTW, most government is not feds in black SUVs - it is small local school boards,  city councils, and special districts. There are tens of thousands of such government entities in the USA alone. Most of their boards are not in it for shaking hands and all that. Some are, but most are just local folk doing their jobs.')
