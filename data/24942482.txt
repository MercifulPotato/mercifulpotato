His policies are typical Republican policies. He hasn&#x27;t jailed journalists or whistleblowers. His military engagements have been the most minimal since the Clinton-era. But again, his temperament is not presidential and that bucks the norm. That&#x27;s on him.<p>In this quote, Trump is the devil and the DNC and mainstream center-left&#x2F;left news, in an effort to get the devil, have destroyed every institutional and journalistic norm. Their role is far more damaging then Trump tweeting idiotic and sometimes terrible things.')
