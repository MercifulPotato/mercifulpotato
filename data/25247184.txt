I have also noticed that my dreams adapt to outside sounds&#x2F;lighting changes in realtime. What&#x27;s more spooky is that the entire dream preserves it cohesion and nothing feels out of place, even when the events outside (in the real world) are completely random. Like sound of the door closing or someone walking by the bed, all of that integrates seamlessly into the dream.')
