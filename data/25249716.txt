It&#x27;s a shame it&#x27;s so hard to do, but I always thought it&#x27;d be a good protection against phishing.<p>I think email signing is wonderful.  In fact, my email client (Thunderbird) is configured to sign <i>all</i> messages sent by my primary identity.<p>For many years, I used Enigmail, until Thunderbird integrated the functionality a few months ago.<p>However, the value of signing is diluted significantly by the narrow adoption and ignorance of the greater populace.<p>As an example, I was exchanging emails with my financial advisor and giving them specific instructions on the disposition of certain funds.<p>Having a GPG signature is great for this, since they can confirm that the email hadn&#x27;t been modified in transit.<p>But rather than being glad that I cryptographically signed my instructions, I received a phone call saying something along the lines of &quot;there&#x27;s all this junk at the end of your email.  We&#x27;re concerned it&#x27;s been tampered with.&quot;<p>When I explained what the &quot;junk&quot; was, rather than asking how to confirm the signature in the future, I was met with confusion and the distinct impression that I was acting in an inappropriate way.<p>Their solution: All instructions from me must be verbally confirmed via telephone.<p>Not that such verification is a bad thing, but the complete ignorance, then rejection of a perfectly valid confirmation mechanism (without any interest in learning how to secure their communications) by folks who <i>should</i> care about such things left me flabbergasted.<p>As long as the above is the norm, email signing (and I still do it where it matters) will be much less valuable than it could be.<p>More&#x27;s the pity.')
