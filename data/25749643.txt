Get involved with projects in your community. Get involved with Meetup groups. Go to hackathons and join teams. Get involved in open source projects. It doesn&#x27;t really matter what the projects are (as long as you find them interesting and marginally worthwhile of course), what matters is you are getting practice working with a lot of different people and building your network of people you&#x27;ve worked with. In order to find 10 great people you love working with, you need to work with hundreds.<p>If you&#x27;d work with &gt;5x as many people at the new job, then it&#x27;s probably worth the pay cut.')
