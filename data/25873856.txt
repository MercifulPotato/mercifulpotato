Further, reading other people&#x27;s definitions and opinions, it feels like the pro and con advocates are talking past each other.<p>Here&#x27;s my current stab at understanding each side:<p>Customer perspective: Rent seeking bad. Don&#x27;t want to be gouged.<p>Broadband providers perspective: Mitigate the free rider problem(s), make the system fair.<p>Examples would be very helpful. Of course there are bad actors. I&#x27;m trying to not get sucked into that food fight. My hope is that we can curtail bad behavior (cheating) with better policies.<p>Surely we can design markets to satisfy the needs and concerns of both sides. Right?<p>--<p>Mea culpa: My bro created and runs the ISP portions of a cable company. He relates examples of their struggles. Stuff like spending millions of dollars on gear and having other companies abusing it.<p>We pretty much don&#x27;t agree on anything. But my bros examples and concerns are legit. So I&#x27;ve been trying to dig into his positions on net neutrality, to better understand the larger impasse.')
