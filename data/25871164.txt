Nor does it allow one to generalize about the content of the entire group of protesters.<p>There were some protesters who expelled rogue actors while accusing them of being &quot;antifa agitators&quot;. It wouldn&#x27;t be fair to cherry pick the worst actions of the group and generalize. The comparison to ISIS is an extra leap that I hope needs no further elaboration.')
