Is not about clever one liners or languages with less verbosity  but better implementations and abstractions and you can implement a good solution in a lot of languages.<p>An example would be where a dev needs to implement X, then he goes on Google , finds some code sample , copy-pastes it,  tests it, then changes here and there to make it work. The issue is that he maybe forgot to read the documentation for the functions used in the sample, or did not think that the sample is  incomplete (maybe missinfg input sanitation) or is outdated or the solution was already in the project code if he only have asked or looked around in the code.<p>Other example is when a dev wants to solve X, installs a package from npm that does X but does not understand it and in fact that npm package is just a few lines of code that you could have read, learn something, find limitations and improve that.')
