But as someone desperately trying to pivot from software development (5 year exp) to anything security related (which I find far more interesting), how are you supposed to do that without certs? I’ve done CTF events and performed well, I’ve done HTB for well over a year at this point, and the only time I’ve ever heard back from a company regarding an (offense) security position was basically just to see if I could be persuaded to do software development for their company instead. It’s extremely frustrating.')
