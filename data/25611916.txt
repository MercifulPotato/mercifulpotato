It&#x27;s in fact the default save method in nearly every PDF capable software. Rewriting the PDF is in fact the less common method. I&#x27;m surprised a researcher of PDF would be surprised by that.<p>However, if you are using a tool like a redaction tool then the software should forbid you from writing in append mode. This was a common error in old PDF apps and perhaps contemporary ones that are new.<p>Edit for politeness:<p>My surprise is aimed at the researcher, not you :)')
