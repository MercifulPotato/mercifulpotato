I included him in the list because he did attract a large following during the Bush era. I wasn’t a huge fan of Taibbi either, but his interview with Megyn Kelly really made me give him a second look. He’s has kids now (three, ages 2-6) and seems much mellower and down to earth.<p>I’ve consistently liked Klein and Yglesias. Both very detail oriented. By the way, Jane Coaston who does Weeds with them is a superstar. She’s on The Argument now too. (Both the NYT and Vox are vastly better and more nuanced in their Podcasts than their print media.)')
