Where these used to be around 60-80 EUR for iPhone 6 (third-party replacement parts), for the X and newer it&#x27;s basically approaching the price of a new device. Samsung phones, or any other modern Android phone, are just as uneconomically to repair. It seems the only thing to stop the trend for extremely expensive throw-away phones is consumer-&#x2F;eco-friendly legislation.')
