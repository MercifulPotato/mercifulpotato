Jobs that went away were things like waiters, bartenders, event planners, theater performers, etc. These aren&#x27;t BS jobs at all, and the stuff they enabled (going out to restaurants, seeing a live show, traveling) are things that were sorely missed by many.<p>On the contrary, <i>I&#x27;m</i> still employed, and it&#x27;s much easier to argue I have a bullshit job. I don&#x27;t want to go into too much detail but will just say my job only exists due to the absurd complexity of the US healthcare system.')
