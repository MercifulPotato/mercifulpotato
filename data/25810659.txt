The office was kitted out with poor monitors - cheapest Dell sold. Some people bought their own but most people were fine with them - they&#x27;re just monitors and they&#x27;re &#x27;fine&#x27;. Then a small group were rewarded with &#x27;premium monitors&#x27; as a prize for some internal competition - and this did cause annoyance, as it recognized that the company knew it was being cheap.<p>Second example. &quot;We&#x27;re getting new chairs!&quot; Supplier dropped off half-a-dozen different models for us to try out and then we collectively chose our favourite.\nExcept we couldn&#x27;t have it, as it was too expensive, and we got the &quot;second choice&quot;.\nNow that second choice was amazing compared to what they were replacing. An office full of premium ergonomic chairs cost the company a small fortune - but decision was tainted with cheapness. We weren&#x27;t worth the chair we&#x27;d chosen. If they&#x27;d just pulled the chairs they couldn&#x27;t afford from the competition, it would have cost the same and made us happy.')
