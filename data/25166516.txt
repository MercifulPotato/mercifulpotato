I had a GoPro eat two Sony cards in less than a year, I switched to SanDisk Endurance and it&#x27;s been plugging along for about 2 years now.  I&#x27;ve had one Samsung and a couple SanDisk SD cards die in Raspberry Pi&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m currently using MicroCenter, AData and one other lower tier brand that have held up much better than the name brands.')
