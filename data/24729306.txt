I removed the link the instant the 1 year I promised expired. Still, even for a low rank site they paid what to a university student was good money.<p>For a proper writer their budgets are no doubt higher. For an article capable of going viral (as it is now on HN), no doubt they have budgets in the thousands.<p>It seems silly, and no doubt it is, but I would be willing to bet that the author of this article even wrote the article he linked to.<p>Perhaps the most fun aspect to contemplate: this is an example of a journalist with something to say financing said writing as a byproduct SEO warfare between an entirely not-news industry.<p>The casino is not even advertising for the purposes of getting customers. The only reader the casino cares about is GoogleBot.')
