My search was mostly in the Toronto&#x2F;GTA region.<p>Most companies I pitched the idea of part-time work too always replied that they would need someone full-time, so I got the impression that part-time web development jobs just aren&#x27;t out there, at least in my region.<p>My question is, do any of you web developers out there have a part-time gig, or have seen part-time job opportunities for web development work?<p>Thanks.')
