Pollution at intergalactic scale. Probably getting to specific levels of technology requires specific level of consciousness - a corresponding level of awareness about actions and consequences. A technological level increase without corresponding consciousness level increase is probably one of the great filters. Like for example human civilization failure to recognize the human civilization induced global warming.<p>wrt. original post :<p>&gt;For ΛCDM to fit the pattern of fluctuations observed in the CMB by the Planck satellite and other experiments, the Hubble constant must have a particular value of 67.4 ± 0.5 km&#x2F;s&#x2F;Mpc. Local measurements are nearly all above this ‘Planck value’, but are consistent with each other. In our paper, we use a local value of 73.8 ± 1.1 km&#x2F;s&#x2F;Mpc using a combination of supernovae and gravitationally lensed quasars, two particularly precise yet independent techniques.<p>I think it is not an accident that c divided by the age of the universe  (meaning that those stars have been flying away from us with constant speed c) produces 71km&#x2F;s&#x2F;Mpc. That also means that there is no acceleration nor deceleration - stars fly away from us with constant speed [Hubble constant x distance] with the distance growing and the Hubble constant decreasing resulting in the same speed for any given star.')
