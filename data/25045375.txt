I suggest you do the same, it is incredibly instructive.<p>In my anecdotal experience, if I had to be a cow or a chicken, I would MUCH rather be in a kosher slaughterhouse. Better terms before, and what appears to me (the observer) as a much less painful death - in one case I wasn&#x27;t sure if the cow knew he was slaughtered.<p>Videos are generally posted by people with an axe to ground, and can never be taken in context. The process takes too long to make a good video.<p>Am I subjective? Well, yeah probably. So are you. But I suspect you would agree if you checked it out. (Note - slaughterhouses are dangerous places, and cameras are not welcome. If you do go, don&#x27;t be an idiot.)')
