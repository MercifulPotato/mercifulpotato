But for some reason I don&#x27;t see the media doing all this chatter (and Watch Dogs Legion was presented as one of the next gen games...)<p>I mean, they basically failed on the most basic feature of a game: the saving system. Game plain failed to save, had no save game button or whatsoever costing me 6 hours of gameplay or even more. Imagine getting back to a game and finding out you lost all your progress.<p>Meanwhile in Cyberpunk 2077 it&#x27;s the ocasional bug here and there, but nothing game breaking like the crybabies are saying.')
