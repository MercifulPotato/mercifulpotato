This means a vast compute power at low electrical power. An Intel CPU spends 650 pJ transporting data from RAM, and then 3 pJ doing an addition. Data IO bandwidth and latency are most of the latency.<p>Programming paradigms with map-like processing are already structured to take advantage of it. Say you hava a Big Data Spark job. Chunk your partitions to be 2GB input, 2GB output; and your mapPartitions operation would be almost free.<p>I don&#x27;t know how far they are in the deployment&#x2F;market aspect though. But if I could invest in them, I would.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.upmem.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.upmem.com&#x2F;</a>')
