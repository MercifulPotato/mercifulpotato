Item(by='Chris2048', descendants=None, kids=[25380304], score=None, time=1607620450, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25373272, text='&gt; I didn&#x27;t suggest genocide, not at all<p><pre><code>  your alternative is to eliminate a significant potion of the population\n\n  managing populations is something you do with sheep and cattle, not human beings.\n</code></pre>\nusing the word &quot;eliminate&quot; and &#x27;treating people like cattle&#x27; isn&#x27;t consistent with merely incentivising them to not have children.<p>&gt; The comment I&#x27;m responding to explicitly recommends forced reduction in fertility rates, removing agency<p>where does it? It&#x27;s a  comment previous that the same poster talks about Chinas 1cp, and as I understand it, it was implemented as a fine for having more than one child.<p>Do punitive fines, and tax&#x2F;welfare incentives&#x2F;disincentives count as being &quot;forced&quot; or &quot;non-agency&quot;?<p>&gt; Any law that tells human beings how many children they are allowed to have is fascism, yes.<p>I disagree. Point me to a commonly accepted definition of fascism that agrees, without requiring too much subjective interpretation. Anyone can have their own notion of what constitutes freedom&#x2F;oppression etc.<p>&gt; Any directive telling human beings how they have to reproduce is eugenics by definition.<p>Again, show me that definition. Most that I&#x27;ve seen limit the choice of <i>who</i> can procreate. A flat rule of 1-child applied to everyone equally doesn&#x27;t seem to apply to me as there is no differentiation based on genetics. But in any case, a rose by any other name: deciding something fits a definition doesn&#x27;t really change the semantics, so it doesn&#x27;t really make any difference, especially if you are using a special-case, or non-standard application of the definition (e.g. like arguing abortion is bad based on whether it counts as murder, or not).')
