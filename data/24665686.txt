I&#x27;m trying to come up with strategies to minimize this, which I guess is related to &quot;saying no&quot; to a lot of things.  But I&#x27;m not sure the ideal path.  Let me give some (non-work) examples:<p>I flew back from Europe on Wednesday, and the airline misplaced my luggage.  To get it back, they&#x27;ve imposed a ton of steps on ME.  &quot;Here&#x27;s your reference number.  Call our customer support in 24 hours.  Follow-up every day until you get it&quot; is what I was told (and what I&#x27;ll have to do).<p>It seems unfair that an act that was 0% my fault results in at least several hours of tasks for me.  I have to follow-up.  I have to wait on hold.  I have to spend time thinking and wondering if my luggage will ever show up.<p>How do we avoid this?  Getting angry doesn&#x27;t work (trust me, they&#x27;ve been yelled at).  Ignoring it doesn&#x27;t work - no luggage will show up.  So I guess the only real solution would be to have a personal assistant or otherwise hire someone to deal with situation like this for me?  That seems out of reach for most people.<p>All sorts of things are like that -- if someone sues you, they&#x27;ve imposed literally dozens of hours of work and thousands of dollars of expenses on you entirely without your say.  You can delegate as much as you want to a lawyer, but you&#x27;ll still need to gather documents, think about strategies, and of course pay your lawyer.<p>So how does one really truly say &quot;no&quot; to things &amp; delegate undesirable tasks unless one has enough money to afford such delegation?  I&#x27;m not sure I have a good answer to this one yet.<p>Thoughts?')
