S.1084 - DETOUR Act, introduced 2019-04-09.<p>Full text (only 1800 words!): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;bill&#x2F;116th-congress&#x2F;senate-bill&#x2F;1084&#x2F;text" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.congress.gov&#x2F;bill&#x2F;116th-congress&#x2F;senate-bill&#x2F;108...</a><p>It was written to get rid of dark patterns and deceptive interfaces. The official summary says: &quot;To prohibit the usage of exploitative and deceptive practices by large online operators and to promote consumer welfare in the use of behavioral research by such providers.&quot;<p>In my reading, the DETOUR act says that large online operators (defined as services with more than 100M monthly active users anywhere, not just in the US) may not use misleading interfaces or unclear wording to mislead the user. It also says that they can only conduct behavioral experiments (e.g. A&#x2F;B testing) if they have an independent review board registered with the FTC and have informed consent from the users as well as routine disclosure to the public of experiments being done. Finally it says that online large operators may form professional standards bodies, and that those bodies should develop on a continuing basis guidances and bright line rules for developing their technology products in a way that does not impair user autonomy or induce compulsive behavior in children.')
