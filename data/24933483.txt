So you&#x27;d think he would want to strike a blow against them by pardoning Snowden.<p>In reality, he doesn&#x27;t seem to have a deep, principled understanding of the issues of the &quot;national security&quot; apparatus (commonly known as the &quot;deep state&quot;). So I&#x27;m not optimistic, although maybe he&#x27;s just waiting until after the election.<p>What Trump&#x27;s administration is doing to Julian Assange is also quite evil (see Cassandra Fairbanks&#x27; reporting here - she&#x27;s a very clear Trump supporter and yet is highly critical of his admin with respect to their treatment of Assange). It&#x27;s not any more evil than what Biden or others would do, to be clear, so this isn&#x27;t something unique to Trump, but we can certainly say that Trump has not shown any desire to try to do the right thing here.')
