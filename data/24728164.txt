The legacy Xilinx tools (Foundation) were far from perfect but at least useable -- and hackable to a degree if you needed to implement workarounds. Those were many times even suggested by Xilinx own employees that were easy to approach and responsive back in the days.<p>Altera Quartus was always better in terms of project organization and user interface, including their hardware tools. Third party software such as Synplify (before Synopsys bought their maker Synplicity) were light-years ahead, especially on the synthesis introspection and support for design and RTL troubleshooting.<p>People tend to justify the software quality and vendor lock-in because these are niche markets. I think that is a lame statement. You could tell both Xilinx and Altera, being &quot;fabless hardware companies&quot;, treated their software departments as a necessary burden and not a critical part of their business model, which by de facto it was. The software started going downhill, progressively accumulating technical debt while it kept getting even more cryptic and expensive. I think they offshored a significant part of its maintenance in the last decade. Each release fixed bugs but astonishingly introduced very stupid new ones that a minimally decent software verification process should have caught.<p>Vivado is a mess. You can optimize your workflow digging down deeply with TCL scripts (yikes, its 2020!). However who has the time for learning their badly designed API and fighting with the quirkiness of their tools? I am amazed some of us use it in regulated environments where our tools need to be properly validated. I have had designs that take more than one day to synthesize, map and route. Having being bitten by some bugs and my own errors dealing with the cumbersome IDE, I always painfully go through all the logs of each step, and also many times recreate the project and rebuild just to check if the output is reproducible.')
