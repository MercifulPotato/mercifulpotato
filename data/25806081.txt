Maven is generally nothing more than some plugin executions with default configurations bound to specific phases.  Both `surefire` and `failsafe` plugins allow you to configure the pattern of files executed (via `includes`).  So you should be able to easily configure three executions, all with mutually-exclusive file patterns, one unit-test and two integration-tests.  And you can choose whether or not to bind them to phases or run them manually.')
