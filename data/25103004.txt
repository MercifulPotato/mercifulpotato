The problem gets even worse at bigger orgs where there&#x27;s a separate, security oriented, team which is responsible for setting&#x2F;managing IAM roles and KMS keys. I think the AWS ecosystem can be very discouraging for younger engineers in these situations. A innovative PoC in your downtime seems a lot more daunting when you need to learn about 4-5 AWS services that are unrelated to code execution and you have make a request to devops for a new IAM role just to locally test out a prototype that you built over the weekend.')
