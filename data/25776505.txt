From the few I flipped through there weren&#x27;t many ads.  Other beloved vintage magazines, like Skateboarder Magazine, are very ad heavy to support their industry.<p>Second, I feel like a magazine like this, that has good content, might actually be popular with a niche audience as a bonus with a &quot;premium subscription&quot; of another product.  Personally I prefer physical medium still, and I&#x27;m sure diehard fans of any niche would be interested in something to hold and collect.')
