No matter how we evaluate people, we are prone to biases, and things like diversity and affirmative actions (whether you disagree with it or not) add another layer of complexity to the process.<p>I like the idea from the powerball revolution epsiode of Revisionist History (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;revisionisthistory.com&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;44-the-powerball-revolution" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;revisionisthistory.com&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;44-the-powerball-revo...</a>). Why not have some filter to get the top students in to a pool, then randomly select them? I mean there are more qualified students than there are slots, so it&#x27;s only &quot;fair&quot; if each of them get the same chance. No politics - just a pure number game at that point. You can argue the filter could create a disadvantage to poor students etc..., but you can adjust that in ways that the initial pool of potential applicants will be even.<p>Of course when I mention the concept of randomly selecting a candidate, it makes people real uncomfortable :)')
