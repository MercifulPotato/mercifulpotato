The leadership of CD Projekt Red was saying the game was done and playable in January and only needed polish. Employees inside the company knew that was a lie.<p>&gt; Now, CD Projekt Red employees want to know why management led them down the wrong path and whether all that work was worth it. On the call, one employee reportedly asked why leadership said the game was &quot;complete and playable&quot; in January, even though that wasn&#x27;t true. The company said it would &quot;take responsibility,&quot; without elaborating. Another employee allegedly asked whether it&#x27;s hypocritical for CD Projekt Red to make a game about corporations exploiting human beings while the company itself was pushing its employees well past their limits.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.svg.com&#x2F;298958&#x2F;cyberpunk-2077-devs-take-management-to-task-over-botched-launch&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.svg.com&#x2F;298958&#x2F;cyberpunk-2077-devs-take-manageme...</a>')
