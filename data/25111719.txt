It feels like now their is enough data on cases, broken down by age, where you can assess your own risk.<p>If you are under 25, the risk to you from Covid is basically tiny. I can understand young people not accepting having their life destroyed from living under a lockdown over a virus that is unlikely to do them harm.<p>In Scotland<p><pre><code>            Infections       Hospitalization     Deaths\n    0-4      1,137             62                  0\n    5-14     2,973             30                  0\n    15-19    6,771             41                  0\n    20-24    7,896             65                  1\n\n</code></pre>\nI think we need something smarter than a blanket lockdown that affects everyone the same regardless of age.

We are destroying peoples lives, income and mental health when for the majority of them there is no risk.')
