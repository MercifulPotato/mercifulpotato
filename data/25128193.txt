Dark mode screenshots are the first thing you&#x27;ll see when you go looking for how IDEA looks today.  It looks like a dark version of the UI from 5 years ago, unsurprisingly.  Which means it still looks about as out of place as any Electron app.  Although one would hope they&#x27;ve dealt with the bad antialiasing by now.  Hard to say without downloading and running it, but the continued lack of polish and past propensity to pass the buck makes one question, &quot;why bother?&quot;<p>&gt; As for how it looks, well, it&#x27;s an IDE.<p>Not sure what this is supposed to mean.
