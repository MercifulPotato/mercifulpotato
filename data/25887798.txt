On skin you get very smooth gradients at the edge of clipped areas and the highlight reconstruction is particularly free of artifacts.<p>But that needs to be brought into a reasonable brightness range for output. The tone mapping from the film simulation works well on skin to preserve color when darkening highlights.<p>That particular photo has both the blue and green color channels clipped, but the red channel let Filmulator reconstruct plausible data flawlessly. Here&#x27;s the raw histogram from that file: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;NLZeM5h.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;NLZeM5h.png</a>')
