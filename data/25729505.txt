That is a lot.  If you are able to do that as a 22-year-old entering the job market, good for you.  It&#x27;s unrealistic for the vast majority of people.<p>The average savings rate in the US is about 7%.  &quot;Bob&quot; managed 30%+ in the most important (read: earliest) years, allowing it to compound for a long time.  His savings was front-loaded.  This is not normal.  Most people don&#x27;t start saving anything of significance until they are into their 40s.<p>&gt;<i>And you missed the point that this is the worst you could do.</i><p>You missed my point that this isn&#x27;t nearly &quot;the worst you could do&quot;.  This fictional person started with incredibly privileged circumstances:  A substantial windfall, apparently no debt, apparently a great job straight out of college, that allowed them to <i>invest</i> significant funds very early in their career.<p>The unrealistic investing scenario is countered by the unrealistic saving ability.  Not a particularly valuable thought experiment.<p>And, once again, I don&#x27;t disagree with the premise: save what you can and invest it in a diversified portfolio and allow it to compound over your life.  This is the best option for 99.9% of the population.  But, it also doesn&#x27;t guarantee a comfortable retirement for that 99.9%, which is scary.')
