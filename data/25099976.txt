I kind of have it all, except for total freedom. I really have nothing to complain about and my life is great.<p>Still, there was this time when I had nothing but a bicycle with four panniers of things for several months, wasn&#x27;t sure where I&#x27;d sleep next, had to withstand cold and rain, and it was easily the singular best experience of my life. I&#x27;m not in a situation to repeat that now. Also I fear I wouldn&#x27;t have the right mindset to repeat that - I&#x27;ve become lazy and complacent.')
