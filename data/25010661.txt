For instance, if you remember a few years back, Cheerios had a commercial with an interracial couple, and they got a lot of complaints about it.  I don&#x27;t think anybody said that the people complaining didn&#x27;t feel passionately that their cause was legitimate.  However, that fact does not mean that others need to treat that cause as equal in legitimacy to the cause that people of different races may marry, and those marriages may be displayed in commercials.  And absolutely, there are cases where both sides are legitimate.  But we do not need to treat all cases like that, even if some are.  We don&#x27;t need to be full-on cultural relativists.')
