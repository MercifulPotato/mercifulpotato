It makes sense that in 2016 the board would see a significant raise for however long their next contract is. I doubt this trend continues after 2018, when the sale of Yahoo saw a huge drop in revenue. They likely should have judged more on market share, but it&#x27;s a fairly understandable move.<p>Also, that huge spike on the chart was roughly $4.5 million of the over $100 million in increased revenue.')
