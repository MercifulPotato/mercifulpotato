Item(by='Rusky', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603294490, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24845755, text='Going back to my original answer, the difference lies in what the two languages ask of the linker under normal circumstances.<p>Normal, non-FFI-using C++ can hit ODR violations in response to things like typos or subtle mis-uses of `inline` and templates.<p>Normal, non-FFI-using Rust is designed such that these situations never come up.<p>My original comment was never talking about FFI in the first place, where <i>yes</i>, both languages are much more at the mercy of what the platform provides. However, in that case the spooky UB ODR violations I was referring to are also not relevant, because you just get normal, fully-defined platform behavior- the expectations of the compiler (and thus the chances for them to be violated, resulting in UB), are different.')
