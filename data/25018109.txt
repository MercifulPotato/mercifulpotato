There&#x27;s always been a component of politics that&#x27;s tribal in nature, and it takes a lot to overcome that inertia. It&#x27;s not unlike sports, where people will root for the local team, even though there&#x27;s not much that&#x27;s local about the team other than the name.<p>You can see that behavior for example around the ACA. It&#x27;s obviously inspired by Mitt Romney&#x27;s Massachusetts health care reform, so you&#x27;d think the Republicans would be all in favor of it. Yet at the federal level, since it was pitched by the Democrats, the Republicans are against it.')
