It&#x27;s also fair for you to note that correlation isn&#x27;t causation, and the cause (or causes) could be other things, such as the age of the regime. To which others could rebut further (e.g., this isn&#x27;t the 18th or 19th century any more &#x2F; genocide and ethnic violence are now exceptional &#x2F; there are lots of countries to model oneself after; a young government could be &quot;forgiven&quot; for violations by rogue officers or soldiers but atrocities perpetrated under communist governments are routinely top-down policy; etc). This is reasonable debate and it&#x27;s how we understand and solve issues collectively. Analysis like this is exactly the opposite of &quot;muddying the waters&quot;.')
