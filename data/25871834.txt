When my daughter was younger I would take summers off, to spend more time with her.  Now that she&#x27;s older, and not so interested in spending all day with her dad (sniff, but I think I was the same way at her age), I continue to do it because it gives me several months per year off, and also results in greater variability in what I&#x27;m working on.<p>If I just quit my job once or twice a year, after being hired as a &quot;permanent&quot; employee, after a while my resume would start to look like a warning sign.  Why can&#x27;t this guy keep a job?  But as a contractor, it&#x27;s normal and expected.')
