We are aligned on many areas relating to the business but, as you can imagine, we don’t align perfectly all the time. Usually we can work it out but not always.<p>Example: Our company is a small retail business in my hometown. I want it to be more than that and my wife would be happy if we kept things the same, so long as finances allow (they should, barring some unforeseen catastrophe).<p>So we are aligned on nearly every “important” aspect of the work except this one. It’s tough because one of us either has to become aligned with the other’s views, or has to work without that alignment if that’s not possible.<p>I feel very privileged to have this kind of problem as opposed to not being able to pay the bills etc, but it still feels bad at times. I think that’s life though, where you need some of the bad to appreciate the good.')
