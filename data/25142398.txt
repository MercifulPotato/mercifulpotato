I&#x27;ll admit I haven&#x27;t read the article though, because I am constitutionally opposed to learning about shows that show Americans going to Paris and wearing berets.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3rDjPLvOShM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3rDjPLvOShM</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=9pxK5Dztte8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=9pxK5Dztte8</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=6qGiXY1SB68" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=6qGiXY1SB68</a>')
