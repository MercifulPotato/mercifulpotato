Who sues me? And how many felonies do they commit in building their case against me?<p>In other words, there&#x27;s a catch-22 in how strict we are about the definition of <i>effective</i> protection. 99% of the public won&#x27;t even open their browser tools so I guess if youtube-dl is put behind some very generously documented JavaScript that is easily bypassed then it is not actually out in public because it is <i>effectively</i> DRM protected, right?')
