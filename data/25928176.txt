Even avowed socialists will sharply disagree on what forms of government &#x27;count as socialism&#x27;.<p>For example: was the USSR socialist? That&#x27;s the common understanding, but plenty of socialists disagree, arguing that socialism means that workers own the means of production, and that in the USSR, workers didn&#x27;t <i>really</i> own the factories, not in any meaningful sense, since at the end of the day they were under central government control.')
