AC systems are not DIY. The things you&#x27;re looking for exist \n(and are often mandatory) in the commercial&#x2F; non-residential market, but they are not IoT, and they aren&#x27;t cheap. For instance, most commercial spaces have a MAX value on percentage of recycled air; a minimum amount of air fed into the return must be fresh air drawn from outside.<p>&gt;should be able to cheaply add networked sensors, fans, filters, and vents<p>Sensors can be ok... But your homes&#x27;s AC design, even if based on simple building code lookups, is based on some fairy complex engineering which rely on certain assumptions.<p>If those assumptions aren&#x27;t met, the design usually must be approved by a licensed engineer. This is why you don&#x27;t see more independently controlled vents on the market. No professional is going to install products that don&#x27;t meet code, unless an engineer has stamped the plans. (Which includes operational logic.)<p>Ignoring regulations, you shouldn&#x27;t just add controlled vents to a system (or manually close existing vents) without compensating for that elsewhere. You likely need a variable speed blower, controlled&#x2F;compensated return air flow, and system logic to control it all.<p>Will the house blow up if you install them yourself? Probably not. But it could result in a system operating much less efficiently, increase the number of system cycles (reducing system lifetime), cause duct ruptures&#x2F;leaks due to increased back pressure, and most likely, cause condensation in places other than the condenser, possibly causing mold to grow and&#x2F;or rot.<p>Which leaves 2 options: installing a commercial system with the integrated vent control you&#x27;re looking for, or adding sensors for input for when the system should run, without modification. Biggest simple change you can make for immediate impact? Change your filters <i>every month</i>, even if it means using 12 $3 fiberglass filters instead of 1 $36 hepa filter.<p>For instance, I run a list of room temps through a simple max function to ensure my AC and&#x2F;or blower runs until the hottest room falls below the set temperature.<p>If this results in wildly unbalanced temps throughout the house, you have a bigger issue, and likely need your system resized&#x2F;adjusted by a professional.<p>Related, and because most people don&#x27;t realize it, your AC is an engine. You want it properly sized and to run constant, when needed. Think of your car: is it more efficient to make a trip by many intermittent 100mph sprints, or driving 55mph without stopping.<p>Multi stage compressors now act like car transmissions to dynamically &quot;size&quot; the system as needed, but run constantly with minimal stopping.')
