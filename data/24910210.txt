I&#x27;ve implemented versions of both paxos and raft, and by golly was the latter more difficult to get right.<p>Could you clarify what you mean? &quot;Paxos&quot; as defined in the literature (and as presented in this article) is a single-shot consensus algorithm. Raft is a leader-based replicated state machine. They are not comparable at all and it&#x27;s not surprising if you find Raft more difficult.<p>However, in practice, when people say &quot;Paxos&quot; they usually mean some variant of MultiPaxos and &quot;Raft vs Paxos&quot; is typically interpreted as &quot;Raft vs MultiPaxos&quot;. It&#x27;s also well-established that MultiPaxos and Raft have roughly the same complexity.')
