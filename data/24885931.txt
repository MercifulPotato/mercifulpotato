Insanity and lack of healthy human thinking. The whole company should be taken over by normal people who understands the impact and responsibilities of a service like Facebook.\nThe business model have to be changed back to what it suppose to be: a sharing platform for friends and family. Not an ads driven morally ill platform.\nBest would be to forbid the entire platform. I am pushing various people here in the EU to move towards that direction.')
