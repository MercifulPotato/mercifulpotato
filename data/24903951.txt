But to the extent that the percept of ringing comes from recurrently firing ensembles in the brain, than neuromodulation techniques may bring relief from the perceptual aspects.<p>TMS seems modestly promising for tinnitus, but experiments thus far have been poorly controlled so hard to tell: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-019-48750-9" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-019-48750-9</a><p>Our lab has done work with using optogenetics for inhibiting neural activity, and I wonder if the inhibition approach might be better than disruption. It’s a bit hard to figure how TMS does inhibition vs excitation, even with electrical stimulation it’s complicated and varies by celltype!')
