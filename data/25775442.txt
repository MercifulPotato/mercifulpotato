It&#x27;s inherent in the design of the X protocol.<p>There are solutions that are intended to force the sandboxing by opening a new Xserver for every application, e.g. Firejail [0], but that comes with another set of interoperability problems.<p>Wayland was supposed to address some of these concerns, but it will only do so for applications that natively talk wayland protocol, not the ones that connect through x-protocol via xwayland<p>[0]  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firejail.wordpress.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firejail.wordpress.com&#x2F;</a>')
