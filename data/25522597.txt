SIP just defines a set of actions that Apple thinks no user, including root, should ever be able to perform.</i><p>I agree with Apple here.<p>&gt; <i>Consequently, disabling SIP empowers root users to do whatever they want, without Apple having a say in the matterâ€”but you&#x27;re still protected by the standard UNIX permission system.</i><p>It also empowers malware. The Creative Cloud, for example, installs as root and installs admin-permissioned services.   The standard POSIX permissions system is crap, and SIP is a huge improvement and valuable tool against malware.')
