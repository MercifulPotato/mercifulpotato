Unemployment Insurance programs send out checks each month to 2.1 million people. In other countries, the government, in addition to paying these kinds of old-age, disability, and unemployment benefits, also pays out a monthly benefit to every child. In the US that would mean checks going out to the families of around 74 million children.<p>&gt; None of this leads to any inflation problems because, as mentioned in the very first section above, taxes are used to fund these programs, just as they would be for any other permanent welfare state expansion.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.peoplespolicyproject.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;18&#x2F;understanding-claims-about-basic-income-and-inflation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.peoplespolicyproject.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;18&#x2F;understandin...</a>')
