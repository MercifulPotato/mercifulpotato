It&#x27;s currently cheaper to wire money than to send some ETH.<p>Wrong. If all you wish for Christmas is to send some ETH, look no further than into ZK-Rollups such as zkSync &amp; Loopring.<p>1) A transfer costs around $0.01 in fees.<p>2) ZK-Rollups are <i>not sidechains</i>. These are layer 2 solutions that settle on Ethereum with a novel trust model of 1-of-N: you only need to trust that a single node is honest!<p>3) Exchanges (such as Coinbase) would eventually support depositing&#x2F;withdrawing to a rollup, which means most folks would never need to interact the expensive base layer directly.<p>Sending money across countries has never been cheaper, faster &amp; as secure as it is now on an Ethereum ZK-Rollup.')
