And to keep people from abusing the obvious issues, it needs to be available at a reasonable cost relative to its price when originally released, or the copyright renewal needs to have an exponentially growing fee.<p>I&#x27;ve also been considering what it means if copyright was to assure something for the public good whether there shouldn&#x27;t be some kind of enforced escrow of the source. Having the copyright expire on the binaries does nothing if no one hid a copy of the source away in their shoebox.')
