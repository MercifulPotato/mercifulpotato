If something like this actually happened, then it would hardly be insane to consider it your patriotic duty to put a stop to it.<p>The metaphor is overused as hell, but it is apt: Trump shouted &quot;fire&quot; in a crowded theatre, and now he&#x27;s acting all surprised that a few people got trampled in the rush to get out.<p>Anybody who believes him at this point obviously has brain worms, but being a notorious liar doesn&#x27;t exempt you from libel and sedition laws. It is also irrelevant whether the mob sincerely believes the election was stolen, or whether they&#x27;re using it as an excuse; slander is still slander.<p>[1]: Using ad-tech to manipulate the way people vote, as the Cambridge Analytica conspiracy theory alleges, is not falsification.')
