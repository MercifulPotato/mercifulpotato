Can&#x27;t be an editorial and have liability protection.<p>The entire point of section 230 is to enable editorial control so long  as you aren&#x27;t the content creator&#x2F;submitter without the kinds of civil liability tied to “publisher” status otherwise, for both platforms and users on those platforms who are empowered to act in ways which have editorial impact.<p>And a one-sentence “you can&#x27;t do X and Y” isn&#x27;t really a substantive argument against Section 230.')
