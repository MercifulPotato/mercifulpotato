This seems closer to an HPC problem, not a &quot;cloud&quot; problem.<p>Related comment from 6 months ago about Kubernetes use cases: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lobste.rs&#x2F;s&#x2F;kx1jj4&#x2F;what_has_your_experience_with_kubernetes#c_qonwag" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lobste.rs&#x2F;s&#x2F;kx1jj4&#x2F;what_has_your_experience_with_kub...</a><p>Summary: scale has at least 2 different meanings.  Scaling in resources doesn&#x27;t really mean you need Kubernetes.  Scaling in terms of workload diversity is a better use case for it.<p>Kubernetes is basically a knockoff of Borg, but Borg is designed (or evolved) to run diverse services (search, maps, gmail, etc.;  batch and low latency).  Ironically most people who run their own Kube clusters don&#x27;t seem to have much workload diversity.<p>On the other hand, HPC is usually about scaling in terms of resources: running a few huge jobs on many nodes.  A single job will occupy an entire node (and thousands of nodes), which is what&#x27;s happening here.<p>I&#x27;ve never used these HPC systems but it looks like they are starting to run on the cloud.  Kubernetes may still have been a defensible choice for other reasons, but as someone who used Borg for a long time, it&#x27;s weird what it&#x27;s turned into.  Sort of like protobufs now have a weird &quot;reflection service&quot;.
