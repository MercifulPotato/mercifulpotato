People don&#x27;t want faster cars , or they&#x27;d buy them, but boy do they want to entertain themselves and overcommunicate with their circle through their phones.<p>They may not even want self-driving cars. If 40% work remotely , driving becomes a leasurely activity, so maybe improving communication networks is more important than adding computers to cars.<p>Tons of airlines and tour operators are going bankrupt with the pandemic in europe. The tourism bubble was a hugely wasteful treadmill perpetuated by people forced live in tiny spaces in expensive cities. Airlines didn&#x27;t want faster or bigger planes, they wanted cheaper airports.<p>Surely COVID was a great accelerator for trends that preexisted. Biotech seems the biggest winner, not because it accelerated discovery, but because it removed regulatory hurdles. It remains to be seen how effective the change will be, as the vaccines haven&#x27;t yet been rolled out. OTOH technologies like VR don&#x27;t seem to be going anywhere despite being heavily pushed.')
