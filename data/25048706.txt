It compiles and runs native on macOS, the documentation is superb. You just let the Qt people worry about the Cocoa, Quartz etc. interface.<p>As a bonus, it will also run on Windows, Linux, Android, iOS.<p>Qt looks like an &quot;operating system&quot;. It isn&#x27;t really an O&#x2F;S, it feeds off the underlying O&#x2F;S, but to the applications programmer, it completely subsumes the O&#x2F;S.<p>We converted a 500KLOC Win32 app to Qt (and macOS), and there is not <i>one single</i> Win32 API call left, except for an obscure font enumeration thing because we wanted to stay with our own PDF code instead of using Qt&#x27;s.')
