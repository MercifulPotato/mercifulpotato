Do school fights still happen? Circa 12-15 years old, these were a normal part of being a boy. There was even a spot outside the school where boys waited for other boys they wanted to fight. Several boys would be there on any given day. There were enough fights that everyone knew where everyone stood in the &quot;rankings.&quot; Who you could beat and who you couldn&#x27;t... says a lot considering how fast kids grow at that age.<p>I didn&#x27;t go to a very violent school, and fights got rarer as age made them more serious. My parents also treated it as normal. They didn&#x27;t encourage it, but it wasn&#x27;t a major outrage. Schools too. A note to parents or somesuch minor penalty was the usual recourse.')
