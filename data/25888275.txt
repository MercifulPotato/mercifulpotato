I once pulled up 27 times having 27-28% of fat being 38 years old, weighting 115 kg, which is about as much as I pulled up at my 18yo with 72 kg of body weight and god knows fat percentage (I had sixpack at the time, so it is 10% or less).<p>3% of fat is death low (thanks to Nazis to find that). To keep anything less than 10% for prolonged time takes very calculated effort or young age and high activity. It is very hard to go lower than 15% for normal men.')
