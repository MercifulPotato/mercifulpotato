We have good data on this. Factory shifts circa 1900 were long, and 2-day weekends rare.<p>Unless &quot;centuries ago&quot; means several centuries, in which case maybe it&#x27;s murkier, the pre-industrial world was different. IIRC hours worked increased in the pre-industrial build-up to the revolution -- perhaps because there was more to buy, and people adjusted to try to buy things, rather than stopping when they had enough to eat.')
