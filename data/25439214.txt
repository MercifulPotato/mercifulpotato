I use an Nvidia Shield to play it on my TV. I&#x27;ve never had any problems with the streaming quality or latency. I could see that depending on location though, I&#x27;m playing in West Coast Canada. Some of the games I&#x27;ve been disappointed with the performance, Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey for instance couldn&#x27;t hit 60 fps even after lowering the graphic settings. Cyberpunk 2077 has been amazing though, high fps and maxed settings, including ray tracing.<p>A few other things of note. 1080p is the max resolution. Unlimited Internet is probably a requirement as its about 10gb per hour. After 6 hours the session ends and you need to save and relaunch the game. Your entire Steam library is not available, its up to publishers to allow their games on it.')
