I have no problem saying that my impression could be wrong. But based on the limited evidence I have available, that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m at with it at the moment.<p>[1]: I don&#x27;t typically hang out with billionaires or anything. The only reason I&#x27;ve met Cuban is because he was once a keynote speaker at an event I attended. After his speech he hung out with the hoi polloi and mingled and interacted with people. I spent maybe 3 minutes chatting with him personally about my business, and maybe another 10-15 minutes listening to him talk to a small crowd that gathered around him. To be fair, that encounter probably went as far in shaping my impression of him as anything. I think the single biggest thing was that he displayed no condescension or smug superiority or anything towards people who weren&#x27;t on his financial level. He was respectful, attentive, and reasonable even when talking with some rando like me.')
