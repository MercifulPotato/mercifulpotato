I would have loved to be fully remote in my early 20s, free to travel and not focus purely on work. sure it was great for my career, but work isn&#x27;t living.<p>sure, a ton of people hate working from home. some personalities and roles require in-person interaction. most people never considered wfh when choosing their apartment or house and don&#x27;t have good setups. meanwhile, there are also a ton of people, like me, who have always _hated_ going into the office. being constantly distracted by coworkers, dealing with long commutes, and putting up with uncomfortable and loud offices.<p>yes, people need social interaction, but that doesn&#x27;t have to come from coworkers. it is a very SF mindset to build your entire life around your work.. being in the office all day and most of your &quot;friends&quot; are coworkers.')
