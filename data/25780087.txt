Popular culture makes it popular to treat education as pointless, and this even affects students who are pursuing difficult degrees.  &quot;Why do I need to study humanities?  Why should I learn to code if I think I am born to be someone else&#x27;s boss?&quot;<p>On the other hand, many teachers in K12 and early university have no ability to connect the &quot;what&quot; with the &quot;why.&quot;  &quot;The curriculum is the curriculum.
