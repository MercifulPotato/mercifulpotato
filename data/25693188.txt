Item(by='idolaspecus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610151695, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25691912, text='DISCLAIMER: I think Trump is essentially diabolical, do not support him nor his behavior, and have a visceral loathing for the man and his (lack of) ideas.<p>This is a grossly opportunistic instance of moral signaling from Twitter. I believe this <i>independent of whether or not I believe they should ban him</i>. Trump&#x27;s behavior hasn&#x27;t changed, his tweets are not more inflammatory than they&#x27;ve been in the past, and his influence is trending towards zero. They banned him as a moral signal at a time when the backlash they&#x27;ll experience is at a minimum.<p>Twitter is a shit storm and has been for years. They know it, we know it, the public knows it, everybody knows it. If Twitter actually cared about not being a Platform For Evil, they would just turn off the fucking angry echo chamber push algorithms, take a massive hit in their stock price, and be about their business. The &quot;social utility&quot; would be the same and we wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about conspiratorial asshats going viral and reaching 50 million souls. But instead they go on burning the public good to fuel their money-printing machine and then crucify the enemy to signal their virtue when the wealth well dries up.')
