Or&#x2F;and was it to protect against &quot;insiders&quot;? (say, someone in the staff got bribed, or a janitor or some other 3rd party person?)<p>I wonder how they got data out from those computers? If by connecting to a printer, to print on paper, then, was that via a cable? Was the printer connected to any network? Hmm but you wrote that this was before the Internet, so, then, maybe only an intranet? and no wifi, only cables?<p>Maybe they copied data in text files on floppy disks?<p>What do they do instead nowadays, if you happen to know?<p>&gt; <i>The very real threat were people trying to locate young victims taken into care etc</i><p>Who are the people who want to do such things? Was it the same underlying reason as this time — extortion and making money? Or something else? If it&#x27;s okay to ask &#x2F; if you happen to know')
