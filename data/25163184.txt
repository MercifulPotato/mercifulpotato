Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=[25164466], score=None, time=1605896167, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25160497, text='<i>&gt; The problem with echo chambers is the bias.</i><p>I would say the problem with echo chambers is that only one viewpoint is ever expressed at all. Everyone has biases; it&#x27;s impossible to have a forum free from bias. But if people can express different viewpoints, each with their own different biases, at least people get to hear different viewpoints and different biases from their own.<p>There is a stronger condition one could make, that to not be an echo chamber, discussions in the forum actually have to change some people&#x27;s minds during the discussion, at least some of the time. By that criterion, it&#x27;s true that I can think of very few online discussions I&#x27;ve ever seen that weren&#x27;t echo chambers. I think that criterion is too strong because it&#x27;s very hard for people to change their minds at short notice, so I normally don&#x27;t expect to change people&#x27;s minds during a particular conversation. If something I post plants a seed in someone&#x27;s mind that only bears fruit much later, I would still count that as a win--but of course I&#x27;ll probably never know if that happens, so there&#x27;s no real way of gathering evidence on such an effect, if it exists.<p><i>&gt; the next time you see an article on climate change. Post in there the opposing viewpoint</i><p>I&#x27;ve run this experiment many times on HN. The results have been mixed. I&#x27;ve had some posts downvoted to oblivion and I&#x27;ve had some actual discussions. I will concede that I don&#x27;t think any of those discussions have changed anyone&#x27;s mind. However, I don&#x27;t think things are any worse in that respect now than in the past; it&#x27;s always been hard for we humans to change our minds.')
