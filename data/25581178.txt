Is not war a collective &quot;enforcement&quot; of violence? So much so that the masses have become numb and&#x2F;or blind to war? Why is the USA _so much_ more violent? Because we have more guns? Point being, let&#x27;s be clear, violence takes many forms.<p>- What if there are long term effects? What if the children of a player of violent video games are more effected? Maybe the parents are less likely to discipline for acts of toddler violence? What happens when that child grows up?<p>- The study looked at a particular group of kids, _10 y&#x2F;o and up_. In terms of development, that&#x27;s relatively late. The affect of violence on say 5 y&#x2F;o&#x27;s could be different, perhaps very.<p>- It&#x27;s important to note that this &quot;study&quot; made no mention - at least in the non-pay material available about sample size. How they assessed violence vs non, and so on. The data collected also appears to be self-reported. Read: red flag.
