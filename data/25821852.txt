I&#x27;ve read papers about COVID that were not merely wrong but deliberatively deceptive, and they haven&#x27;t been retracted. Public health research just has a huge problem with bad papers, and it&#x27;s not one they&#x27;re admitting to.<p>Secondly, have you actually read the criticisms? A big part of it is that the Drosten protocol appears to have been published via a journal that he himself controls, hence the 24 hour submission-to-publication turnaround time. Obviously if that is true the paper will never be retracted, thus using lack of retraction as a way to attack the critics is circular; the non-independence of the publication path is itself a part of their criticism.<p>Thirdly, I read the criticism. A few things were indeed quibbly and didn&#x27;t seem that important, others were not good but perhaps understandable if you make allowances for extreme speed. Other criticisms were highly substantive. But this may depend on your pre-existing value system. A critical problem with PCR testing is the way the people behind it appear to consider false positives either non-existent or entirely free: it&#x27;s clear that everything about these testing programmes is designed to maximize positive results at all costs. They&#x27;re terrified of false negatives but don&#x27;t care about FPs at all. That isn&#x27;t excusable.<p>Finally, w.r.t. &quot;more test procedures&quot;, they all seem to have very similar reliability problems that are dismissed with circular logic of the form, &quot;COVID is anyone who tests positive, therefore there are no false positives&quot; or &quot;A PCR positive means it detected RNA, and PCR is the most sensitive way to detect RNA, therefore if RNA is present you get a PCR positive, therefore the test works fine&quot;, all of which is entirely blind to the way it&#x27;s being used in the real world.<p><i>There&#x27;s a radical fringe which for some unexplained reason are both radically anti-science and heavily invested in trying to produce and use fraudulent pseudo-scientific work to attack scientific findings they find politically inconvenient, as a kind of Trojan horse based on appeals to authority</i><p>Yes, that fringe is called the public health establishment.')
