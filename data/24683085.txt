If you get dense enough (e.g. 8-story apartment blocks) you&#x27;d need a pretty big septic field right next to the housing. Now that&#x27;s land you can&#x27;t use for housing or offices. At some point it&#x27;s more cost-effective to whisk that waste away to some low-value land to do the processing.<p>I don&#x27;t know at what level of density that&#x27;s true, though. It could be pretty high.')
