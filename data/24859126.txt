Often the only times incentives are possible are because of severely slumped sales of a model, usually the only time you&#x27;ll see those kinds of numbers off on a car is if it&#x27;s an older MY or otherwise definitely on it&#x27;s way out of the lineup.<p>SUVs and Trucks have historically been priced higher, with larger margins. The Automakers can give nice looking discounts to prospective buyers while still making more money.<p>&gt; It used to be just American car manufacturers that did that, but it happened to me when I went to a Honda dealership looking for a Fit, which they didn&#x27;t have new because the factory washed out, but here we have 20 CR-Vs from the same factory on sale, why not take one of them?<p>The Fit was assembled in Mexico; my gut says the new trade agreement made it unprofitable to continue selling under that setup (possibly foreign parts content?)<p>The other thing to note; It&#x27;s a lot easier to fit a battery pack in an SUV than a car, doubly so when we consider these manufacturers are likely looking to retrofit existing unibody designs to electric if they can.')
