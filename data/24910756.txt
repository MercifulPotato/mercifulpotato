The circles are much more dynamic than Spotify playlists. I can react to and discuss songs with friends and have multiple circles for different themes and friends groups. I also love the cross-platform functionality. Now I can post and listen to acoustic covers only available on youtube seamlessly with my Spotify tracks, and even see the video natively in MusFuse!')
