Warmer outside, faster to heat inside.<p>But there’s no way to tell the system - I want 72 at 8am, you work it out.  So <i>I</i> need to see if tomorrow morning will be 30 or 50 outside and set the start time accordingly.  That’s not smart.<p>Heat pumps aren’t great at large changes anyway, but even 68 to 70 or 72 would work for me<p>And I also want that inside temperature to be based on the rooms I expect to use at those times:  Night time, bedroom.  Daytime, living room. Ecobee has exactly this function, Trane&#x2F;Nexia does not')
