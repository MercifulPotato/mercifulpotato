It would drastically reduce their user base but it might just be better for society as bot accounts would be difficult to make, younger children with responsible parents won&#x27;t be able to join (it&#x27;s a monstrous website that is full of  frauds, conspiracy theorists etc and children shouldn&#x27;t use it IMO ).<p>I know it&#x27;s wishful thinking.')
