And perhaps they use the address for adtech purposes. But I don&#x27;t know for sure.<p>It’s a lot like having a physical address which is used as a core part of meatspace identity management.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d love to hear from such sites about how they use customer email. If it&#x27;s not primarily for communication, it may not make sense to accommodate it in TMTP.<p>A shared unique identifier (value for user is that it is consistent across services).<p>A means of authentication when primary auth (password) cant be used (company sends links etc).<p>1-1 channel of communication (notifications of activity or changes in a service).<p>Obviously, it’s just my opinion, but making a new messaging protocol won’t fix email. My hunch is that is because email’s primary purpose (to the end user) is not to provide a messaging channel but to provide an identity.')
