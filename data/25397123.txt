Item(by='senko', descendants=None, kids=[25398337, 25397211], score=None, time=1607766837, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25384582, text='The way I - a non-designer - understand this, these flow cards are not wireframes as such, where the intention would be to structure the information&#x2F;content presented to the user on a page.<p>Instead, I view these as basically standardized &quot;icons&quot; - a visual language - with each depicting a function&#x2F;meaning of one page (or step) in a flow. For example, you could have a &quot;landing page&quot; flow card, &quot;account login&quot; flow card, &quot;home dashboard&quot; home card, depicting the user flow when accessing their account.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter what the actual wireframe layout is at that point, as this is for a step <i>before</i> that, where you want to see what are the steps the user follows to do a specific thing.<p>I might be completely off the mark here, but if that&#x27;s the intention: preparing a smaller, well defined and <i>named</i> set of cards, basically designing a language for this, would be clearer. As a non-designer, mixing the semantic value of the cards (if understood as icons) and the actual layout on each of the card (a step toward wireframing) makes it more confusing. Limiting the number of choices would force the designer(s)&#x2F;stakeholders to focus on the meaning, not the mechanics.')
