Item(by='brundolf', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609861591, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25646029, text='Same here; coffee has never made me feel generally &quot;bad&quot; in any way that I can detect. I drink several cups a day - sometimes (not usually) as late as 5 or 6pm - and sleep like a baby anyway. I haven&#x27;t ever given it up completely, but I did cut down to a single (8oz) cup first thing in the morning for a little while. The only noticeable effect was - as you said - the coffee I did drink had more of a punch than before. I didn&#x27;t feel like I had more or less energy overall; I certainly didn&#x27;t notice anything like &quot;skin greasiness&quot; before or after.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that it affects people so differently. It takes a whole lot of coffee for me to even feel jittery; most of the time it&#x27;s just a pleasant boost of emotional energy. Like an anti-depressant. I feel excited about life and ready to go dive into it. That&#x27;s the main reason I drink it most days; not to keep myself awake. It just feels good, seemingly without downsides.')
