Not sure why.<p>2. The chrome.storage (or is it only storage.sync? can’t recall) API doesn’t work when the extension is loaded temporarily (since there’s no stable extension ID assigned or something), which is how `web-ext run` loads the extension, and the only way I could find to test the extension without submitting it to Mozilla for signing. Yeah I tweaked all the related settings in Firefox Developer Edition but couldn’t for the life of me figure out how to non-temporarily install my unsigned extension. So in the end I just gave up on testing the part of the extension that used chrome.storage, which was like 75% of the extension. A really hostile experience that will make sure I don’t port my extensions to Firefox in the future.')
