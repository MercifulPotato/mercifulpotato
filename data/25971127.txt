We &quot;lose&quot; our keys.<p>&quot;Smothered&quot; or &quot;Cast away&quot; might be better terms. Like what we&#x27;re doing to beaches with plastic. We worked hard to create what blocks out the stars and covers the sands, as well as much of our other connections to once pristine nature. We know when we launch satellites, build smokestacks, drive where we could walk, and choose to fly.<p>We can fool ourselves that we didn&#x27;t know, but as Feynman said, &quot;The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.&quot;, but also &quot;Reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.&quot;')
