Window layout savers have very little recognition logic when restoring window placements, and of course they don&#x27;t restore internal state like auto-refresh and scroll position. Chrome by default doesn&#x27;t restore pop-up windows, while non-popup windows have too much of a GUI visible and I wasn&#x27;t able to find an add-on that can do this.<p>I would probably be better off writing a browser extension, but I&#x27;m not that proficient in that, so for now am going with making a browser by integrating Microsoft&#x27;s new embedded Chromium-based browser.')
