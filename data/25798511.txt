(Not to be confused with the “+=“ operator, which also concatenates paths, but with subtly different behavior.)<p>Why did the division symbol get chosen for a concatenation behavior, of all things? Well, I suppose because it looks kind of like how we write paths with slashes, e.g. “dir&#x2F;subdir&#x2F;etc”. While I understand how this might be fun aesthetically once you already know the types involved, I find this completely opposite-than-numeric behavior here to be quite ambiguous and unintuitive.')
