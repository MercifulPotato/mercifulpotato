It provides a place for disgruntled employees to vent, and vent they do. It doesn&#x27;t matter how much truth is in the posts; Glassdoor will stand behind it because ultimately, they want you to pay them to &quot;clean it up,&quot; and most do. Companies try to compete with it by offering &quot;incentives&quot; or pushing employees to post positive things. The whole thing is ridiculous.<p>I think Glassdoor&#x27;s concept is excellent, but the business model ensures employees or employees can&#x27;t trust it.')
