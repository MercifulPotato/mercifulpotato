We need BIG changes in cycling infrastructure.<p>My old bike commute in the Bay Area involved stupid shit like this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;YajWMoY.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;YajWMoY.png</a><p>Having to constantly switch between pushing along sidewalk and waiting ages for pedestrian lights, dealing with broken road sensors where I had to wait for a car to come behind me and &quot;rescue&quot; me so the light to turn green, having to go back and forth in zig zag patterns while cars got a nice direct road (not fair) -- all that made be not want to bike, especially in the heat or rain.<p>Seriously, get rid of ALL parking on El Camino Real. It&#x27;s mind-bogglingly stupid to have parking on a major road. Turn the remaining space into a separated bike lane.<p>Or just mark off 1 out of the 3 lanes on El Camino Real as a wide bike lane. Our governments are just too chicken to do that.')
