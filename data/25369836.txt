So, you look like a troll.<p>There was E. Bernays and his idea of a <i>narrative</i> as the basis of a propaganda campaign.  Well, the mainstream media (MSM), e.g., ABC, AP, Boston Globe, CBS, CNN, LAT, MSNBC, NBC, NYT, Reuters, The Atlantic, WaPo, WSJ, seem to have signed up to push the Bernays narrative.  In a few words, the narrative is &quot;Orange Man Bad&quot;.  No meaningful data, no reasonable rationality, just an attack.  Next there is the Nazi Minister of Propaganda Dr. Josef Goebbels with his<p>&quot;If you tell a lie often enough, then people will believe it.  Eventually even you will come to believe it.&quot;<p>So, the second part of the propaganda effort is to repeat the narrative lies over and over.  Eventually a lot of people come to believe, or come to believe that others believe so that there must be something to it or that they must at least fit in.  Here is an example of the media pushing the narrative with repeating lies:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=f1ab6uxg908&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=f1ab6uxg908&amp;feature=youtu.be</a><p>I hope that right away you saw that you were watching propaganda and refused to watch again.  The MSM is desperate and about to go out of business.  Apparently they sold out cheap.<p>Some people stand to get big money and power if Biden will actually do all he has proposed, e.g., sending US companies and jobs out of the country and bringing cheap products and labor into the country.<p>Really the people to get the benefits from Biden are under 1% of the population -- essentially everyone else in the US will be worse off, much worse off than with Trump.  Still the MSM keep pushing the Bernays narrative with the Goebbels repetition.<p>Now a lot of people have bought into the propaganda or are just being paid off to be trolls for the propaganda.<p>Apparently there is a lot of money involved, enough to buy off the MSM and a lot of people.<p>If you are being paid to help destroy the US, it&#x27;s not enough.  If you are not being paid, it&#x27;s time you woke up.<p>A lot of social media, sadly including HN, is fertile ground for trolls.  It is important for the rest of us to down vote the trolls.')
