They will definitely reduce code readability, will increase binary sizes and will increase compile times because of generics&#x27; abusers.<p>Well you don&#x27;t have to use them and you won&#x27;t have to use any of the libraries that use them. Just like C++ templates, some C++ shops forbid their use. But that&#x27;s your problem, don&#x27;t make everybody else suffer from what is considered a burden and a flaw in that language.<p>People want compile time type safety, not having to resort to runtime reflection, which Go std lib itself does . There is nothing unfathomable about that thought process. Go has a poor type system at compile time while being way too permissive at runtime.')
