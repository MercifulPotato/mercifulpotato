Catalogue with 90k pictures, performance might be a tad slower than LR on my iMac 2017 but so far I am happy with the software when it comes to workflow of importing new photos.<p>Will never go back to Adobe&#x27;s ransomware&#x2F;subscriptions again. Just a happy amateur and in periods it could pass weeks&#x2F;months between starting up the software.<p>Although, I do miss photoshop a bit but Gimp does the job &quot;good enough&quot; for me.')
