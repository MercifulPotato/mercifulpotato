But then I think the whole &quot;only allow your own software to run on your patented hardware (which you therefore have a government granted monopoly on)&quot; should be an anti-trust violation too.<p>Taking it as a given that Apple has the right to control what software people run on the IPhones that they own. And taking it as a given that we have apparently decided aggressively deplatforming these people is the right action (which I also disagree with in general [1] - but my objection doesn&#x27;t actually apply in this case). I&#x27;m not sure that I see why Apple controlling it&#x27;s platform is different than reddit&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;twitter&#x2F;youtube controlling their platform, and if there is no relevant distinction then this seems like reasonable corporate speech.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25688130" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25688130</a>')
