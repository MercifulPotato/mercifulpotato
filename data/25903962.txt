I think if anything having a site like this could illuminate how inferior a party&#x27;s position is on an issue more clearly than trying to research yourself.  It also may be that both sides are not uniformly wrong on all issues, and seeing where this is the case is potentially useful.  That being said I feel like this platform is not going to work simply due to lack of users willing to put in the work.  I feel like politifact is supposed to do the job of this already but since it is owned by Democrats(?) People already don&#x27;t trust it')
