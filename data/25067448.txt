ARM CPUs are also not executing ARM ISA directly and doing translation as well.<p>Simpler ARM ISA has advantages in very small &#x2F; energy efficient CPUs since the silicon translation logic can be smaller but this advantage grows increasingly irrelevant when you are scaling to bigger, faster cores.<p>IMHO these days ISA implications on performance and efficiency are being overstated.')
