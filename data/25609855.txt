In turn, that virus will have an advantage spreading to other vaccinated individuals, too.<p>It is a low probability event in each individual, but if you generate enough individuals like this and infect them all, it&#x27;s sure to happen eventually.  We can&#x27;t really estimate what the probability of this happening is, but it&#x27;s certainly less likely if the efficacy is high and there&#x27;s less disease circulating.')
