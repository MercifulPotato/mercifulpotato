Indeed, in 1995 the simpliest applet would take several seconds to appear. In 2005 (about the time everyone stopped caring), the same applet would take ... several seconds to appear. They never got faster even as CPUs improved by several hundred percent.<p>The Applets ran fast enough (even on 1995 machines) once loaded, at least fast enough to be useful. But that delay at startup when your CPU went to 100% and your hard drive buzzed away, freezing everything else you machine was doing, just killed any interest the public had in using applets.<p>Part of the problem is that they JIT&#x27;ed everything without caching it and that included the standard Java libraries. So every applet started to execute, called some standard API, the API was JIT&#x27;ed, that called some other part of the API which was JIT&#x27;ed, etc, etc. I could never understand why they didn&#x27;t compile at least the standard libraries on install or first use and save the result.')
