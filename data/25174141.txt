Item(by='a-nikolaev', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606009054, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25174016, text='I played Russian accordion with this type of a layout (EDIT: not the same as chromatone, which uses <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jank%C3%B3_keyboard" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jank%C3%B3_keyboard</a> ), and I think it is superior to the piano keyboard. But the piano layout seems to be the default for almost any modern digital instrument&#x2F;device, so you need to play piano anyway to use any of them. And this uniformity was not a thing in the past, when people designed all sorts of &quot;analog&quot; instruments (violins, guitars, trumpets, etc.)')
