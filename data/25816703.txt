In general I judge my performance about how well I do compared to my coworkers in terms of output and what I know about my industry and what is &quot;normal&quot;. I&#x27;m not the legendary 10x coder&#x2F;engineer but I&#x27;m pretty good I think, in particular based on what I&#x27;ve done vs other people in terms of output and general reaction from peers (who i trust more on feedback than managers). I agree quite often &quot;nice managers&quot; will overdo it on praise, but there are other signs. You&#x27;re not going to figure it out in a couple weeks, but I don&#x27;t see how one can&#x27;t get a general impression over a few months.')
