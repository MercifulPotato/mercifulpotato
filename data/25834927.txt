Item(by='eropple', descendants=None, kids=[25835201], score=None, time=1611073048, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25834372, text='I will define <i>freeloading</i> by those with the capacity to do otherwise as immoral any day of the week (and AWS functionally does a lot of that), yes, and I will define it in those moral terms regardless of the legal letter of a license. There is an implicit social contract that open source software absolutely and without question relies upon--and yes, large actors owe more in response than small ones in that calculus. When the social contract is abrogated by an actor who is beyond the capacity for shame or for criticism to change their ways--that&#x27;s absolutely a problem. This shift of what open source means away from &quot;Amazon, please co-opt and strangle at your leisure&quot; is inevitable, and I don&#x27;t really think it&#x27;s wrong.<p>(I also don&#x27;t like Elastic as a company, to be clear, and wouldn&#x27;t shed many tears if they disappeared tomorrow, there&#x27;s just a hierarchy of dirtbags and they&#x27;re not near the top.)<p>As far as encouraging those source-available licenses--that sounds great, except that, in my experience, people with the temerity to offer source-available licenses get treated like shit anyway <i>because</i> they aren&#x27;t giving away the farm. So I don&#x27;t know where we go there, either.')
