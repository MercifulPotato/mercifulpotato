Like building the required charge infrastructure. To accelerate the development which would happen any way, but might be to slow to react on climate change.<p>I would be interested which actual need for ICE cars there would be in 2030. Good electric cars are already quite comparable today and they keep getting better. Electricity is available everywhere, &quot;charging infrastructure&quot; can be created by installing a socked on the outside of buildings. Long distance travel is already no problem and in a blackout, you cannot refill your ICE car either, because fuel stations require... electricity.<p>Judging on how many modding projects, like converting old ICE cars to electric, do exist, car modding might get even easier.')
