Without the throttling the phone would just shut down abruptly under certain conditions.<p>Part of the reason Apple has this issue at all is that they provide continued support for their hardware years after others have stopped even giving security updates.<p>Apple has also a multi-year lead on things like chip performance in their devices (and more subjectively hardware design, software performance too).<p>I used Android nexus phones for a few years before jumping into the Apple ecosystem with the iPhone 5 (I had used macs for a while prior to that since OS X 10.3 and played with a variety of linux distos alongside it).<p>If Apple stuff starts to degrade compared to competition it will be a hassle to jump to a different ecosystem. As it happens, over the years it&#x27;s just gotten better further ahead of the competition (with some mistakes: butterfly keyboard, touchbar).<p>The premium and their authoritarian approach to vertical integration and good defaults isn&#x27;t for everyone, but I think it&#x27;s really great and worth the premium. Other companies seem to be all over the place without much of a unified vision of what they&#x27;re doing. Google in particular is extremely bad at this.')
