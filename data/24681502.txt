So that certainly planted the seed for me. In the early 90s I worked as a paperboy, delivering newspapers to houses in the neighborhood. I saved up for months and finally was able to buy my first PC. I first ran MS-DOS on it but eventually managed to get hold of Slackware around 1995. The rest is history, I guess.')
