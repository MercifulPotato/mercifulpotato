Online ads will be for overpriced junk, when it&#x27;s not literal scams.<p>The reason is it&#x27;s all highest bidder, no quality control. If there was an ad network with a <i>brand</i>, with a <i>reputation</i> for only running ads for high quality products at competitive prices, then maybe I&#x27;d pay attention.<p>EDIT: Writing this comment made me consciously pay attention to ads to verify my thesis, but honestly the quality was better than I expected.')
