Given previous manufacturing delays, I wouldn&#x27;t expect them to anywhere near keep up. Therefore although they could sell at $25K, due to the insane demand they may as well sell at $30K to reduce some demand, and then bring it down to $25K over a year or 2 as they work through those willing to pay a higher price.')
