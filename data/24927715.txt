Item(by='dnr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603951214, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24922919, text='As other people have pointed out, almost none of this comment is accurate:<p>Google put some effort, not that much, into Unladen Swallow, and the people who worked on it admitted that it didn&#x27;t achieve the goals they set. The Python community was well on their way to creating Python 3 before work started on Unladen Swallow (so it was not in any way &quot;Python&#x27;s response&quot;). As other comments pointed out, Google did not hire Rob Pike to &quot;do&quot; Go. Go was initially a side project of a few people and had nothing whatsoever to do with Python. The Go team was surprised when Python users started migrating to it. Google never used Python for web development, with one major exception, Youtube, an acquisition. I also don&#x27;t understand how Google has &quot;moved on&quot; from Python (this seems unlikely) and how what they use Python for internally has anything at all to do with the fate of Django and Python webdev.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to pile on, but I kinda have to ask, what were you thinking when you wrote this comment? Do you believe all those statements, or were you taking huge liberties with facts and making guesses to tell a story that supports a statement you wanted to make? You seem like a valued member of the community and this kinda makes me distrust the accuracy of everything else you write. (And to be honest, makes me distrust more of what I read in general, which is probably good but sad.)<p>A couple references for history&#x2F;dates:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;CPython#Unladen_Swallow" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;CPython#Unladen_Swallow</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.python.org&#x2F;dev&#x2F;peps&#x2F;pep-3000&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.python.org&#x2F;dev&#x2F;peps&#x2F;pep-3000&#x2F;</a>')
