I hope my post history shows I am not one of these types of people. However, this book has really helped me turn a corner like no other has.<p>The gist is that when you _don&#x27;t_ pursue something you want to do (e.g. learn Haskell, Unix, or the other wonderful suggestions in this thread and many others on HN) and feel flummoxed at how you continually stymie your own best intentions, you _are_ actually making a choice (i.e., to stay put); it&#x27;s not some bad-faith abdication of agency. When one chooses to stay stuck (or &quot;petrified&quot;, an apt term used by the author), one is actually choosing to preserve a sense of hope for the future; one preserves it from the painful feelings of failure that one anticipates will come due to a lack of faith in oneself to make meaningful progress towards things one deems to be important.<p>The best way out of this trap (besides being aware that you are making a choice, instead of giving up) is to do something extremely simple on a regular basis (daily if possible) that helps you realize you have agency. As goofy as it sounds, I have started a lot of habits because of the &quot;habit tracking&quot; feature in Emacs&#x27; org mode (just to make all of the little marks in the agenda go green).<p>Whether it is meditating for one minute, writing &quot;hello world&quot; is Haskell for the umpteenth time just to write _some_ Haskell each day (even on bad days), or anything else, that will slowly help you feel unstuck.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.harpercollins.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;how-we-change-ross-ellenhorn" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.harpercollins.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;how-we-change-ross-el...</a>')
