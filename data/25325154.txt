Maybe I&#x27;m not 100% objective since he is my brother but it blows my mind every time I see him send me a project. The problem is that he absolutely does not realize that these projects are very interesting and he could build a great community around them.<p>As an example, he sent me a &quot;random&quot; video this afternoon on WhatsApp like he usually does when he has some free time during the weekend: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=nAYiPEyuBkQ<p>I wonder if you guys agree with me that there is great potential to build a community around these projects? If so, how would you proceed? Note that he has absolutely &quot;zero marketing skills&quot; and I would love to help him realize how crazy it could be!')
