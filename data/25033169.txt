Nowadays setting up services, where you  have to take care of avoiding port conflicts, is much easier with container technology. Modifying config files in the users directory is in my experience  a pain because chef was not designed to do that. You have to do all kind of workarounds to get permissions right. Just using Chef for abstracting from which package manager you use also does not fully work because package names can be different between Linux flavors. Chef also requires a ruby installation, which itself is a problematic large dependency which might conflict with another ruby version on the system.<p>Update: trying to install the same package in different versions at the same time is also a pain.')
