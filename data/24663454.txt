I get what he&#x27;s trying to say, but I don&#x27;t think it has much to do with the the ordinary sense of the word privacy. If he&#x27;s saying that the boundary between the individual and the collective is a core social construct, then, sure. But there are other, much better discussions of that topic, going back thousands of years.')
