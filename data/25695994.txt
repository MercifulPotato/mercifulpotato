You see that because you <i>believe</i> that and spoken language is ambiguous.<p>Trump followed up with an almost identical statement. You understand what he said differently because you <i>believe</i> different things about Trump.<p>It’s OK. It’s politics.<p>In the end all I want is people to be consistent in how they describe violent mobs.<p>Personally I don’t think these violent mobs in the summer or yesterday are terrorists. I think they are simply violent mobs that were allowed to get out of control through lack of policing and bad politics. I blame both sides.<p>The meta problem I have is the rapid political capitalization by Democrats (including Harris) and the media following one violent mob after granting persistent cover and gaslighting readers for months over the significantly worse BLM&#x2F;antifa mobs going off all summer.')
