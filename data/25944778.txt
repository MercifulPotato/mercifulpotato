You can use whatever language you want with people you know, because you know how they&#x27;ll react and that it genuinely won&#x27;t cause offence. In a public space though, I&#x27;d be wary. A black person walking past a group of white kids making racist jokes and using racial slurs is only going to make them feel less comfortable, even if the white kids genuinely mean no harm.')
