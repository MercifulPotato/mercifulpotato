In those days these same groups existed, but were exclusively on the fringe. You didn&#x27;t hear people bring up radical alt-right talking points, or sympathize with nazis, or spout outright racism (as much).<p>The fact of the matter is that echo chambers encourage extremism and social media is nothing but echo chambers.<p>Another fact of the matter is human psychology. Humans have a biological tendency to accept as truth the first opinion they hear on a topic. This is a result of evolution. If your tribe member tells you a berry is poisonous, is the first response to argue? Or to just listen. Better to be safe than sorry.<p>When you combine that bit of psychology with social media, you see people go online to some circle jerk, innocently at first, and then get radicalized.<p>Now before any counter examples get brought out, just consider that while it doesn&#x27;t work this way for every person, in every context, it does work this way for some non-trivial amount of people, and that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re seeing. A lot of users on parler aren&#x27;t domestic terrorists, but if it&#x27;s even 1% who fall victim to basic human psychology, that&#x27;s enough for what took place on Wednesday.<p>So yeah - the example is the time before social media.')
