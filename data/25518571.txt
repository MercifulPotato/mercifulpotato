I use Youtube mostly for hobbies. A couple examples are cooking and small engine repair - I find it super valuable to watch multiple people do the same thing in different ways. Anecdotally, the algorithm does a really good job giving me more content&#x2F;channels both narrowly related and slightly expanding the interests. Sure, it can be frustrating if you watch a clickbaity video that spawns a genre of clickbaity content recommendations - but it doesn&#x27;t take long for those to stop showing up so long as you don&#x27;t watch them.')
