But there were and still are a lot of innovations in various fields. Also Germany has great engineers and a lot of innovation, but the state weighs much heavier on the companies than in Switzerland.<p>EDIT: Perhaps the Global Inovation Index would also be worth a look: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Global_Innovation_Index" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Global_Innovation_Index</a>')
