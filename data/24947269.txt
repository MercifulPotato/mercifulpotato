Then I beat it (Launched the rocket in to space), and ever since then I have no desire to go back. I think it just feels too much like work for me now. I think the fact that Factorio feels so much like programming both makes the game great, and makes the game exhausting. Nowadays, after a full day programming, I just want to relax with games that don&#x27;t require refactoring.<p>That being said, it&#x27;s a great game and would still recommend it to anyone that hasn&#x27;t played through it.')
