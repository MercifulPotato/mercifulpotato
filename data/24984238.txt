Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604439075, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24981644, text='&gt; I think the poster you are replying to is saying...<p>You are exactly correct.<p>&gt; ...against the vast hurricane of actual governmental conspiracies and the harm that can come from them, and that anything that might make it harder to hear about those conspiracies is far more harmful to the world than letting people say things that are untrue<p>There are several going on at all times.  What&#x27;s fascinating is how easily the vast majority of people, even smart ones, can so easily have heuristics planted in their minds that result in a Pavlovian response to the very mention of a conspiracy theory - any story that has had a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; label attached to it by the media is from that point immediately classified as False - many people seem quite literally unable to concede there&#x27;s a possibility that not every single conspiracy theory is wrong.  What makes it even funnier is, from reading many comments on HN, it couldn&#x27;t be more clear that people&#x27;s knowledge of what the conspiracy world consists of comes directly from the mainstream media.  The average &#x2F;r&#x2F;conspiracy subscriber has far(!) superior epistemic skills than the average that I&#x27;ve observed here.')
