I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s useless, only that has limitations, the same thing that you noticed when you started with a teacher.<p>&gt; I still think it&#x27;s good enough for learning how to play.<p>As long as it&#x27;s weighted it&#x27;s decent, and 61 keys for starters is not too bad either. When the parent said &#x27;cheapo midi keyboard&#x27; I was thinking of one of these small cheap keyboards that almost looks like a toy.<p>&gt; One thing that you might be missing is the fact that most of the people wanting to learn the piano don&#x27;t plan on becoming a professional, they just want to be able to learn and play a few songs or improvise a bit. In order to do this usually &quot;good enough&quot; is good enough<p>I know that. I&#x27;m talking precisely to that people, because I&#x27;m one of those people. I&#x27;m doing that with the clarinet right now in fact. If you really want to play a few songs by yourself and improvise a bit, you&#x27;re taking it seriously enough to the point I do think it&#x27;s worth it to go to a teacher.')
