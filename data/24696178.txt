You can go to another instance.<p>If another user blocks you, that&#x27;s on them but you have no right to push your messages into another user&#x27;s home system.<p>If all else fails, you can host your own. It&#x27;s ultimate free speech as intended and as someone who hosts a mastodon instance, it&#x27;s a system that works pretty good, there is no noticeable hatespeech in my federated timeline.<p>edit: I might have misunderstood the GP, but I&#x27;ll let the comment exist. Banning mastodon in the US is a non-concern since it&#x27;s a french open source development.')
