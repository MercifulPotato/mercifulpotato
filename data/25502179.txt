Item(by='rootusrootus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608603823, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25500055, text='&gt; is there any competitor that has even 25% of the charging network that Tesla has?<p>Well, EVgo claims to be the largest DC fast charging network in the US.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true, and I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re excluding Tesla&#x27;s proprietary network.  They claim to have 800 fast charging locations, and I think Tesla is a bit over 900.  Tesla has more stations per location, however, I&#x27;m pretty certain of that.<p>Collectively, I think there are more non-Tesla DC fast charging locations than there are superchargers, and the gap is expected to widen significantly over the coming years.  Tesla had a great head start, though, so they command the mindshare.  And some of the standardized DC fast charging stations have acquired a reputation for unreliability.  But ... superchargers break regularly, too.')
