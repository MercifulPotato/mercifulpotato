The car disabled itself <i>during</i> installation. It was not driving. It was also not &quot;hacked&quot; remotely. I assume the installer also had the key at hand.<p>A certified dealership will have the computer interface and software to reset the anti-theft mode. For those that do not have this software, Ferrari can remote into the car and reset it for you. This requires connectivity though.')
