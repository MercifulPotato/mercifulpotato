Some would call my family preppers, but we live in an area likely to be devastated by a major earthquake. We wanted at least 2 weeks of supplies, water, etc in case of it.  We actually were closer to a month.  People thought we were strange, until toilet paper and meat shortages at our local stores this year.  I have had a few friends ask me for advice on stocking up now.<p>We started back when we lived in the Midwest. We had a basic &quot;tornado kit&quot; in the basement (our first year, there were a bunch of tornadoes within 5 miles of our home) and then later, a blizzard knocked out power.  Of course, the power company does the big city first, then works their way out to the country. Took us 3 days to get power back. We had propane, but the furnace needs electricity to start up the fan.  The Well needs power to run the pump, etc. I was very eye opening to us.')
