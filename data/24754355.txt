We can use our network, specifically our Access product, to check for identity. When a user requests an application, our network can stop that request and ask the user to show ID.<p>The difference is that we don&#x27;t issue that identity. We aren&#x27;t an identity provider, like Okta or Azure AD. Instead, teams integrate our Access product with their identity provider which tells us which sources of identity to trust (in the same way a bouncer or border guard doesn&#x27;t create your identity card for you, but they know what a valid one looks like).')
