Different nation has different laws and testing, and different methods for animal handling can increase disease risks. To take an direct example here from Sweden, if a farmers animal get tested positive for salmonella then most if not all the nearby animals are killed and possible even nearby neighboring farmers flocks just to be on the safe side. Raw milk also get tested a lot more since the risk are higher.<p>That said, while its true that we have kept cows for thousands of years without using pasteurization, there is a reason why the average life span is high and child mortality  is low. We also used to milk the cow and then directly drink it, rather than collect it and store it for a extended period of time.')
