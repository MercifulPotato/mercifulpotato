I’ve been a Creative Cloud customer since launch but now have to crack my copy of Adobe Fireworks CS6 to use it. Horrific thought for me since I hate using hacks to run software (who the hell really knows what is in there) but I can’t find another way to use it legally (no one has a copy for sale second hand).<p>I’d switch but I am very busy with work and can’t justify the time to learn new software right now while I still know all the features of Fireworks as I’ve used it since Macromedia introduced it.<p>I wish upon wish that Adobe had just made it possible to obtain a license key for it that worked offline.<p>Really upset at Adobe right now about this but also can’t imagine switching since everyone in the industry uses their file types.<p>I won’t invest my time in learning more of their products after this though.')
