Item(by='wegs', descendants=None, kids=[24957270], score=None, time=1604181816, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24951999, text='Linear algebra, to the point of being a:<p>* competent ML engineer;<p>* competent at doing statistical analysis;<p>* competent at 3d graphics;<p>* competent at graph theory &#x2F; SNA;<p>* competent at signal processing; or<p>* competent at control systems<p>is a few semesters, not a month. There is deep intuition behind the concepts, and it takes a lot of time to pick up. The core problem is there are no short-term gains. Dabbling in linear algebra is not a skillset which improves your employability, or broadens projects you can work on.<p>Being able to develop TensorFlow, optimize 3d rendering for NVidia, process images for Adobe, or design a control system for a robot IS an employable skillset, and makes for much more interesting work. Picking that up is why I&#x27;d send my kid to a school like CMU.<p>Similarly for precalc and calc. It&#x27;s not hard to know what a derivative and integral is. There is mathematical depth to being able to do something interesting with that.<p>If college gets you that background, you can pick up Agile and test infrastructure on-the-job.')
