Even then we had software installed that would let us control the old Mac Plus with our voice. It was the first time I&#x27;d ever used a boom microphone.<p>Here, go reminisce: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;PlainTalk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;PlainTalk</a><p>My dad insisted that a boom microphone was required -- not just any microphone but a &quot;boom&quot; microphone specifically. It was interesting when I showed him some smaller microphones years later that worked better with less noise.<p>Oh man have I grown since. Hardware and processing power have both grown so much. But speech recognition is still as dumb (or even dumber) as it was 30 years ago. It <i>certainly</i> didn&#x27;t need the internet to work back then!')
