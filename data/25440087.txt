I think the best implementation is Apple IDs version, as they don’t need to care about A and have the reputation to solve B.<p>Great job getting to 8k MRR and good luck. I think 33mail (or idbloc) would be awesome if integrated with a password manager, might be a good place for you to find new growth.')
