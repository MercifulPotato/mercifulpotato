This bit in particular resonated:<p><i>In contemporary American discourse a word like &quot;racism&quot; has as much connection to phenomena in the real world as &quot;Trotskyite&quot; had in Russia under Stalin. So if someone says &quot;You&#x27;re a racist!&quot; and you respond &quot;I&#x27;m not a racist because X and Y and Z&quot; you have already lost because you have implicitly conceded that there is this thing out there called &quot;racism&quot; which is really big and bad and scary, and one that your enemies get to define for you. And it doesn&#x27;t matter that your X or Y or Z may be absolutely correct. You still lose by dignifying the accusation e.g. (&quot;I am not part of the Trotskyite conspiracy!&quot;). The entire thing is transparently preposterous and should be responded to appropriately, with laughter and derision.</i><p><i>And let&#x27;s face it, we are so eager to say &quot;I&#x27;m not a racist!&quot; because we&#x27;re afraid of what will happen to us if we don&#x27;t. And people can smell fear, and it&#x27;s unattractive. Be not afraid!</i>')
