Plus loading WASM is not &quot;free&quot; (that is, essentially an instruction cache flush) because you need to generate a bundle that WebKit will then load, which is slow (although there has been work done in this area: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7JUs4c99-mo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=7JUs4c99-mo</a>). So even if we did some sort of WASI thing where everything is going on in the browser, there are hurdles to overcome to make this viable. Plus the current interpreter almost certainly leaves performance on the table ;)')
