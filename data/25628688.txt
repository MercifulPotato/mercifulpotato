But I think this misses the mark a bit. I agree with the general point that the folks who think they want to live in 1960s New York wouldn&#x27;t be caught dead in the most similar places that exist today, but obviously that&#x27;s not <i>really</i> what they&#x27;re asking for. They&#x27;re wondering why every safe, walkable urban neighborhood seems to be gentrified to the point of being unaffordable to all but the top decile or so. Even if neighborhoods like that have never existed in the past (aren&#x27;t cities today safer than they&#x27;ve ever been?), it doesn&#x27;t seem like that should be an unattainable goal, but they seem to be rare if not nonexistent.<p>As an aside, there are probably classist elements to what they&#x27;re asking for but it&#x27;s not just a class thing. Since taking a fully remote job I&#x27;ve seriously considered moving back to my hometown, where I could get a 3BR detached house for &lt;$150k within a couple blocks of an intact downtown, but I keep remembering that this [0] (recorded 3 miles away) is representative of the people who would be my neighbors there. &quot;Classist&quot; is adjacent to the right term for my attitude here but it&#x27;s not quite right.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Y4Zdx97A63s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Y4Zdx97A63s</a>')
