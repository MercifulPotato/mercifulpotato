Good idea maybe, but give it time and rocks will be the least of his troubles.<p>However it&#x27;s unfair of me to dismiss our real life solutions to real life problems by pointing to a problem that might come to exist in an imaginary long-term future. We can only make the best with what we have.<p>Maybe I need to update my mental model of the law from an eternal-and-perfect view to an incremental-and-imperfect view, especially when it comes to the intersection of law and technology.')
