Quarks were conceptualized as a mathematical simplification, and only later were recognized as real physical things - or at least as real as protons.<p>In QM we have physical quantities (an electron&#x27;s mass) and unphysical quantities (an electron&#x27;s phase). But there&#x27;s open questions, like the wavefunction - can that be placed in correspondence with reality? We don&#x27;t really know. This is the &quot;ontic&quot; vs &quot;epistemic&quot; debate.')
