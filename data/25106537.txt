Should you have stayed home to avoid that risk? In any situation with risk involved there will always be stories like the wedding mentioned. The point is that people should be free to take on as much or as little amount of risk as they want. If you have compromised health or a very low tolerance for risk maybe you should make the decision to avoid people as much as possible, wear a mask, work from home, etc.')
