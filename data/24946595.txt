I think that comes from a misunderstanding about expectations. We want to provide a functional, usable system -- but we also <i>are</i> going to change things in new releases, and while we do weigh user impact, we&#x27;re tilted towards bringing upstream innovation to users. That means we&#x27;re likely to bring you things like cgroupsv2 sooner rather than later.<p>If you have these expectations, I hope we&#x27;re holding to them pretty well.
