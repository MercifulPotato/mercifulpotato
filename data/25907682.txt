Item(by='arcticbull', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611603405, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25906731, text='&gt; Saying &quot;I can send one million dollars or 20 dollars easily to anyone without blockchain&quot; is no different than a &quot;Let them have cake&quot; to someone in Argentina who would like to work as a freelancer with European customers.<p>Again, that&#x27;s not the point I&#x27;m making.<p>Yes, perfect shouldn&#x27;t be the enemy of good, but utterly insufficient shouldn&#x27;t be the enemy of good either.<p>Yes, some people are helped. No, substantially any more people cannot be helped because - and while you disregarded this criticism earlier - the system simply cannot and does not scale to any transaction quantity larger than that of a single Costco or a large flea market.<p>&gt; It has more to do with enabling whatever-you-can-call &quot;middle class&quot; to be able to protect their wealth and to do their business without being harassed by corrupt government officials, or having their savings inflated away by government that can not&#x2F;will not manage their finances and even to enable them to make business with foreign entities without getting ripped off by abusive&#x2F;unfair taxes.<p>Blockchain doesn&#x27;t stop any of that. It&#x27;s not a way to protect your wealth if the value drops 40% in a month. In <i>this</i> month. That&#x27;s not protection, that&#x27;s juggling buzzsaws. In no small part because the same thing that allows it to be used in these rogue jurisdictions allows scammers and criminals to manipulate the ever loving crap out of it - I mean, Tether, for example, but that&#x27;s just the <i>latest</i> example. It&#x27;s impossible to actually price because you can&#x27;t see through the murk.<p>I&#x27;ve said this before, and I stand by it: if you have a government that cannot manage a currency, you have bigger problems than your currency. Once you sort out the government, the currency is no longer a problem. And even if you use crypto you are <i>still subject to those same taxes</i>. But strictly worse because you have to pay them in local units, but store your value in a wildly fluctuating store of value.<p>I also reject the idea that &quot;just do financial crime&quot; is a solution to really any problem you may have.')
