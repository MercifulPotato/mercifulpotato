It&#x27;s an hour and a half. I would add another hour to that to make that a true door-to-door figure, i.e. from the time you decide to get ready (past breakfast&#x2F;morning coffee) to when you&#x27;re actually productive at your desk. Same in the evening from the time you shut work to when you&#x27;re back home.<p>If you sleep 7 hours a day, you have 21 waking hours. You&#x27;re spending 15% of your time (2.5 hours) on a commute. That in my opinion is a lot of waste.<p>My point being most people seriously underestimate the cost of the commute. It&#x27;s almost like saying you have to work at least 2.5 more hours a day but you won&#x27;t be paid for it.')
