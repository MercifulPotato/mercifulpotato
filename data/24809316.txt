But the <i>worst</i> feature of Jira is the ability to install custom extensions that slow it down and fill it with bugs. My local Jira install takes seconds to reorder stories because we’ve loaded it to the hilt with god knows what. I’ve regularly crashed it due to innocuous actions like deleting a story due to extensions. Oh and we can’t use any automation tools with it (Zapier, IFTT) since it’s only accessible via VPN.<p>Taking away the ability to customize Jira to death will make it a better project. Or it’ll force my org to move to something better: either is acceptable.')
