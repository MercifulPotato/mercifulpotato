It&#x27;s just a complete clusterfuck and you end up with all sorts of truly terrible things, like luajit or terra being sometimes zero and sometimes one based, which also interacts in hilarious ways with the length function. I think this has done even more harm than the messed up scoping (which could largely be fixed).')
