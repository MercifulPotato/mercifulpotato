The GPL is a license which has worked for this, QT is a good example. This works best, when the dual-licensed software is the large part of your product.<p>When using the GPL, it comes at one huge disadvantage: you cannot accept community patches to the GPL software and use them for your closed-source branch. This is the incentive for companies, to use a more permissive license for some of the software. They can reintegrate community contributions into their closed software product. Of course, this only works out, if the closed software product adds significant value over the open sourced part, or no one would buy it.')
