The LB needs another RTT_2 to fetch data over a (hopefully) pre-established TCP connection from your webserver. Assuming a 2ms RTT_2 at the data center, your RTT_1 seems to be about 5.5ms.<p>A quick google search indicates with TLS the whole think takes at least 4 RTT_1, plus the RTT_2 because the LB still has to fetch your data, so your hard limit is 24ms, plus how long it takes to actually transfer the additional data (especially certificates).<p>This leaves about 86ms.<p>Now, does your client perform any checks for a revoked certificate? Assuming these checks are also done via TLS, and a &quot;far away&quot; server with a RTT of 15ms, then that&#x27;s a whooping 60ms your client is taking to ensure that the certificates are valid. In that case your LB would merely be 26ms slower than the theoretical optimum.')
