However getting there, to what for us is the most optimal configuration, is what was the main incentive for me. The way it is now it requires almost no ahead planning. I.e. for most rooms we had no idea on beforehand how we were going to pupulate them with furniture and which activity we&#x27;d do where, so I just went &#x27;cable for lighting in the center, at the side on each wall, and some extra&#x27; and then put the switches in sensible places i.e. usually next to room entrance. Then during the next years hook up as needed and adapt if needed. E.g. couple of months ago we needed an extra desk for working form home and one extra for my GF&#x27;s new hobby, so we just put some desks to a wall and  instantly can get a light above it. With a fixed configuration you&#x27;d either need to think of that in advance, or use the light centrally in the room which makes you sit in your own shadow. or add lights you just plug in the wall socket but that&#x27;s extra cable, and especially for desks it&#x27;s hard to find a suitable one. Also throughout the years I&#x27;ve made small changes here and there to change things like being able to turn on the light in the bathroom from the bedroom, or turn on light in the kitchen from the place where we eat so you don&#x27;t have to look for th kitchen switch in the dark. Sure those are just nice-to-haves but pretty convenient. I&#x27;ve been and lived in quite a lot of houses where the whole configuration was pretty akward. Though I get some people don&#x27;t care about that.')
