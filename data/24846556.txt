It maybe doesn&#x27;t help that the perception is that tech giants have very large numbers of developer jobs involving non-complex work that pays extremely well, and that very basic &quot;coding&quot; skills are valuable.<p>Anecdata, but from five years helping beginners through a popular online curriculum, this pattern is ridiculously common:<p>1. Beginner learns some HTML&#x2F;CSS over the course of a few weeks.<p>2. Start on the JS curriculum, get stuck immediately.<p>3. Start to ask in forum if there are jobs [at a FAANG] just involve knowing HTML&#x2F;CSS.<p>4. Very polite and detailed replies start to appear on forum of the form &quot;well, it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try but you might want to bear in mind that at entry level you&#x27;re competing against people who have years of learning behind them&quot;, or &quot;maybe just try to work through the slightly harder bits of the curriculum first (bearing in mind that even that isn&#x27;t going give you a deep knowledge of the subject on its own)&quot;.<p>5. Few months later the beginner reappears talking about how they&#x27;ve applied to x number of jobs with no responses. And they start asking about how to get jobs working freelance. Moderators take some  diazepam and start putting together more polite replies.<p>Anecdata as I can only see a tiny slice of self-learners via the forum; I feel for your ex though')
