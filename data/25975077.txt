All of the things you mention (pumps, etc.) Break only after long usage (60-80-100k?)<p>Oil changes and filters are reasonably cheap, i guess $50 every 5-10k miles?<p>I would really want to see long term cost of ownership of ev once you include replacement battery.<p>Edit: of course the repairs add up as the car gets older for ic (because of things you mention), but i wonder how does that stack against battery itself.')
