However, given that compensation in US is a large multiple higher I think it would be easy to agree it&#x27;s better overall. For comparison Big Law pays 20-30% lower on average in London vs. NYC and finance pays marginally lower (outside of quant finance where London pays a lot lower than NYC as hedge funds don&#x27;t have to compete with FANGs for tech talent that wants high pay).')
