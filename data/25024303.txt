A primary source describing anything will do. Don&#x27;t fabricate accounts or go with the &quot;he said she said&quot; approach. Each and every single case you vaguely referred to has been debunked and corrected, but apparently either you prefer to ignore facts or  preferred to turn yourself off from the world. Show the evidence. Can you do it?')
