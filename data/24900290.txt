I remember when I was in school as a dumb teenager watching the Zeitgeist video that was going around then, it’s a bunch of dumb conspiracy theories which if I watched now I’d probably peg as blatantly antisemitic as those things tend to be.<p>Anyway I mention that because during that time I remember always leaning on weird ZeroHedge articles to prove things in dumb arguments. I don’t remember the specifics but it stuck with me enough to completely blacklist ZH when I realised how dumb I was being.<p>It sounds like I probably should take a look at it from a fresh perspective and without that baggage, because it’s obviously not what I remember based on these comments.')
