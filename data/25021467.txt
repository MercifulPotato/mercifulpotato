This increased resentment in turn leads whites to withdraw support for welfare programs when they perceive these programs to primarily benefit minorities.</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;academic.oup.com&#x2F;sf&#x2F;article&#x2F;97&#x2F;2&#x2F;793&#x2F;5002999" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;academic.oup.com&#x2F;sf&#x2F;article&#x2F;97&#x2F;2&#x2F;793&#x2F;5002999</a><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1093&#x2F;sf&#x2F;soy046" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1093&#x2F;sf&#x2F;soy046</a><p>Some books on this:<p>&gt; <i>Wetts and Willer are hardly the first scholars to argue that racial animus is a powerful factor motivating opposition to social spending and redistribution in the US.
