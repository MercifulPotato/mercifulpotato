If that were the case you&#x27;d hope we&#x27;d have far less entitled customers abusing workers who don&#x27;t deserve any such treatment.<p>This is not to say that a summer on a lobster ship is worthless, but your choice of example is poor - yes, I do honestly believe that a summer at Starbucks seeing people on their worst behavior could do more to shape perspective than a summer of manual labor in relative isolation.')
