For example:<p>1. You can&#x27;t downvote direct replies to your own comments<p>2. You can&#x27;t see comment scores other than your own<p>3. Heavily down voted comments aren&#x27;t hidden, just greyed out<p>4. New comments are initially sorted near the top of the thread, so they aren&#x27;t immediately buried and have a chance to get voted on<p>5. Comments on older threads can&#x27;t be downvoted')
