It&#x27;s a little SaaS platform that allows you to quickly define commands that can be sent over text messaging to invoke REST APIs. I got the idea when I was out camping and wanted to get some stats from an API that I had but I didn&#x27;t have great internet connectivity, so I thought it would be fun to wire up my APIs so that I could hit them via text message instead of through a web interface.<p>I&#x27;m about 90% code complete with the MVP, would be fun to find someone else who is interested in this kind of stuff (preferably US based) and might want to help work on expanding the functionality or coming up with other interesting things to do with it.<p>Platform is React, Node, PGSQL.<p>my contact info is:\nrecurry AT outlook DOT com')
