If it&#x27;s like the US, it&#x27;d be through a HOA for the building. If someone wanted to fight it they&#x27;d have to go to court.<p>I could imagine a scheme where a bank lends the HOA the money but then deals with the court since dealing with that is much less of a pain for them than the random building HOA president.')
