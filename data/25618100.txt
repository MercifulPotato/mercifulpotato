When they did, it was with larger missiles than the US used, but fewer of them. There were some interesting designs, such as a missile that carried a torpedo, a ramjet-powered missile, and a missile which operated in a group of other missiles with one of them in charge. The USSR built some giant nuclear-powered battlecruisers to carry all those large weapons, and put large vertical launch tubes on some aircraft carriers.<p>Now, like everybody else, Russia mostly uses vertical launch in new systems.')
