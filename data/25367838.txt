I think that&#x27;s an acceptable outcome tbh.<p>&gt; unless [the small restaurant] starts making new recipes it keeps for itself.<p>which is why it doesn&#x27;t make sense to give away the recipes in the first place. If restaurant&#x27;s value proposition is _merely_ the recipe, and you give it away, but expect customers to be charitable and still give you money, then the business is a failing one (even if temporarily solvent).<p>But if your small restaurant has qualities that can&#x27;t be replicated in a chain, then you have a business model (even if temporarily insolvent - you just have to hang on and not bankrupt...), and you can &quot;afford&quot; to give away the recipe and chalk it up to marketing expense.<p>This is why there&#x27;s barely any real businesses selling open source games - there&#x27;s hardly any differentiator there. But for enterprise&#x2F;productivity applications, i think there may be - for example, professional services associated with the product, or customizations etc.')
