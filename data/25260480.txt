Long time listener, first time caller... poster.<p>I&#x27;ve been working hard on learning web development and programming in general this year, and this is the result. It&#x27;s been an incredibly rewarding experience and I wanted to share it with everyone here.<p>While compared to &quot;real&quot; web developers this is nothing special, I&#x27;m quite proud of what I&#x27;ve accomplished and eager to keep learning. I&#x27;m planning on posting this to my LinkedIn audience this week so would love to hear any feedback you guys have.')
