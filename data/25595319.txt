Sadly there&#x27;s a bug in the firmware I think that reports a bad colorspace, but there are ways to pass it around using v4l loopback devices.  It&#x27;s really nice to have a tripod with a camera on it, and the lens can zoom in or out to show more of my room.  Although depending on the camera and what mode it&#x27;s in, the HDMI output can be quite different, causing headaches and crashes sometimes in apps like zoom.<p>I&#x27;ve also ended up using my dashcam for a timelapse camera, since I&#x27;m not driving much.<p>Also, in terms of audio, just as a PSA: please get and use earbuds or headphones for your meetings.  It&#x27;s not so much for you, but everyone else can hear the echo.')
