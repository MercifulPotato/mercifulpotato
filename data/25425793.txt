JWT has also been susceptible in the past[2] to the same kinds of attacks here - Poorly defined verification semantics.<p>I suspect that buried in the semantics around SPIFFE&#x27;s SPIRE Server and Agent are a number of vulnerabilities or other ways that trust doesn&#x27;t mean quite what you think it means. I&#x27;d love for someone with interest to take a look. Besides the obvious downsides fundamental to Isitio&#x27;s MITM Proxy architecture, I think there&#x27;s more lurking on that edge.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spiffe.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spiffe.io&#x2F;</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auth0.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auth0.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-...</a>')
