That is:<p>1. User types CompanyFoo (whose real URL is www.companyfoo.com) into their address bar, which lands them on Google (because Google owns Chrome and pays billions for the privilege on other browsers).<p>2. Since Google will sell this keywords to others, many businesses always bid on their own brand name to ensure it comes up first.<p>3. Thus, an ad for CompanyFoo shows up first, even though www.companyfoo.com is the first search result, so when user clicks on the CompanyFoo ad Google takes its cut. Again, this is also because Google has done as much as possible to make ads as visually similar to SEO results as possible - just the teeny &#x27;ad&#x27; banner, compare to the big yellow box of early Google.<p>I don&#x27;t have as much objection for other companies buying branded keywords, but the way Google has set up things up they are taking their cut from everyone even when they are giving very little value.')
