But I feel some of these features are not used by customers anymore. Currently I want to do a couple of things to improve the product&#x27;s usability and also move it into the cloud. For this process, I need to collect data on feature usage by our customers. I would like to capture information like\n1. What is the most used feature grouped by customer\n2. What is the least used feature of the product\n       a. Can I depreciate this feature so that I can reduce the maintenance overhead\n3. What is the path(workflow) a user takes to use a particular feature.\n       a. What is the most used entry point for using a feature\n       b. Is there any default values or other aspects which will make things easy for the user.<p>Are there any tools which would help me collect this information?  Are there any articles&#x2F;references for understanding how people do this and any information on their experiences ?<p>Rgds,\nSiva.')
