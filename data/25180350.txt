Two, equal people, walk in a test room.  One has never seen the test, the other has been practicing it for a while.  The guy that has been practicing, will perform better.<p>Even for official IQ test taking, they don&#x27;t recommend taking the test more than once a year, as it invalidates  the results of the tests...<p>Why?  The act of doing tests, makes you better at that particular test, and the test ceases to become a good measurement of what it was trying to measure (in this case, IQ).')
