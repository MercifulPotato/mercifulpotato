Then your &quot;primes&quot; (formally irreducible elements) become equivalence classes up to unities.<p>In the concrete integers though AFAIK it&#x27;s more conventional to only consider positive primes, so that the decomposition is canonical. Probably I should have said that you lose canonicity.')
