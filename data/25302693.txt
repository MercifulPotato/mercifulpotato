This especially penalizes more experienced &#x2F; older devs who don&#x27;t have time to LC grind (of which I&#x27;m also one), and introduces unconscious selection bias.<p>Certainly there are other ways to verify someone can code: code samples, talking through high level language concepts, reviewing existing code, etc.<p>What people should be focusing on is this - 1) Do you understand enough systems architecture &#x2F; code techniques to succeed at this particular company? This can be done via mostly talking. 2) Do you have experience that will help us with our <i>company-specific problems</i>? Give them an actual problem you regularly deal with, and get them to attack it.')
