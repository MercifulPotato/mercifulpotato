I often talk to people to improve the UX.<p>Marking someone in touch means you interacted with this person somehow for example you met or called. This sets the last contact date to today. This is used for reminders to catchup after some time and sorting the contact list to see which contacts you met recently and where it&#x27;s been some time.<p>Setting in touch and adding contacts uses a similar UI, which can be confusing in the beginning. I need to improve this. Thanks!<p>You can also contact me at kai@amicu.app, if you&#x27;ve more questions or feedback.')
