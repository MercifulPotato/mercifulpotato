Even with the downturn, we&#x27;re still producing more CO2 than the environment can absorb, so CO2 will net increase. The best you can hope for is that it would increase less than expected.<p>The metaphor I heard from several researchers is that it&#x27;s like a bathtub filling up -- we turned down the tap a bit, but it&#x27;s still going to overflow.<p>So you wouldn&#x27;t expect the temperature to be lower than previous years. It might be lower than the predicted amount, but probably by less than the uncertainty in the prediction.<p>The year as a whole is shaping up to be the second hottest (after 2016), though it&#x27;s possible that it may end up being hotter than than year as well.')
