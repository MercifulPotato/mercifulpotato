Item(by='whateveracct', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609639073, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25616945, text='1) Fully remote<p>2) A domestic flight away<p>3) I was fully remote before the pandemic, so things aren&#x27;t different.<p>4) Pros are work isn&#x27;t a dominant experience in my life. Cons are that in normal times I have to travel by plane a few times a year.<p>5) Nothing special. I love a short flight to the Bay which really allows me to treat it like an extension of my local job market.<p>6) I have no plans to not be remote for the rest of my career unless I don&#x27;t have a choice. So I recommend it. Not doing so means you&#x27;re wasting hours of your life you could reclaim if you do the hard work of making remote work work for you.')
