It&#x27;s incredibly interesting how he dismantles a lot of our facade of a history into simple bourgeoisie economics. He makes everything modern conservative pundits preach in regards to the founding fathers as just pure lies. I mean look how fast the Anti-Federalists were stamped out! The revolution was purely a fabrication of rights stripped from the industrialist estates. The average worker wasn&#x27;t as affected as much. But they were easily riled that&#x27;s for sure. Everything in the early days of the US was just radical libertarians and aristocrats just seeking their own self interest. Since the majority of the US was still an agricultural economy based off of preceding thought surrounding Physiocracy, the system at the time was implemented far differently than it is today. Now it is on a full-scale industrialized level, but with a system devised for farmers, artisans, and aristocrats.<p>The US system though will never change as long as it&#x27;s the global hegemon. Much like the British Empire, Roman Empire, Qi Dynasty, and Holy Roman Empire; these major players never ended up reforming until their total collapse. As much as anybody hates to see it, that is the only way for this system to be revised. There is a big pie for many to take a piece of in the US. It&#x27;s why there are minimal united for change.')
