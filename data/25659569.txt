Those are private companies, and I hope you don&#x27;t try to list NASA projects. Elon wants to bring down the cost of space transportation to 10$ per Kg, a Space Shuttle launch used to cost 1.5B$.  \nMy point was about the public sector. Last time I checked, the high-speed railway they were trying to build in California added another billion $ to its budget. Meanwhile, feel free to look how much high-speed rail China has built in the last few years.<p>&gt; Not for Uyghurs or political dissidents.<p>Just because a system works very well for the majority of its citizens doesn&#x27;t mean it works for everyone. You are not refuting the central argument.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d take our system any day of the week over being disappeared for disagreeing with officials.<p>You seem to have the impression I&#x27;d prefer the Chinese system. I don&#x27;t. That does not mean you can&#x27;t take a hard look at what they do better.')
