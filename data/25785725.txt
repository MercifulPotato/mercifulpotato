IMO, the issues would be easier to grapple with.<p>Instead these enourmous websites are filling what is now an obvious void in public services for communication.<p>Perhaps I should not have used the term &quot;common carrier&quot; as that term has very specific meaning, and only in certain jurisdictions.  What I mean is common carrier-like treatment by the public.  People talk about these websites as if they are public services.  Messenger apps are treated like they are interchangeable with telephone service.<p>Practically speaking (i.e., how they are being used in practice), maybe, but beyond that I refuse to see them that way.  These are not anywhere close to public services, IMO.<p>Even the trend of websites that we would otherwise see as &quot;public websites&quot; containing &quot;public information&quot; that urge visitors to create &quot;accounts&quot; or &quot;profiles&quot; and &quot;log in&quot; is a disturbing evolution to me,  blurring the line between public and private websites.  Traditionally, a website that is protected by a password is not &quot;open to the public&quot;.  If &quot;accounts&quot; are required then disabling the account can disable &quot;public access&quot;.  Accounts can be disabled for any reason.<p>Of course, that trend is probably driven by the commercialisation of the web as an advertiser&#x27;s wet dream.')
