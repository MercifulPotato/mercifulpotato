It&#x27;s awful. If you use the regular camera, it generates an HDR selfie exaggerating every imperfection on your face. And if you use portrait, it applies a fake looking blur and softness to your skin and is incredibly strict on framing.<p>Camera photography is moving further from realism and I don&#x27;t want a part of it.<p>Turn the camera around and you get similar problems. From detail-less low-light images, to sun-saturated indoor shots. It&#x27;s like everyone took the Samsung model and ran with it.<p>My DSLR is the only lens I have that can produce a realistic photo nowadays and give me access to the raw sensor data.')
