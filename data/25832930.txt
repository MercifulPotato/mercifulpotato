Most of my usual monthly travel would be on battery and the recharge time for something that small wouldn&#x27;t be an inconvenience. The hydrogen would only get used a couple of times a month, but if I needed to travel much longer distances, I&#x27;d have the freedom to do so without any range anxiety.')
