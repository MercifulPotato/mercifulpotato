Item(by='triceratops', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606339963, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25213997, text='&gt; I have yet to hear someone high on the left address why either they believe that the right&#x27;s stance on an unborn child&#x27;s right to the 5th is wrong<p>The argument is that an unborn child that can&#x27;t support itself outside the mother isn&#x27;t a whole life yet. And if accept that it is a whole life and the mother is obligated to use her body to sustain it, why don&#x27;t we apply that same argument for say mandatory organ donation? We don&#x27;t even do mandatory organ harvesting on dead bodies, let alone compel living people to donate organs, due to the principle of bodily autonomy.<p>&gt; I sincerely think that if the left took the time to argue against the steelmanned argument from the right,<p>I don&#x27;t agree, since most of the right&#x27;s objections are rooted in religion. You can&#x27;t convince someone to abandon what they consider an article of faith using logical arguments. The right also consistently opposes government support for poor mothers (the group most likely to get abortions) and children, and sex education (reduces abortions among teenagers, the next biggest group). If they were sincere about being &quot;pro-life&quot; rather than just &quot;anti-abortion&quot;, they would be strongly in support of these policies. Why bother arguing with people who don&#x27;t even act in a manner consistent with their proclaimed beliefs? What argument would they accept?')
