Never an easy task, but with everyone being remote we want to assess candidates remotely as much as possible, making it even harder to get to know someone in a very limited amount of time.<p>We are looking into different code assessment services, but it is hard to know which ones are good and some seem very intrusive from a privacy perspective with web cameras required and whatnot. Of course we can use video conferencing for straight up interviews. But I realise there must be plenty of tools I&#x27;m not aware of.<p>I&#x27;m wondering what has made online recruiting a great experience for you? Any particular services or tools you have been impressed with? Anything we should do to make the life of the applicants easier? Anything we should avoid at all cost?')
