Any subsequent events such as a ‘faithless elector’ will have no effect on the settlement of this market. In the event that no Presidential candidate receives a majority of the projected Electoral College votes, this market will be settled on the person chosen as President in accordance with the procedures set out by the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<p>This market will be void if an election does not take place in 2020. If more than one election takes place in 2020, then this market will apply to the first election that is held.<p>10&#x2F;03&#x2F;2020 10:30am – Once voting (whether postal, electronic or at the ballot box) begins in the year 2020 for the US Presidential Election 2020, the election will be deemed to have taken place for the purposes of this market. We will then settle the market as per our rules regardless of whether the election process is fully completed in 2020 or beyond.<p>If there is any material change to the established role or any ambiguity as to who occupies the position, then Betfair may determine, using its reasonable discretion, how to settle the market based on all the information available to it at the relevant time.

This is to allow customers to continue trading candidates that they have positions on and because each candidate is still a valid runner in this market.<p>Customers should be aware that:<p>Transmissions described as “live” by some broadcasters may actually be delayed.<p>The extent of any such delay may vary, depending on the set-up through which they are receiving pictures or data.<p>Please note, due to internal administrative procedures, the indicated start date&#x2F;time of this market is subject to change.
