New discoveries would require monstrous machinery that takes decades to design, plan, and build.<p>So to conclude that a decade was less productive just by counting the Nobel Prizes awarded to discoveries made in that decade is flawed. The &quot;lag&quot; just increases with difficulty so to speak.')
