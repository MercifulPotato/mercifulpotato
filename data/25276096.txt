The key would be greatly reducing the cost of the non-nuclear side of the power plant.  Perhaps the best approach would be replacing large steam turbines with far more compact supercritical CO2 turbines.  This would require temperatures somewhat higher than from PWRs.   And this (not thorium, not waste destruction, nor really even safety) is perhaps the best argument for molten salt reactors.')
