I, for one, never <i>decided</i> to work more, I simply don&#x27;t have a real choice. No one will hire a 15hr&#x2F;wk person except in positions that don&#x27;t pay enough per hour to make a living wage anyway. If I could cut my current salary to 37.5% to only work 15hr&#x2F;wk I&#x27;d do it in a heartbeat.')
