Instead, the value is (1) I&#x27;m required to have at least two days of 24&#x2F;7 recording history on the cameras and (2) they now know where these cameras are and the direction that face.<p>Thus, if a crime happens, they can come subpoena the footage. Simply knowing that there might be footage that could help solve a crime is super helpful to the police. But they don&#x27;t get automatic access or anything of the sort.')
