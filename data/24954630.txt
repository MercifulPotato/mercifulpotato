Or that it could just be used in one little local office of a multinational. Or that it&#x27;s just shelfware, bundled with whatever it is they bought that they actually wanted.<p>Everyone else thinks, &quot;Oh wow, X are using it? Must be good!&quot; And it grabs those people as customers. And that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s done.')
