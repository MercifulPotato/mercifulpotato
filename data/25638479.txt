The PI does things like Wake-on-lan the Desktop, working with Alexa (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flows.nodered.org&#x2F;node&#x2F;node-red-contrib-alexa-home" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flows.nodered.org&#x2F;node&#x2F;node-red-contrib-alexa-home</a>) and acting as a pi-hole. The Desktop listens for things like shutdown commands (from Alexa) and other commands to do things.<p>All together Node-Red just gives me the flexability to do everything at the &quot;right&quot; scope. The project is also cute as hell, just look at knolleary&#x27;s response here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;node-red&#x2F;node-red&#x2F;issues&#x2F;719" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;node-red&#x2F;node-red&#x2F;issues&#x2F;719</a>')
