So composites of multiple samples aren&#x27;t a suboptimal means of imaging atomic structure, they&#x27;re the only way. To do anything else would be to show only part of the probability field that is the atom.<p>(Right? I&#x27;ve been going back and forth about this since I saw those &quot;videos&quot; in 2015 of &quot;individual photons&quot;. My gut reaction was that those aren&#x27;t videos, they&#x27;re simulations that cleverly represent the probability of measuring a photon as the brightness of of the &quot;photon&quot;, but since we&#x27;re measuring inherently probabilistic things maybe that&#x27;s the only honest way to do it, in which case perhaps we ought to accept them as images.)')
