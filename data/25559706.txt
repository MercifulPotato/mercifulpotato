Your concern would be valid if the pay was really low but it is not. There are few companies that will significantly top that.<p>Sure, an employee might leave to Google for the money... if only Google had an office in London and they could get an interview and pass. It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s going to invariably happen over the next 6 months. It&#x27;s far fetched from the company to assume that.<p>In the meantime the candidate is out of a job because companies refuse to hire them (I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s ageism but that&#x27;s certainly something) and the company gets no work done because it&#x27;s understaffed.')
