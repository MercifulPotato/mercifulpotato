There were autograders that would test tons and tons of edge cases, so a large percent of my project time was analyzing my code trying to find which edge case I missed that was taking a point off my score. I also participated in CTFs which are all about finding security vulnerabilities (edge cases). If the senior developer is going to be expected to write a lot of code, then I would expect the senior developer to be adept at finding edge cases. If the senior developer isn&#x27;t going to be writing much code, then yes, a coding interview is maybe not so useful, and a more architecture-focused interview might be better.')
