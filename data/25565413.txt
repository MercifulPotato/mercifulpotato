Item(by='curryhoward', descendants=None, kids=[25566337, 25565938], score=None, time=1609204090, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25564565, text='&gt; Certain functional programmers corrupted this idea to somehow mean pure functions are free; that these functions can be executed one to infinity times and the result is the same.<p>I think you are conflating two things and attacking a strawperson. As someone who is very involved in the functional programming community, I&#x27;ve never heard anyone say that pure functions are &quot;free&quot;, and if this has been said it&#x27;s certainly not the majority perspective. The fact that a function gives you the same result given the same arguments is not meant to be some kind of encouragement to redundantly call a function many times. It&#x27;s meant to give you a tool to better reason about the program logically. You don&#x27;t have to worry about _when_ a pure function is called, because it doesn&#x27;t depend on hidden state that may change over time, and it doesn&#x27;t change anything about its environment.<p>In a sense, I think you seem to have been given the _opposite_ idea (not necessarily saying it was your misunderstanding vs. someone else poorly communicating to you); the fact that a function always gives you consistent results means that you never have to invoke it multiple times. In some sense, this viewpoint recognizes the cost of function execution even more than the zeitgeist.')
