You must like building them.<p>&gt; For the obvious reason that if you go read voat and gab that&#x27;s, um, literally what those dudes are saying. Like, I didn&#x27;t make up the shit about pizzas, man. Sometimes some things are just fact.<p>I&#x27;ve been on Gab in the past and while there were some that said that stuff like that, most weren&#x27;t.<p>&gt; Like, I didn&#x27;t make up the shit about pizzas, man.<p>Again keep on bringing up the crazy stuff while ignoring the stuff that is plausible. That is very disingenous.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m sure it must be very convincing that I am in cahoots with CNN weather because we both think it&#x27;s a sunny day in San Francisco today. Or maybe Big Calendar and I are conspiring to decide that today is Nov 15, a Saturday. After all, we&#x27;re saying the same thing. Coincidence? I THINK NOT!<p>I never that you were in cahoots with a news media. I said that you were repeating the same lines in the same manner. It is obvious that you are just repeating what they&#x27;ve said and then pretending on here that you are not.<p>&gt; Now, if you&#x27;ll excuse me, I have to go attend to my master. His nictitating membrane is giving him some trouble this morning. And I&#x27;ve got to learn from him what day we&#x27;re going to decide tomorrow is.<p>Can&#x27;t engage in an honest manner at all can you. It is all very tiresome.')
