Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=[25115636], score=None, time=1605551498, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25114969, text='I&#x27;m a huge Linux fan and used Linux natively on several laptops for nearly 20 years.<p>Even with all that experience and care picking good laptops, and even after Ubuntu and Xorg autoconfig made the driver situation much better, I found myself having to: Fix kernel graphics driver bugs (spans of random pixels occasionally drawn on the screen due to something extremely subtle deep in the Intel driver), sound driver bugs, and being annoyed that nothing worked right with Nvidia on one of them (neither Nvidia&#x27;s driver nor Nouveau worked properly), and debugging unreliable suspend.<p>Now I run Linux in a VM, and that&#x27;s been perfect for userspace development. On a Mac, the four-finger swipe switches beautifully between Mac and Linux full-screen desktops, as if neither OS is really in charge.  It feels more like running Xen, two OSes side by side, with Apple-quality GUI for switching and organising OSes.<p>Of course, not so good when the Apple device bricks.<p>The symptoms people are reporting now are very similar to what I saw when upgrading to Catalina - hours stuck on &quot;about a minute remaining&quot;, many reboots and with what looked like glitchy display errors and &quot;starting from scratch&quot; progress bars, leading to a worrying feeling it was stuck in a reboot cycle or just bricked.  I was immensely relieved when it eventually finished after hours of doing whatever it was doing, as I didn&#x27;t have a spare working computer (all my old Linux laptops have broken :-&#x2F;)  And that was after leaving it for nearly a year (I installed Catalina this summer), so the problems should have been &quot;ironed out&quot; by then.<p>I&#x27;m really glad I haven&#x27;t follow the system notification&#x27;s prompt to update to Big Sur.  From the Catalina experience, I suspect I&#x27;d be one of the brickage victims, and I can&#x27;t afford that right now.<p>If it were always possible to restore from backup (as it generally is with Linux and Windows) that would be fine, I&#x27;d take the risk.  But when Apple updates go wrong, it can be more serious as you can&#x27;t necessarily boot at all, even to restore from backup.')
