This isn&#x27;t an open source ESP8266 - it&#x27;s an ESP8266 soldered onto an open source PCB. It doesn&#x27;t have any wireless certifications so it&#x27;s really only good for DIY unless you&#x27;re planning to invest in getting the certifications, at which point you might as well work with the ESP8266 directly.')
