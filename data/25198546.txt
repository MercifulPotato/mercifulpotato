Very nice, you can &quot;unlock&quot; developer mode so you can control it over the local network. Super nice. Scripted up a simple thing running on a Raspberry pi + telegram bot for simple commands like &quot;movie&quot;, &quot;night&quot; etc without needing to switch apps or be on wifi.<p>Then my daughter said that it was so cool when it blinked in all colors and I realized she had flipped it on&#x2F;off till it factory reset itself.<p>Now I can&#x27;t commission them. At all. Both apps provided by Yeelight fail with timeouts, neither server works (you have to pick one, eg china, germany), and none of the troubleshooting steps help. Changing DNS server, wifi hotspot, etc etc. None works. They even have a bug where if your account number is large enough, it will fail since it can fit in the apparently int32_t they seem to store it in.<p>They are cheap, but I&#x27;m beyond frustrated that I can&#x27;t get them online again. The light was nice and bright, but the sw quality is apparently not on par.')
