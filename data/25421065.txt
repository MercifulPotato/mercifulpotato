The two M1 bars should have similar (but distinguishable colors). The two Intel bars should have similar, but distinguishable colors (they are the same!). They should all have similar luminance contrast with the background. Charts that use bars to represent things other than those categories should use different colors than the other bars (the blue and red are reused in the Go chart). The colors used for a given category should be consistent across all the charts (different colors are used when you get to the Redis test).')
