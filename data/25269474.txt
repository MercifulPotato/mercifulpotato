If everyone was &quot;policy abiding&quot; folks who will give a megacorp the benefit of the doubt, these won&#x27;t be disclosed for years.<p>The flippant attitude is exactly why and how you are reading of all these vulnerabilities now.<p>Knowledge of the issue (but enduring &quot;flippancy&quot;) or not knowing it at all? You pick.<p>What I&#x27;m really saying is that this &quot;flippancy&quot; is the agency that&#x27;s making someone write a blog post, sign their name to it, put it out there with code samples, etc. You dismissing &quot;flippancy&quot; is insulting the agency of this. Without that emotion, that idea where they thought Apple wasn&#x27;t treating them well, that is the source where people find the energy to publish, to publicise.<p>Every single word takes strength to write. In this case, the flippancy was the driving force and it shows clearly.<p>Why would you dismiss that energy?<p>And no, it&#x27;s not the author&#x27;s job to &quot;shield&quot; you from the wrath of their flippancy. I take it and I thank &quot;flippancy&quot; for disclosing this issue.')
