(I believe Facebook was actually the first to take action.) What if Google does it too?<p>In the past few years, we&#x27;ve seen these big tech companies operate in a manner that seems collusive. They follow each other&#x27;s cues. One company is the first to censor, and then the other companies follow very quickly with the exact same censorship. (The quick collective action tends to dilute the criticism against any single one of those companies.) It&#x27;s not just one company doing what it wants, it&#x27;s all the major players doing the same form of censorship.')
