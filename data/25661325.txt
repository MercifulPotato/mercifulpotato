Even if you could do that, I think it would be much better to get through a chapter then try to apply the algorithms of that chapter to Leetcode&#x2F;Codeforces question and cycle through the subjects as you advance through the book in a spaced repetition technique.<p>For me and for many other people the linear approach for studying that they suggest is far from ideal.')
