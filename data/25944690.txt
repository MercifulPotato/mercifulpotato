There was once a time when that sentiment was shared across the political spectrum, but lately it seems that &quot;the right&quot; remains undecided about whether or not it is acceptable to threaten the lives of politicians who refused to overturn the results of an election.  I still remember a time when both the left and right celebrated the strength of American democracy and the fact that people in America do not turn to violence when their side loses an election.  The fact that right wing activists are crying &quot;censorship&quot; when platforms react to an attempt to use violence to overturn the results of an election by banning the terrorists who organized that attack speaks volumes about how far America has fallen.<p>It was not all that long ago that right wing activists were joining left wing activists in demanding that tech companies stop providing service to ISIS.  Where were all these cries of censorship back then?  It is only now that the right wing of American politics has aligned itself with terrorists that they have started whining about &quot;free speech&quot; and calling for increased regulation of tech companies that dare to kick terrorists off their platforms.')
