Arduino + PlatformIO is plain fun to work with.<p>As a professional (as in getting paid to do it), I shed being ashamed of using Arduino a while ago. With PlatformIO, you have great tooling and you can avoid the garbage that are the vendor supplied IDEs. And even tough the Arduino HAL isn&#x27;t exactly elegant, I can switch between uCs without having to learn a new API. I can even port between uCs by simply changing some pin names and so on.<p>I&#x27;m currently looking into other frameworks, like Zephyr, to trade up from Arduino, and I&#x27;m especially looking into using Rust in the future (because Rust would give me an actual benefit to offset the cost of using the &quot;harder&quot; language, which will in the long run make stuff easier).<p>But the ease of use, especially ease of prototyping, of Arduino + PlatformIO is now the baseline.<p>There is also MicroPython and Espruino - again, stuff that people will make fun of for you using, but you won&#x27;t care because you will have to much fun using it. Performance and size penalties means they don&#x27;t work for all problems, but often enough, they do.<p>There is even working examples for using Swift on uCs - and I really wish that language was better supported under Linux.')
