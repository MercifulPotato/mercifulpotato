You and I might disagree but out of the 195 countries on earth the only ones who recognize Taiwan is a country are these few:<p>Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Paraguay, Nicaragua, Belize, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent And The Grenadines, Marshall Islands, Saint Kitts And Nevis, Palau, Tuvalu, Nauru, Vatican City.<p>Comparing that to the 139 countries that recognise the State of Palestine (where Israel can still do as they damn well please!) and it is quite easy to see that while some might <i>pretend</i> to care about Taiwan (like the US) all they really care about in the end is the money to be made from trading with&#x2F;in PRC.<p>&gt;<i>China will think twice about invading.</i><p>PRC doesn&#x27;t invade. It isn&#x27;t the US. It gains influence in much more subtle and intelligent ways than bombing people but <i>if</i> they wanted to they could do to Taiwan what Israel does to Palestine and no one would do anything but talk talk talk.')
