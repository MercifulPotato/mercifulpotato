There is much more diversity in individual states depending on where you are than in most European countries.<p>You ever been in Spain, Italy, Germany or France?<p>This is simply not true, in Spain they have so many different languages, in the others they have incredibly dialects that seem like entirely different languages and can be only as short as 25km away from one another--something like Badish vs schwabish vs Alemansich vs Hoch Deutsch.<p>You have to live in places like Hawaii (which I did) before you get anything close to the stark differences I&#x27;m talking about, where they have an entirely different set of culture and language (Hawaiian pidgin) to see what is so pervasive all throughout Southern and Central Europe.')
