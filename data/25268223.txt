Using a condition in the state machine, this can be done in a loop, so when the AWS Lambda function reaches its timeout, another one gets triggered as long as there is still data in the SQS queue.<p>If data doesn&#x27;t have to be processed sequentially an option is to configure the AWS Lambda function to get invoked for new data in the SQS queue [1], so you don&#x27;t have to care about manually fetching data from SQS at all.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;lambda&#x2F;latest&#x2F;dg&#x2F;with-sqs.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;lambda&#x2F;latest&#x2F;dg&#x2F;with-sqs.html</a>')
