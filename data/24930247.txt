A government has a civic duty to make regulatory and legal information as easy to understand as possible, for the widest gamut of possible readers who are subject to the laws of the land.<p>However, those sites have a captive audience: anyone smarter than the &#x27;lowest common denominator&#x27; UK GOV target reader, any reader who might have appreciated a more concise and less &#x27;hand-held&#x27; style, is going to keep reading anyway, because the information is important and non-negotiable.<p>Outside of that context, most pieces you might like to read were commissioned with maximum word-counts, varying levels of assumed readership skill and prior knowledge, and diverse other factors that defy any &#x27;universal style-guide&#x27;, such as TFA is trying to formulate.<p>For instance, I write about technology for a living. Those commissions have word-count restrictions that force me to either:<p>- Say less, so that I can maintain a level of English suitable for a moderately-skilled non-English speaker (As you can imagine, the editor does not want me to &#x27;say less&#x27;).<p>- Use more compressed and concise language that may be more challenging for the non-native reader (because concision can be antithetical to simplicity [and my editor also wants prose that is accessible to the widest number of readers without alienating the target demographic for that particular piece]).<p>- Write boldly and use footnotes and references to justify the claims I am making, because:<p>a) I don&#x27;t have enough word-count for &#x27;explainers&#x27; and &#x27;box-outs&#x27;<p>b) I&#x27;m expected to deliver a <i>lot</i> of information, and<p>c) I&#x27;m expected to write in the simplest style available, depending on the intent of the commission.<p>It&#x27;s bad enough that the dictates of SEO have dumbed down so much content from once-great news and analysis providers over the last ten years. Let&#x27;s not support any further race to the bottom, but rather aim to write lean and information-rich material in a style that&#x27;s matched to the readership.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;guidance&#x2F;content-design&#x2F;writing-for-gov-uk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;guidance&#x2F;content-design&#x2F;writing-for-gov-u...</a>')
