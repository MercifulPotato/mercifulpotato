It’s on the accusing party to provide that evidence and they haven’t. It also strikes me as strange that they’re targeting only the cities that they are. Detroit for example when it was actually Oakland and Kent Counties that most altered the outcome in Michigan for Trump.<p>Election officials have many ways to audit elections for example knowing exactly who voted in an election how and where.<p>To fill out and mail thousands of ballots you’d need to have them in the first place.
