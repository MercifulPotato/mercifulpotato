I think better reporting should be required.  I see what I see and that&#x27;s good enough for my opinion right now.<p>The biggest part I don&#x27;t like is how people are being pushed towards shelters to adopt dogs and pitbulls of unknown origin are the highest percentage of dogs available in those shelters.  Whether it&#x27;s their bred in nature or their nurture.  I think a combination of both, but I don&#x27;t think these shelters should be pushing these dogs onto families. Especially ones that have killed family pets before and are being advertised as &quot;good with children&quot;')
