I&#x27;m not sure it would increase the environmental externalities.<p>Since transaction inclusion is a marketplace and since most products we care about will continue to be denominated in local currencies I don&#x27;t think transaction fees will change much as the price of bitcoin changes.<p>As the dollar-denominated value of a 0.01btc fee increases people will become less willing to spend that 0.01btc. There might be some stickiness but I expect the kwh-denominated fees will grow much more slowly than the price of bitcoin.')
