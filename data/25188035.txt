Very different problems. The former is as equal parts art as it is engineering. Building your own CPU will be vastly simpler. Whether or not Google has the same level of coordination between HW and SW to have Android benefit so greatly, I don’t know. It’s also unclear how big a step building the CPU is for Google. Lots of talented people on that project. That being said, it’s already behind schedule if I recall correctly so it legitimately could be causing them problems. Or they don’t have enough direction and good leadership to actually execute competently')
