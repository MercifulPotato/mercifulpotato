Basically, would you hire a babysitter with a criminal record or one without a criminal record and good references?<p>Maybe my employees break the law when they&#x27;re not at work, but that&#x27;s none of my business.  If one of my employees is indicted or cited for rioting &#x2F; DUI, welp I&#x27;ll fire them on the spot.<p>Also, re &quot;all crimes are behind you once you leave prison&quot; - how would you explain repeat offenders?  At this point I&#x27;m trusting my business against statistics of a felon committing a crime again lmao.')
