Attractive &#x2F; high value men are happy to sleep with less attractive women they wouldn&#x27;t consider as &#x27;relationship material&#x27;.<p>2. Women are generally more sexually liberated so there&#x27;s an increasing chance they will have had several of these encounters, and therefore believe they are entitled to men of the same level (also known as becoming an &#x27;alpha widow&#x27;).<p>Like most of these theories it&#x27;s pretty depressing to contemplate, but I&#x27;m yet to see a convincing refutation of it.')
