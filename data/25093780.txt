This is because, prior to the internet, powerful people were able to get away with too much evil with too little punishment. (&quot;Nothing wrong&quot; here, to me, means &quot;for the greater good of society&quot;).<p>The problem is when this same internet mob protocol gets applied to average citizens.  The internet mob deals massive amounts of damage to a person&#x27;s reputation and psyche.  And, there&#x27;s no way to temper the punishment to meet the crime.  For your average wrong-doer, it&#x27;s extreme overkill.<p>Take, for example, the woman who recently got called out for making racist comments to a black man in the park.  She was clearly in the wrong, but her entire life is ruined now due to the internet mob.  The punishment did not fit the crime.')
