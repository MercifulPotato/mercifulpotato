From that I can assume they have a better b2b model.\nWolt prices are higher, even though DeliveryHero prices are already higher, including the distance extra payment for me it makes it stupid to order.\nI understand that the drivers get paid more and it is obvious, but as a consumer to pay 30% more for a delivery, is insane.\nBack in the day you would get FREE delivery from restaurants and even extras.\nBeing corona lockdown I prefer to walk and get my food.<p>This is not a judgement against Wolt, but against this whole delivery system.')
