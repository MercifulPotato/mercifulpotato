Being sued for pain and suffering because an accident occurred that wasn&#x27;t your fault, that&#x27;s not small.  Things like that literally ruin your life.<p>You can make the argument, &quot;Well, they should know better, and if not it doesn&#x27;t matter.&quot;  I find that weak.  The legal system is amazingly complex around business and fault during accidents. It&#x27;s so complex, that there are attorneys that spend their entire career focusing on things like this. When dealing with insurance there is no, &quot;Well it&#x27;s ok, I&#x27;m insured.&quot; It&#x27;s, &quot;I&#x27;m insured if I can prove I didn&#x27;t break any of the insurance contract rules,&quot; and the people on the other side, they&#x27;re all better at this than you are. Most people who drive for Uber, etc. have no idea this is how it really is.  The driving companies have pushed all this off to individuals, because they know the consequences of them getting involved, and this is why there needs to be laws surrounding things like this.')
