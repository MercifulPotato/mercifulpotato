Well is France BTC transfer are much faster than traditional bank transfer, and we are not talking about international bank transfer that could take up to a week, and require 5 or 6 banks and institutions to work together (and you have to trust each of those institution), and the cost will be mush higher than an (already expensive) BTC transaction...<p>But Bitcoin is not really a currency used for everyday life transaction, it is more like digital gold. As such it is doing well !<p>He is saying we can trust bank, and as such crypto and DeFi have no use. Some people feel otherwise, for 4 different points.<p>1) Some bank do fail... Icelandic&#x27;s bank are a big example in Europe. 2008 is another example... People did lost some money there, despite massive state intervention.<p>2) Government can go and take part of the money you have in your bank account. Cyprus (part of the EU, not a random third world dictatorship) is an example of it<p>3) Government and central bank choose the monetary policy, which has a direct impact on the value the money you get into your bank account<p>4) Bank &quot;use&quot; your money in your account the way they want, not the way you want. You have a very little say in the current banks.<p>BTC do consume a lot of energy... But there are other ways to do transaction with a much lower environmental impact (eg lightening network) and most other leading blockchain are using or moving toward much much much more energy efficient protocol.<p>BTC is pseudonymous, but you can use other network to do anonymous transaction if needed')
