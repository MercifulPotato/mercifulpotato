If you come up with something that has no competitors, either:<p>-you didn&#x27;t look hard enough<p>-you are a genius who spotted an untapped demand (very unlikely)<p>-no-one wants it (very likely)<p>Also, remember that the main competitor to a lot of software is Excel and post-it notes.<p>That said, the more competitors the harder it is to get noticed.
