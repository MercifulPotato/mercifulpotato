I always assumed that by the next generation, people are basically locals if their parents immigrated well. You&#x27;re an example that it also works well within one generation.<p>But many european people who lean against open immigration policies will not make the rational distinction between you and someone who has not intergrated very well, and will instead judge you based on e.g. your skin color or your last name.<p>I hope you don&#x27;t have to deal with that!')
