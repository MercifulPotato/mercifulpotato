The video covers the basic idea of witnessing this using polarizing filters, as well as explaining Bell&#x27;s inequalities using basic discrete set theory and Venn diagrams.<p>We don&#x27;t have to lose reality; we could instead lose locality. However, then we also lose most of physical causality and spatial relevance. [0] covers all of the material but takes more than 20min to read. At the end of it, we&#x27;re left with a very weak theory that has trouble ruling out FTL influences.<p>On the second point, it doesn&#x27;t particularly matter whether those natural laws exist; my point was that they&#x27;re not fully knowable. There&#x27;s no reason why the universe ought to admit a short legible encoding of its own structure, especially considering that such structure ought not be observable by creatures like us residing in the universe.<p>Rather than knowing <i>the</i> natural laws, we know predictive models which are good approximations. There is fundamental uncertainty preventing our approximations from sharpening to some arbitrarily fine precision.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quantum_nonlocality" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quantum_nonlocality</a>')
