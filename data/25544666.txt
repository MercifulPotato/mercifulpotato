The potential I see in Palantir is that they have the base infrastructure covered (talent, tech stack, business relationships) to connect to all sorts of disconnected database sources.<p>The 2nd step will be to analyze that data for insights using opensource or in-house engineered algorithms - not Palantir&#x27;s role right now.<p>Ex: My past firm played with Datarobot&#x27;s AI solutions which tried to outsource data scientists as &quot;consultants&quot; but did not work very well due to lack of data engineering&#x2F;domain expertise.<p>Could this be Palantir&#x27;s next move?<p>Note: This may sound mildly speculative, but trying to approach it from an engineering and business perspective.')
