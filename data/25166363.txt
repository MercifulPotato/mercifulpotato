Some 16 years ago at a company I worked with we were testing some mini industrial PC and embedded boards for a project, so we had to download lots of documentation from the manufacturers site which was located in Taiwan. Those weren&#x27;t home or business PC boards, their site target audience would be mostly engineers and technicians but it was anyway ridden with Flash blinking buttons and heavy (albeit minimalistic, still awful) graphics for everything where a highlighted text link would suffice.\nThat site was a nightmare to use, and the slow bandwidth when connecting there from the EU certainly didn&#x27;t help.\nBut there weren&#x27;t lots of ads, quite the opposite, they used Flash and blinky objects extensively like their page had to draw more attention on a multi screen wall against other pages, just like a billboard. They weren&#x27;t alone however as I recall having seen in the past other Asian manufacturers technical sites doing essentially the same thing.')
