But that is an extraordinary person.<p>If you are a reasonable person and are going to actually live in SF - you have to adjust your expenses accordingly. Your rent&#x2F;mortgage, your shopping trips, your recreational activities, etc... and you realise that your social outing costs you $200, instead of $30... and you don&#x27;t have the ability to host it at home, because all of your friends live 2-4 hours away or you have a $5000 p&#x2F;m home in a convenient location.<p>The reason why I say this - I lived in Helsinki, Dublin, London, NYC, San Francisco, Palo Alto and back to NYC. Me and my husband are both SWE, well paid. I literally went through the change of attitudes towards &quot;living a life&quot;.')
