Item(by='corty', descendants=None, kids=[25332840], score=None, time=1607352001, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25331093, text='I don&#x27;t know about the rest of the EU, but for Germany at least, your assumption is dangerously wrong.<p>As the party at fault in an accident, you are on the hook for the total amount of damages, no caps or limits, in cases of negligence, intent or &quot;inherent danger&quot; (if you drive a car, hit a pedestrian, and no fault can be found with anyone, the car&#x27;s driver is on the hook because of the &quot;inherent danger&quot; of the car). The car insurance only covers up to the pre-agreed limits in cases of inherent danger and negligence. For intent, they have to make the victim whole and then get the money back from you.<p>Healthcare cost will be initially covered by the healthcare provider of the victim in all cases, but if you are found to be legally at fault, the healthcare provider will collect the bill from you or your liability insurance as the party at fault. To the full amount they can extract, no limits. They won&#x27;t do that for just a few scratches, because usually they don&#x27;t know what that bill was for until their client tells them about it. But for larger bills, they will inquire and then come to collect. If the collection exceeds the limits of your liability insurance, a court determines intent or you did something else the liability insurance doesn&#x27;t cover (e.g. non-named driver in limited contracts, knowingly driving a dangerous vehicle, using a vehicle insured as private use in a commercial (Uber) setting) you will pay...<p>Oh, and in Germany, only liability insurance covering the 3rd party&#x27;s damages is necessary, the rest is voluntary. Your limits sound about right.')
