Item(by='shripadk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611892790, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25953047, text='&gt; where numerous --highly downvoted-- comments quite correctly predicted what was coming.<p>I got banned for &quot;flamewar&quot; when I literally was opposing this form of censorship in those articles.
