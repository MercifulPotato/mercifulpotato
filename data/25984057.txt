Item(by='tylerhou', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612138357, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25983409, text='&gt; The obvious discontinuity is &quot;never have to work&quot;.<p>First, wanting to achieve &quot;financial independence&quot; does not imply a discontinuous utility function.<p>Suppose it takes $X to reach financial independence. Let&#x27;s say that when I achieve $X, I have utility Y. It is possible that as I approach $X from the left, my utility continuously approaches Y.<p>In fact, I argue that&#x27;s what happens for most people who have a FIRE goal â€” they get happier and happier until they reach their goal. (It&#x27;s true that once they <i>reach</i> their goal and experience retired life, they decide that retirement&#x27;s not all that it&#x27;s cracked up to be, but I argue that&#x27;s because their utility has dropped because of another variable has changed: they have stopped working.)<p>In other words, &quot;wanting to not have to work again&quot; and &quot;having a continuous utility function&quot; do not contradict each other. And the people who are dedicated to saving enough money to not have to work (FIRE) almost always have utility functions that are continuous wrt. money!<p>&gt; when they talk about this stuff.<p>Again, people might <i>say</i> that they have a discontinuous utility function, but talk is cheap. Real economists (TM) measure utilities through examining a consumer&#x27;s revealed preferences because what people <i>say</i> doesn&#x27;t always reflect what people <i>do</i>.')
