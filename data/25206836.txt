The US encouraged the Indonesian leaders to avoid that. Part of the problem was ethnic politics and loyalty - Chinese businessmen control finance in SE Asia, and the native Indonesian leaders decided to do something about that under the guise of &quot;communism bad&quot;<p>- the US until today is the primary military supporter of Indonesia, training virtually all of their air force pilots. The C-130 and F-16 are their main aircraft.<p>So when people criticize US involvement in Indonesia, I remind them that the US is their biggest friend, from 1945 until today. In return, the US has never colonized that country in any way.<p>For those who haven&#x27;t visited Indonesia, the country made huge economic strides from 2000 to 2019, and if not for corona, would be doing very well economically. Central Jakarta, the capital, is very nice.<p>Regarding the South American anti-communist actions, that is what it took to prevent it taking root. You can see what the alternative is in Venezuela, a former oil exporter, essentially a destroyed country  because of it.<p>Or closer to home, the burning of our downtowns by Marxists.')
