Item(by='criley2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606315440, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25209469, text='&gt;It&#x27;s not that people want to create division. But the left becomes upset with your product if you show them rightwing opinions, so if you want to have rightwing content you have to make bubbles so they don&#x27;t see it.<p>It&#x27;s funny, but it&#x27;s actually the opposite.<p>The right wing folks using Facebook become so incensed and outraged at being shown left wing content that they complain all the way to Congress, and the radical right-wing politicians who are slaves to the whims of the populist movement then haul social media executives in front of Congress and literally pepper them with ignorant conspiracy theories.<p>Facebook has notably had to wine and dine famous radical conservatives for years to prevent negative press, something they never have to do with the left.<p>Facebook notably even created &quot;Conservative-only&quot; high level level positions to ensure that their entitled right-wing users were placated. They added outright propaganda outlets to their &quot;Fact Checking Initiative&quot; not based on any objective metric, but on the political calculus of &quot;Both-sides-ism -- we&#x27;ll put your fact checker next to this liar, both sides get a spot at the table&quot;.<p>When you look at the radical right-wing populist movement, the search for Parler and more right-wing safe spaces, and how they use their fact-free media and conspiracy theory-friendly politicians to push truly ridiculous nonsense, I think you can see the full picture of a quickly-radicalizing right wing populist base that becomes incensed and even violent when viewing left-wing or moderate&#x2F;centrist content.<p>Remember, this is an America where Fox News is currently being abandoned for being &quot;part of the Left&quot;, and there are millions who are abandoning Facebook and Fox News for Parler and OANN, so you have to see this as the radical right actively seeking out and creating ever more ideologically pure safe spaces.')
