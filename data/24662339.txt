That error could have easily occured if the application linked an old version of that library and the new version of the daemon was incompatible.<p>But that wouldn&#x27;t happen in a distro-packages environment, because the distribution would ensure that everything was built against the same version of the library.<p>&gt; This is an issue Linux created because everyone makes their own solution and then distro managers will silently patch over the mistakes, so it all kinda works together.<p>And flatpak is yet another case of that - doing their own incompatible thing instead of fixing what&#x27;s there already.')
