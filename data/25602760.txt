Roughly speaking, the effectiveness of the vaccine should be the same as long as the shape of the spike protein doesnâ€™t change.<p>The most important mutation in the new VOC 202012&#x2F;01 variant (N501T) translates to tighter binding to the ACE2 receptor, which should have no effect on its structure. However, that variant has also a double deletion (residues 69 and 70 are removed) that might induce slight conformational changes.<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that vaccines are polyclonal: the antibodies produced by them target several different regions of the spike protein. This implies that the virus would need to mutate several times in separate parts to be able to evade immunity effectively.')
