My expected reaction isn&#x27;t &quot;laws&#x2F;CoC should be discarded&quot; but &quot;CoCs and their enforcement process is seriously flawed and needs revising.&quot;<p>Here there seem to be two issues: 1. Too-vague rules &amp; 2. Unfair enforcement.<p>If we punished people for murder by forming a posse and summarily executing them, the reaction should be &quot;yes murder should be forbidden but this enforcement process is seriously unfair and needs to be overhauled.&quot;<p>If we punish people for &quot;being unkind&quot; the reaction should be &quot;this rule is unfair because it&#x27;s not clear how one can go about following it and it is likely to be enforced highly subjectively which is likely to lead to enforcement based on personal bias, favoritism etc..&quot;<p>What I think the author might see if he examined the situation with an open mind is that &quot;be kind&quot; (a rule he doesn&#x27;t like) and &quot;don&#x27;t be sexist&quot; (a rule he likes) <i>both</i> suffer from the issue of being vague and susceptible to extremely subjective interpretation. Reasonable people can (and do!) disagree about what is &quot;kind,&quot; what is &quot;sexist,&quot; or what is &quot;racist,&quot; but these rules ignore this fact and take an &quot;I&#x27;ll know it when I see it&quot; approach to kindness, sexism, racism etc. that is subject to the problems of arbitrariness, bias, and favoritism in <i>all</i> cases. I&#x27;m &quot;haha&quot;ing at the fact that the author refuses to consider this aspect of the problem: that it goes beyond just his case (other people think <i>he&#x27;s</i> bad) to the cases of people that <i>he</i> thinks are bad.')
