Or maybe MBAs are really just that vacuous, I don&#x27;t know.<p>PG has wrote some really great essays (the Submarine Article, anyone?). I&#x27;ve read all of them, some of them many times. But if I&#x27;m being completely honest, lately it feels like he&#x27;s writing to write instead of writing because he has something genuinely new and insightful to say.<p>PG does have a good, prescriptive insight here: you should constantly question what the truth is in a manner of detached concern. You could more concisely call it dispassionate skepticism.<p>But take away all the dressing about conventionality and thinking in ways others don&#x27;t, and drill down into that one idea. That would be a great essay.')
