The people saying that are not being narrow with their definitions like you are here.<p>So if people live their life having people around them using the word politics like in my phrases above they will also start using the word that way. A way that does not match up with your definitions.<p>&gt; You’re confusing “controversial” with “political”.<p>So when you say things like the above it comes off to me as unreasonable&#x2F;uncharitable. Since the people you are talking to are using a set of definitions that are relatively common in my experience.<p>edit: unreasonable -&gt; unreasonable&#x2F;uncharitable<p>---<p>&gt; I’ve never heard anyone told not to talk about those things because they’re political, but I could believe they were told not to talk about them because they’re controversial.<p>Knowledge and understanding of a topic is required before reasoned action is taken. If you can not talk about abortion, birth control, sexual&#x2F;gender discrimination, gay marriage, and more because it is controversial then we might be getting in to an area where speech is so restricted that it impedes knowledge transfer and understanding on those topics.<p>In order to have an informed populace then need to be exposed to things, sometime controversial. If you remove a reasonably large mechanism for that, conversation at work, it will have political consequences.')
