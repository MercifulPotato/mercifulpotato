Just a random fact. &quot;Draw your own conclusions&quot; is not helpful.<p>Really? I can think of a narrative here about the virus being not as serious as people thought.<p>I can&#x27;t relate to your complain at all. We want more straight fact not &quot;helpful&quot; opinions. If someone can&#x27;t form an opinion on their own it&#x27;s fine, just dont participate in the discussion. The last thing we want is some people joining some discussion just to magnify other people&#x27;s thoughts.')
