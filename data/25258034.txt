It needs to take well to grafting. It needs to be resistant to pests and diseases, and thrive well on the kinds of fertilizers readily available to farmers. It needs to grow well in orchards. It needs to be easy for pickers to pick. It needs to grow fairly regular shapes and not look too ugly.<p>Without all of that, it could perhaps find itself a niche spot in specialty orchards if it tastes amazing or otherwise piques people&#x27;s attention. There are a few thousand varieties grown that way. But a lot of those are in danger of disappearing if people lose interest, and we&#x27;ve already lost thousands of named varieties of apple.<p>To really take off it needs to be friendly to farmers in all of the ways I mentioned, or they just won&#x27;t grow it.')
