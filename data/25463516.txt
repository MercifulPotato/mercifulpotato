And why shouldn&#x27;t a group try to limit their liability?<p>&gt;&quot;I have read and agree to the privacy policy,&quot; is a coded way of saying, &quot;I have read and agree to waive my claims to privacy, as outlined in the privacy policy.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s often, but not always true.  For example, here&#x27;s a [sanitized] privacy policy I wrote for a website I set up for a specific (noncommercial) purpose:<p>&quot;[Site] Privacy Policy<p>No personal information^ will be stored on the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.[site]" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.[site]</a> web server (except as specifically authorized), and every effort will be made to  protect the integrity and privacy of such information.<p>[Site], its management or assignees will never sell personal information collected on this site, nor will they use such information for purposes other than specifically related to the operation of the [Site] website and&#x2F;or to facilitate the dissemination of information regarding [purpose of site] and other group activities related to [potential users]  and other [user purpose] related group activities.<p>Under no circumstances will street address or telephone number information be stored on the www.[site] by [Site], its management or assignees.<p>[Site], its management and assignees will never, under any circumstances reveal email addresses, street addresses and&#x2F;or telephone numbers to anyone without explicit authorization.  From time to time, [site] may offer services to allow [potential users] to contact each other.  For these services, [Site], its management and assignees makes no warrantee of fitness for any purpose, including maintaining the privacy of users&#x27; personal information.<p>All personal information will be held in confidence and will only used for the purposes of the [potential users] [purpose of site] and official [membership organization] business.<p>This business includes (but is not limited to) providing personal information for inclusion (by the [membership organization])  in a printed work to be published at a later date.  If this published work is then used for illegal and&#x2F;or nuisance purposes, [Site], its management and assignees disavow any responsibility or liability for the use of that information by third parties for any purpose.<p>If a subscriber (limited to members of the [potential users]) chooses to share their personal information with other subscribers via any mechanism made available through the [Site] web site, mailing list or other conveyance provided by [Site], its management and assignees disavow any responsibility or liability for the use of that information by third parties for any purpose.<p>Under no circumstances will [Site], its management or assignees be liable or otherwise legally responsible for the theft, misuse or other unauthorized use of personal information.<p>Any person or entity registering on, providing contact information, or subscribing to the [Site] web site explicitly agrees to all the terms of this privacy policy.<p>This policy applies to the www.[Site] web site and the [Purpose of site]@[Site] mailing list.<p>If any portion of this policy is found, by any competent jurisdiction, to be invalid or unlawful, the remainder of this policy will continue to be in force.<p>The  terms of this policy may be modified at any time at the discretion of [Site].  It is the responsibility of the subscriber to review the terms of this policy on a regular basis.  Current versions of this policy can be found at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.[site]&#x2F;privacy.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.[site]&#x2F;privacy.html</a>.<p>^Personal Information: Data such as street address, email address and telephone number which would enable direct contact with the subject of that information.&quot;<p>It does two specific things:<p>1.  Informs users how their PII will (and will not) be used;<p>2. Clarifies the liability of those who own&#x2F;run the site.<p>Unlike <i>most</i> &quot;privacy&quot; policies, there&#x27;s nothing underhanded or privacy invading&#x2F;data stealing involved.<p>I wish more privacy policies were like that.')
