Item(by='bmitc', descendants=None, kids=[25569696], score=None, time=1609236722, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25568163, text='&gt; It&#x27;s usually implied that it would also increase the healthspan, rather than prolonging suffering.<p>As I&#x27;ve stated multiple times now, this is only true if you consider suffering related to health, and I am not considering just health-related suffering. Please read my other comments before replying. I keep getting replies <i>only</i> talking about health in the very physical and medical sense. When I say &quot;quality of life&quot;, I mean it in the holistic sense. For example, if someone who is poor, disenfranchised, has no retirement, lives paycheck to paycheck, lives in heavy pollution both of air and water, etc., is living longer really on top of their list?<p>And of course, no one has addressed the societal issues that longevity creates.<p>&gt; Aging itself isn&#x27;t something you die from, you die from age related deceases.<p>That&#x27;s kind of pointless semantics, but anyway, it doesn&#x27;t address anything I&#x27;ve said.<p>If we go back to the original query: &quot;what are you surprised isn&#x27;t being work on?&quot;, then is it really surprising longevity is a niche thing when there&#x27;s so much else to work on (i.e., so much going wrong)? If someone really thinks longevity is interesting enough, then I&#x27;d like to see the political, societal, and environmental, not just the medical, arguments and solutions that would need to come along with it to make it a net positive.<p>Wanting longevity seems to be a rather privileged position.')
