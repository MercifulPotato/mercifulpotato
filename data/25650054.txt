Because last I checked, the composer can demand royalties (if it&#x27;s not so old that it expired).<p>Of course you can sell physical things. You can even sell digital things, but transformative works are a way of creative expression. Or, say, a live streamer on Twitch doing an IRL (using a mobile uplink while out and about) getting their content (people seem to like it, so it appears to have some value) deleted&#x2F;banned because a car with an open window waiting at the stoplight had the radio on.<p>And I don&#x27;t know where you got that I&#x27;m making six figures. I&#x27;m just not aware of individual artists making a living by selling digital copies of their work. I&#x27;m not saying they should put a free-download button there, but having to keep track of who made which parts when (copyright and expiry) is a gigantic pain, especially for small artists who do transformative work.<p>I&#x27;m primarily attacking the rent-seeking model of software houses and (at least most of) the MPAA &amp; RIAA.<p>I want to encourage work-for-hire (potentially payed by a collective) and Patreon-like models over rent-seeking business &quot;propositions&quot;. The benefit is that all the censorship for reasons other than legality and bookkeeping for royalties would be gone. It would enable far better privacy, too.')
