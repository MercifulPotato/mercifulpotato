There are a couple issues that I&#x27;ve noticed. The first, especially pertinent to the bass, is that the sound doesn&#x27;t come from any single place, so you have to find a sweet spot for the mic, that captures a representative tone quality, and that doesn&#x27;t collide with the bow, etc.<p>With the violin, that place is probably above the fiddle, so you have to find a way to dangle your phone, or put a mic on a stand. Especially since you&#x27;re probably standing to play, for reasons of good posture.<p>And you want the mic to be close, basically to drown out the effects of typically bad room acoustics unless you&#x27;re lucky to have a nice recording room. Plus, noise from HVAC and other sources.<p>And... mainstream recording apps for primarily voice use have built in compression and possibly other artifacts that you have to figure out how to turn off.<p>And... if you want audio <i>and</i> video, it further constrains your options. You often need your teacher to see you play, to comment on posture and technique issues.<p>Once it&#x27;s all working, then the mic in a cell phone and its audio input hardware are actually surprisingly decent. The tiny little condenser mic elements are fairly high fidelity, and an audio codec is pretty much a slam dunk nowadays.')
