That&#x27;s it. There is no other reason.<p>Jobs could not <i>say</i> that of course, so he used his massive platform to assert that HTML5 was just as good as Flash, and that Flash was &quot;riddled with security holes&quot;.<p>None of it was true, of course, but Jobs had charisma and a massive following of True Believers, and so his frontal assault on a competitor was successful.<p>An entire industry and platform destroyed so that Apple could not only control what games were played on its platform, but to charge for them<p><i></i> Yes, Flash had security issues, like every platform and program and browser ever, but there was nothing about Flash that was <i>uniquely terrible</i> the way Jobs and his minions asserted')
