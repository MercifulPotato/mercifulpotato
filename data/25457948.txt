These tend to be a <i>lot</i> less expensive (because making them is much more efficient for the manufacturer) than regular foods, and are more readily available and time-convenient when compared to other foods.<p>That&#x27;s how you can easily get to 50% or more of your daily intake with them.  If you&#x27;re already short on time, or if you have several family members at home who need to be fed quickly, or if you have a lower income and cannot easily afford fresh food items and the utensils with which to prepare them, you will buy and eat lots of ultra-processed foods.')
