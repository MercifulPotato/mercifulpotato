Say, when positive cases per population or per test given are below X, for instance.  It&#x27;s likely that the &#x27;right&#x27; number that makes sense for not having masks is pretty low, and possibly lower than will be realistically gotten to without widespread effective vaccine or other significant change in the landscape. (Some countries like Australia or New Zealand got there without a vaccine; we&#x27;ve missed that boat, if it was ever possible here).<p>The &quot;right&quot; number for masks should be pretty low because the social&#x2F;economic&#x2F;etc &quot;cost&quot; of masks -- while I agree it is non-zero -- is lower than about any other effective measures. Closing schools or businesses, for instance. You&#x27;d want to resort to universal mask use before closing schools, because the social&#x2F;economic cost of closing schools is so much higher. Masks are pretty effective at comparatively much lower cost, so make sense to be a much earlier resort. (although I agree non-zero; I find masks very uncomfortable and hard to breathe in myself). At <i>this</i> point in the US, numbers are bad enough that masks are a no-brainer and we need a lot more than that.<p>Those against wearing masks might also be contributing to a rational conversation about costs and benefits more if they talked about under what conditions they thin masks <i>would</i> be appropriate -- say, what number of covid cases diagnosed per 100K population would make masks well-advised?<p>I wonder how many people against wearing masks basically think there are <i>no</i> conditions under which masks are advisable though.')
