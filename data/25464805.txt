Though, you&#x27;re right, a pretty big percentage of people just don&#x27;t seem to care about this kind of thing, at least consciously.  They may dislike some specific frictional aspect of these limitations, but never quite understand the technical&#x2F;practical reasons behind them.<p>When I first got into Macs, my first experiences of dabbling with the system was being able to edit literally anything on the computer with ResEdit, renaming key system-related files and menu items, or the shutdown message, or change key-commands of menu items in programs I used.  I felt like I could do anything.  This sense of control and ownership over my computer has slowly decreased as they become more abstract and DRM&#x2F;gatekeeping&#x2F;security seeps into every inch of their architecture.')
