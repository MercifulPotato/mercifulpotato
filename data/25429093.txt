Airports are usually about an hour away from anywhere in the city you&#x27;re going to. So I&#x27;d say 3 hours&#x27; overhead is the norm, and it gets worse if you&#x27;re trying to fly after a day&#x27;s work because the transport system of the place you&#x27;re going to is usually shutting down by the time you arrive.<p>This document [0] has airport-to-city-center-by-taxi timings for top European airports. 1 hour seems to be the absolute worst, 27 min average, 22 min median. And it only gets better with smaller cities [1].<p>Almost any airport nowadays lets you walk in with your boarding pass. You scan it, go through security and go straight to the gate. You&#x27;d need to be very unlucky with unusually clogged security (unlikely early in the morning). Or be dealing with a huge airport where it takes a long time to get to the gate.<p>Boarding for short flights shouldn&#x27;t close earlier than 20 minutes before departure. For large airports 40 mins should be enough. For tiny regional airports 30. Even check-in counters will sometimes close as late as 30 mins before departure.<p>Also note that the arrival time given on the ticket, isn&#x27;t touchdown time. It&#x27;s either aircraft door open or final parking. There&#x27;s often a bit of padding added too. So for arrival 10 extra minutes should be the absolute worst case.<p>Very conservative average for first-time travel between sizable EU cities: 50 mins before departure + 2 x 30 mins for taxis + 10 mins for exiting the airport = 120 min = 2 hours. Subtract 10-30 minutes for repeat travelers.<p>In my example I was going from a small city to a capital city and the breakdown was roughly: 10m taxi + 30m before departure (20m would have been fine too!) + 20m taxi + 0m for exit (disembarked before claimed arrival time) = 1 hour.<p>Need to be very unlucky to hit 3 hours.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;transport&#x2F;sites&#x2F;transport&#x2F;files&#x2F;modes&#x2F;air&#x2F;studies&#x2F;doc&#x2F;intermodality&#x2F;2010-airport-accessibility-in-eu.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;transport&#x2F;sites&#x2F;transport&#x2F;files&#x2F;modes&#x2F;a...</a><p>[1] in my example the airport was in fact closer to my house than the train station.
