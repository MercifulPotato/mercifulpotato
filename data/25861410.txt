What does &quot;deeply flawed&quot; mean? Hunter S. Thompson was a severely unhappy man with extreme drug problems who shot himself in the head. Unfortunately, people like him aren&#x27;t particularly uncommon. You&#x27;ve flattened out the landscape of human experience into this, at best, trivial comment that &quot;we&#x27;re all deeply flawed&quot;.<p>The idea that nearly all &quot;perfect&quot; people are just charlatans is also quite toxic. Is it true that many people try extremely hard to hide their problems? Sure, sounds plausible. But is it also true that the only way someone might appear perfect is by being a &quot;charlatan&quot;? Of course not. For example, maybe not every person&#x27;s faults are exposed to the interface between that person and your slice of the universe.<p>I feel a little bit icky slamming on a comment so hard, but I think this flattening out of the human condition is a major negative thread in our culture&#x2F;society right now.')
