You <i>could</i> do a second burn at apogee to circularize the orbit and thus keep the satellite at that altitude all the time, but that&#x27;s more fuel again.<p>IIRC per a video by Scott Manley they do this for geostationary satellites and maybe at medium orbits, but for low-earth orbits (the majority of satellites) the extra fuel requirement goes against the cost advantage of LEO.')
