In most highly developed countries these peaked in the 70s or so and fell sharply since (due to seatbelts, better car design, harsh anti-drink-driving rules, etc). The UK peaked at 8k per year in the late 60s, for instance, and fell to reliably under 2k by the last decade. The US peaked around the same time at 55k, but fell much more modestly to 38k.<p>Gun deaths, of course, are a very US thing; they donâ€™t really register in most developed countries.')
