Before then, when we only had dial-up, only a single computer in the house could use the internet. Broadband internet brought with it external modems you could connect to via wifi rather than sitting inside your computer [1], and this meant you could use other devices than the primary family computer to browse the internet, even assuming you had more computers in your household than just the one.<p>The iPhone came out in 2007, and is generally credited with ushering in the smartphone revolution. The iPad came out in 2010, making a somewhat larger form factor to enable the touchscreen interaction with the computer. From observation of my 3-year-old nephew, his ability to meaningfully use the computer via keyboard and mouse is quite limited. And I&#x27;m not sure he&#x27;s all that capable with the touchscreen; he still hasn&#x27;t understood that the reason he can&#x27;t see me is that my phone doesn&#x27;t have a camera and tries pushing stuff on the phone to make the camera turn on, inevitably resulting in him pushing the &quot;end call&quot; button.<p>I can totally buy a 10-year-old in 2007 who had never used the internet, especially if they came from a poorer household that didn&#x27;t have the ability to keep up with technology and lived in a school district that didn&#x27;t have the ability to give all their kids laptops.<p>[1] This does also show my age, as I never experienced the age of external modems connected via serial cables.')
