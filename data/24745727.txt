They care if you can live up to expectations and provide the experience they expect. So if a performance is lacklustre, or a piece of software is stupidly designed from their POV, they&#x27;ll know something has gone wrong - but they won&#x27;t know (or care) exactly why.<p>Amateurs and wannabes tend to fethishise equipment instead of art. There&#x27;s a lot of &quot;If only I had that equipment I could do this properly.&quot;<p>The reality is that expensive pro-grade equipment only ever adds a final layer of polish. It&#x27;s also good at not getting in the way with unnecessary frills and complications.<p>So a world-class professional with a budget guitar will <i>always</i> outplay and outperform an amateur with a pro-league instrument. No exceptions. And a professional photographer will always take better photos with your phone than you will. And so on.<p>The professional may notice some polish is missing and they may have to work harder than usual - but they will be able to do the job, while an amateur won&#x27;t, no matter what they&#x27;re using.')
