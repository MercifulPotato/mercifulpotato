We had spent so much time analyzing, documenting, specifying in prep.<p>My initial implementation, per our &quot;perfect&quot; spec, really sucked.<p>Turns out there&#x27;s a significant amount of fit and finish to a direct manipulation interface that I wasn&#x27;t able to handle formally with charts and machines. Ended up with a bunch of special cases. Unanticipated knock on effects were unsatisfying negotiations with QA&#x2F;Test (how to test) and tech writers (how to describe) our product.<p>I&#x27;ve always wondered about that gap. Was I doing it wrong? Are there better formalisms? How&#x27;d Illustrator (and others) do their direct manipulations?<p>With the rise of touch UI, I anticipate the problem space (complexity of the states) has gotten smaller. For instance, no modifier keys. But that&#x27;s just a guess.')
