Not all of them - but enough of them to cause serious damage. Look what happened in California recently - about 27% (!!!) of unemployment benefits is now thought to be fraudulent. This is what happens when people are incentivized to cheat and people who oversee the public coffers aren&#x27;t incentivized to guard them. You&#x27;d expect that there would be some consequences for CDC leadership for their numerous failures - but that&#x27;s not happening.')
