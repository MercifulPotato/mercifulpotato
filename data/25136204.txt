Apple Silicon implements additional instructions not found on other boards, making software compiled for it potentially (read: probably) incompatible. There&#x27;s also the presence of the security chips which Apple will likely assume to be present as it&#x27;s not optional on ARM boards, so you&#x27;d need to patch checks and calls to that out.<p>Even if it does work, there&#x27;d be little use in it. Hackintoshes are popular because they offer performance beyond what you can buy for a reasonable price as a consumer. Alternative ARM devices are nowhere near as fast as M1, so that use case disappears completely.<p>There&#x27;s also the bootloader issue. On x86 and x64 the boot process has been standardized into either BIOS or UEFI mode. On ARM there are standards comparable to UEFI, but most chip vendors have their own custom bootloader code to boot an OS. Most chipsets are compatible with Android or Linux but there&#x27;s only one manufacturer who develops bootloaders for the macOS platform.')
