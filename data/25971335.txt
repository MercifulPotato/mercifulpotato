Item(by='wtallis', descendants=None, kids=[25972050], score=None, time=1612030110, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25969792, text='I think that&#x27;s the second-gen WD Black, but the first one that had their in-house SSD controller rather than a third-party controller. The marketing and packaging didn&#x27;t prominently use a more specific model number to distinguish it from the previous WD Black, but on the drive&#x27;s label it does say &quot;PC SN700&quot;. Also, the first-gen WD Black was 256GB and 512GB capacities, while the later generations are 250&#x2F;500&#x2F;1000&#x2F;2000GB. Firmware version strings for the first-gen WD Black were stuff like &quot;B35200WD&quot;, while the SN700&#x2F;720&#x2F;730&#x2F;750 family have versions like &quot;102000WD&quot; and &quot;111110WD&quot;. So I would definitely expect your drive to require the sleep-wake cycle before it&#x27;ll let you reformat to 4k sectors.')
