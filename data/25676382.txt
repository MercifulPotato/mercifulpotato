It&#x27;s sort of miraculous that it worked out so well. Since the original Gameboy they&#x27;ve had the mobile gaming market cornered absolutely. Even with the rise of cell phones the &quot;good&quot; games aren&#x27;t there. You can&#x27;t play The Witcher 3 on your Samsung Galaxy Tablet even if ostensibly it&#x27;s very similar, hardwarewise, to the Switch. Interestingly, Nvidia tried to make the Nvidia Shield as something like this, but failed and I think uses the same&#x2F;similar GPU chips in the Switch now.<p>So the Switch is a merger of two branches\nGameboy Advance -&gt; DS -&gt; 3DS\nN64 -&gt; Gamecube -&gt; Wii -&gt; Wii U<p>And now these two markets have collapsed into the Nintendo Switch (which isn&#x27;t a bad thing!)')
