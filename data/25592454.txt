In Holland swearing involves a lot of diseases.. for example  klerelijer (cholera sufferer)  kankerlijer or krijg de kanker (cancer sufferer, get cancer)\nIn Croatia it&#x27;s more like fuck your mother (jebem ti mater) God fucks your mother (jebo ti Bog mater)<p>In Istria we have a nicer version of telling someone to fuck God (jebi Boga)  Marry God (idi Boga Å¾enit)... you would say that to family members when you don&#x27;t want to be vulgar but the message is still more or less the same  :-)')
