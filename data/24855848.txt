Everything that works over HTTP&#x2F;2 should work over HTTP&#x2F;1.1, even if at a slight cost, and HTTP&#x2F;3 should be uniformly superior to HTTP&#x2F;2, except in those rare cases of UDP-blocking firewalls, which situation I expect to improve over time. Given the complexity and maintenance burden of the protocol and more importantly the upgrade mechanism, I think browsers will be happy to remove HTTP&#x2F;2 in favour of the old reliable HTTP&#x2F;1.1 (which is <i>certainly</i> not going anywhere) and HTTP&#x2F;3 once they see very little using it any more, and absolutely nothing <i>needing</i> to use it.')
