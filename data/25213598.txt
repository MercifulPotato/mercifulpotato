I think often centrist dems like to think of themselves as different from moderate republicans. (And vice versa.) More extremist right wing types tend to think Pelosi is some sort of progressive bogeyman and that she&#x27;s <i>nothing</i> like folks like Reagan or Thatcher. I think all of those groups would disagree with my assessment enough to downvote it. (I suspect a lot of people are upset I called Pelosi a neoliberal.)<p>That said, my view is only one lens, and there are others. Many don&#x27;t consider Clinton&#x2F;Obama&#x2F;Pelosi and their ilk to be neoliberal. Many do.<p>Edit: Also, I told someone they were wrong, which is usually a few downvotes. :D')
