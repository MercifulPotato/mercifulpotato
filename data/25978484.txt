Bitcoin has no fundamentals, so it can go as high or low as it wants.<p>GameStop has fundamentals. But you&#x27;re free to ignore them; they&#x27;re not hurting anything. GameStop has everything Bitcoin has, plus some extra things; it is therefore worth even more than Bitcoin is.<p>Said another way, it is nonsensical to claim that Bitcoin has no fundamentals. If you believe that (1) Bitcoin has &quot;no fundamentals&quot;; and (2) GameStop has fundamentals tethering it to a market capitalization of a few million dollars, what you&#x27;re actually saying is that Bitcoin has fundamentals tethering it to a market capitalization of zero dollars.')
