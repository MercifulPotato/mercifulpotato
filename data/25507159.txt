Their principal training is a military one, often even crossing moral boundaries, such as learning how to steal without getting caught. The philosophy was that, in case of a war, a soldier might have to steal food in order to survive. The main key point here is that, when a boy was caught, he was not punished for his act of stealing, but for being caught!  The Spartan youth had their favorite &quot;game&quot; of stealing food or other possessions from servants (Greek: είλωτες, helotes).</i><p><i>A well-known story that proves the Spartan training and loyalty is this: Once, a 13 year old Spartan boy stole a fox from a village near his camp. Alas, a trainer found him and asked him what he was doing off campus. The boy had seen the trainer and had hidden the fox beneath his cloth. As the boy said nothing, the trainer insisted. The fox, still alive, beneath the boy&#x27;s cloth, started scratching him, in order to escape. While doing that, the boy continued to deny the stealing until the wounds suffered by the fox killed him.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ancient.eu&#x2F;article&#x2F;342&#x2F;the-spartan-education&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ancient.eu&#x2F;article&#x2F;342&#x2F;the-spartan-education&#x2F;</a>')
