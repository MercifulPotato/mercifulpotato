The figure of speech context does NOT have any threats involved.<p>Now, here is Bannon&#x27;s statement:<p><i>&quot;I’d actually like to go back to the old times of Tudor England, I’d put the heads on pikes, right, I’d put them at the two corners of the White House as a warning to federal bureaucrats. You either get with the program or you’re gone – time to stop playing games.&quot;</i><p>In this context, Bannon does not seem to use it as a figure of speech, it is a threat - maybe not literally - but a threat nonetheless. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s wrong, and why people are angry. Not because they don&#x27;t like his &quot;ideas&quot;.')
