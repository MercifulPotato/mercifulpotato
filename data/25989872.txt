I apologize for the strong response, and don&#x27;t mean it to reflect on you as a person at all, but the idea of charging someone for something that is literally part of the biological definition of life is kind of shocking.<p>They should treat it like the Supreme Court recently treated homeless people camping on the sidewalk.  They have a biological need for somewhere to sleep; if the city cannot provide enough places for them to sleep, they must allow them to camp on the sidewalk.  In this case, if there are not enough public restrooms, public businesses (i.e. open to the public, not publicly traded) must allow non-customers to use their restroom.<p>It seems crazy to me that a) we know everyone needs to use the bathroom, b) there are no requirements for access to restrooms (beyond ADA stuff), c) urinating or defecating in public is illegal.  I don&#x27;t find it crazy that urinating or defecating in public is illegal; I find it crazy that we&#x27;ve put ourselves in a spot where it is possible to be put in a position where there is no legal means for you to carry out a biologically required task.<p>These poor drivers are just getting caught in the crossfire of the class war between restaurant owners and delivery companies, and are being deprived of human dignity as a result.<p>I think there&#x27;s also an unintentional sexist effect here.  The article keeps talking about people peeing in Gatorade bottles.  I&#x27;m a male, so I could be wrong here, but that doesn&#x27;t seem like a viable option for women.  Women have another needs for the bathroom as well.  I can&#x27;t imagine putting in or changing a tampon in the car is an easy or pleasant experience.<p>And lastly, do you really want your food delivery driver to be making a choice about whether they want to pay $1 to use the bathroom where they can wash their hands, or just peeing in a bottle and going around with dirty hands?  I would strongly prefer that wasn&#x27;t a choice they considered.  I will happily pay another $0.25 or whatever that goes to the restaurant to cover paying for the water, toilet paper and soap they use to remain hygienic.')
