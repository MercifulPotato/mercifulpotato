One obvious difference is that you don&#x27;t have the threat of preventable death or debilitating injury bankrupting you overnight.<p>&gt;So your argument is about intent, rather than just the final effect? So what do you think about the tech workers who believe their job puts out more good than evil into the world?<p>No, it&#x27;s not about intent, it&#x27;s about accountability. You can only address the problems that you are aware of. If you&#x27;re talking about unreasonable standards then it <i>is</i> unreasonable to hold someone accountable for problems that they&#x27;re not aware of.<p>And if you believe your job to do more good than evil, and I disagree, then that reflects poorly on my opinion of you. I do not hold the ignorant accountable, but I do hold the irrational accountable.')
