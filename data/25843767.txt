List-Processes -&gt; SuperDuperList-Processes?</i>&quot;<p>No because List- isn&#x27;t a standard verb, nor is SuperDuperList. Get-EventLog had Get-WinEvent added. Get-WmiInstance became Get-CimInstance. The third party NTFSSecurity module added a Get-Item2 to cover for Get-Item, and a Get-NTFSAccess to cover for Get-ACL.<p>And because it&#x27;s a shell and can run binaries, there&#x27;s no problem with you having or running top and htop. or aliasing htop or calling your own thing htop, the Verb-Noun pattern isn&#x27;t mandatory, it&#x27;s recommended for companies developing modules so that administrators will have ideas how to list things, add things, remove things, without having to read the manual to find that it&#x27;s mysterymgmtcli --auth-control -login-create instead of New-ToolUser.')
