Item(by='g_p', descendants=None, kids=[25548325], score=None, time=1609022379, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25545973, text='I can definitely see this working for tech-savvy users on additional accounts. The problem with email is that it&#x27;s still used&#x2F;needed as the &quot;universal&quot; online way to establish&#x2F;initiate correspondence with someone.<p>It&#x27;s become used for person-to-person communications, as well as computer-to-person communications, and is probably one of the few standard, interoperable, near-ubiquitous means of reaching people, short of postal mail and carrier-provided services like SMS and voice calling.<p>While requiring people to know who they want to correspond with before the fact could be helpful, it also breaks a lot of popular use-cases for email - email is often written into contracts as a valid means of serving notice etc pursuant to the contract. Locking email down to only receive mail from approved senders would break a lot of things, but certainly help to prevent this kind of spam.<p>I wonder to what extent this could be reduced however by using unique per-use aliases - in a sense you can get a softer version of this whitelist by giving out per-sender inbox aliases, and therefore seeing which alias was used to send a message. Not quite sender authentication, but perhaps better than nothing. Doesn&#x27;t prevent compromise of the underlying (human-to-human) email address, but would certainly help with a lot of phishing-type scenarios using breached customer records.')
