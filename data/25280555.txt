It worked better a couple years ago.  The thing I hate the most about these opaque, closed box systems is the absolute dependence I have on them.  I can&#x27;t just freeze the version of software I&#x27;m running that is working.  Nearly every app I have that works great, will at some point stop working and regress.  Almost universally that is true.  I despise the new era we&#x27;re in where the user has zero control over what is running on their hardware.')
