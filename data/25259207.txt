This isn&#x27;t too bad when n is 4, but it has stressed both AMD and Intel&#x27;s capabilities to make it to 8, and I don&#x27;t think anyone would ever seriously consider building a 16-wide x86 machine.  Once memory and I&#x2F;O buses get fast enough to feed a 16-wide general-purpose computer, x86 as an architecture is in trouble.  They have quietly gotten fast enough to feed an 8-wide machine.<p>LPDDR4 very quietly took the speed crown from DDR4 due to the fact that the signal integrity problems are less demanding (soldered vs DIMM being the standard interface), and it looks like the DDR interface may be near the end of its useful life.  Transceiver-based memory modules using standards like CXL and CCIX may be the long-term fix to the problems of DDR4.  In the short-term, those are going to hurt, but long-term they should be a lot better.')
