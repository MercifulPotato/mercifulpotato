Item(by='herbstein', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603382571, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24859066, text='My daily commute takes me from sea level (well, 1 meter above) to 66 meters above sea level. It&#x27;s not uncommon that I have obligations at around 79 meters above sea level. Both of those climbs are single hills that don&#x27;t let up, and are on major commuting routes in my city - a city in which biking is almost at an Amsterdam-level of bike usage.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s tougher than a flat road. But if you&#x27;re in any kind of shape it shouldn&#x27;t take too big of a toll out of you. During lockdown I spent months without going on that commute, and without keeping myself in shape by other means, and when starting back up again I didn&#x27;t miss a beat.<p>A small hill (which I consider ~60-80 meter differences) shouldn&#x27;t scare people much.<p>EDIT: I should also add that I ride on a heavy mountain bike. The intention was to use it as a commuter and to ride trails, but it&#x27;s almost exclusively been used as a commuter.')
