Certain people have twisted what was mentioned in the national education policy into a lucrative business.\nAs for enhancing computational thought: Coding games are fun. Google had one. I have seen videos where children are taught some concept (network sort I think) using a sorting mat; students are given number placards and asked to stand in predefined squares. They are given an instruction. When they play it out the result &quot;appears&quot;. All the kids do is follow the instructions given by the instructor. It inspires them to expand their thinking horizons; take a step back and understand what happened. That should be the education.<p>These tv ads are more inclining to app building, online coding playgrounds, etc. Its not the right education.<p>Perhaps for an epidemiologist, or, a researcher who has to work with a lot of data, some of these skills are required. (More of the stuff that comprises computation thought). Would an epidemiologist require to build an app? Would an emergency doctor want to build an app? Its rare.<p>There is an explosion in apps in our generation itself. This is even several years prior to this recent national education policy. You can imagine the chaos that would follow from this.')
