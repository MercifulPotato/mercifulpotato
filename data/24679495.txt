The only way I&#x27;m aware of to get into prison is via an arrest by police.<p>So, every arrest a police officer makes, they need to consider, &quot;knowing what I do about prison, is it ethical to arrest this person?&quot;<p>Police militarization is supported at the federal level through grants of military equipment, and nationwide through the use of trainings that teach officers they are &quot;warriors&quot; or &quot;sheep dogs&quot;.<p>And yes, police are fragmented from a logistical standpoint, but culturally they are very similar. Police unions make holding bad cops accountable nearly everywhere, prosecutors refuse to prosecute bad police because their jobs require a good relationship with police, the idea of the &quot;thin blue line&quot; permeates every police dept, etc. They might all have different funding and standards, but there are systemic nationwide problems.')
