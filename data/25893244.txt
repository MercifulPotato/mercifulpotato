The paper emphasizes an important distinction: there was no measurable correlation between dogmatism and confidence, but rather between dogmatism and ability to <i>correct</i> one&#x27;s own confidence in light of new evidence.<p>From the paper:<p><i>In line with our hypothesis, higher values of dogmatic intolerance were associated with reduced metacognitive sensitivity (study 2: β = −0.12, p = 0.032, R2 = 0.01; see Figure 3A), in the absence of any effect on perceptual discrimination performance (study 2: β = 0.02, p = 0.77) and controlling for key demographic variables (i.e., age, gender, education). Importantly, there was also no relation between dogmatism and overconfidence (study 2: β = 0.07, p = 0.26), suggesting a specific reduction in the sensitivity with which confidence tracks performance, rather than a bias in confidence.</i><p>Original paper: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cell.com&#x2F;current-biology&#x2F;fulltext&#x2F;S0960-9822(18)31420-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982218314209%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cell.com&#x2F;current-biology&#x2F;fulltext&#x2F;S0960-9822(18)...</a>')
