Both for the choices of material and because a lot of stuff is compatible.<p>A big reason most of our (non custom made) furniture is IKEA is because it strikes a pretty ideal balance between price and quality and allows you to &quot;get to town&quot; with changes.  Most other &quot;crap furniture&quot; does not at all support such modifications to it.  For starters because some of the things we bought even though they said solid wood on the label did not actually fully consist of solid wood and were useless after cutting off a piece.')
