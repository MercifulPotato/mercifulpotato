If a program fails to compile or quickly crashes (because of a failed assertion), then I consider that better than having to unit test and fuzz test your code to find that particular problem.<p>As an added benefit the code also becomes more robust in the production environment, if there are use cases you failed to consider -- 100% branch coverage does not guarantee that there are none!')
