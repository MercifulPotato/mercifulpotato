It seems untestable and unprovable and not like science to me.<p>I don’t think your classical CPU analogy is really applicable here.<p>The wave function is exactly that, many values describing the probability of the particle in space.  The act of measurement is what sets the value of the wave function.  Take the classic electron diffraction experiment.  It’s not the measurement that defines the wave-like property there.<p>Take tunneling through a potential barrier, why can the particle tunnel?  Tunneling is a consequence of the wave function defining the probability of particle in all space.')
