My opinion as a parent matters in the context of my child (as I am legally responsible), and in the end what matters is the law (which is above &quot;don&#x27;t care&quot;). I&#x27;m very curious if this is even legal, and if so, in which jurisdictions. If I don&#x27;t give my child permission to have a camera active in my private space, what is going to happen?')
