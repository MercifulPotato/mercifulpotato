Peers can receive, interchange, and synchronize their downloaded media. This is especially helpful in rural areas, where internet bandwidth is sparse; and redundant downloads can be saved. Just bookmark Stealh as a Web App on your Android phone and you have direct access to your downloaded wikis, yay!<p>Trusted peers with a shared web cache is a good start, but how about _trustless_ peers? Is this possible?<p>Possibly using something like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tlsnotary.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tlsnotary.org</a> - which uses TLS to provide cryptographic proof of the authenticity of saved HTTPS pages (but unfortunately only works with TLS 1.0)')
