Think of LabView in a browser. A graphical programming environment that compiles to Python, so that the whole Pandas and AI universe was available and simple analysis and data presentation workflows could be built by anyone. Input daily imagery, automatically output time-series graphs, curve fits, augmentation by other data sources (stocks, weather, AIS, etc), ... seems like a natural combination to me, but maybe Iâ€™m too excited over my own idea?<p>I have to admit though, having earned a physics PhD in a laser lab, I would much prefer to work on optics and satellite tech than software ;-)')
