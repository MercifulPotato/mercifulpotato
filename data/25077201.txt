In practice though clearly it does cause problems the larger your codebase gets as you&#x27;re more likely to have some nested dependency chain that&#x27;s time-consuming to upgrade so you&#x27;d rather move faster than make sure you&#x27;re only running 1 version of the dependency.<p>Consider the view that some times it can be sloppy &amp; other times it&#x27;s not &amp; it&#x27;s impossible to distinguish between the two in an automated fashion.')
