Our customers are the most vulnerable members of society and our products tangibly improve their financial health. We&#x27;re backed by A16Z and our founders have decades of experience in the lending industry.<p>There are many fintech startups trying to differentiate themselves, capture customers, and then figure out how to make a profit later. We&#x27;re proudly starting from the other side... weâ€™re adding the banking after getting the unit economics to work!<p>Many of the products we&#x27;re building don&#x27;t have any existing analogues in the market, so we&#x27;re looking for engineers with an entrepreneurial bent. Our team experiments frequently, iterates quickly, and we use both data and customer feedback to measure our success.<p>We&#x27;ve purposefully kept a low profile, so we&#x27;ll tell you much more about our products during the interview process!<p>To apply, please email your resume to jobs at seedfi dot (most common TLD).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seedfi.com&#x2F;jobs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seedfi.com&#x2F;jobs</a><p>You can also ask me questions via the email on my profile.')
