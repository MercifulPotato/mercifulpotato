During that interval, you might be able to figure out whom that code belongs to (e.g. because there&#x27;s no one else in the room). Then if they test positive afterwards, all their codes from some preceding time interval will be broadcast, you get a warning and if your records of which code belongs to which person are complete, you can figure out who it is.<p>This doesn&#x27;t work if the person who got infected was never the only one broadcasting their code close to you.')
