I&#x27;d imagine it to be mostly large sequential reads. Especially since operating systems have a long history of booting from HDD and still need reasonable support for that, I wouldn&#x27;t expect the boot process has a whole lot of disk thrashing. I also can&#x27;t think of a reason why it would need to.')
