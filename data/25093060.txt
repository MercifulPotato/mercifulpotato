It’s one of the best tools for getting at the “reception” of a particular work.<p>The most complete and well-known example of this study to date was Owen Gingrich’s census of copies of Copernicus’ de revolutionibus: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;about&#x2F;The_Book_Nobody_Read.html?id=komv9-u3NPAC" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.com&#x2F;books&#x2F;about&#x2F;The_Book_Nobody_Read.ht...</a><p>The main findings of the <i>Principia</i> study according to the NYT:<p>&gt; An earlier census of the book, published in 1953, identified 189 copies worldwide. But a new survey by two scholars has found nearly 200 more — 386 copies in all, including ones far beyond England in Budapest; Oslo; Prague; Zagreb, Croatia; the Vatican; and Gdansk, Poland.<p>Is this “surprisingly” wide? All a matter of expectation, I suppose.
