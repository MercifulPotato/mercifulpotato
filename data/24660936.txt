Google isn&#x27;t doing this out of the goodness of its heart.  As well as PR generally though, it&#x27;s as much about owning the consumer.  Google and Facebook are increasingly the portals through which the majority of people consume content online.  Each wants to protect and grow that - it&#x27;s central to their business model (and a well-understood strategy generally).  The biggest threat to either is disintermediation.
