Item(by='samatman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611773450, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25925826, text='True, and accessibility is why the long tail of peripherals is so important.<p>For the home-row supremacists, it would be great to have an ortholinear split-key which has a ThinkPad-style nub, although we could spill a lot of ink about where to put it: in between u-i-j-k would suit me best, other people might want y-u-h-j for the index rather than middle fingerâ€” and of course, the left-handed equivalent for those who prefer it, I happen to be left-handed but mouse with my right and wouldn&#x27;t care to switch.<p>There&#x27;s room in the Ergodox layout for one more thumb key, between the grid and the thumb cluster, it would require expanding the classic chassis but that&#x27;s a small thing. The driver, the custom keys, and an appropriately sensitive joystick, these are not small things! I <i>think</i> one could drill through a corner of four of the switches, to make enough room, without touching the electronics, and <i>mmmmaybe</i> mold a custom housing which is missing a corner, simply rotating appropriately.  Making room for the traces and such is completely above my paygrade.<p>But if Ergodox costs $350 to get to the user, this keyboard would probably end up costing $500 on a good day.  It would be a glorious thing, but I wonder about the market for it.')
