Compute simhash of each issue - O(1) in N, the number of issues.<p>2. Sort the issues by hamming distance of simhash (N log N in the number of issues)<p>3. Pick the K issues before or after the current issue in the results (O(1) in the number of issues)<p>You can precompute&#x2F;incrementally update any of these steps as issues are added. This would make find duplicates itself O(1) because it would just be step 3.<p>If you put this in term of size of text in the issues instead of number (which is what you used) it changes the time bounds, but, for example, it&#x27;s not any worse than sorting&#x2F;comparing the issues as text strings.')
