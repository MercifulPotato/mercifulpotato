Instead the company took advantage of the flexibility of software to port iTunes to Windows<p>That&#x27;s how things turned out, but not how they were originally meant to be. Jobs&#x27; reluctance to port iTunes to Windows was so obvious that even the Isaacson bio made it clear. And it wasn&#x27;t simply an atavistic impulse, it was faithfulness to his &quot;Digital Hub&quot; strategy which saw smart-device integration as a way to sell Macintoshes. Jobs was a late and reluctant convert to the idea of a post-PC era. Repasting an earlier comment of mine <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9470925" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9470925</a> :<p>&gt;&gt; If you look at Apple&#x27;s trajectory over the last 15 years, you can see the vision was consistently outlined from the very beginningâ€”the Digital Hub strategy ([link working in 2020: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;AnrM4n6S3CU?t=2585" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;AnrM4n6S3CU?t=2585</a> ]).<p>&gt; That&#x27;s not really the case though. As Jobs outlined it in that video, the Digital Hub strategy was to sell Macintoshes by positioning them as something you could dock your consumer-electronics gadgets, mostly from third parties, into. It was a plan to sell hubs, not spokes. This strategy had limited viability for Apple, because a typical consumer wasn&#x27;t likely to think &quot;I&#x27;ve just bought this $500 camcorder, so now I need to spend twice that or more on a Mac in order to offload and edit the video&quot;. If they were going to use any computer as the digital hub for their camcorder, it was probably going to be their Windows PC. That&#x27;s probably why iTunes for Windows was such a difficult and long-drawn-out decision for Jobs: because it was a decision to mostly abandon the Digital Hub approach in favour of selling more of the spokes. Then Apple&#x27;s slow and initially reluctant embrace of the &quot;post-PC era&quot; with over-the-air iDevice updates and cloud storage to partly displace iTunes means that it&#x27;s increasingly taking nearly the opposite of Jobs&#x27; 2001 stance: &quot;We&#x27;re clearly migrating away from the PC as the centrepiece&quot; and &quot;We don&#x27;t think of it in terms of the PC business anymore&quot; are things that Tim Cook could say today without really startling anyone.<p>At his 2007 joint interview with Gates at D5 <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;bill-gates-and-steve-jobs-at-d5-full-session&#x2F;60C4F9FA-9AD5-4D04-8BB6-015AEBB1C052.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;video&#x2F;bill-gates-and-steve-jobs-at-d5-fu...</a> Jobs is coming round to the post-PC agenda, reluctantly.')
