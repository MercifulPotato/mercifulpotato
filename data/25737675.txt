People who two weeks ago would claim that companies should drive out employees who disagree with them, now wish these companies were subject to the will of the people. You can&#x27;t spend a lifetime fighting to reduce the power of the federal government and then be surprised at all that large corporations are the ones deciding our public policy.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say these are in conflict. The biggest reason I oppose political movement in SV corporations is because I believe they&#x27;d become <i>even more</i> censorious than they are now. Today&#x27;s corporations are evil to make money and protect their brand, but I don&#x27;t want tomorrow&#x27;s corporations to be evil for a political ideology.')
