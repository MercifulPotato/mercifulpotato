Does it not completely change the situation compared to an individual or organisation doing this?<p>It takes more effort to show a lie to be false than it does to tell another lie, and the public only have finite time to weigh up the accuracy of information. The government has more power to push out convincing misinformation in vast quantities than anyone else.<p>A lot of the time of you don&#x27;t need censorship because truth and open critique will drown out the lies, but there&#x27;s going to be a breaking point when the misinformation being thrown out becomes overpowering.')
