Did a week long drive through wales. It was absolutely gorgeous.<p>I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to have been on a few holidays in both Scotland and Ireland for a few weeks at a time (I&#x27;m Canadian, but I lived in England for a just under a year). I found the people in Whales to be considerably less friendly than anywhere else in the British isles. To a point where I walked into a pub in a small town and people switched from speaking English to Welsh. I plan to return to Ireland and Scotland, but based on my experience with the Welsh, have no real desire to revisit  Wales.')
