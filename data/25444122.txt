How much traffic would Google lose? People would just use those same Google services through Chrome, Safari, native apps, whatever.<p>So, I believe Google funds Firefox mainly as a hedge against monopoly charges.<p>If Chrome ever dominated the browser market <i>entirely</i> with 95%+ marketshare like Internet Explorer back in the bad old days of IE5&#x2F;6, they&#x27;d be painting a large target on their backs for various governments to step in and make life difficult.<p>If we think about it, Chrome&#x2F;Chromium&#x27;s current ~70% market share is pretty ideal for Google. They get to <i>kinda sorta mostly</i> control the web, without a bunch of pesky governments on their backs.')
