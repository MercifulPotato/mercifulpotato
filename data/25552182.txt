I.e. if the country facilitates registration of child based on parent citizenship and not birth location of child, they just never declare the child was born in the US. &quot;It was a home birth&quot;<p>At international schools in some countries this is an open secret and happens quite often, as long as the parents are not feds and are not under heavy scrutiny. So the kid has two different BC &amp; passports with two different birthplaces. Some even have different birth-dates and names.<p>Sure saves the poor kids the nightmare of not being able to open a bank account abroad, as a US citizen.<p>The moral is, plan your money, plan your kids, the federales will never inform on what is in your best interest.
