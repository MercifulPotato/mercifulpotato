But most Windows users didn&#x27;t twig that the wheel as well as being scrollable, was also clickable. Probably that was because at that time very little software for Windows had the capability of using a 3-button mouse.<p>UNIX users had the reverse problem. They were used to their mice not being scrollable, so they were very confused when their middle-clicks were also scrolling the mouse (thus moving the cursor) so they were sometimes clicking on the wrong thing.')
