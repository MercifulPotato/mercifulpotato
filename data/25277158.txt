It&#x27;s a very high balloon ride to less than 20 miles up. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s spectacular, but it&#x27;s not the Kalman line and it&#x27;s certainly not orbit.<p>It doesn&#x27;t require tons of fuel or disposable rockets. It sounds like it&#x27;s not even a ton of innovation, though I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s many millions of dollars worth of engineering to make it safe.<p>I imagine the price comes down once they&#x27;ve satisfied people with a ton of money who just can&#x27;t wait to get a space-like experience. But the price-of-a-house fee feels like it should be a life-changing experience, and I just dunno if this will satisfy that.')
