Because of my transient nature and the fact that I&#x27;m neither black nor white, my coworkers and clients tend to speak more freely with me regarding politics.  My conclusion is that the BLM&#x2F;rioters have really screwed over Biden, and that not only will Trump win, he&#x27;ll win by a landslide victory.
