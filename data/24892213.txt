Index size - Google spider visits more places than Bing spider. This is why Google delivers better results for compiler error strings, serial numbers etc.<p>Query examples where Bing&#x2F;DDG completely miss the mark:<p>SA1DP2CF - a serial number<p>s2 034 253 033 C  - audi rs2 exhaust manifold part no<p>Denninger Str. 96, 81925 MÃ¼nchen, Germany  - what is on this location?<p>2. Intent&#x2F;Semantic<p>Query examples:<p>tesla 00001   - who owns first tesla? Bing is completely lost<p>original elite alien name - looking for thargoids, Google tells me that right away, DDG #8<p>3. Localized<p>Query example:\nhiking trails - Google gives me relevant local results based on my location (IP based), DDG doesn&#x27;t (although it is aware of my IP-based location in the same way)<p>Getting these right is incredibly hard as you literally need Google size infrastructure to get this right, which even Bing doesn&#x27;t have.<p>Second thing that is hard to catch up for any Google competitor is the rest of Google infrastructure users rely on - Browser, Email, Meet, Docs, Youtube, Android, Drive... Even if you get the search right but the user has to go back to Google for the rest of services, Google has a chance to get the user back.<p>IMO attacking Google starts with developing a product that does not insult user&#x27;s intelligence, is innovative and does things Google can&#x27;t, explores different business models (as ads inevitably lead to conflict of interest - optimize for user or advertiser?) and offers infrastructure that displaces (at least some) Google services.')
