I <i>think</i> I&#x27;m the opposite. I agree that as integration and product complexity increase, it makes more sense to make a new thing from feedstock than repair an old thing.<p>But what we <i>can</i> do is recover the resources used in manufacture. Critically, the product needs to be made in a way that supports this.<p>I want manufacturing to be <i>so advanced</i> that &quot;full circle&quot; resource recovery is incorporated into the design. The glues have corresponding (low toxicity) solvents for disassembly, the plastic can be cheaply digested back to clean monomers, the metals easily separable. No &quot;retrofit&quot; processes with show pony robots, but full &quot;reverse manufacturing&quot; facilities built with the same care and attention as the ones that make the product.<p>The thing I want is <i>more</i> automation, and <i>more advanced</i> design.')
