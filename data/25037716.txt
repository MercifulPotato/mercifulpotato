Here are some other hidden costs that are often invisible to people:<p>1. The cost of understanding the 3rd party solution, which increases with the generality of the tool. That is, you are using a tool which solves A, B, C, and D to solve A.  Using a well-documented tool helps here, but doesn&#x27;t eliminate the problem.<p>2. The cost of upgrades, especially when forced by a security issue.<p>3. Framework vs library costs.  It usually much less costly to import pure functions (think: an assertion library) versus importing a framework which forces a bespoke way of doing things (think: rspec).')
