Item(by='Natales', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608833911, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25527581, text='I find fascinating how many folks, typically on the younger side, gravitate to proprietary (and expensive!) software like Roam Research and others, in search for personal knowledge management solutions, without seriously considering TW.<p>Coupled with the proper plugins, I find TW to be the most comprehensive, flexible and powerful solution, guaranteed to work 20 years from now, all self-contained in a single file. Seriously, how amazing is that when you think about it!<p>I talked to one of them recently, and he said it wasn&#x27;t appealing because the name &quot;wiki&quot; sounded old school. Another beef was the use of JavaScript (yet, he&#x27;d find it cool if it were WASM. Go figure).<p>The only legitimate criticism he mentioned was the lack of efficient image&#x2F;file embedding or linking, which I don&#x27;t find much of an issue with the [img[&lt;file&gt;]] syntax, provided you are well organized. I keep dozens of images (mostly food recipes) linked that way on my site [0] with 107 tiddlers currently, extremely snappy, and properly cached and compressed with CloudFlare, all with no issues whatsoever. My personal TW file (combined personal and work) has over 2,000 tiddlers and I feel no difference.<p>Seriously, more people should give TW a try, just for a week or so, and see how can it change the way you retain, search and manage information.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ramirosalas.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ramirosalas.com</a>')
