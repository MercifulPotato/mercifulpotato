It is a tech hub, but it&#x27;s considerably smaller in most areas and has a less innovative business culture. A tell for this is the pejorative use of the word &quot;cowboy&quot; for someone that doesn&#x27;t do things by the book. It&#x27;s something you never hear elsewhere, not even in the Midwest or Texas.<p>It&#x27;s also way too classist and aristocratic in its thinking. Where you went to school basically informs a caste system.<p>Climate aside though, it is a nicer city. It has more usable (though quite old) transit, is very walkable, clean, low crime, and is much more affordable than the Bay Area (though still pricey).')
