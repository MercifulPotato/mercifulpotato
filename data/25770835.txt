There are too many companies where employees are only offered equity if they ask for it, and people don&#x27;t understand it. We can educate the SWE community about matters of financial literacy and normalise equity for all full time employees. I personally will not accept a job at any company without equity.<p>2. Focusing on salary. We need a european alternative to glassdoor and it needs to become popular. People need to know what they are worth. We are quite shy when it comes to discussing salary. TC info is more readily accessible in the US.<p>3. Europe needs to grow tech giants that demand top tier talent. That&#x27;s the main problem with Europe, there isn&#x27;t a huge amount of ambition to home grow 100bn+ companies that attract the best talent globally. Europe is at a disadvantage because it takes fewer risks and it&#x27;s also more likely to sell out before reaching tech giant status. We are all using Google, Facebook (or some product of) and Amazon (in countries where amazon can effectively avoid taxes). And the UK sold off ARM, though there is ongoing discussion about that.<p>If you look at industries that are world leading (i.e banking in London for example), you&#x27;ll find opportunities to double or triple your salary. Turns out that enough of us are turned off by the idea of working in the banking sector that it doesn&#x27;t appear to translate into pressure for talent. We are also very well educated so it&#x27;s not as hard to find people')
