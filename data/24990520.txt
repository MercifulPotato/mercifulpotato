Which is a generally good rule of thumb, as there&#x27;s no guarantee someone else&#x27;s experience would go as positively as yours did with Chase. So I wanted to point out a much more hostile outcome someone may feasibly experience in such a situation, to highlight the difference involving a lawyer could make.')
