That’s insane. Even if you think you know what your doing. This is the steam roller. And you’re the guy picking up the penny in front of it.<p>But, the premiums can be pretty juicy.<p>Looking at the 29Jan 320 Call options, if you were good, and called today’s top. Then you could’ve wrote the call at 145. Then held it for 90 mins, when it bottomed out at 89. Netting you a cool $56 per contract.<p>If you wrote 1 contract on this play, then 56 x 1 x 100 = $5600.<p>So, $5600 of net profit in 90 minutes. If you’re lucky. It’s best to have a large war chest to play this strategy.<p>But, if you’re unlucky, then a short squeeze can even happen during normal trading hours, and it would probably wipe you out.<p>You can call the wrong top, and the spreads are so wide, that the loss is heavier to exit the position.<p>And if you ran this strategy yesterday, at a lower price point, and held it overnight, then you would’ve been wiped out this morning, when the stock spiked in overnight off-market trading. So it’s best to keep this strategy to a daytrade.<p>I don’t recommend this strategy to anyone. The odds of you consistently calling the top, correctly, all the time, is very low.<p>And the crazy phenomenon going on right now, is that the retail traders, are somewhat collectively operating like a hive mind. Whether they can really succeed to achieve their objective of hitting $1000&#x2F;share, remains to be seen. But, I’m not going to challenge this one, at this time.')
