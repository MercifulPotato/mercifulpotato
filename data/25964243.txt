I also work for an SF company everyone knows about and I moved to Sarasota a couple of years ago.  It&#x27;s the best financial decision I&#x27;ve ever made.  Your analysis is spot on, and the Amish food is amazing.<p>Also, I&#x27;m a night owl and now I can work from like 12pm-9pm.  Working on west coast time while living on the east coast is a major life improvement for me.<p>If anyone is considering moving to FL and buying property, Sarasota is the obvious choice.  The amount of construction going on here is incredible.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy anywhere else in Florida.<p>I also looked into Austin TX and Vancouver WA as possible destinations, but the real estate values seemed more predicable in Sarasota.  If you get in at the beginning of a construction project here, you&#x27;re pretty much assured to make money.  I bought my house as new construction at the start of a new development and it was worth more than I paid by the time construction was complete.<p>If someone is considering moving to FL but wants more of that &quot;tech city&quot; vibe, you can rent a really nice place up in St Pete where there&#x27;s much more happening, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy there because the whole thing is a flood zone.')
