Test unlimited sites as often as you want including local development sites to stop critical issues going live.<p>Glad I didn&#x27;t rely on the Chrome Web Store payment system they deprecated a few months ago. :) Felt predictable they were going to throw in the towel with it since it was lacking obvious features and the support forums always had complaints about it breaking.')
