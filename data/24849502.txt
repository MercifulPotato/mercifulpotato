For instance the C ABI emulation they have both cannot support all of CPython and wrecks performance.  The same is true if you try to do fancy things with sys._getframe which a lot of code does in the wild (eg: all of logging).<p>In addition PyPy has to do a lot of special casing for all the crazy things CPython does.  I recommend looking into the amount of engineering that went into it.')
