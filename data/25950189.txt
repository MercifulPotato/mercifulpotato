Thereâ€™s no upper limit of shorting, since shares can be borrowed, sold, then borrowed again.<p>Short interest above 100% is perfectly fine. Stocks can and do go over this imaginary line, without any fraud involved. It just means that many people disagree about the price.<p>Allowing speculators to build up large short positions is a good thing, because it helps prevents overpriced bubble from forming. Read the actual academic research from my original look comment. If a hedge fund is willing to take the risky and thankless job of taking a large and concentrated short position, the public should be <i>thanking</i> them for their contribution to market efficiency.')
