I&#x27;ll ask you again what the basis of these trials should be? who and what should we be investigating?<p>I&#x27;m aware of a few trials that have already happened, my favourites:<p>Paul Manafort, former campaign chairman of the Trump campaign sentenced to 7.5 years in prison[1]. Collusion with suspected Russian operatives, lying about that collusion. Sentenced separately in Virginia for ~4 years for bank fraud, tax fraud, and hiding foreign accounts[2].<p>Michael Cohen, former personal attorney to Donald Trump sentenced to 3 years in prison. &quot;charges involving campaign finance violations, tax evasion and lying to Congress&quot;[3].<p>A fun list of the rest of the swamp dwellers that have been charged or convicted[4].<p>&gt; If we assume the worst about people because they were born into a wealthy family where does that leave us?<p>We aren&#x27;t assuming the worst about people born into a wealthy family. We&#x27;re asserting that they cannot relate to those born into a lower or middle class family.<p>&gt; You don&#x27;t believe the swamp could be that corrupt. I do. Is it ok for me to hold that opinion? Is it ok for me to speak it, or will I be silenced for wrong think?<p>You&#x27;re intentionally ignoring the fact that the man who told you there was a swamp is entirely surrounded by people found guilty of some form of fraud or corruption...<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.axios.com&#x2F;paul-manafort-sentenced-years-prison-russia-mueller-investigation-23a5a107-a065-47be-90e3-3a01e593ea45.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.axios.com&#x2F;paul-manafort-sentenced-years-prison-r...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.axios.com&#x2F;paul-manafort-sentenced-prison-mueller-investigation-32fc62e2-c6aa-4c1d-b0e7-f63f07b3e192.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.axios.com&#x2F;paul-manafort-sentenced-prison-mueller...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.axios.com&#x2F;michael-cohen-prison-sentence-mueller-investigation-8a283541-870a-4334-af6e-6ca21d4c906d.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.axios.com&#x2F;michael-cohen-prison-sentence-mueller-...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.yourtango.com&#x2F;2020336767&#x2F;trump-associates-have-been-arrested-since-start-his-presidency" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.yourtango.com&#x2F;2020336767&#x2F;trump-associates-have-b...</a>')
