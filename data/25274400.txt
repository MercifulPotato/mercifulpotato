By good short functions I mean functions that, as you say, don&#x27;t mix levels of abstraction, use proper names, and follow a consistent pattern so their behavior can be safely assumed most of the time. And sometimes you can&#x27;t have such a clear view of the problem because it already got too messy at another stage of the process, and you want to murder the system designer plus maybe some of your coworkers too.<p>Of course, for certain tasks long functions are still reasonable, but they tend to be the exception rather than the rule, and it takes quite some practice to realize.<p>Best practical advice: do more design and planning on paper.')
