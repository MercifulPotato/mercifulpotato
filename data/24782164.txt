I had exactly the same training when I worked at IBM, every year.   &quot;Never talk about dominating the market&quot;, yadda yadda yadda.   It&#x27;s sound legal advice that I would expect all corporate employees would get.  VMWare won&#x27;t want their employees to talk about how they dominate the VM indusrty; EMC wouldn&#x27;t want their engineers talking about their enterprise storasge arrays &quot;crushing the competition&quot;, and so on.<p>And at all companies, the standard line is, &quot;never send in e-mail anything that you wouldn&#x27;t want to see on the front page of the New York Times, or might cause you to be deposed as a witness in a courtroom.&quot;  And it&#x27;s not just about anti-trust; you also never want to talk in any kind of discoverable medium how an engineering short-cut in the development of your product (say, like a 737) is going to cause people to get killed.<p>All of this is not unique to Google, but applies to any company with half-way competent lawyers and a half-way competent HR department.')
