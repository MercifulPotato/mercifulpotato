They’re big, yes, and full of detail - but incomprehensible doesn’t sound right.<p>However, I’m sure that this is true in certain cases, and I would appreciate reading about specific examples of complexity that are well hidden, so the exact nature of the complexity can be described. What complexity do people systematically underestimate? What defies all understanding?<p>Throwing our hands up and saying it all is incomprehensible is akin to ceding control over everything to the few that have understood everything.')
