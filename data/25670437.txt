Sadly, it seems to me that we&#x27;re taking the opposite direction. Just few widely used messengers, all of them are centralized, some of them have E2EE, but who knows for how long - EU commission seems to like the idea of breaking in. No matter what their intentions are, I didn&#x27;t sign up for that.')
