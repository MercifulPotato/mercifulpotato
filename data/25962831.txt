The only argument is to punish the rich...at the rate we are going, all collected taxes will soon become insignificant relative to new debt...i.e. why collect one dollar when you are printing twenty? Just print nineteen.<p>I&#x27;m not the first to recognize that at our current rate, it would be sensible to simply cancel Federal taxation. This would be an instant, decentralized stimulus that requires no new bureaucracy.')
