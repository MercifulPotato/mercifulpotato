In some cities you&#x27;re more likely to see casual litter, in other places more people cleaning up after themselves.<p>For every decade you go back in time there will be more and more classes of people who had a much harder time of fitting into society, along with the lack of many other freedoms that we take for granted now.<p>Once nobody has to constantly struggle for basic comforts, I think humanity will be able to chill the fuck out.')
