I haven&#x27;t found PowerShell more useful than zsh&#x2F;bash or fish (if you haven&#x27;t, try fish, it has a lot of benefits of PowerShell (fish has its own scripting language that is more &quot;language like&quot;, like some of the more simple constructs of Python, syntax wise) but via a simple plugin[0] you get bash compatibility too, and its made <i>for</i> Unix like environments). I do like that it has a rich object data model, I just don&#x27;t do that kind of thing in my shell. I mostly use aliases, shortcuts, and maybe some grepping. I don&#x27;t do heavy duty tasks from the command line where I&#x27;m not writing the logic in the first place, and I just find it easier to use the standard that my team does (currently, this is JavaScript, with the shebang it executes just like a binary. We can reliably say everyone has the same version of node)<p>Maybe in the future this will change, but I don&#x27;t see the win to divide my attention economy to it deeply, personally.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;edc&#x2F;bass" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;edc&#x2F;bass</a>')
