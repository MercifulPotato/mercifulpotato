Often it honestly depends on both sides of the project.<p>I&#x27;ve seen projects where bad requirements led to cost overruns and&#x2F;or delays due to required rework.<p>I&#x27;ve seen projects where due to bad&#x2F;strict requirements the customer&#x27;s product basically became the &#x27;learning platform&#x27; for a team to use &#x27;the hot new web ui framework toolchain&#x27; of the year. I made sure to completely forget what I &#x27;learned&#x27; about react&#x2F;redux after leaving that gig.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen projects where the contract house threw bodies on that didn&#x27;t even know the language used. I&#x27;ve seen horror story houses that are code-genies that overcharge to give you exactly what you didn&#x27;t want.<p>But in this case My guess it would be a combination of requirements fustercluckery alongside what sounds like an integration nightmare; from my time working in an environment where we had to do a lot of &#x27;etl loads&#x27; from different partners and&#x2F;or acquisitions, you see a lot of snowflake cases.')
