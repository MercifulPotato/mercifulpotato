For example, I recall reading a blog &quot;Why Python is a Lisp&quot; or something. And it basically destroyed this idea that Lisp was some magical insane language because the author did all the lisp things except they used python.<p>But yes, in some of the minor claims, I think there&#x27;s some credence to the idea.
