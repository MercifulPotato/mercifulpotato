And that’s what I see in the right-wing of today in the US. &quot;<p>It seems you had a bad experience with what you <i>felt</i> were &#x27;right wing&#x27; ideals but probably had little to do with that, as it would be a pretty intellectually shallow description of any kind of Conservatism (although understandable if one were to equate &#x27;Trump&#x27; with &#x27;Conservative&#x27; and I don&#x27;t think many people would in the intellectual sense) and also oddly experientially &#x27;upside down&#x27;.<p>Most &#x27;young people&#x27; are progressive, people tend to get more conservative as they get older.<p>Cynically, one could say it&#x27;s due to age and myopia, but more likely it has to do with responsibility, perspective, maturity and frankly living through decades and seeing how the world adapts.<p>Believing in the institutions of family (and monogamy as a commitment to that institution), the objective rule of law, moral obligation through duty of various kinds of community service, prudence, faith as an integral part of worldview, a sense of community that can possibly be expressed through nationalism, the notion that people must act responsibly to the extent they are able and assume responsibility for their actions - these are not ideals of &#x27;entitlement&#x27; frankly.<p>Barack Obama, for example, is a &#x27;Progressive Conservative&#x27;, and he is in many ways in his own personal life a model &#x27;cultural conservative&#x27;: religious, church going, mild mannered, straight forward marriage, traditional formal education. He speaks formally and graciously, and is literally a living embodiment of many cultural historical artefacts. He didn&#x27;t serve in the military but he very well could have, it&#x27;s totally within his character.<p>He&#x27;s not at all that far away from Mitt Romney for example.<p>Donald Trump is not a &#x27;Conservative&#x27; or even &#x27;right wing&#x27; really, he&#x27;s just a jerk who found a &#x27;following&#x27; in appealing to the worst qualities of &#x27;bad right wing tropes&#x27;.<p>&quot;In 1999, Trump described himself as &quot;very pro-choice&quot; and said &quot;I believe in choice.&quot; (Wikipedia)<p>Donald Trump was a tough-guy New York &#x27;kind of Democrat&#x27; most of his life. He always supported gay marriage. The Clintons were <i>literally at his wedding</i> to Melania.<p>He&#x27;s a serial scammer, effectively a polygamist who marries woman purely on the basis of their attractiveness and then dumps them later, cavorts with prostitutes, lies, cheats, steals.<p>He changes his political views to suit the day, because they don&#x27;t matter to him - he&#x27;s just about being rich and popular.<p>He&#x27;s managed to convince a lot of people that he is something that he is not, and that&#x27;s sad, and it&#x27;s brought out the worst in so many people, and that&#x27;s what we are seeing today.<p>Have a look at this Charlie Rose interview with Senator Jeff Flake who&#x27;s a much more traditional conservative, and FYI detests Donald Trump and &#x27;fell on his sword&#x27; rather than go along with the toxicity.
