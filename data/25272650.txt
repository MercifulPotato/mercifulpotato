This in essence means company or individual using this cloud services neither own the compute resources and data hosted in it.<p>On the other hand in self-hosted infrastructure government notice will not block access to resources owned by you and data in those resources. You can respond to notice and continue using those resources until court rules. So it is more freedom than a cloud can offer.<p>Obviously given the large marketing budget and convenience cloud provider flourish at the expense of freedom.<p>Self-hosted infrastructure needs a new renaissance given whats happening around the world and how government and large corporation taking away freedom one bite at a time. So it is very essential for development and freedom for humanity to have self-hosted compute, networking and data infrastructure.')
