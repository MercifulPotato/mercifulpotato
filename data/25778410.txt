Currently, my preferred solution to the problem of Sybil attacks in decentralized social networks is a reputation system based on a meritocratic web of trust.<p>Basically it would work something like this: By default, clients hide content (comments, submissions, votes, etc) created by new identities, treating it as untrusted (possible spam&#x2F;abusive&#x2F;malicious content) unless another identity with a good reputation vouches for it. (Either by vouching for the content directly, or vouching for the identity that submitted it.) Upvoting a piece of content vouches for it, and increases your identity&#x27;s trust in the content&#x27;s submitter. Flagging a piece of content distrusts it and decreases your identity&#x27;s trust in the content&#x27;s submitter (possibly by a large amount depending on the flag type), and in other identities that vouched for that content. Previously unseen identities are assigned a reputation based on how much other identities you trust (and they identities <i>they</i> trust, etc.) trust or distrust that unseen identity.<p>The advantage of this system is that it not only prevents sibyl attacks, but also doubles as a form of fully decentralized community-driven moderation.<p>That&#x27;s the general idea anyway. The exact details of how a system like that would work probably need a lot of fleshing out and real-world testing in order to make them work effectively.')
