The entire thing was an intelligence plant that Greenwald swallowed hook, line and sinker.<p>There&#x27;s a <i>reason</i> why dozens of highly respected, experienced investigative journalists took a good look at the information supposedly retrieved from this &quot;laptop&quot; and decided not to proceed with publishing any of it. Because they didn&#x27;t want to embarrass themselves by publishing obvious fabrications.<p>From USA Today:<p>&quot;John Paul Mac Isaac — owner of The Mac Shop — told reporters that a man who identified himself as Hunter Biden brought three liquid-damaged laptops to his repair shop in April 2019, per the Delaware News Journal.<p>The man left one laptop for repair and never returned to retrieve it.<p>Eventually, Mac Isaac gave a copy of the laptop&#x27;s hard drive to Brian Costello, an attorney for Rudy Giuliani, who is the personal lawyer for President Donald Trump. Mac Isaac said he turned the hard drive over to Costello because of fears for his safety.&quot;')
