For the rest all this rhetoric about fascism, racism, trans-activism and other critical-theory related issues does nothing but drive a wedge between those who are in support of deconstruction and those who oppose it - there is no middle position here. It is a small but vocal minority which supports this, that is why it keeps on cropping up everywhere. Unfortunately the majority of those who oppose it are afraid to say so out of fear of being ostracized or cancelled.<p>I&#x27;ve been a volunteer for the GNU project for many years but I vehemently oppose this type of activism. It doesn&#x27;t help the project, it doesn&#x27;t help forwarding is goals, it only serves to brand the project and in extension free software as yet another thing to be shunned by those who do not hold with critical theory.')
