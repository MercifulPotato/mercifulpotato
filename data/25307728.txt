Suggesting there was much more anti-China astroturfing around election season. Which is expected considering Trump&#x27;s entire platform was anti-China, and there&#x27;s much more anti-China shills than pro-China shills.<p>I too have noticed more pro-China voices on worldnews, but I&#x27;ve monitored and tagged via redditprotools and from my observation these pro-China regulars have been participating for a while, they just used to be more drowned out (suppressed by downvotes) by relatively more dominant anti-China voice. For example, the amount of anti-China users who also actively posted in &#x2F;r&#x2F;hongkong has dramatically reduced - hundreds of thousands of low effort HK virtue signallers lost interest. The conversation is balanced now or returned to pre HK drama &#x2F; post tradewar balance, where pro-China views occasionally get positive reception, whereas before they&#x27;d be lucky to be downvoted but controversial.<p>There&#x27;s still handful of anti-China HKers&#x2F;TWers making substantive posts, but mostly indian nationalists or generic anti-China-lifers shitposting now. Bluntly, most anti-China voices are low-effort, ignorant haters with poor boilerplate China-bad rhetoric. Pro-China voices are typically Chinese national, or diaspora or adjacent, they have actual experience and knowledge on Chinese related issues from Chinese perspective. At the end of the day &#x2F;r&#x2F;50k sino users can&#x27;t out astroturf 500k &#x2F;r&#x2F;hongkong, 200k &#x2F;r&#x2F;china and comparably numerous india nationalist. But they do have better rhetoric and are more invested in the debate compared to lol chinabad tier commentary turned persecution complexes because their debunked GFW banned words copypasta didn&#x27;t cost 50c shills social credit points. Being anti-China isn&#x27;t immunity from being unhinged.')
