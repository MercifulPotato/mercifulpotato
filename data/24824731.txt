On paper every variant from the lowest to the top has an &#x27;optional&#x27; version with airbags.<p>In practice, the waiting period for any variant with safety features other than the top speced would be &quot;over 6 months, no gaurentees&quot;. ie: as a customer, I was forced to buy the top end variant -- with alloy wheels, chrome trim and all sorts of other crap which I did not care about because I wanted the safety features.<p>I think that maruti is using safety features as a way to upsell customers who care about safety. The difference isn&#x27;t a &quot;marginal cost&quot;. For some models, the difference is 30% the cost of the car.')
