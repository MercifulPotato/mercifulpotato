Their approach was to get a study visa. Covid notwithstanding, this would let you enter another country for a prolonged period of time, and you could use your time there to pick your life back up. Canada, for example, has a much more lax immigration policy compared to the US.<p>I went the study visa -&gt; work visa -&gt; permanent residency -&gt; citizenship path myself - though, thankfully, I had the luxury of not having the pressure of being forced to leave behind a country with an unstable government (I went from Brazil to Canada). I&#x27;ve since also obtained a US green card (I had that process started before this whole &quot;election steal&quot; kerfuffle started).<p>The obvious downside of this approach is that it might become difficult to visit family (e.g. because international travel can be expensive, but in the Ethiopia case, literally due to fear of political backlash), though if the alternative comes down to literally having to stock up on guns and ammo, that might not be a bad trade-off...')
