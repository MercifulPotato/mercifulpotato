Get a good quality high performance ARM64 chip, pair it with a larger than typical battery, and build a laptop that never actually shuts off unless the battery charge falls below 10% and the lid is closed.<p>This would be a better machine all around anyway. You could close it with ssh sessions open and open it again and they&#x27;re still open. You could run P2P software in the background and it would never have to re-bootstrap. You could connect to it remotely to access files any time. Computers that turn off all the time suck.')
