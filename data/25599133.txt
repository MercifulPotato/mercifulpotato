I had a discussion with a friend about his son&#x27;s education. He was divided over &quot;do I teach him to do good, or do I teach him to be selfish? Because there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any downside to being selfish these days&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve generally experienced outsized rewards from being selfless. But then I have struggled with defining my ambition, so all rewards seem awesome. I have friends who are laser-focused on an outcome, and for them my &quot;do random good stuff and the universe will give you good stuff back&quot; approach is insane. They&#x27;re all &quot;fuck everyone else, I need this&quot; and it seems to work for them. But that comes with zero sense of social obligation. And I can&#x27;t see how society is supposed to work if everyone behaves likes this.')
