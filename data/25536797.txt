I don’t think it matters much, though, as you can have a great non-UNIX OS, which Linux definitely is.<p>Also, we might forget it now, but in the past there were a lot of UNIX that were quite different in small and large ways. The differences between Linux and Darwin might be as great as the differences between SunOS and Xenix, or indeed NeXTSTEP, back in the day. Or maybe not, that was before my time, but my point is that UNIX was not a monolith and there were incompatibilities and different ways of doing things. So I guess yeah, Linux might be what one of these might have become.<p>I just find it ironic that so many people are keen to compare macOS to UNIX and just assume that macOS has to be the weird outsider, even though the reverse is actually true. The same people also often assume Linux-isms are the way UNIX works, like the now-dead comment about macOS’ commands not supporting GNU options.')
