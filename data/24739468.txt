Obviously one solution is to call out to a different programing language for only the areas that require it, but I’d consider that a definite deficiency if it’s commonly required.<p>I think e.g C# and F# handle mutation well, but I think F# does the right thing by not <i>encouraging</i> it like C#.<p>Being able to control the in-memory representation of data and do things like sort arrays in-place etc to some people seems to be rare and to others happens on day 1 even at toy scale. Depends on what problems you are solving I suppose.')
