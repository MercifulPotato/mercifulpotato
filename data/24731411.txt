I thought about exactly doing that at one point, since I block most ads, although I do it via &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts instead of AdBlock, so that makes it a little harder.<p>I also have custom CSS&#x2F;JS rules to block those infuriating chat box popups on various websites and thought it might be fun to not only block them but also run a chat bot on them in the background for every chat box that pops up unsolicited. Waste their time and maybe they will learn very quickly that unsolicited chat popups are the most annoying UX ever.<p>(To be clear, I love chat UIs for customer support -- but not <i>unsolicited</i> &quot;Can I help you?&quot; sales chat boxes that pop up and cover part of the screen before you have even had a chance to understand the product.)')
