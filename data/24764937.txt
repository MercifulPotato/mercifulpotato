Most of the problems people had with DOS memory protection issues were due to the lack of standardization around memory management. Similarly so with Windows 3.x, running DOS programs from Windows on top of DOS was never going to work well. Even Windows95 had its problems.<p>On the Amiga it didn&#x27;t have this problem. There was AmigaOS and that was it. The base hardware was for the most part tightly coupled to the OS and the architecture was designed to provide standardised mechanisms for accessing hardware that were fairly stable. The Amiga had different stability issues of course, but my A4000 manages fine without memory protection despite having a full MMU on-board.')
