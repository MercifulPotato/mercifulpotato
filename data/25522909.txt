Most comparisons at Internet are out of date, usually new features are added to software all the time. I also have not found up-to-date comparisons site. Comparisons pages can also get very long, some kind of summary would be nice, if possible. I should sometime try to update this out-of-date comparisons page <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wekan&#x2F;wekan&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wekan-vs-Trello-vs-Restyaboard" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wekan&#x2F;wekan&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wekan-vs-Trello-vs-Resty...</a> , after creating that there has been many changes.<p>- For example, Wekan has some same features that Trello also has. Wekan has some features Trello does not have, like Open Source, self-hosting, Swimlanes, etc. Trello has some features Wekan does not have, like burndown charts.')
