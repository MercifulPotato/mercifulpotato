So I’m not sure what the point of your comment is. I think you are getting at the fact that there’s a lot of bad-faith grifters out there who prey on entry-level devs. This is a legitimate concern! But in my experience it’s pretty easy to sniff those folks out with a superficial investigation. You don’t want to “spend any time” watching the video but I think you can spend two minutes skimming their other work, their CV, etc.<p>I myself didn’t know anything about this person so I poked through their blog a bit. They are clearly marketing their education business (and I am not their target audience) but also seem to know what they’re talking about. More to the point: their material appears to be sincerely helpful to intermediate (and even advanced) NET devs. This relatively short post on unsafe array access in C#[1] although not especially deep, does at least dive into the runtime &#x2F; IL internals enough to give a clear picture of what the unsafe code is actually doing.<p>I haven’t watched the video either but they are creating good-faith tutorials, they are obviously capable of understanding the .NET GC, and there’s no reason to suspect they would change type and BS their way through a new video series.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tooslowexception.com&#x2F;getting-rid-of-array-bound-checks-ref-returns-and-net-5&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tooslowexception.com&#x2F;getting-rid-of-array-bound-chec...</a>')
