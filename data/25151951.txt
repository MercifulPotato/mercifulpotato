Many HN stories have political overlap. At the same time, we can&#x27;t allow all political posts and we have to moderate flamewars, or HN will turn into a political site, which is against its mandate (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>).<p>I&#x27;ve written about this many times: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=political%20overlap%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=political%20overlap%20by:dang&amp;...</a>. These explanations have become pretty stable by now, so I think they answer the question pretty completely. Some good threads to start with might be <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21607844" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21607844</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22902396" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22902396</a>.<p>If anyone has a better idea about how we should approach this, I&#x27;d love to hear it. But please make sure that you&#x27;ve familiarized yourself with the previous explanations first and understand the constraints we&#x27;re subject to. If it&#x27;s something simple like &quot;just ban politics&quot; or &quot;just allow everything&quot;, I&#x27;ve already answered many times why that won&#x27;t work.')
