When machine guns became generally available (and i&#x27;m aware $200 is not &quot;generally available&quot; in 1920).  That changed.  These weapons were introduced to &quot;force multiply&quot; an individual.<p>Before the internet, the amount of damange a single guy with free speech could do was pretty limited.  But with the internet, we&#x27;re all force-multiplied.  This message is probably going to be read by hundreds of people.  Maybe thousands.  In meat space, i&#x27;d have to be standing in a large concert hall for that kind of audince.<p>I still believe in free-speech, and frankly I also believe regular individuals should be able to buy machine guns.  But I don&#x27;t blame people for having some hesitation about that.  Crazy people exist... and force-multiplying those individuals can cause a lot of harm to society. I&#x27;m very pro-speech, but I respect that we might need to have a conversation about it.')
