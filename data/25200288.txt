To get it formed into that shape, potentially very expensive.<p>It looks like aluminum. Someone posted 23.5&quot; x 23.5&quot; x ~144&quot; as the dimensions. This comes out to be 46 cubic feet, and would weigh about 7,700 lbs. A floor of the price would be ~40 cents&#x2F;lb scrap price, or ~$3,100. Ballpark 80-120 cents&#x2F;lb might be a more realistic price if it were straightforward to manufacture like that (which it&#x27;s certainly not).<p>As an industrial engineer and former employee of one of the largest aluminum plants in the world, I can safely say I doubt it is solid rolled aluminum, and bet it would be way bigger of an extrusion that is possible. And logistically, it would be far easier to transport to a remote location via helicopter if it wasn&#x27;t solid. Any machining, metal forming, etc. would require specialized large equipment, and would quickly drive the cost up, potentially an order of magnitude higher than material costs.')
