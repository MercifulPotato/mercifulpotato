The market for standalone cameras has been shrinking and the market that remains is largely moving towards mirrorless where Nikon lags. Nikon lags here so their customers are moving to competitors like Sony and Canon and because they&#x27;re buying into an entire camera system moving back to Nikon will be difficult and expensive. It&#x27;s tough to imagine a scenario where things improve anytime soon.')
