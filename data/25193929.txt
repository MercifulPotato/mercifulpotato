Then, if I clicked a recommended video again later, I&#x27;d know I had already seen it. Over time, as far as I could tell, YT stopped recommending videos I&#x27;d seen before as there were fewer and fewer videos I would check out that I had already seen.<p>May also be attributed to something else, or I&#x27;m getting old, but it seems to have been a fortunate outcome.')
