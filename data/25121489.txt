Item(by='Fnoord', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605603445, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25121303, text='Right now its only available for the Swiss.<p>Honestly, it depends where you are from.<p>Given that I am from Europe, when I host in the same country as I am from (ie. The Netherlands), I am only dealing with local law. The only problem I could have, is when I am dissident according to my country. I&#x27;m not though, and if I was I&#x27;d have to host in a country unfriendly to mine.<p>Fastmail is an Australian company. I don&#x27;t believe Australia has strong privacy laws. EU, at least, has GDPR. For most people, The Netherlands is an excellent place to host your data.<p>If you consider non-US cloud services, you end up in Europe as well. For example Hetzner, Jottacloud, TransIP just to mention a few.<p>You should also ensure they use a local domain. For example, thepiratebay.org isn&#x27;t local if you consider the service is from Sweden (and if its hosted in The Netherlands, neither is thepiratebay.se). Ik.me uses the .me ccTLD; Montenegro. Not a country known for its civil rights, AFAIK.<p>That being said, I don&#x27;t believe in &#x27;lifetime&#x27; either. Lifetime just means &#x27;as long as we last&#x27;. Its a risk an early adopter takes to invest. If the service succeeds, yes they might have lifetime. If it fails, it was an expensive purchase.<p>Case in point: Emby. I bought a lifetime license. Then they changed to closed source in version 4, and it lead to me switching to the last 3.x fork, Jellyfin. License useless.<p>The weird thing here, is that they provide the e-mail supposedly lifetime <i>and</i> free. TANSTAAFL, so the default should be suspicion. They don&#x27;t do advertising. What&#x27;s their profit model?')
