I have seen it break multiple times with two different scenarios:\n1) Backup system with external media (usb3) on XFS. The USB link goes down, the kernel panics inside some XFS code. Hard reset needed.\n2) Production system with &lt;1M files being actively read by apache http. Hot updating this folder via rsync randomly panics the system.<p>After a couple of times you just migrate to something sane, like ext4, and everything works flawlessly.')
