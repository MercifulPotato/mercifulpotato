For live-tv, I&#x27;ve had lots of issues with more popular feeds.  For example, when the fiance watches Big Brother, it&#x27;s the worst experience, I swear I&#x27;ve had to download almost every episode this season for her to be able to watch... it&#x27;s been pretty bad.<p>Not to mention trying to remember what is where etc... was so much easier when I had a list of shows, I&#x27;d check the torrent site(s) about once a week for new episodes, snag them all to a seedbox and download and watch local over the following week as time permitted.  At least with less TV I&#x27;m getting more done.')
