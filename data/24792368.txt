So there is no authorization for some random employee to &quot;check up&quot; on their partner, even though it sounds like escalating internally should help.  (It should at least trigger, &quot;we&#x27;d better look into this very carefully&quot;, though.  If it didn&#x27;t, that sounds like a problem.  If it did, and the result is &quot;yeah, this is legit&quot;, that&#x27;s a very awkward position for everyone.)<p>I was in a similar situation when I worked at Google.  My brother kind of disappeared, and my family asked if we could at least check if he logged into Gmail.  I asked and was told no, and I understood why -- it&#x27;s up to my brother to share what he&#x27;s up to, not Google.  (My brother was fine; just didn&#x27;t like replying to email or answering his phone.)')
