What could be communicated in an email, slack message, or hallway conversation is left to a meeting and I often wondered if it&#x27;s just because these folks want free lunch and some socialization.<p>One thing that remote work during the pandemic has demonstrated to me is the line at which chat rooms lose their efficacy as a tool for collaborative problem solving.<p>Many times a week I need to upgrade a conversation happening over chat to a video conversation, simply because The linearity of chat sessions makes it quite difficult to communicate  more complex concepts, especially causality. Something about spoken language allows us to communicate more dimension.<p>Furthermore, regularly scheduled face-to-face meetings over video are the only times I get to hear about work by members of my team whose day-to-day tasks do not overlap with mine.<p>It&#x27;s not just for the purposes of socialization - though socialization is very important in any team - but rather very frequently in meetings I learn about something that someone else is working on that is consequential to my own work.')
