People just drop dead when shot. Quake 2 had very painful death animations for the weakest enemies. Games that want a PG16 rating need to remove blood splashes.<p>In most game, your shots don&#x27;t hurt bystanders. There are no ricochets and usually no civilians. No one&#x27;s running away, putting out fires, crying over dead bodies.')
