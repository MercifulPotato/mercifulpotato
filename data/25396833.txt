I once tried to get the navigation stack running on a raspberry pi based robot to test out a gps driver, and was shocked that I had to include massive libraries for lidar and point clouds that I had no intention of using to get anything to build. In the end everything ran but the nav stack ate up so many resources that my robot wasnâ€™t able to move reliably.')
