Random oracles will likely be big business one day. I&#x27;m happy CF has put forward their  posture on this. It&#x27;s a good thing for the internets.<p>&gt; nor is &quot;good sources and throughput&quot;<p>So you can provide entropy with high quality guarantees at 10GB&#x2F;s? Sign me up mate. What&#x27;s your price?<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve been cagey about writing about this but this thread is now old<p>Who the fuck cares? Is this thread about actual discussion of the issue at hand or petty HN posturing? Couldn&#x27;t care less what influencers and randoms here think. Simply stating thoughts and experiences.<p>&gt; there is a misconception that running cryptography primitives somehow burns through entropy<p>Certainly agree, that&#x27;s not what I meant though. A broken seed is nearly always exploitable in practice. It doesn&#x27;t matter in the slightest how strong your primitives are when they are deterministic.<p>&gt; The lava lamps aren&#x27;t doing anything for Cloudflare&#x27;s security. They&#x27;re a marketing gimmick. A very good one!<p>Yeah, of course it&#x27;s marketing, but with purpose, exposing devs to this stuff is worthwhile, means to an end and all that. XOR&#x27;ing sources is as cryptograhpically strong as the best source provided, why not do it if you have much at stake and 20 mins to spare.')
