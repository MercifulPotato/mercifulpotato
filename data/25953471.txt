(Saying they cared about the little guy and these stocks were too volatile for them to handle)<p>Then they came out and said it was a liquidity issue. If it was simply a liquidity issue, why weren&#x27;t just margin orders halted? Why did they stop people with cash in their hand from buying stock?<p>None of Robinhood&#x27;s statements provide a full explanation.\nPeople are within their right to be absolutely livid at this moment and demand answers.<p>Some facts:<p>1) There is a conflict of interest when Robinhood routes the majority of trades through a high frequency trading firm that has an interest in short positions. Citadel bailed out Melvin who [probably] illegally naked shorted 150% of the float.<p>2) The CNBC interview explaining the liquidity issues that aired today was filmed yesterday.<p>3) Mainstream media has been feeding lies to the public. Who is buying the stock? (It&#x27;s foreign entities who hate America and capitalism!)\nWill the SEC come after the little guy?! Can they sue these investors?! (Absolutely not. Why the hell are you trying to put fear and doubt in the heads of these people?)<p>These facts along with Robinhood&#x27;s BS explanations lead people to believe that the reason that this happened is simply that the WRONG PEOPLE LOST MONEY.')
