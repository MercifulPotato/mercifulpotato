Item(by='UncleMeat', descendants=None, kids=[25529088], score=None, time=1608827406, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25526108, text='&gt; Unlimited immigration is unsustainable (Europe can’t support 3bn people), so there have to be some limits.<p>If it were just about population, why is there no concern with natural population rise due to birth rates?<p>&gt; Also, I value my culture (not in the “food &amp; language” sense, but in “enlightenment values” sense), and have no interest in admitting more people who don’t value or respect this culture.<p>Surely then it would be possible to institute a &quot;cultural test&quot; where people who do agree with &quot;enlightenment values&quot; are free to immigrate. I also think it is incredibly questionable for europe to lay claim to &quot;enlightenment values&quot;, as if those are a single unified system of values that belongs solely to europe and is matched by modern european states.')
