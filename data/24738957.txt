The two most common mistakes I see online are:<p>1) Not understanding the long elimination times of these vitamins. When overdose can take months or years to appear due to gradual accumulation, it becomes difficult to associate health problems with slowly increasing vitamin levels. Most people don’t realize that overdose won’t be immediately apparent.<p>2) Forgetting to account for dietary Vitamin D intake. The way some people talk about Vitamin D, you’d think that supplements and sunlight are the only way to get it. If these people added up all of the Vitamin D they received through their diet they might be surprised that their combined dietary plus supplemental Vitamin D intake is higher than they wanted.')
