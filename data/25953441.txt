It&#x27;s a good example of how the internet breaks good people.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s why habitual bullshitters like Elon Musk hate shorts. Musk leads a cult of credulous worshippers who buy whatever he&#x27;s selling. Shorts make bets that Musk&#x27;s cultists will get deprogrammed. Musk uses this to sharpen his cultists&#x27; resolve: &quot;they want us to fail!&quot;<p>An alternate explanation of Elon Musks position might be the ongoing day in, day out attacks from Short Sellers on Twitter ($TSLAQ), Reddit, HN of his products to devalue them.<p>It&#x27;s not just pointing out flaws. It&#x27;s information warfare. They will and do lie.')
