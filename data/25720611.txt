I think this is wrong.<p>I have worked at a good number of places, including a FAAMG.<p>The freedom that was given to me directly correlates to company size &amp; seniority.<p>When I was younger, I didn&#x27;t get much autonomy, why? because I was a naive arrogant prick. I would dream up solutions to problems that didn&#x27;t exist. I would make existing problems worse by trying out new things.<p>When a company gets larger, it will bump into problems, missed features, deadlines or massive bugs. New procedures will get be implemented to make sure that those don&#x27;t happen again. Ticketing is a good thing, so long as its developer lead. It allows delegation of tasks, and simple tracking of state. Its an artform that should be taught.<p>I was at a start up for two years that was bought out by a FAAMG. We were working on cutting edge computer vision research. We had a tight process, tracked with ticketing. We had complete autonomy.<p>We were chucked into SV &quot;culture&quot; only to find that is somehow managed to make cutting edge research both more chaotic <i>and</i> boring. Ironically I have much less freedom than I did when I worked at a large financial newspaper.')
