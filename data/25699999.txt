DSLs give you a new set of primitives which is more suited to the problem domain and makes it harder to make mistakes by accidentally encoding things which don&#x27;t exist in the problem domain.<p>Of course, just making a DSL isn&#x27;t enough. Some DSLs are badly designed and inelegant, or their features do not compose well with each other. But a well designed DSL can be a thing of both beauty and clarity.<p>I think this shouldn&#x27;t be surprising as even modern programming languages are DSLs of a kind when compared to machine code.')
