If it is then inaccurate, we&#x27;re OK with that, we see it as artistic freedom. This game tries to base itself directly on history. Big difference!&quot;<p>The author very explicitly states: &quot;As I have argued here many times, fiction is often how the public conceptualizes the past and that concept of the past shapes the decisions we make in the present.&quot;<p>Through that lense, I would argue that &quot;the Nordic theme in World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King&quot; or &quot;Norsca and Warriors of Chaos in Total War: Warhammer II&quot;, while inaccurate, will still heavily sway perceptions on them. The artistic licenses do shape how they are percieved to the player.')
