Each one of these department can ask for a wiki on the platform, manage access rights on this wiki based on departments or groups. Pages are stored as markdown files and are backed on a git directory. Each wiki get its own git repository, hosted somewhere (e.g. gitlab), meaning on would be able to edit a page either on the wiki platform or by cloning the git repository.<p>I&#x27;ve found Zim[1], Gollum[2], WikiJS[3], Dokuwiki[4], GitIt[5] and BookStack[6]. Each one of them have nice features, but none of them have mixed features in authentication, multi-teneancy or git-backed.<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to see how this will be done in WikiJS as multi-site support will be released in version 3 (ETA: Q4 2020), but as far as I can tell, this is the closest to my requirements.<p>I write in the hope that someone have an alternative to suggest or a way to do it?<p>Thanks anyways!<p>--<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zim-wiki.org&#x2F;<p>[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gollum&#x2F;gollum&#x2F;wiki<p>[3]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.js.org&#x2F;<p>[4]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dokuwiki.org&#x2F;dokuwiki<p>[5]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jgm&#x2F;gitit<p>[6]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bookstackapp.com&#x2F;')
