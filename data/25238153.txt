Servo was incubated inside Mozilla, and served as the proof that important web components such as CSS and rendering could be implemented in Rust, with all its safety, concurrency and speed.</i><p>This is clearly written by someone who sees Servo as a showcase for Rust above anything else rather than <i>what tf it is</i>, such as a state-of-the-art rendering engine. But the developers addressed as readers, such as me, care about the state and coverage of the actual layout engine, CSS parsing&#x2F;matching, rendering and rendering targets, font handling, and the like.<p>I&#x27;m not the only one bringing this up; when the announcement was discussed [1], there were similar sentiments. For me, a programming language is a means to an end for creating machine code, not an end in itself. This focus (and Mozilla and developers walking away from it) also hints at Servo not being all that useful (or incomplete?) for actual rendering; we don&#x27;t really know. Anyway, the take away for me is that diving into Servo and Rust is probably not worth my time investment.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25125325" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25125325</a>')
