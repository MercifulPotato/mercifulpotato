The version that requires almost a deliberate imagination against the likely interpretation. Besides being against the HN guidelines...Of course humans hunt in packs. What are you even thinking?<p>I&#x27;m sure you weren&#x27;t trying to do that specifically, but this propensity of people to straw man everything to find a gap to then comment against, and pretend that their &quot;successful&quot; comment against a straw man disproves the real comment they&#x27;re replying to (which of course it doesn&#x27;t), lets me feel like commenting online is so different to talking in person. Almost like every comment needs to be written like a legal document covering every possible edge case and malicious misinterpretation...Ugh. People seem obsessed with being right and proving others wrong, rather than learning. So often pretending it&#x27;s binary, rather than nuanced.<p>I guess this is the &quot;game&quot; of commenting online. We pretend it&#x27;s about learning, but actually it&#x27;s about &quot;outwitting&quot; others with these malicious misinterpretations (bad faith interpretations), malevolent reframings, ignoring data that contravenes your cherished beliefs (confirmation bias) and other dirty rhetorical tricks. Maybe everyone&#x27;s day to day sucks so much they need to come online to feel they&#x27;re finally smarter and more dominant than someone else...maybe it&#x27;s just an outlet....Of course it&#x27;s not. There&#x27;s plenty of good discussions, but the bad discussions happen much more online than in real life.<p>I don&#x27;t care to get good at such a &quot;game&quot;. I want to be able to defend against that balderdash type commentary, rather than just tolerate or ignore it, but I also want to learn. I&#x27;m pretty certain I&#x27;m guilty of most of this stuff myself......I think this metacomment by me can serve as a reminder to myself to try to get good enough at this game so I can ignore it, but to not make that my focus, with my focus instead being learning. If I do bother to comment, I may as well create and get something good for myself and others.')
