(I&#x27;ve lived in Saigon for 7+ years.)<p>In official stuff they&#x27;ll say Ho Chi Minh City but in casual conversation, I&#x27;d guesstimate 80%+ of the time people say Saigon. But if someone drops in a Ho Chi Minh City instead it isn&#x27;t especially noteworthy.<p>Saigon also gets used on things like, say, book titles: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fahasa.com&#x2F;sai-gon-ky-an-cuoc-phieu-luu-cua-nhung-giac-mo.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fahasa.com&#x2F;sai-gon-ky-an-cuoc-phieu-luu-cua-nhun...</a><p>or movie titles: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;title&#x2F;tt12937684&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;title&#x2F;tt12937684&#x2F;</a><p>Saying &quot;Saigon&quot; doesn&#x27;t have any particular connotation. Like, it doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;we refuse to accept the North won&quot; or &quot;we refuse to accept the renaming&quot;. (Some Viet Kieu in America are crazy about that kind of thing, though.) It is mostly just that Saigon is two syllables and Ho City Minh City is five syllables.<p>That said: &quot;Saigon&quot; tends to refer to the inner metro area. &quot;Ho Chi Minh City&quot; actually covers a massive area -- it is the size of a province. It is divided into 24 districts and I don&#x27;t think anyone from the outer 5 rural districts would say they live in &quot;Saigon&quot;.<p>Also note that the airport in Saigon still has the code SGN.')
