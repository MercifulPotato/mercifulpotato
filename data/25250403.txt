The auto-on&#x2F;-off part really does little for security, it&#x27;s the firewalling that does the trick. Turning it off is good to save costs though.<p>I&#x27;m actually working on basically exactly what you described (using WP2Static), and we&#x27;re planning for a competitive $10-15&#x2F;mo price, but we&#x27;re not quite ready for launch yet.')
