You don&#x27;t believe we landed on the moon? Okay, buddy, have a nice day.<p>Occasionally, though, conspiracy theorists escape the harmless fringe and become actively harmful to society, which is what many of us believe is happening in the USA today. A racist conspiracy theory that posited, contrary to all evidence, that our previous president was born in another country, combined with some conspiracy theories popular among &quot;the Tea Party movement&quot; as they were known, propelled our current president into office, where the theories have snowballed and escalated into shots fired in a pizza parlor, protesters murdered by car, protestors murdered by gun, illegal voter intimidation, and a significant chunk of the population not quite ruling out the possibility that a huge chunk of elected officials and others are part of a cabal of devil-worshipping pederasts who drink the blood of children.<p>Faked moon landings this ain&#x27;t. Crazy Uncle Roger this ain&#x27;t.<p>I do live in the US, and I encounter the results of this weekly, sometimes more often. It doesn&#x27;t take visiting 8kun to be affected by this here.<p>Update: There are people on this page, right here at HN, stating misleading nonsense tangentially related to QAnon. The spread of this stuff is pervasive already.')
