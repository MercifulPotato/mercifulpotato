If we didn&#x27;t have computers and a global internet, there&#x27;s no way we would be shutting down everything.<p>My take on this is that, without the internet, we would (1) either still choose to lock down and cause much greater economic harm[^1], or (2) not choose to lock down and lose more lives. I&#x27;m not disagreeing with the fact that we still need to perform a costâ€“benefit analysis before going into lockdowns. But the internet has lowered the &quot;cost&quot; part of this analysis, by allowing most people to continue to work during lockdowns.<p>[^1] Note that during the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic, there were also lockdowns: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nationalgeographic.com&#x2F;history&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;how-cities-flattened-curve-1918-spanish-flu-pandemic-coronavirus&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nationalgeographic.com&#x2F;history&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;how-citie...</a>')
