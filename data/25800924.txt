Clicking on the &quot;past&quot; link for the present submission does not turn up that past submission, although the links are identical.<p>&gt;However, clicking on the &quot;past&quot; link for that three year old submission does turn up the present submission.<p>The &quot;past&quot; feature is implemented by a third-party site, not HN.<p>Also, you can see the URL of the page and highlighted text on the page that it&#x27;s searching by the title text as well as the link. The previous submission&#x27;s title did not have all the words of the current one, hence does not show in the search results.')
