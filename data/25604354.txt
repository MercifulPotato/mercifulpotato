But it should be able to run in the same tech stack it was running before, or provide some way to interoperate. The game shouldn&#x27;t be designed in a way that makes it possible for someone else to unilaterally shut down the game with no recourse.<p>To illustrate, if FarmVille were an offline game that costed $1000, I could still set up a Windows XP computer, install Flash, and play it. It&#x27;s not trivial, but it&#x27;s very doable and legal.<p>But instead, actual FarmVille is designed so that it needs an online infrastructure (so far so good, it&#x27;s a core part of the game after all), <i>but by design this infrastructure can only be provided by Zynga</i>. You can&#x27;t replicate it even if you want to.')
