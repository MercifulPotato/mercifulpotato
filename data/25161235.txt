You can solve this context problem through a DI container, or by direct parameter passing, but whatever you do, there will be a layer which can expose the requirements as types.<p>I&#x27;m not a know-it-all who&#x27;ll dictate how you need to structure your program on HN, so what I stated above is just me thinking out loud, but let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s up to the programmer to make everything safe-r with the tools available, be it runtime checks or the type system.')
