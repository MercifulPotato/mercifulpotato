Normally, if there is a drop in grid frequency, a small increase will be planned later to maintain a long term average frequency of 50Hz so that clocks that keep time by grid frequency stay accurate [0].<p>The network split seems to have made this impossible, during the split, the cycle counts for the two regions diverged, and the split ended before this was reconciled.
