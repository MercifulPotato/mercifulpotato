My bet is most people who try it won&#x27;t buy a second one and will even stop using the first one. Taking off and on every day to charge is a huuuuge hassle , its much worse than a phone that naturally lends itself to being charged (because it rests on a desk anyway usually). But most of all the utility is not there, it wanes fast and the whole &quot;breathe&quot; thing is just ridiculous. The mi band is like $30 and lasts for a whole month on a single charge. Garmin watches seem to be popular with sports enthusiasts. &quot;Normal&quot; people dont have a use for a daily-charger phone. It&#x27;s mostly a fashion item for all i know, one that needs extra effort.')
