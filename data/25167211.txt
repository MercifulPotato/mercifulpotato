He was anchored in that area, and his boat didn&#x27;t right itself in the wind like it always had before.<p>When things go bad on a boat, they go bad fast. The skiff he planned to hop in and get to shore sank before he could get into it. He did get his survival suit on, which kept him alive long enough to be rescued.<p>This is a 70 year old man who&#x27;s spent his life fishing in the area. This was his day where almost everything went wrong. But he&#x27;d done enough right on his boat, and in his training, to set himself up for rescue.<p>I live in Sitka, where the helicopter crew that did this rescue is based. We hear stories about these kinds of rescues all the time. People have deep respect for USCG personnel here.')
