It also makes a lot of sense to let my radiators measure room temperature and let it detect open window.<p>Normally when i activate a radiator, in 2-3h the room is always way too hot and i do only put it to the middle number (3).<p>Is this critical? No\nIs this important? No\nCan i live without it? Yes<p>But i do think its here to stay and in the long run, IoT will become the default.<p>Light atmosphere actually works very well when you can activate it by one click\nLight switches are were you need&#x2F;want them\nVoice command feels much more natural and is quite useful<p>I like to think how my future house could incorporate something like alexa (a smart agent) in every room but 1. with powersavings 2. privacy in mind.<p>Something like the line in I, Robot where the main computer can see everthing.')
