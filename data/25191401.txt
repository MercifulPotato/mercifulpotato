Aren&#x27;t they glued on?  I guess window glass would be something but that <i>can</i> have serial numbers on it.<p>Maybe the seats would be worth something or the wheels, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be worth it really.  Besides, Tesla&#x27;s are still pretty high end and most purchasers are not really looking for a $50 set of wheels.')
