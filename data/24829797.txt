Sorry to everyone, really. But it&#x27;s oddly nice to know I&#x27;m not alone.<p>Many great replies. Covering most of what I&#x27;d say.<p>Piggybacking on your reply with some &quot;Yes, and...&quot;, because your advices are closest to my two cents.<p><i>&quot;Advocate for yourself. I was misdiagnosed six times before they finally figured out my issue.&quot;</i><p>Same. Many times.<p>I advise everyone to never accept &quot;No&quot;. Someone somewhere has the answers we need. Keep searching.<p><i>&quot;Choose a supportive partner.&quot;</i><p>I have no idea how to do that.<p><i>&quot;Keep a detailed diary of your symptoms and your daily activities, even when you&#x27;re feeling good.&quot;</i><p>And get a fitness tracker. Self reporting is not reliable.<p>My most recent example: I literally felt no different on or off wellbutrin (prescribed to help me recover from a surgery). I only knew that it was kicking my ass because of my Apple Watch&#x27;s activity monitoring (step counter).<p>Related bonus tip: I periodically stop misc scripts, just to be sure they&#x27;re still actually helping me.')
