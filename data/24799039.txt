The monetary aspect (hyperinflation in the old, change of currency in the new) is only a small part of that. You are correct - in that scenario, there are other things to tend to, more urgent.<p>I also witnessed that gold did <i>not</i> replace the collapsing currency. Other, non-collapsing currencies took on that role.<p>USD is safe and sound for as long US is safe and sound. The fiat currency is creation of the state. In collapse, I&#x27;d say causality goes 99% state-&gt;fiat. Only a small (2nd or 3rd order) effect in the opposite direction.<p>For the parent - &quot;Hyperinflation – It’s More Than Just a Monetary Phenomenon&quot; by pragcap.com<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pragcap.com&#x2F;hyperinflation-its-more-than-just-a-monetary-phenomenon&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pragcap.com&#x2F;hyperinflation-its-more-than-just-a-...</a><p>reads right for me. Even general inflation (= increase in P&#x2F;y) does not necessarily follow from the exchange equation (M V = P y) and money growth (M). There are other possibilities too, examples discussed in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;johntharvey&#x2F;2011&#x2F;05&#x2F;14&#x2F;money-growth-does-not-cause-inflation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;johntharvey&#x2F;2011&#x2F;05&#x2F;14&#x2F;money-gr...</a>.<p>To end on a more upbeat note: I also witnessed the hyperinflation tamed, the economy booming, without seemingly much effort and in short period of time. Looking back, I think the most important part is the right diagnosis: where is it coming from. Otherwise the cures end up worsening the disease.')
