My opinion is that they (China) should abandon this approach.<p>This was planned back in the early 2010s, before the rise of Trump and MAGA.<p>The reality and situation on the ground has changed. Now, the powers that be of America, is pursuing persecution and containment of all Chinese advancements in technology.<p>China should abandon Intel x86 and all software from Microsoft. In fact, they should ban it and make it illegal to use.<p>They should instead focus on Huawei’s new Harmony OS and a new RISC-V processor instruction set architecture.<p>They must also abandon ARM, since that’s under western control, and nVidia is trying to acquire it, which means it’ll also be under American control.<p>America played its card. They are willing to use sanctions for everything. The only way for China to counter, is to not play America’s game. And instead, to make their own game.<p>The benefit to this is multipronged. It allows domestic manufacturers to build expertise in software and hardware systems for operating systems, databases, application software, and hardware components.<p>But first, they must crack the photolithography barrier, and build a domestic competitor to ASML.<p>For Americans, you don’t have to worry about using Chinese technology, since you’re not the target market for this. You can’t anyways, since Huawei has been banned in America. So you don’t have to worry about China mysteriously spying on your Facebook posts (as if you’re really that important to them anyways).')
