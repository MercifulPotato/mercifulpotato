For example when I&#x27;m doing metrics I&#x27;ve always used &quot;timers&quot; to measure how quickly a program runs. I would never call a function which measures how long a process runs a stopwatch function, it would be a timer (or timing) function.<p>Until I owned an iPhone I&#x27;ve always thought of a stopwatch as the literal physical thing.')
