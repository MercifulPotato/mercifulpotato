The phrasing is defined in the article<p>&gt;These compounds may take hundreds, or even thousands, of years to break down in the environment. They can also persist in the human body, potentially causing health problems.<p>It is clear that this means &quot;Teflon&quot; and similar molecules that aren&#x27;t processed biologically. &quot;Forever chemicals&quot; here is excellent phrasing. They in fact last an indefinite amount of time in the ecosystem, and they are &quot;chemicals&quot; in that they are not naturally occurring.<p>For you to insist this is fearmongering is disingenuous and you should feel ashamed. This isn&#x27;t at all the same as calling water &quot;dihydrogen monoxide&quot; and hyping up fear of &quot;chemicals&quot;. There is in fact an active industry that promotes the production of these compounds for reasons of profit, and the externalities thereof are not at all taken into account by the mainstream understanding.')
