For a start you&#x27;re conflating drug use, open drug use and drug addiction. Homelessness obviously has some correlation with some types of drug use but there&#x27;s a lot of non-homeless, non-addicted drug users. And you haven&#x27;t touched on hard vs soft, addictive vs non-addictive drug use.<p>I&#x27;m not disagreeing because I&#x27;m genuinely not sure what point you&#x27;re making?')
