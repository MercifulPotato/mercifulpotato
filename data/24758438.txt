From personal experience I know that Google, Facebook and Netflix all test for cross functional leadership at the senior+ level. By the time you&#x27;re interviewing for senior or higher roles, only two of the six interviews are actually about coding at these companies. The rest are behavioral and system design, with specific questions used to calibrate how hands on you are and how much you&#x27;re used to working with many teams effectively in a large org.')
