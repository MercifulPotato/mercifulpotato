If you compare the rise of European facism to contemporary trends in US politics then the parallels are pretty stark.<p>If it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck... it is, at the least, a precursor to fascism. It doesn&#x27;t happen all at once, and if we wait until it&#x27;s plainly obvious to call it like it is, then it&#x27;ll probably be too late. And even if you don&#x27;t want to call it facist, it&#x27;s out of line to compare this shit to my personal blog. That&#x27;s a baseless character attack, which is a dick move, not to mention against the HN guidelines.')
