There have been recordings from aircraft hud cams of UFO’s. This doesn’t address the OPs question about hallucinations or hysteria or whatever, but it does give a little credence to a claim of a UFO. I’ve seen a UFO, by definition, something unidentified, unknown, then it was gone.<p>My grandfather told stories of things he saw flying for Eastern Airlines and later American Airlines. My uncles who flew F-16s all saw strange things too.<p>Ask any aviator that’s been flying heavy for 10+ years what strange things they have seen and they’ll have some stories.<p>I’m glad we, as a people, are talking about it, without jumping to conclusions about what these objects are.')
