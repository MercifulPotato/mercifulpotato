Also, I&#x27;m familiar with our voting procedures and have worked on election oversight, data gathering etc.<p>If we had an election that had a fraction of the irregularities that are surfacing in some of these problematic states, I&#x27;m pretty sure we would have been invaded by now. Jokes aside, those states are a similar population size to my country so it&#x27;s not apples and oranges.<p>Censorship is also something the US is quick to call out others for.')
