Not just financially (equity&#x2F;etc), but also:<p>- flexible schedules<p>- autonomy + impact<p>- interesting work<p>- culture (respect, appreciation... etc)<p>It&#x27;s not hard for me to imagine an environment where I&#x27;d love to work despite giving up <i>a lot</i> of salary. Hell, I&#x27;m not uniqueâ€”just look at how many incredibly skilled people choose research careers over <i>far</i> more lucrative industry jobs.<p>And yet, I don&#x27;t see many startups that seem serious about this. If you want to compete for great engineers, choose some of the things I outlined, <i>actually commit to maintaining them</i> and figure out how to demonstrate this (show, not just tell).')
