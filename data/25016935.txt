Item(by='feralimal', descendants=None, kids=[25020505], score=None, time=1604772284, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25014907, text='&gt; Square these two sentences, because you can&#x27;t accidentally &quot;only pay lip service to the scientific method&quot;. Are you or aren&#x27;t you claiming that scientists feign their rigor?<p>You can do everything right, follow the scientific method, but be answering the wrong question.<p>Eg, asking which of these 3 drugs is best for such and such a disease.  Ie you are excluding fasting or other alternatives.  You will build up a load of data on those 3 drugs perhaps, but fasting might be best of all.  You just don&#x27;t know.<p>But a scientist will say that there is no evidence to support fasting.  So the scientific method has studiously ignored inconvenient (unmarketable) options.<p>So is the scientist giving the best information here?  Are his&#x2F;her answers biased?<p>&gt; &gt; And, be honest, you don&#x27;t even need them to provide evidence for you to accept whatever they state.<p>&gt; I suggest that you stop such insinuation.<p>If you skim articles, watch TV, and don&#x27;t do research to satisfy yourself, you don&#x27;t have evidence.  You don&#x27;t know.  You may think you know.  And thinking you know, when you don&#x27;t, is dangerous.  This is a point worth considering - in my opinion it covers 99.99% of what passes for knowledge.<p>You may find that you have lots of belief and very little actual knowledge just a compound and rigid set of mutually reinforcing beliefs.  (This is akin to religion in fact). Which is at least an honest assessment of what most &#x27;scientists&#x27; are practising!  They believe that there is a body of evidence that supports what they think, and can take that for granted.  No one is checking that the foundations are as solid as they believe!<p>And that is the point of education.')
