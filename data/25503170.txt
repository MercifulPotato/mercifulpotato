I still dont see how selling and servicing Apple Cars would work for Apple if it is sold as an originally car. That large investment and sunk cost would be a good use for its Cash. ( And it would be part of their Services Revenue ) Apple also gets to trial and gather Data with their current Map Data Collection vehicle.<p>The problem is there is nothing, absolutely zero indication that we can crack Level 5 self driving within next 5 years. It is always easy to get the first 80%, the last 20%, the small and minor details will often take as long if not longer than the first 80%. We have just arrived at the 80% point, and there is always the illusion of we are close to Self Driving Goal. And we are not.<p>And apart from that there are no indication as to how Apple is competing with Batteries. Tesla as a car manufacture may be easy to replicate, ( only on a relative scale, it is actually difficult to make cars in mass quantities, especially with Apple that demands perfection. Unlike Tesla ) but Tesla Battery is at least 4 - 5 years ahead of everyone else from both technological <i>and</i> manufacturing. And no have seems to have shown a plausible plan of how Apple is going to tackle this.')
