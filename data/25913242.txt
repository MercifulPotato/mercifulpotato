(they may be flagged or dead so may not be visible unless you have your settings set to show dead)<p>&quot;Innocent until proven guilty&quot; doesn&#x27;t apply here since it&#x27;s not a specific individual being accused of a crime. This is a PUBLIC process within a constitutional republic (which means we use a public process known as an election to decide who makes decisions), and I believe the results of aforementioned PUBLIC process should be PUBLICLY <i>verifiable</i>. That isn&#x27;t an unfair statement.<p>Think about it, how do you <i>know</i> that Biden won? Considering you cannot <i>prove</i> that Biden won, and I cannot <i>prove</i> he didn&#x27;t win, I&#x27;d say we have a pretty broken process.')
