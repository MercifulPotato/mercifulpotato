These kind of apps are quite easily reverse engineered, because java binaries are not machine code binaries, rather java byte code. Today&#x27;s IDEs will decompile the java byte code in no time, giving you access to the source code.<p>The only line of defense the developers have is to obfuscate the code, but that only means that you will get access to a version of the source code where the original name of the variables, functions, classes was changed to abstract names so that code is harder to read. Even so, you are in much better state that going through disassembling an ELF binary.')
