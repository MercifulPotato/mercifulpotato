I&#x27;d love to see a graph of the marginal tax rate from 1k till say 6k.<p>Because here it seems from 2k, 3k or 4k, an extra 600 is taxed consistently by more than 50%, and sometimes even 75%. That&#x27;s a very high marginal tax rate. I wonder if that&#x27;s cherrypicking something and the x600 to x000 range looks better.<p>I also wonder what the taxes break down into, I think it&#x27;s always good to separate pure taxes (going to the government for the public good) from various social safety net contributions (some of which go to a general fund for the public good, but some are also individually-accrued benefits by paying a monthly premium, e.g. unemployment insurance of your particular salary).<p>When making cross-country comparisons, I find there&#x27;s a ton of apples to oranges comparisons like this, where taxes and other things aren&#x27;t properly separated and just lumped together.<p>Another example: in some countries healthcare is arranged as a benefit on-top of gross income. In others healthcare is subsidised by 80% by the government, and paid for through a tax on gross income. It could very well be that compensation in both these countries is the same, but that the former looks like you&#x27;re earning more because you get paid out more of your gross income.')
