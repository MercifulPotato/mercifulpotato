The first group comprises countries that have avoided a detectable rise (with a posterior probability of at least 90%) in all-cause mortality and includes Bulgaria, New Zealand, Slovakia, Australia, Czechia, Hungary, Poland, Norway, Denmark and Finland. The second and third groups of countries experienced a low-to-medium effect of the pandemic on overall deaths and include Austria, Switzerland and Portugal (low effect) and France, the Netherlands and Sweden (medium effect). The fourth group of countries, which experienced the highest mortality toll, consists of Belgium, Italy, Scotland, Spain and England and Wales.</i>&quot;')
