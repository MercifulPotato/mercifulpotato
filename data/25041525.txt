They&#x27;ve acknowleged a fault, but the replacement part wasn&#x27;t going to be available until January so they asked me to confirm whether a replacement unit would be ok, subject to availability.  I said fine.  I have had no communication in the two weeks since.  I have no idea if they got the confirmation, whether they have stock to give me, whether they&#x27;ve ordered it and it&#x27;s being delivered and I should expect it to arrive tomorrow, or whether they also can&#x27;t get the new unit to me any sooner than January.  And I can&#x27;t get anyone to tell me, because the set of people I can speak to is disjoint from the set of people with visibility into the system that actually matters.<p>I&#x27;m left with the sinking realisation that the only option I&#x27;ve got left is to pursue a refund, hope that doesn&#x27;t take an age to sort out, and start the whole process over again with either Dell or Lenovo.  Then deal with whatever mess I get left with if I <i>do</i> get a delivery.<p>Ironically I went with HP because I&#x27;d heard Dell was having delivery issues and I wanted to avoid that hassle.  More fool me.')
