What they do is fund a solar&#x2F;wind project which will generate the amount of electricity they use over the whole year. Of course in reality their power comes from the grid which was only 26% renewable last year. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opennem.org.au&#x2F;energy&#x2F;nem&#x2F;?range=1y&amp;interval=1w" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opennem.org.au&#x2F;energy&#x2F;nem&#x2F;?range=1y&amp;interval=1w</a><p>Its not a scalable solution! A lot of Australians already have solar panels on their roof which generate more electricity than they use in a 24hour period. But we cannot say we are 100% renewable because we also use power at night, where the electricity is still mostly from coal, especially when theres no wind.')
