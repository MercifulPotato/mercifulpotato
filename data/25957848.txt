Item(by='zinekeller', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611932335, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25957417, text='Yes, I agree that it actually exists in the open, and I should have clarified what I&#x27;ve said earlier.<p>It turns out that Nokia doesn&#x27;t have the whole IP for Symbian (unless in 2009 they painstakingly bought all the IP needed, which I haven&#x27;t seen any eveidence). Of course it would be silly to include for example Java and the <i>Snake</i> series of games on what I am talking about, but I mean the internal bits of the components of it. So I say that the code, while source-available, might not be released cleanly IP-wise (however it is clear that it is abandoned so they might be reluctant to enforce it or even unknowingly holds the copyright to some parts of it).')
