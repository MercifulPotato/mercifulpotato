It&#x27;s mostly useful for finishing a bottle the day after without compromising on taste. I&#x27;m not sure how it might keep if you&#x27;re hoping to save the wine for longer.<p>Argon might last for longer than one day, which is a plus! But I tend to finish the bottle within a day or two, so N2O works fine for me.')
