The user has no freedom because the user has no administrative access to alter the service software.<p>The software can do bad things that are harmful to the users, yet fully comply with the AGPL. The users have to accept that, or not use the service. The FSF wants it that  if the users are going to be abused by an online service, at least this should be done with entirely free software, and that&#x27;s where the AGPL comes in.<p>The AGPL (and copyright licensing in general) is completely the wrong tool for actually doing something to combating the social problem that people are becoming dependent on SaaS that is out of their control.')
