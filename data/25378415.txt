Time to leave?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;m a software engineer for context and will hit 2 years for this job in April.<p>Managed to get promoted at my workplace recently. This is also around the time that we&#x27;re doing the salary reviews.<p>So my performance review was great. Even got promoted. But the my actual increase was about 2% despite the perceived achievements. This is less than inflation in my country, so effectively working hard made me poorer in real terms?<p>The real reason why this happened, was that according to market data, I&#x27;m apparently paid higher than market rates for my country probably. Therefore, my increase is little to nothing because I&#x27;m hitting my &quot;ceiling&quot;.<p>In theory, existing low earners get a high increase so that everyone is within the same bands. I&#x27;m just the wrong place at the wrong time kinda guy.<p>So on the one hand, I love the place I&#x27;m working at and the experience has been great. People are great too.<p>On the other hand, I can&#x27;t help but feel undervalued by the actions of the company. Basically feel that no matter what I do going forward in this place, my compensation is decided by market data and not the value that I added to the company. Basically, I could&#x27;ve been intentionally average and probably still get a similar increase and this is what&#x27;s affecting me now.<p>From the company&#x27;s point of view, they&#x27;ve been acquired and only recently started becoming profitable. The pandemic didn&#x27;t really affect anything from a business perspective.<p>It&#x27;s either stay for a little bit or go job hunting. Other option is to start my own company. Easier said than done of course, but that&#x27;s an option at this point.<p>But yeah, any thoughts?')
