In my experience, most bugs have taken longer to reproduce repeatedly than to understand from code. Besides, there&#x27;s no guarantee that a bisect will land at the right commit if the bug is not reliably reproducible.<p>But I have been in situations where I had to manually bisect the code because I just couldn&#x27;t understand how the code could reproduce the problem, and having git bisect would have been a significant help.')
