The A100, and other GPU designs, probably will have higher FLOPs than any FPGA made on the 7nm node.<p>But not a &quot;lot&quot; more FLOPs, and the additional flexibility of an FPGA could really help in some problems. It really depends on what you&#x27;re trying to do.<p>------<p>At best, 7nm top-of-the-line GPU is ~2x more FLOPs than 7nm top-of-the-line FPGA under today&#x27;s environment. In reality, it all comes down to how the software was written (and FPGAs could absolutely win in the right situation)')
