Forbid adding new lines-of-business? And what&#x27;s the definition of line-of-business? Adding a small feature on a top web page could be one, right?<p>&gt; Each free from any conflict of interests, and potential for collusion.<p>Even harder. Conflicts arise all the time, big and small. Potential is harder to squish, especially when you want to preserve potential to improve.<p>&gt; Each large enough to run their own business successfully and efficiently, but small enough that they donâ€™t have the power to bribe Congress, bully smaller competitors, collude across different market segments, and rewrite the rules of the game.<p>Can &quot;small enough&quot; be too small to be &quot;large enough&quot;? What would be a divider?<p>&gt; Each operating independently, in a free and competitive market.<p>That&#x27;s the goal. What&#x27;s hard is to have rules to codify as laws.<p>Current situation when markets tend to slide into duopolies is clearly not good enough. Should we limit market share to, say, 25% starting with market of, say, 1000 average annual salaries? What - and why - can we put into law to somehow improve the situation?')
