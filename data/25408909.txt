It&#x27;s just that I have noticed an uptick in using this kind of phrasing when trying to dismiss other positions on things as a version of the &quot;thought terminating cliche&quot;. Not trying to say there are no delusion belief systems.<p>That said, the bar should be very high for calling other peoples beliefs as such. I disagree with lots of people on lots of things, but one of the things I&#x27;ve learned is that by approaching topics with such a judgemental, holier-than-though attitude, one puts on blinders to truly understanding a persons position, and more importantly, <i>how they got there</i>. The power of empathy is strong in giving the brain more information to work with, but the power of harsh judgement is that it stifles the flow of information prematurely.')
