Disks are so fast now that I would trade away 50% of the filesystem&#x27;s performance for correctness in 95% of the software I use. (Eg my code editor, git, compiler, etc). Except I bet in a good implementation the actual performance cost of transactions would be negligible anyway. Especially on top of something like ZFS.<p>And legacy software can just keep using the current unreliable APIs with all the performance that entails anyway.')
