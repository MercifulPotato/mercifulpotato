All your snippets are stored in a simple git repo by either GitHub or GitLab. While still offering a clean and intuitive interface to interact with your snippets. Paired with a  powerful and fast code search.<p>One of my main goals was to create a tool that does not lock you in. Snippets can be quite valuable and save a lot of time. You own your snippets as much as you own all your other code stored on GitHub. If you decide to leave Snucket (not that we would ever give you a reason to do so) you can use your snippets like Snucket was never there. Every snippet and its tags are stored as a folder containing a readme with the description and all the files that you created.<p>I&#x27;m very grateful for every piece feedback and criticism and open for new ideas.<p>Just keep in mind that Snucket is at a quite early stage.')
