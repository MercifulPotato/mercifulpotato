Having anything interactive (games&#x2F;immersive) would be really great.<p>Re: subscription, I agree that it&#x27;d be interesting to build something for free that everyone can use, and maybe try to sustain this with subscriptions for extra features (competitions, etc.)<p>Finally, maybe the trick to building this out rapidly is to start with a web version. You&#x27;d connect your C2 to your computer via bluetooth, and then you could stream your computer to the Apple TV. A native Apple TV app would be better though, but it&#x27;s more work. A web&#x2F;three.js prototype is faster to put together (for me, at least -- a Unity developer might want to do this natively)<p>Should I try to make a launch page and if I get 1000 emails, go off and do it hah? :-)<p>---<p>Actually, an iOS app that would run on iPads (the perfect-ish format for a C2 immersive monitor) is really interesting... Maybe iOS&#x2F;AppleTV is the way to go after all...')
