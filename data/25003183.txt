I&#x27;m sure the lawyers can come up with an agreement that in day to day operations is the same as the management team being employees but that doesn&#x27;t trigger the extra tax because the decision makers aren&#x27;t really employees.  You just bifurcate  the company into two separate companies, the highly paid people and everyone else.')
