If I happenstance get covid, recover with no damage, develop immunity, and can&#x27;t pass it onto others - I&#x27;d feel fine.<p>One of the big reasons is that I do a lot of social dancing. Washing your hands and what not isn&#x27;t sufficient there. You&#x27;re getting full body contact with a lot of heavy breathing. Sadly - I think social dancing will be dead for the next few years because this. Might be fine - it&#x27;ll probably get a lot of the weirdos out of the scene.')
