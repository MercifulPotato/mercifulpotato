They aren&#x27;t even particularly interested in Bitcoin. It just happened to be the thing that worked best for their situation.<p>I live in a Canadian neighboorhood with lots of immigrants from poorer countries. There&#x27;s a Bitcoin ATM near me that seems to get a decent amount of usage, mostly by people who look like they might have family in other countries. It might get even more usage, if not for the fact that buying Bitcoin in Canada is pretty easy via exchanges like Kraken and Bull Bitcoin.')
