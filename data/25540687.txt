But maybe the perp shot off some guns just to get the cops to show up?<p>Reports of gunshots weren&#x27;t fake because multiple witnesses heard gunshots. No idea if it was related to the bombing or not.<p>Example:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;25&#x2F;us&#x2F;nashville-explosion&#x2F;index.html?fbclid=IwAR2eobyKNLHiZ1eLupyVr7U-3qmwgXkgG2cjbXehvzpozfETlLTR28EZ7RY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;25&#x2F;us&#x2F;nashville-explosion&#x2F;index....</a><p>&gt;McCoy said he was originally woken up by what he believed were gunshots prior to the explosion. He got up and looked out the window, he said, but went back to bed when he didn&#x27;t see anything. Asked if the noise he heard could have been something other than gunfire, McCoy emphasized that he believed it was, saying he owns a gun and goes shooting, so he&#x27;s familiar with the sound of gunshots.')
