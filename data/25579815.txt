Item(by='kenhwang', descendants=None, kids=[25579965], score=None, time=1609317472, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25579731, text='Pfizer has the highest efficacy endpoint (95% at preventing symptomatic infection, which would theoretically also prevent spread and symptoms at higher percentages) with equal efficacy across age groups.<p>Moderna is 95% at preventing symptoms (100% for serious symptoms in their trial but insufficient sample size). They also reported slightly lower efficacy for the elderly.<p>AstraZeneca is 62% for preventing symptoms (unknown for infection and spread).<p>So it&#x27;s not quite a trade-off of spread prevention vs symptom prevention, because Pfizer claims to do both significantly better.<p>edit: reading the data in more detail, all 3 don&#x27;t have sufficiently significant data to claim anything other than symptoms. So preventing spread is just PR-hype.')
