I don&#x27;t see why you&#x27;d consider ECDSA to be any more robust than RSA if we&#x27;re talking about certificates keys for TLS.<p>EdDSA is better, but is in general not yet supported in the WebPKI (browsers, BRs). I did manage to successfully use it for an internal mTLS setup though, so I think it&#x27;s only going to be a matter of time.')
