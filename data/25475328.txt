Because it means that if they cause a rich person (paying 30%) to make a dollar, Congress gets $.30. But if they cause a poor person (paying 10%) to make a dollar, Congress gets $.10. Worse, if they adopt any policy that would <i>transfer</i> a dollar from a rich person to a poor person (e.g. promoting small businesses that would compete with larger ones), they would <i>lose</i> $.20. And Congress wants to have more money to spend, so this perversely impacts their policies.<p>What you want is for lower income people to be paying lower <i>effective</i> rates but not lower <i>marginal</i> rates. Which you can achieve by giving everyone a large fixed credit to start with and then using a uniform marginal rate for everyone.')
