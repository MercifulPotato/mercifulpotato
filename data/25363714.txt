Plus, then you can spend that money above ground increasing your living area. Unfortunately, most people don&#x27;t factor in the extra expense of cooling more above ground space, whereas a basement would hold the temperature better. I&#x27;d reckon after a decade or so, the energy savings of putting some extra square footage in a basement would event out.')
