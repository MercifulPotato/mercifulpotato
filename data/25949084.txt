Broker&#x27;s are incentivized to have the short squeeze stop.<p>Someone please correct me if I am (or how I am) wrong with the following:<p>Bob is a broker.<p>Jack comes along buys 100 shares of X.<p>Bob lends those 100 shares of X to Amy to sell short.<p>Amy sells it short. Price shoots up.. Amy says â€œoh crap.. Sorry bill. Simply cannot buy back those shares. I am bankrupt. I physically do not have the money to do so.<p>Jack will still expect Bob the broker to make sure his 100 shares of X are there one way or the other.<p>Bob the broker has to buy back those shares it lent out to Amy so that Jack the account holder is still able to sell&#x2F;trade their shares.')
