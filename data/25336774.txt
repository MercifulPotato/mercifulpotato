Rufus, for example, lets you specify the mode.<p>Alternatively, if you can&#x27;t install it in UEFI mode, you can switch to legacy BIOS&#x2F;CSM mode in your machine&#x27;s BIOS (or vice versa).<p>It gets worse - some Win10 ISOs themselves are made for either UEFI (most common) or legacy BIOS, and they can&#x27;t be set up the other way.<p>You can clone or run Win10 legacy BIOS&#x2F;CSM installations on other machines&#x2F;drives (useful if you plan on swapping&#x2F;upgrading), while UEFI will only run on the specific motherboard&#x2F;CPU you installed it on.<p>I&#x27;ve also noticed Win10 in UEFI mode can BSOD with no chance of recovery when undervolting too much and causing it to freeze&#x2F;BSOD. Something must be getting corrupted, and it won&#x27;t run again, ever. Legacy mode works fine.')
