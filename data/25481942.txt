It just behaved differently enough that some additional pilot training would have been needed without MCAS.<p>Quoting Boeing with my own emphasis:<p>&gt; MCAS, or Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, is a flight control law implemented on the newer models of the 737 <i>to provide consistent airplane handling characteristics</i> at elevated Angles of Attack in certain unusual flight conditions only.<p>Which, to be clear, means it&#x27;s intended to stabilize the plane (&quot;consistent&quot;) in circumstances where the physical design of the plane would render the plane unstable (inconsistent) in certain operating environments.<p>&gt; The EA made a different mistake - turning off the trim when it was too far from neutral.<p>Do you have a specific citation for this? I&#x27;m digging through the ECAA report and am not able to find this specific mention. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200310004955&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aib.gov.et&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;documents&#x2F;accident&#x2F;ET-302%20%20Interim%20Investigation%20%20Report%20March%209%202020.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200310004955&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aib.go...</a> (original site is timing out)<p>---<p>It seems you&#x27;re generally suggesting that the instructions provided by Boeing were sufficient for the plane to remain airworthy without further mitigation; this was contradicted by the ECAA and others. Is this what you&#x27;re suggesting?')
