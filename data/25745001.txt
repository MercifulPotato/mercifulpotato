Or the exits? Or even externalized value creation?<p>Edit: I will give an interesting answer to my own equation and that is Element AI. A ridiculous concept from a startup perspective, but very rational regional investment argument: round up the AI talent and give them something to do. In the end, they couldn&#x27;t make money - but - they didn&#x27;t lose money and they may have secured at least a foundational location for AI researchers to be employed in montreal, which is not nothing. It remains to be seen if it can be expanded, and if all those AI researchers will just end up moving to the US for more money.<p>It&#x27;s a little bit like the &#x27;Boston Dynamics&#x27; of Montreal - clearly something going on, but difficult to commercialize so it needs a massive company to see the strategic benefit.
