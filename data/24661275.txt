Item(by='8589934591', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601636166, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24659834, text='&gt; The Dalits are a formidable political force now and a lot of caste based discrimination is done by non-Brahmins who fear the reduction of their share of the pie. I&#x27;ve seen brahmins being on receiving end of the caste based discrimination, countless no. of times.<p>This is a point I feel many people miss out. The non brahmin upper castes are never pointed out in the discussions related to caste discrimination. Somehow it&#x27;s always the brahmins vs lower caste. As if there are no &quot;upper&quot; castes apart from brahmins.<p>For example, in Tamil Nadu, there are a lot of non Brahmin upper castes namely nadar, vanniyar, mudaliyar, thevar, gounder, kallar, vellalar, naikkar, chettiar, reddy and many more.<p>These non brahmin upper castes spew the misinformation that brahmins are the reason for caste discrimination when they themselves practice it. They would advocate that their (non brahmin) community should marry a brahmin girl to show superiority since male &gt; female. But the same community would oppose, even use violence to prevent marriages between themselves and a &quot;lower&quot; caste, esp if the girl is from the &quot;higher&quot; and the boy is from a &quot;lower&quot; caste. These are the same hypocritical retards who keep saying brahmins are the only ones who show caste discrimination.<p>People should start noticing and acknowledging this aspect of discrimination too esp since they are the majority of the population who drive the narrative.')
