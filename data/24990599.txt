The point with that is so you don&#x27;t have an issuing authority (like a sherriff) denying people a permit on a discriminatory basis when they otherwise met the requirements (commonly a racial issue in the past, such as when MLK was denied a permit). May-issue states like NJ, NY, MD, etc can deny a permit for people who meet the legal requirements on some other reason. Generally the wealthy and well connected are more likely to get a permit.<p>I don&#x27;t know if there are any specific outreach programs. I know they have youth programs and recently started some geared towards women. Generally these distinctions in training are made if there&#x27;s enough demand to form a new training program and also if the topics would be sufficiently different. For example, the youth training would be about basic safety and marksman ship. Women can join the same classes as men, but the women&#x27;s course covers different defensive tactics based on general size and strength differences as well as topics like carrying in a purse. The NRA sets the curriculum, but the actual training is provided by a certified instructor. These instructors and the businesses they are affiliated perform their own outreach. Here&#x27;s an example of outreach after the Pulse attack - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orlandosentinel.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;os-group-offering-free-classes-to-train-gays-on-guns-20161019-story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.orlandosentinel.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;os-group-offering-f...</a>.<p>My experience at events has generally been that everyone is welcome. There can be an odd person or two who have personal beliefs which are biased, but the groups as a whole are welcoming. I don&#x27;t like to make assumptions about people, and I also don&#x27;t go around asking everyone their business - so I have no way of knowing if the people I&#x27;ve met are hetero, LGBTQ, or any other personal traits. What I can say, is that I&#x27;ve met people whom others might have stereotyped as being LGBTQ (whether they were or not) and were not treated any differently. This has been my observation when it comes to other personal traits as well. The only trait that I know of that will land some incendiary comments might be political opinions supporting candidates which are gun control supporters.<p>Edit: The negative side of the NRA from an LGBTQ perspective would be their support of pro-gun candidates may incidentally be supporting a candidate who&#x27;s other policies may negatively impact the LGBTQ community.')
