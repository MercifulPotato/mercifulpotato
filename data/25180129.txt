Hardware configurations are almost all unique between ARM SoCs, and each of those configurations need their own Linux port.<p>Here&#x27;s an idea of just some of the work that is required to port Linux to each individual ARM SoC[1].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elinux.org&#x2F;images&#x2F;a&#x2F;ad&#x2F;Arm-soc-checklist.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elinux.org&#x2F;images&#x2F;a&#x2F;ad&#x2F;Arm-soc-checklist.pdf</a>')
