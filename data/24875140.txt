I used to work for a major social media network that was growing and eventually stalled.<p>If you run a social network and it gets popular you&#x27;re going to run into major problems that no one talks about.<p>1.) Multiple governments, private organization and luddites send people to your company to compromise the source code.<p>2.) People eventually find out they can use the social network as a covert advertising platform.  They end up trying to make side money using the platform to slip ad campaigns as normal human interactions.<p>3.) Eventually someone figures out they can control the behavior of people on the social media platform in strange ways.  One guy figured out he could create sock puppet accounts and automate the process of bringing women he liked everywhere he went. Don&#x27;t do this!!! If you start slipping covert advertising in the platform and you get caught you&#x27;re eventually going to run into organized crime, the govt or both.<p>4.) And my favorite, people start offering your best employees obscsene amounts of money to try and stop you from starting another social network.')
