Having lived in many countries I would rather live in a country where Uber and Lift can add something to ballot rather than where they secretly bribe Governor or Legislators.<p>Both Uber and Lyft are California companies with billions of dollars in investment and thousands of employees, if they are facing an existential crisis I would at least give them a fair chance. California&#x27;s hare brained policy to push some virtue signaling measure down the throats of Uber and Lyft is not good for gig economy, riders and innovations. Self driving cars would put all this theater to rest for good hopefully.')
