Including images in these public documents is always problematic. I can use some basic Image hosting services (imgBB, Imgur, etc), but there are 3 problems:<p>1. I can&#x27;t be sure my image will be deleted without me knowing (so I need to keep backups in versioned repos or google drive)\n2. I don&#x27;t have a visibility of the status of those images: if the service is ever down, if they have downgraded the quality, etc.\n3. The interface isn&#x27;t great. I&#x27;d like something more markdown-friendly. Ideally with &quot;paste from clipboard&quot; capabilities.<p>Is there any service that can handle these use cases? Am I alone in this or you folks also face the same issues?<p>Ideally, I&#x27;d love to hook up my S3 account (or generate some keys for the service) and they could keep an automatic backup for me.<p>Thanks!')
