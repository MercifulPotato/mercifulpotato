The Electron desktop app is a slow, buggy, resource sucking mess. A video call with one person reduces my laptop battery from 8 hours to 2, fans going at full tilt the entire time. It uses its own notification system that doesn&#x27;t (or at least didn&#x27;t) respect the system notification settings. Lots of small things you innately expect to work, like being able to right click a message to edit it, simply do nothing.<p>Of course, take this with a grain of salt, because I&#x27;m generally of the opinion that the DOM is a mediocre target for applications, and that we all put up with it because it&#x27;s attached to the world&#x27;s greatest distribution mechanism. So to me, the fact that we&#x27;d want to bring all that awkwardness to the desktop and divorce it of its killer feature seems <i>insane</i>.')
