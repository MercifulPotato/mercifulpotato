Because Homebrew was developed 11 years ago on generally available hardware by people who already had such hardware, Apple... owed them free hardware? For what purpose? Just to say thank you?<p>Homebrew isn&#x27;t a cross-platform thing. It&#x27;s written by MacOS users for MacOS users. (Although I guess it now also supports Linux.) The project didn&#x27;t need anything from Apple as long as Apple was using generally-available hardware.<p>Once Apple announced new hardware, they donated hardware to avoid the brew devs needing to buy new hardware. I&#x27;m not sure why anyone would expect anything before then.')
