Why Jest?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;ve been running some performance comparison of different JavaScript test runners [1]. Jest comes out woefully behind everything else. To me personally that&#x27;s a show stopper. However, Jest is popular and so I am clearly missing something. Looking through Github issues, it&#x27;s also clear that addressing performance is not a priority. What is the priority? Who is Jest appealing to?<p>I&#x27;d really love to hear from people who, given a green light on tech choices, would pick Jest over, say, mocha or tape for their next project. Thank you!<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;artemave&#x2F;node-test-runners-benchmark')
