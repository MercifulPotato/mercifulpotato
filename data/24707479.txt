This interference can significantly degrade cellular and 2.4GHz WIFI performance. Customers using cellular networks or 2.4GHz WIFI networks near USB 3.0 devices should take measures to reduce the impact of these devices on their network connectivity. Please note that interference is generated by both the actual USB 3.0 device as well as its cable.&quot;')
