Item(by='the8472', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602812716, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24796386, text='&gt; The collective set of communication platforms that people use are, in concert, important, but it&#x27;d still be a stretch to say even that combination was &quot;essential&quot;<p>Yes, I am concerned about the collective of privatized communication mediums. More and more private, personal communication runs over these platforms. Facebook is not just your timeline, it also is whatsapp. Twitter has DMs too. Those get filtered too. This is unlike telephone or face-to-face communication.<p>Their continued existence is not essential to life, I agree. But they shape communication which is essential to society as a whole. If we can&#x27;t do anything about the network effect then having a disinterested network should be preferable.<p>&gt; This proposal would make it nearly impossible to simultaneously have user-posted content and moderation.<p>I already mentioned this in another post, but let the userbase collectively handle the moderation of what would now be considered &quot;community guidelines&quot;, let the platform provider handle moderation of illegal content. This may require much better tooling and different ways content is amplified (or not) than social media platforms currently offer but it doesn&#x27;t seem as impossible as you say.')
