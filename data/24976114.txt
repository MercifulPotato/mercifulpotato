I&#x27;m keeping an eye on the pinephone, but I have a vital edge case for my pixel (NFC blood sugar monitoring) that I really can&#x27;t give up. If xdrip becomes fully supported on pinephones, I&#x27;ll jump ship on android that exact day.<p>In general I&#x27;d say not to be too pessimistic about consumer awareness. I know non-technical people who are using brave browser, do not want smart home listening devices in their houses, avoid buying from amazon, etc. A few years ago I wouldn&#x27;t have expected that from them, so it feels like it&#x27;s getting better (anecdotally).')
