I got curious and found this comment on youtube, sharing in case it may help or diagnose:<p><i>Battle Angel  Sorry, not sure why I didn&#x27;t share previously. So, I believe this is caused by using a non-HDMI cable with the audio out turned on. Either turn the audio in the display off completely in the settings, or use a new HDMI cable. The alarm is a result of the display trying to send an audio signal through a Displayport cable. Are those of you getting this alarm using Displayport cables? They do not pair audio with video, as HDMI does. I hope this fixes your problem.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1i2dB8mGuKM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1i2dB8mGuKM</a>')
