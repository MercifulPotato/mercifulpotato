Later, he backhandedly criticizes his father (while, again, complimenting himself) by saying that that he wouldn&#x27;t take a flight to see his own grandkids but would to watch his son teach.<p>I&#x27;ll give the author this: after reading this article, I am quite confident that he &quot;believes to be true&quot; that he is a great guy.')
