I&#x27;m not a &quot;gotta have it now&quot; person very often. I generally don&#x27;t like the general public either, if I hang out with people it&#x27;s someone I care about or have somehting in common with (meetups and such). I can generally wait a day or two, and will plan meals around amazon deliveries a couple of day in advance. I don&#x27;t have a lot of fridge storage space so I&#x27;ll order Amazon Fresh every couple of days for food. I get most of my household items the same way. I generally plan ahead well enough and &quot;buy in bulk&quot; so that emergency runs happen very seldomly. I love the freedom of ordering online, also it&#x27;s a lot more efficient and environmentally friendly than driving to a brick and mortar store.')
