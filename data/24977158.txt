Item(by='compsciphd', descendants=None, kids=[24977285], score=None, time=1604386931, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24975910, text='just for the record, while I mostly agree with the analysis on that page, I believe the author tries to make a stronger case than it really is.<p>1) DKIM verifies the To: header, not the &quot;rcpt to&quot; receipient.  The To: header has no value in determining who actually received the email.  (Ex: you receive the email via BCC, you can&#x27;t verify that the recipients listed in the To: actually got the email).<p>2) GMail actually does let users &quot;spoof&quot; the From: line.  it needs cooperation from the &quot;owner&quot; of the address you want to use in the From line, but it is possible, and once set once, is never reconfirmed.<p>so, as I said, while I generally agree with the analysis, but I think 2 statements it makes are a bit too strong<p>1) &quot;it was sent from this specific account, v.pozharskyi.ukraine@gmail.com&quot; - It could have been sent via a different account that got the specific account&#x27;s permission (either via a hack of sorts or cooperation) to spoof it.  I&#x27;d agree that this isn&#x27;t that likely.<p>2) &quot;the intended recipient was to the account hbiden@rosemontseneca.com&quot; - all we can know is that this was the To: line, it is very easy to spoof this.  (every email one gets via BCC is essentially spoofing this).<p>do I think either points are very likely?  Not so much, but any page trying to prove the authenticity needs to address the limits of the analysis, which the author didn&#x27;t do.<p>Of course there are other assumptions we make, notably that no one was able to steal or crack Google&#x27;s old DKIM key.  I wonder how many google employees would have had access to this DKIM key over time (and if security procedures might have been relaxed once it was &quot;expired&quot; and the public portion no longer distributed).')
