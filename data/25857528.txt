Item(by='ggrrhh_ta', descendants=None, kids=[25858462, 25858409, 25857999, 25858473, 25857592], score=None, time=1611225724, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25857048, text='&quot;Blaming the clinics doesn&#x27;t work&quot; - I trying to wrap my head around to put myself in your frame of mind to shift the blame from who is to blame to the government. If those clinics recommend and perform unnecessary procedures on people that can afford them (and do not benefit from govt. aid), does &quot;blaming the clinics not work&quot;, because the actual problem is people being able to afford it? or would you go one step ahead and then say that the government is still to blame for allowing the possibility of wealth accumulation by individuals that results in unnecessary spending? or is the government still to blame because of not further regulating and auditing dental clinics? or is the government to blame because of allowing the mere existence of private dental clinics?<p>I guess that the government did not &quot;set things up so that the rise of clinics to exploit the rules was legal and inevitable&quot;. I am going to guess that individuals, knowing that that was not the intention of the government aid, decided they could get around it to profit.<p>edit: typos')
