So, please, don&#x27;t down-vote me because I&#x27;m going to mention Bible here.\nBut I find it interesting that the Individual Ancestors Point is not that far off from the Biblical estimate of the Earth&#x27;s age of about 6,000 to 15,000 years.\nSo forget about &quot;planting&quot; the planet with &quot;fake&quot; fossils, Adam and Eve are right on the same timeline as the IAP.\nWhich really isn&#x27;t that surprising because that basically indicates the age of a modern human being, capable of passing down stories through an invention of a language, and eventually writing them down.\nSo, at least in this case, the Bible got the math down fairly well, and I&#x27;m bringing it up purely as a historical document here.')
