Prohibiting your existing best available source of employment will, as a rule, leave you with an alternative which is even less good. Something with more pay but a longer commute that eats that pay and then some. Something more dangerous, or less convenient, or less stable, or more stressful. And then you get paid a little more in exchange for losing something that was worth more to you than the money.<p>&gt; Alternatively, we could offer public healthcare, social housing, and food guarantees, decoupling work from survival.<p>Or a UBI. Which is what we should do.')
