Fundamentally an ethical system is not that different from a mathematical one: there are some assumptions, some deductive rules, and a potentially infinite set of conclusions that result from applying those deductive rules to those assumptions. One particularly important property to verify about such a system is consistency: if it can prove conclusion &quot;X&quot;, it should not also be able to prove conclusion &quot;not X&quot;. An inconsistent system can prove anything, so is essentially useless for reasoning.')
