When I bought in Mill Valley in 2001, I was literally paying 13X more taxes than my neighbor, a masseuse who inherited the property and kept the same tax rate her parents paid in the 70s. And as a very liberal town, every new tax initiative always passed, which again hit us harder.<p>If at least Prop 13 benefits could not be passed as inheritance, that would go a long way to balance things.<p>I&#x27;m happy I moved to WA now where my property taxes do get reassessed every year, but it balances out with no state income taxes.')
