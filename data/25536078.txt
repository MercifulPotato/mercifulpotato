I&#x27;ve moved to svn for a few projects that required large binaries to be shared and version controlled along with their source (for hardware design projects) and hit the 100Mbyte (IIRC) file limit. Im sure it could be fixed, but it is a limitation that has prevented me from using git in some cases')
