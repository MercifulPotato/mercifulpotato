The data stored in Config.ly are key:value pairs and can be a JSON string&#x2F;array, String, Number or Boolean. So you can create as many keys as you&#x27;d like.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if that answers your question. It may be referring to slightly different functionality... We don&#x27;t yet have functionality to say &quot;for this key, deploy value x to clients a,b,c and value y to clients d, e, f&quot; but it&#x27;s on the roadmap. Do you think that&#x27;d be important?')
