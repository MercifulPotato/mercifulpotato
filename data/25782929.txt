Especially if there is something to be gained from it.<p>However, I&#x27;m not referring to the wealth of the countries themselves, but the concentration of wealth within them. Both Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan were desperately poor with a starving citizenry. Germany from paying reparations completely devaluing their currency and Japan from a lack of natural resources. The empires of the 18th and 19th century would be third world states by our standards. Life was cheap and people dying en masse wasn&#x27;t a big deal.<p>Modern USA hardly even engages in full scale warfare since Vietnam. Now we have a few limited engagements against small countries without any real backers. Even then the tiny US losses from those wars has killed our taste for them. Even Donald Trump is disengaging from them.<p>It&#x27;s hard to send a bunch of people to die when they are the ones holding the wealth of your nation. It&#x27;s much easier to send the poor huddled masses if they exist.')
