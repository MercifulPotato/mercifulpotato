Whether it&#x27;s through abusing a flaw in the router&#x27;s WPS functionality or plain old brute force, it&#x27;s not impossible for an attacker to get into your network.<p>From there a simple flood of ARP packets will allow the attacker to take over your network traffic and listen in on any unencrypted traffic, using the router admin password as an escalation within the network infrastructure.<p>Of course, such an attack is unrealistic in a home network scenario. It doesn&#x27;t matter, because most consumer routers probably contain some unauthenticated RCE or authentication bypass anyway. Consumer routers aren&#x27;t the most secure products and nearly every time a security researcher starts digging into their firmware, something spectacular comes out of it.')
