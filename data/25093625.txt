However people don’t seem to be doing that, and those who do often do that for academic purposes rather than to have their own personalized daily driver.<p>Even more so often the wishes of many people when it comes to customization doesn’t even require a rooted phone and a customized AOSP ROM, if you look at what people customize on their desktop which is often limited to their desktop environment and their workflow can be done on stock Android using alternative launchers and other apps.<p>Wanting for an Android competitor for the sake of having competition is fine, but it won’t look much different or it won’t be much of a competitor.')
