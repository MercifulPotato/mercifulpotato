Canonical examples are things like an employee ID card, where the ID card can produce a proof that they&#x27;re an employee, have clearance level X or are part of group Y <i>without the proof containing any information beyond that</i>. Another example would be things like national ID cards, where you could make a check for &quot;is older than 18 years&quot; and the system only receives a cryptographically-verifiable answer to that question, without being able to infer anything else.')
