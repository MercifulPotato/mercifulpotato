In another light it&#x27;s just saying &quot;E pluribus unum.&quot;<p>Before it became uncouth to express a spirit of national unity or civic pride, the melting pot was a way of expressing that who we are is defined by our coming together to participate in the great project we call our nation.  And as part of that, we&#x27;re sharing in the uniqueness each of us bring and hard boundaries start &quot;melting&quot; together as we form a shared history and culture.  A very chunky concoction constantly getting new pieces added, not a smooth uniform mixture left to simmer.<p>We now live in an age where &quot;identity&quot; often means participating in a stereotype that&#x27;s actively gatekept.
