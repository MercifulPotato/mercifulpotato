The classics: Clockwork Orange; Farenheit 451; Brave New World; 1984.<p>Now there&#x27;s a new trend in this genre, where a supposedly possible future time is described in order to glorify the present, and defend it against all possible change, good or bad, because &quot;it could become worst&quot;. Handmaid&#x27;s Tale is a good example. It makes catholic religion look so good it&#x27;s sad. The total absence of criticism towards a religion tied with the institutional rape of thousands of children[0], and hatred of women, for instance, is absurd. And the fact is the raping is still going on as you read this. Of course this is only a single point of failure and absurdity amongst many others.\nWhilst Huxley, Orwell and others were driven by passion and rebellion against injustice and misery and desire to change life, low quality scripts like the one on this TV series are clearly motivated by making money while surfing&#x2F;exploiting current social media cultural &quot;trends&quot;. Disgusting.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-44209971" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-44209971</a>')
