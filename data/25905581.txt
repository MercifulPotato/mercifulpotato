An attacker could insert manufactured ballots to be tabulated after this process and there would be no way to know if they are legitimate or not - they’re anonymous now too so you can’t check with the voter and the voter can’t verify their vote.<p>You can recount the ballots all you want if this attack occurred, because the fake and real ballots would be indistinguishable and unauditable.')
