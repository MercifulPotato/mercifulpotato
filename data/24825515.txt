Item(by='pilif', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603108716, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24824885, text='&gt; it&#x27;s just an obscure way to hack yourself.<p>that&#x27;s only true for applications that strictly only ever work on and display content that the user has created themselves.<p>This is an increasingly rare type of application in the age of the internet and social media to the point where I would argue that most applications these days interact with data created by other users (think opening an image file, displaying a chat message, displaying an email, etc).<p>With Electron you&#x27;re setting yourself up in a way where a single case of a forgotten input escaping automatically means a remote code execution attack.<p>On websites, XSS certainly are a bad thing, but they are still somewhat limited in scope and generic mitigations exists in many browsers.<p>In Electron apps, an XSS means an RCE unless you make use of features like `conextIsolation`.<p>Reading your comment makes it obvious to me that this isn&#x27;t already a well-known issue. People generally aren&#x27;t aware or believe their type of application to be immune and thus it would, and that&#x27;s the point of my initial comment, make sense to either default to secure or at least default to asking the user to specifically make the decision to be insecure.<p>Defaulting to turning every XSS attack into an RCE seems to me like a very bad decision.')
