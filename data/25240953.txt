When the first lockdown started here in the UK, it was anarchy in the retail world. I needed a few bits after the first month: household MCBs (fuses) after some power issues and a new mechanism for our toilet. All 4 of the national DIY retailers were unable to handle online orders. Some simply removed the Pay button. No note explaining they were closed, you could browser and make a basket, register, put in card details. You just couldn&#x27;t find the Buy button.<p>They continued to sell &quot;essentials&quot; like wallpaper and flowering plants once they opened. But they wouldn&#x27;t sell other items like the ones I needed. If it wasn&#x27;t for amazon, I&#x27;d have literally been sitting in the dark, filling the cistern with a bucket.<p>That&#x27;s amazon&#x27;s killer app: basic competence and taking some vague interest in customers needs rather than profit margin and half arsing everything and being allergic to basic tech and customer experience.')
