It really is no less worse or better than any random CLI program.<p>But yeah, I fear people have issues with Git because unfortunately they reflect upon their experiences with other SCMs (like Clearcase, SVN, RCS&#x2F;CVS, whatever) and think the same terminology and concepts apply in Git and then it goes wrong.<p>Git is not really rocket science to use. People who find Git difficult or nonsensical should spend 4+4 hours of their weekend playing with Git while reading Pro Git. It&#x27;s available for free at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-scm.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;en&#x2F;v2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-scm.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;en&#x2F;v2</a>.<p>Specifically, read chapters 2, 3, 5, and parts of 7.<p>You should intentionally skip chapter 10, more than likely you don&#x27;t need it.<p>Keep Pro Git handy and come back when you&#x27;ve a specific need.')
