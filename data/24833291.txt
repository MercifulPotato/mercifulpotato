Item(by='hombre_fatal', descendants=None, kids=[24834164], score=None, time=1603159382, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24830353, text='&gt; I really do want people to be able to communicate directly with one-another, without multi-billion dollar companies.<p>It&#x27;s just really hard to imagine what this could look like in practice while remaining a compelling experience.<p>Downsides aside that we both agree with, it&#x27;s just hard to compete with centralization. You register @ve55 on Discord and you click &quot;Join&quot; on any server and anyone can find you and it&#x27;s not confusing.<p>Meanwhile, literally every discussion of a federated system like Mastodon on HN is full of confusion, even among us the tech savvy crowd.<p>Example, just yesterday this was posted to HN: &quot;You may be using Mastodon wrong&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24819387" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24819387</a> and the comments are full of confusion. And it&#x27;s just a Twitter clone, the simplest social app possible, that isn&#x27;t even trying to solve real-time chat and voice.<p>And the traditional siloed bulletin board model (vBulletin, phpbb) had massive downsides too like fragmentation and having to &quot;host it&quot; just to start a community (not something everyone can do), which is why they struggled to compete with, say, Reddit.<p>It&#x27;s hard to pin what a Discord would look that maximized the ideals that took us away from a centralized corporation controlling it. Seems we&#x27;re still in the very early stage of experimentation, or maybe centralization will always have this sort of advantage that lets it dominate social spaces?')
