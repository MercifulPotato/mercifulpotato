And not just SF; my grandparents immigrated to New York with nothing, worked hard to establish themselves, and eventually moved out to raise a family. They had a &quot;transactional&quot; relationship with the city, but I like to think that New York was also enriched by their presence. And I think when we look back at all the people who have come through San Francisco on their journey to a better life, we&#x27;ll realize that the city has been serving a very important function.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that San Francisco doesn&#x27;t have problems - it most certainly does. But I think that this &quot;us vs. them&quot; mentality is counter productive when it comes to actually solving the city&#x27;s problems.')
