Earth&#x27;s magnetic field is not protecting in the Moon. It&#x27;s unclear how much rad-hard they need if they don&#x27;t use it for anything safety critical. Rad-hard 90nm SoC for 4G&#x2F;LTE should be relatively  straightforward. Or maybe they use redundancy  and use already available  few generation old chipsets.<p>Changes for thermal management and testing eats  most of the budget.')
