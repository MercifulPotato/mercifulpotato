You could almost argue this stuff does not really matter because people are effectively forced to use it, as is.1  There is no alternative choice.<p>1. If you manage to &quot;beat the system&quot;, and bend the web to your will, those invested in it will label you an outlier or accuse you of being like Richard Stallman.<p>The Suicide Linux idea, and in fact, all &quot;rm -rf &#x2F;&quot; jokes, are still perplexing to me because I always made systems where one could accidentally rm -rf &#x2F; (still have not done personally that after 20+ years) and would not lose anything of importance, because &#x2F; is an overlay and any long-term user data is stored on external media, separate from executables, which I unmount after a periodic save completes.  I guess I could describe it as a minimal system booted from USB and running in RAM, overlayed with a more complete system (downloaded from the network then extracted), also running in RAM, with a workspace consisting of 100% RAM.  The only way to destroy the system is to mount the USB stick read-write, chattr -i on everything and then try to rm -rf &#x2F;.  Impossible to do that by mistake.')
