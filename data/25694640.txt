Government action isn’t required unless you’re talking about the 1A.<p>And this is yet another escalation on the road that started with “we’re just going to censor tweets that literally say the sky is green.” Google has banned an entire social network.<p>It’s exactly what social conservatives did back when they controlled the levers of government and industry in the mid-20th century.
