To adopt do something similar on macOS, I&#x27;d just:<p>&gt; % echo &#x27;notes () { acme-open ~&#x2F;iCloud\\ Drive&#x2F;notes&#x2F;$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md }&#x27; &gt;&gt; ~&#x2F;.zshrc<p>This would give me a function to create a new, dated notes doc and open with my editor anywhere from the terminal. And then I&#x27;d just use standard tools for searching, instead of using a script.<p>(FYI: acme-open is my wrapper to acme, and I keep a link to the actual iCloud Drive directory in my home folder.)')
