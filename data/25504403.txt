You don&#x27;t compare the situation described, but something different.<p>Second, most developers don&#x27;t run an independent ISV with their spouse ... If you did this in the US you&#x27;d have to further compare: $200k in .eu with healthcare with, say, $500k plus double that in business income, or $1.5m per year.<p>I think healthcare is going to be FAR better for you in the US. This won&#x27;t be true for everyone, maybe won&#x27;t even be true for most, but for you there can be little doubt.')
