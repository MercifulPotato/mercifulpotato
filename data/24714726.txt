Are we talking about end-users, or advertisers?<p>As far as end-users are concerned, there absolutely are alternatives: Bing and DuckDuckGo.<p>It doesn’t really matter that they have low market share, there isn’t really a structural switching cost.

That just makes it the best out of a few options, and the market share largely reflects that.<p>Ben Thompson addresses that point in his article, too:<p>&gt; <i>Indeed, what makes Google’s contention that “The competition is only a click away” so infuriating is the fact it is true.</i><p>Google is arguably an anti-competitive monopsony, not a monopoly.
