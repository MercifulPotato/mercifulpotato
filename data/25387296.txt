Otherwise it&#x27;s Slack for people who don&#x27;t want to feel like they&#x27;re at work, in line with the spirit of the last few generations of gacha games (boost this server by paying, get more emojis for yourself by paying, etc)<p>I agree that the text is the major activity going on at any given moment because text remains a good asynchronous repository, but if they hadn&#x27;t basically integrated mumble&#x2F;teamspeak to slack I&#x27;m not sure the glitter would have been enough to stick, because gamers (and some groups of discussions) definitely do rely on those voice lobbies when actually being present.')
