If you don&#x27;t forget qwerty, it&#x27;s not an annoyance to use someone else&#x27;s keyboard.  And having someone else be annoyed when they use my keyboard is a feature =).<p>The only time it was mildly annoying was when I started dating someone and asked to use her laptop, and I suddenly found I couldn&#x27;t type.  It turned out that she had ALSO learned dvorak in college.  When I realized what was going on it was all good.')
