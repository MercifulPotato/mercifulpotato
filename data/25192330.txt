I still want to see a penny every time my data is used&#x2F;accessed&#x2F;sold&#x2F;etc, if anything to drive up the cost of contracts around or servicing of my data. If my data is made functionally anonymous then make it a dime payment and then a penny every time that block of data is used sold. Send it as a check to my mailing address with a letter including the legal entities involved, initial source of the data, what type or category of data they have relating to me (like PII category ex address, name, purchase history, etc), their intended use for the data (research vs marketing), and how I can contact to have my data removed from the set. Also if my data is made anonymous, provide a 1 penny check and above information for any use or sale of the data set.<p>Yes this regulation would kill the industry in overhead costs aimed at making the information somewhat close to the &#x27;informed consent&#x27; required for medical approvals and breaking down how the industry works.

Make it known and pay me the same way farms are paid for the useful manure their animals produce.')
