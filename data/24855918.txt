While the US has 800 military bases and had 2 land wars at once for basically 15 years. On top of the entire Navy. Of course it&#x27;s defense spending is going to be higher.<p>Every American seems to forget that if they want a better balance in defense spending within NATO that the US could also lower its spending, in stead of Europe raising it.')
