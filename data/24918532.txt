They have several unique advantages and are undergoing a modern renaissance after being used in the very first days of non-fixed wing flight:<p>-Inexpensive and reliable. Far simpler to build and fly vs a helicopter<p>-Can fly at very low speeds without stalling<p>-VERY short landing, pretty much anywhere. Not quite so short take-off, but pre-spooling the horizontal rotary wing can mitigation this.<p>Cost and low stall speed are probably the biggest factors for their choice of autogyro.')
