Adium was a sister project that was originally completely different, but utilized some of our Protocol Plugins (aka prpls â€” basis for the name &quot;libpurple&quot;). It later utilized libgaim when it reached a certain level of maturity.<p>I don&#x27;t know whether Adium eventually moved fully onto libgaim. I seem to recall it only used it selectively, but I stopped working on those projects years ago.<p>Been very happy to Pidgin&#x27;s maintenance resume. Gary Kramlich&#x27;s been doing a fantastic job reviving it, and I&#x27;m hoping the same will be done for Adium in time. We really need a modern multi-chat&#x2F;IM client for the modern era.')
