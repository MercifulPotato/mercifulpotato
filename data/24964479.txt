In any (type) system, there’s an opportunity to chicanery the compiler. The degree to which you have to treat users of that system like children depends on how likely you think they are to behave badly.<p>If a “well-formed program” is something you can reasonably expect in your environment, you can also reasonably assume you also received a nominal type because it was validated. If it’s not, the expectation is that someone is lying to the compiler... and then you treat someone like they’re misbehaving. Even if they’re not.')
