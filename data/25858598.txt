And then you are just stuck.<p>This is changing with CentOS Stream. Bugs can be filed against CentOS Stream in the Red Hat Bugzilla and they will do something with that bug report. Additionally, if you know what to backport to fix it, you can submit pull requests on any package in CentOS Stream to have it reviewed and merged to fix your issue. The fix would then be built and released within days of merging your fix.<p>From my perspective, that&#x27;s pretty golden for an Enterprise Linux platform. The only other that&#x27;s like that is openSUSE Leap&#x2F;SUSE Linux Enterprise.')
