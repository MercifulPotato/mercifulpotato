It&#x27;s one of the (arguably key) things that make quantum algorithms work.<p>To quote Nielsen &amp; Chuang (section 1.4.2 on page 30):<p>&gt; Quantum parallelism is a fundamental feature of many quantum algorithms. Heuristically, and at the risk of over-simplifying, quantum parallelism allows quantum computers\nto evaluate a function f(x) for many different values of x simultaneously. In this section we explain how quantum parallelism works, and some of its limitations.<p>Then they go on and explain how e.g. the Deutschâ€“Jozsa algorithm is a good example of this. But I think it&#x27;s a key component in Shor&#x27;s algorithm as well when it comes to the period-finding step.')
