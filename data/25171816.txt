Item(by='Poblamoce', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1605984820, title='Ask HN: Chef by Day, Programmer by Night(?)', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I work 200+ hours a month and I love my work and my profession, but I also have a real love for computers and programming. I study programming and computer security in my free time. I&#x27;ve recently been wondering if I could make a few bucks on the side with what I&#x27;m learning, but I struggle to find what specifically I could do. What are are my options, and what should I focus on learning? Is being a web dev my only freelance option? I doubt I&#x27;d be able to do anything where I couldn&#x27;t work from home on my own time.<p>Also, for those of you who are in the same boat as me; how do you manage to juggle professions? Are you able to make time for things other than work in your life, or is your professional life all consuming?')
