(Elastic&#x2F;Mongo&#x2F;Redis being the primary examples).<p>As I see it, the 30 year old &quot;Open Source&quot; principles didn&#x27;t see these coming any more than the buggy whip industry saw the Model T coming.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d really like to see those three companies (and others&#x2F;new entrants) come up with a workable new model for software licenses for some kind of &quot;freely usable software&quot; (&quot;free&quot; in the generic &quot;no obligations&quot; sense, not the GPL&#x2F;Stallman &quot;freedom&quot; sense) written by salaried devs at for-profit companies. I think the world would be a better place with more software closer to the Stallman end of the license spectrum than the Oracle end. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s necessarily a given. It might well be true that in general, a for profit company cannot make enough money out of writing software and giving it away to keep teams of full time developers paid.')
