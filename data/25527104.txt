No breadboards! That&#x27;s amateur hour.<p>Or, fairly frequently, one VT220 hooked to a serial terminal concentrator that lets you select which of the 32 or 48 machines you want to be connected to.<p>Or a VT220 emulator in that smart serial terminal concentrator, that&#x27;s addressable by SSHing in.<p>Or a VT220 emulator in an IPMI access point directly in each server, that&#x27;s extremely common.
