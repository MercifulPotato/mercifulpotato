I&#x27;ve never worked with the JVM outside of Clojure, and I&#x27;m not going to, but it is a nice runtime for processes that needs performance, but not quick startup time. On the other hand, we now have Babashka, that solves the issue of startup time. So now we have two tools both using the same (ish) language, but for different use cases.<p>And I think that&#x27;s where one of the most powerful strengths of Clojure comes from. It&#x27;s a hosted language, so it runs on many platforms. Today we have JVM, JavaScript, C#, Babashka and more smaller experiments, who knows where the language will pop up in the future? I&#x27;m excited!')
