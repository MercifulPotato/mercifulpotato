But your own quote says &quot;some planners&quot; not &quot;all planners.&quot;<p>Some planners were intentionally pursuing an explicitly racist and classist agenda. And some were just doing what other planners did because &quot;monkey see, monkey do&quot; and some were just trying to do their job and get their paycheck and make their own lives work.<p>Planners don&#x27;t always have the kind of god-like powers to rearrange the city as they see fit that outsiders seem to routinely imagine them having. There is often a political process involved and planners themselves are frequently tearing their hair out about their own inability to do as they please.<p>I&#x27;ve had conversations where people characterized large swaths of single family detached homes -- aka the modern suburb -- as &quot;racist architecture&quot; and I tried to say &quot;I don&#x27;t think that is helpful framing. I think to some degree, we made large swaths of single family detached homes because greenfield development was expedient and not because single family detached homes are, per se, racist architecture.&quot;<p>And someone was upset and trying to tell me I was denying racism or something and I finally said &quot;Let me put it this way: I&#x27;m sure they would have found ways to keep out people of color even if they had been building condos in towers in the downtown area. Racism is a social phenomenon and should not be conflated with a particular form of architecture.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s very similar to what I am trying to say here. If that&#x27;s still not clear, I think I need to just let people be confused. I don&#x27;t know how I can more clearly state my meaning.')
