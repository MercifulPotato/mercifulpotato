Other examples would be checking liveness properties in the unbounded case, and possibly full Linear Temporal Logic, e.g., &lt;&gt;[]p (&quot;eventually, property p is always satisfied&quot;).<p>I realize this is a tall order, but I think nuXmv [1] already implements some kind of SMT-based LTL model checking, so it should be possible to achieve something similar for TLA+ (or at least a subset).<p>&gt; to make invariant checking decidable<p>Of course decidability is desirable, but efficient sound procedures in the undecidable case would still solve many practical problems. I realize they are not as &quot;nice&quot; from a theoretical&#x2F;academic standpoint, though.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nuxmv.fbk.eu&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nuxmv.fbk.eu&#x2F;</a>')
