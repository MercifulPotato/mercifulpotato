If so, Elon&#x27;s stock option expenses should also be excluded.<p>- they&#x27;re non-recurring.  The company has to hit higher EBITDA and market cap goals for Elon to get another award, so at steady state Elon gets nothing.<p>- they don&#x27;t impact cash.  Elon gets stock, not cash, and he doesn&#x27;t sell them so it doesn&#x27;t even affect float.')
