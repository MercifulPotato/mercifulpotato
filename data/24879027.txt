I have only recently realized just how bad it is.<p>I have recently gotten headfirst back into turntablism&#x2F;vinyl DJ’ing, and leaving my iPhone in my room, just wearing my Apple Watch with me to tell the time and to do a quick voice reply to someone if it’s important enough. I’m trying to start reading books again. It’s scarily hard to keep that level of attention span again.<p>I’m an iOS developer for a living, and I think screen addiction should perhaps start to be considered a workplace hazard.<p>Worse off for me - previous to DJ’ing, my hobbies have been game&#x2F;homebrew development and hardcore audio production &#x2F; editing &#x2F; engineering - all on my MacBook, of course, staring at a screen.<p>Looking at the actual ‘Screen Time’ reports became jarring. I actually still have a dopamine response that tells me to look at my phone when it’s in the other room. Thank God the watch can’t do HN or Reddit.<p>It’s like a signal in my head, wired there, like ‘hey; you’ve gotta use the bathroom’ but instead it’s ‘hey, pick up your phone and start scrolling.’<p>I’ve had issues with substance abuse in the past that I’ve moved past and worked through.<p>‘Doom scrolling’ has, by no exaggeration, been harder to kick for me than any substance or even cigarettes, which I smoked for almost ten years - it’s going to take years to unprogram what it took years for the developers of things like Facebook&#x2F;IG&#x2F;Reddit to program in the first place.<p>It’s messed up to think that people who have never faced addiction before may deal with this as their first go. It’s going to be a hard recovery for a world buried unproductively with devices in their faces all the time giving them a much quicker and more consistent dopamine response than cigarettes ever could.')
