Having grown our bookings by +100% in each of the past 2 years, we helped over 1.3M travellers in the year through May 2020 book great accommodation deals, anywhere in the world. Now we are looking to rapidly grow that figure in 2020 despite the challenges of the Coronavirus. Built with passion in Amsterdam &amp; and now increasingly remotely (with team members living in PL, RU, ES, BR, PT, IL, US) Amsterdam in particular and The Netherlands in general are terrific places to live, and in times of great crises, a great place to have a company HQ (see our founder&#x27;s note on the support we received). We are growing more towards remote work even from the NL contributors (albeit in a hybrid fashion) and are now open for full-time remote function for all roles, with preference for EU timezone. The challenge in the travel industry is also a great opportunity Having survived the coronavirus with the full team, we are growing more ambitious in our goal as we seek to build a category leader in distributing the best accommodation deals to travellers, partners and businesses around the world. We believe that the 2020&#x27;s are the best time to scale a travel company in over two decades, and are looking for hungry &amp; accomplished leaders &amp; contributors to help us build a world class travel company. Reach out and join us for the ride - &gt; It won&#x27;t be smooth, but oh, the places we will go!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.findhotel.net&#x2F;o&#x2F;data-engineer-remoterelocation-possible-bi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.findhotel.net&#x2F;o&#x2F;data-engineer-remoterelocati...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.findhotel.net&#x2F;o&#x2F;senior-backend-engineer-golang-remoterelocation-possible" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.findhotel.net&#x2F;o&#x2F;senior-backend-engineer-gola...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.findhotel.net&#x2F;o&#x2F;engineering-lead-fefs-remoterelocation-possible" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.findhotel.net&#x2F;o&#x2F;engineering-lead-fefs-remote...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.findhotel.net&#x2F;o&#x2F;senior-devops-engineer-remoterelocation-possible" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.findhotel.net&#x2F;o&#x2F;senior-devops-engineer-remot...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.findhotel.net&#x2F;o&#x2F;software-test-automation-engineer-frontend-remoterelocation-possible" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.findhotel.net&#x2F;o&#x2F;software-test-automation-eng...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.findhotel.net&#x2F;o&#x2F;data-analyst-performance-marketing-remoterelocation-possible" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.findhotel.net&#x2F;o&#x2F;data-analyst-performance-mar...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.findhotel.net&#x2F;o&#x2F;senior-frontend-engineer-remoterelocation-possible" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.findhotel.net&#x2F;o&#x2F;senior-frontend-engineer-rem...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.findhotel.net&#x2F;o&#x2F;senior-frontend-engineer-remoterelocation-possible" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;careers.findhotel.net&#x2F;o&#x2F;senior-frontend-engineer-rem...</a>')
