Plus news orgs are already using FB to syndicate&#x2F;share, so it’s really a no-brained for them.<p>I wonder what the world would look like with a independent, trustworthy, non-advertising-based company&#x2F;organization which provided a similar anti-spam service for free, with the option to publicly tie to verified identities as well.
