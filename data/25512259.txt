Item(by='rchaud', descendants=None, kids=[25516389], score=None, time=1608676999, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25508383, text='&gt; I don’t think it follows that Reddit would become as bad a voat if it was “all free speech all the time”.<p>Do you remember r&#x2F;uncensored_news, a sub that sprang up in the wake of the Miami Pulse nightclub shooting? Apparently its raison d&#x27;etre was to show people &quot;the truth&quot; because r&#x2F;news moderators were not approving the numerous news posts about it fast enough. Unsurprsingly, that was considered censorship.<p>It took all of 3 months for that sub to become filled with racist and bigoted misinformation. Reddit&#x27;s admin policy is very generous. On numerous occasions, they have allowed hate speech communities to grow, right up until the inevitable calls to violence occur. At which point Reddit kills the sub and pretends it never existed.')
