And you don&#x27;t even need to go <i>that far</i>, roots as used on the real numbers don&#x27;t make sense in C.<p>The way I see it is that there&#x27;s only one fundamental function, which is the exponential function, and log is its inverse. Everything else, including a^b, is syntactic sugar. (If you define exp on C, even sin and cos...)<p>I guess a different notation could have some meaning pedagogically, math notation is incredibly inconsistent at times, but there really is no &quot;deeper truth&quot; here.')
