And then censoring them from a position of power, since you now provide their paycheck.<p>Keep mind that this is a new, recently instituted process. During the interview process when these researchers were hired, this policy did not exist. Perhaps they were naive to believe that such a policy wouldn&#x27;t be instituted later but I think that&#x27;s a different discussion.')
