Emotions and instinct kept most of our ancestors and most of the currently living animals both alive and thriving.<p>This is the point. Instincts developed to keep you alive in a world where the classic laws of the jungle where true. Since the modern world, the definition of what is &quot;strongest&quot; and the threats you find yourselve exposed to differ vastly from that back in the days.<p>While instincts will generally give you a good direction to start with, problems are too complex today to just rely on instincts. Heck even I had my instincts tell me &quot;this feels wrong&quot; and upon reading and getting smart about that topic i completely changed my mind.<p>If you have time to prepare for a discussion, try not to rely on instinct but let it push you to gather facts to undermine it or to oppose it.')
