Water heater will stay hot for a day or so, but will rapidly cool when you start using it and cold water flows in. House will be uncomfortably cold after a few hours in the wintertime if the heat is not running, and it&#x27;s not really practical to overheat it when electric rates are low&#x2F;free because you can only go maybe 10 degrees before it&#x27;s really too warm for comfort. You&#x27;d need a heat tank of some sort which complicates the system and as a practical matter homes don&#x27;t have that and might not have space for.<p>Finally aside from all that I heat my water and my home with natural gas.')
