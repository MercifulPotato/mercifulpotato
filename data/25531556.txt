Remember that it hit the market in 1982.<p>For it to have finished up in 1982, it likely started development before or just as the original IBM PC hit the market.  At the time, there wasn&#x27;t a huge installed base of can&#x27;t-afford-to-break 8086 code, or much of a precedent for backwards compatibility on a wholesale platform change for PCs.  They may well have figured anyone trying to build a 286 system would be targeting a fully protected-mode OS, and the non-protected mode support was more of a stopgap for compatibility and bootstrap purposes.')
