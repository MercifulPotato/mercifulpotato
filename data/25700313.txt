The vast majority of people can&#x27;t tell you when something&#x27;s wrong with the writing even if they want to, let alone point a finger at it.<p>I don&#x27;t have a list, but here&#x27;s something that I dealt with recently:<p>* Is everything sufficiently described&#x2F;explained?<p><pre><code>    - Environment descriptions: Is it clear where the scene is set?\n\n    - Character motivation: Does the reader understand why they decided to do &lt;x&gt;?\n\n    - Are there enough clues for the conclusion &#x2F; reveal &#x2F; twist to make sense?\n\n    - What day is it?\n</code></pre>\nWhenever a reader finds something confusing, it&#x27;s usually a matter of that thing not having been described enough.<p>* Are the characters distinctive enough?<p><pre><code>    - Have I described each in a non-perfunctory way?\n \n    - Could I tell who&#x27;s saying which line if I removed the dialogue tags?\n\n    - Is someone just a background character when they ought to be a person?\n</code></pre>\n* Can a paragraph be cut down into a sentence without losing anything?<p>Edit:<p>* Is there enough tension throughout the story? Is the main character lacking personal stakes in the plot?')
