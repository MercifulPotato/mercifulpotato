I love the idea and would be willing to contribute if possible.  I agree we don&#x27;t need another social network where new content is posted.  We need a way to sift through the large amount of existing content out there.<p>My questions:<p>1) How do you plan on getting content from reddit&#x2F;twitter&#x2F;hackernews?  Are there api&#x27;s for this or do you plan to scrape?<p>2) Would other social sites have issues with you using their content in your social stock market, and possibly profiting from it?<p>3) Would it be possible for a social network to cut you off and kill your business?  For Example: Reddit realized that they are losing traffic because more people are going to [yourSite].com to view Reddit content so they sue you.')
