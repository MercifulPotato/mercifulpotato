Skype acts like you bought a computer just to run it. Slack wants it all. Gmail is crammed with icons and features and can&#x27;t deal with half width screen. Media players have notions, they call your computer a library.<p>Instead, many applications subdivide themselves into smaller windows - for example IDEs.<p>It&#x27;s as if people gave up arranging application windows. They alt-tab (switch) between fullscreen apps. Moving windows around is usually too much hassle.
