Is this more a lifestyle choice to have as much fee time as you can to travel etc and make just enough money to get by?  Why not a full time job and take vacations?  Some companies give unlimited vacation...ok they say they do but really if you work on a project and get it complete and need to decompress for n weeks and let your manager know and work it out ahead of time that should be entirely possible!  So I’d say barring any reasons above or others not mentioned where part time work is a necessity, I would say go for the full time work.')
