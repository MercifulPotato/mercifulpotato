There was a motivation for this. Supervisors were getting bonuses for closing out cases.<p>To be clear, I was never asked to enter any bogus data and I&#x27;ve not heard of anyone else who was. What I did get near the end of the census were lists of homes to visit where the respondent had refused to participate.<p>I could go to the homes on my list in any order I wanted too, and I could stop working anytime I wanted to, so I went to homes where no one had been contacted in previous visits first and when I ran out of those I went home. I didn&#x27;t see any good reason to go visit someone who&#x27;d already opted out 3+ times because they had the right to refuse and to expect it be respected.<p>There were a lot of people who refused. Out of those I visited that did refuse they had a tendency to be pretty aggressive about it too. I was almost always able to calm them down very quickly by telling them they had the right to refuse and I would make a note saying not to bother them. But many of those cases were back on my daily list several times after I and others had noted their refusals.<p>All in all it was a pretty interesting gig.')
