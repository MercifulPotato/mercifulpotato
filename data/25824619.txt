She&#x27;s spent a lot of money on some sort of adopt-a-chinese scheme. Someone in her family did the same, and the kid had various medical issues. I honestly think she&#x27;d have been better off with a surrogate and a sperm donor.<p>I definitely respect people who adopt, but they risk of just adopting someone else&#x27;s problem is too high for me.')
