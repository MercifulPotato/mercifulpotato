Item(by='PlugTunin', descendants=None, kids=[25491561], score=None, time=1608516298, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25490284, text='I should be clear in stating that my life hasn&#x27;t been a bowl of cherries. Asperger&#x27;s is at the core of a looooong list of problems I&#x27;ve had with interpersonal relationships, whether it&#x27;s family, friends, co-workers, roommates, etc. I&#x27;m sort of intolerant of being treated unjustly or being taken advantage of, and I react rather nastily to those who cross me. (And before you judge me, know that people with Asperger&#x27;s have a knack for finding these situations. Exploited by coworkers? It really happens. Undesirable roommates who&#x27;ve physically threatened me? Been there more than once. Physical altercations as a kid, refusing to back down from bullies? Too many times to count. Screwed up relatives? I have many.)<p>But I don&#x27;t care to use the word disabled in describing myself. Being unable to keep my mouth shut in the face of something I don&#x27;t agree with doesn&#x27;t qualify as a disability. My sensory issues aren&#x27;t anything I ask for accommodations for. That I prefer to spend more time away from people than the average bear is not a disability. And in the context of autism, it&#x27;s hard to use the word disabled and not have people place limitations on what one can&#x2F;can&#x27;t do. So, I don&#x27;t use the word. And just consider myself <i>different</i>.<p>I recognize that there are people deeply offended by people like me, who are at the higher-functioning end of the spectrum and refuse to consider themselves disabled. (They see us as impostors.) There are also many people who take offense to the term <i>lower&#x2F;lesser functioning</i>, and resent the use of terms like &quot;severe autism&quot;. They consider this language to be demeaning. Autistic twitter is quite the landmine for semantic wars of this sort.')
