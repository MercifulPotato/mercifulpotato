Granted, it&#x27;s a cool tool and would likely save some people alot of time as they wouldn&#x27;t have to invest necessary time and effort into setting up a virtual machine with an older version of Mac OS. What concerns me about this Saas is that Encoding&#x2F;Decoding as a service is about a silly as Encryption&#x2F;Decryption as a service. The project may as well say: &quot;Give us your valuable information and intellectual property, we promise not to look at it and we promise that it will actually be immediately deleted.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t mean to be altogether negative or pessimistic here. I have no beef with Joshua Stein and absolutely no evidence to suggest he isn&#x27;t anything but a super honest and chill dude. I&#x27;m sure he is totally trustworthy and I think this is a really cool addition to his portfolio. I absolutely do not have anything negative to say with regard to him or his fantastic decision to host this Saas tool.<p>My negativity and critique is solely focused toward the HN community that upvoted this Saas tool when it (to the best of my knowledge) cannot be either paid for as a commercial saas under a contract guaranteeing security considerations and custody of information or alternatively self hosted in either a distributed binary or source form. To be absolutely clear, I am absolutely not suggesting that security sensitive Saas tools should be open source of offer self hosted variants to merit upvotes on HN. I think it&#x27;s great when creators are able to monetize their fantastic software.<p>At the end of the day consider this meta comment to represent nothing more than my personal opinion on what any individual or organization should consider safe to outsource. A free Saas tool that decodes a deprecated archive format should never be used with anything sensitive regardless of who is offering the service.<p>Astute readers should note that my game theoretic motivations with regard to sharing my contrarian views on the top trending link are clearly nothing more than a pathetic effort to seek attention and shouldn&#x27;t be taken seriously. :)')
