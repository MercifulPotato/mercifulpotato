This implies that it would output no more than seventeen significant figures, regardless of the requested precision.<p>The first thing I notice is this comment in a later changelog:<p>&gt; I believe we have a very fast numerical conversion that appears to be reliably generating about 15 to 16 digits out output [last digit may be off by 1 or 2 in typical case].<p>If the last digit of a fifteen- to sixteen-digit output is off by one or two, are we sure it round trips?<p>Second, the test coverage for this feature in tests&#x2F;format.cpp looks pretty sparse, and it&#x27;s not obvious to me how the output is verified.<p>Interesting find.  I may play around with this later.')
