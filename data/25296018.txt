Yes he&#x27;s talking about software issues. But in the case of Apple, you can&#x27;t separate those two. The OS doesn&#x27;t work on other hardware and (in this case) the hardware doesn&#x27;t work with other OSes. This works to their (huge) advantage in some cases, being able to optimise each component perfectly. But it can be a drawback too like it is here.<p>Moorhead didn&#x27;t make that point.<p>Moorhead made the point that a small amount of software that&#x27;s mostly rarely used on the Mac platform isn&#x27;t working perfectly.
