Item(by='aitrean', descendants=None, kids=[24871475], score=None, time=1603470575, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24870987, text='&gt; DeFi on Ethereum is replicating the existing financial system, so by criticizing this, you&#x27;re essentially also criticizing the legacy financial system.<p>Checkmate nOcOiNeRs. If you criticize my pyramid scheme network, you&#x27;re actually criticizing the complex global financial system, because r&#x2F;ethereum told me they&#x27;re basically one in the same.<p>How many mortgages are settled at any level of the &quot;financial stack&quot; with DeFi? None.<p>How many bond payments have been paid out at any level of the &quot;financial stack&quot; with DeFi? None.<p>How many registered securities have been traded with DeFi handling any level of the &quot;financial stack&quot;? None.<p>If you want to use your &quot;financial stack&quot; metaphor, DeFi is like using a bluetooth smart dildo bootloader as the back end for a full stack web application. Sure, the stack you speak of exists, but there is nowhere that any programmer would ever seriously think to put that thing.<p>Stop arguing semantics and actually point to a legitimate use-case that someone outside the crypto space would have for DeFi (even if it is at a &quot;lower level&quot; of the fin stack).')
