At least the sun never got you to agree to a draconian ToS.<p>I also liked their idea that AWS is trying to protect their contract with Twitter because users are leaving Twitter(hosted by AWS) for Parler (which was hosted by AWS at the time). If I have a glass of beer in my left hand and switch to my right, have I lost my glass of beer? How would that possibly benefit AWS unless somehow Parler negotiated better terms than Twitter? If anything, the opposite seems likely.')
