Classic! :)<p>This is one of the (relatively few) documented bugs that I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ve already fixed. Doing continuous level-saves is needless to say a necessity in any game you invest dozens of playhours in..<p>Still, to manage to have as few bugs like that in comparision to the sheer size of the game is amazing. Once you play a bit longer than this, you&#x27;ll see the game opening up in so many ways and with so detailed side-jobs and side-plots that it&#x27;s just jawdropping. That they actually pulled this off at all is a benchmark effort for future mega-games I&#x27;m sure.')
