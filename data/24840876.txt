This is the type of thinking Graham says he wants to avoid in earlier paragraphs.<p>Instead of cultivating overconfidence through the deadly sin of pride, we should cultivate increasing true confidence through the cardinal virtue of courage.

Courage is the choice to confront pain, ridicule, and the unknown all for an uncertain reward.<p>Graham says, &quot;being slightly overconfident armors you against both other people&#x27;s skepticism and your own.&quot;  Acting courageously does this much, much better.
