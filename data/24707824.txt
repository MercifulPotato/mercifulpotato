I think the cameras we were using were around $80 a piece. Cost was an important consideration for us because we were building a multi camera device and to do something similar with Azure Kinect would have cost us several thousand dollars.<p>Another thing we like was how great the Intel RealSense SDK is. They have official wrappers for multiple languages along with sample code to get you started.<p>The RealSense ecosystem is quite healthy too â€“ at least for a niche technology. RealSense cameras have a proven track record in various commercial devices and the development forums are fairly active. We found we could find answers to most common questions and problems we had.<p>Another nice thing about RealSense is that they have a great range of cameras so they have something perfectly suited for every application. For example, some of their cameras use stereo vision while others use LIDAR or structured light. They also use the same SDK for every camera which makes swapping out cameras fairly easy. We were using structured light cameras, but we were able to swap them out with Stereo and LIDAR cameras with no problems at all.<p>Azure Kinect looks interesting. I&#x27;ve wanted to play around with one of a while, although given its price and feature set it wouldn&#x27;t have been the right camera for us. It&#x27;s probably a good all-rounder for general robotics &#x2F; vision projects though.')
