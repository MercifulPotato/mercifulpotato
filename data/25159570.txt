Wearing masks in Taiwan was normal even before the pandemic.<p>Scooter travel is the most common form of transportation and it&#x27;s very normal to wear masks to prevent inhaling pollution. You could find masks all over the place. They sell them at convenience stores, stationary stores, in vending machines at the front of hospitals, etc.<p>I agree there are a lot of lessons that can be learned from Taiwan&#x27;s success but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s fair to compare their mask adherence to other nations that didn&#x27;t already have that embedded in their daily lives.')
