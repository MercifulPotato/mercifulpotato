Item(by='prepend', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610588636, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25746993, text='“Hundreds of emails” seems like a poor reason to revoke all activities.<p>It’s hard to say without seeing the actual text but unless they were saying to burn down the capitol, I don’t think political emails saying the election was stolen are noteworthy. This is based on my own experience of getting large numbers of spam letters making all sorts of stupid claims “Jane Doe is a terrorist” “Nancy Pelosi is going to take your guns” “Trump is going to put your kids in cages” “Biden will destroy America”<p>While I would like to block all this crap, if Salesforce is going to drop RNC over “donate to us because the election is stolen” they they will need to drop many other people.')
