They too opted to write a second encryption layer on top of TLS &#x2F; SSL, fearing MITM attacks. That was also when iOS didn&#x27;t support SSL pinning yet.<p>It seemed to work for them, security researchers went to town on it and while they quickly discovered there was a second encryption layer below SSL, they were unable to determine what it was and how to crack it.<p>IIRC their encryption was never broken, and thanks to that track record, they slowly increased daily spend limits over the mobile app.<p>Long term, because they were very forward-thinking and they had competent native app developers (as opposed to the competition who struggled for years with mobile web &#x2F; crossplatform tech), they increased their market share by a lot, now being the largest bank in NL; can&#x27;t find historical data, but they went from 37% in 2016 to 40% in 2018.')
