No legal action was taken and I think this is why libsignal-client is still running. Open Whisper Systems never bothered to sue them, probably because it&#x27;s only a fringe phenomenon right now.<p>His opinion is clear though and it leaves it open to legal action in the future.<p>I agree it is his perogative but I wish there was an actual open network. I don&#x27;t like moving from one vendor-lock-in (whatsapp) to another (signal). I want something where I can do with my conversations what I want, like Matrix. For this reason I don&#x27;t advocate Signal to my friends as an alternative for Whatsapp.')
