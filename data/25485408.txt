In my opinion, microservices make most sense when dealing with multiple team. It&#x27;s much easier to update core services when everyone depends on it through the network, rather than requiring people to redeploy their stuff. If you&#x27;re a single team operation, it&#x27;s not really a problem if all your stuff runs in a single process. It may even benefit you in terms of performance and scalability, to be honest.')
