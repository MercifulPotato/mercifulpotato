The whole allegory of the cave from Plato&#x2F;Socrates is most likely the first non-religious justification in western philosophy (which was promulgated) which explains this &quot;the people on the bottom deserve it and are correctly segmented&quot; idea.<p>Idiot farmers, who are not educated and don&#x27;t see reality for how it is (only shadows on the wall), cannot be trusted to run your state.
