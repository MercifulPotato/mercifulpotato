It&#x27;s what &quot;underlings&quot;, &quot;minions&quot; do.<p>But if we look at deep learning, it&#x27;s almost the opposite of this. Deep learning begins with an existing stream of data, a huge stream, large enough that the system can just extrapolate what&#x27;s in the data, include data leads to what judgements. And that works for categorization and decision making the duplicates what decisions humans make or even duplicates what works, what wins in a complex interaction process. But all that doesn&#x27;t involve any amount of adaptive intelligence. It &quot;generalizes&quot; something but our data scientists have no idea exactly what.<p>The article proposes an &quot;engineering&quot; paradigm as an alternative to the present &quot;intelligence&quot; paradigm. That seems more sensible, yes. But I&#x27;m doubtful this could accepted. Neural network AI seems like a supplement to the ideology of unlimited data collection. If you put a limit on what &quot;AI&quot; should do, you&#x27;ll put a limit on the benefits of &quot;big data&quot;.')
