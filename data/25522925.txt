The new rate applies to future income only.<p>And unfortunately, triggering the rate increase is <i>sticky</i>. If you go over $1MM is 2021, the 30% rate will apply to all of your income in 2022. (If you are under $1MM in 2022, the rate will reset to 15% for 2023).<p>This is the actual confusing part. Surely Apple could just apply the 15% rate to the first $1MM of every developer&#x27;s income in each year instead. It&#x27;s simpler, and it doesn&#x27;t create the weird incentive to depress earnings at the end of the calendar year if they are approaching $1MM.')
