This is the society we have collectively built!<p>Meanwhile, as a student of Hume I cannot hope to describe what “ought to happen”. I can only speculate that (as I said previously) we need more regulation to ensure everyone is treated “fairly” (whatever ought that might imply).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Is–ought_problem" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Is–ought_problem</a>')
