Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612118803, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25977196, text='&gt; But you won&#x27;t really know if March is going to be income-less until it is over. On March 1st I may still be hopeful that tomorrow will be a better day. Soon it is the 31st and I realize I didn&#x27;t make anything. You&#x27;re still dependent on hindsight, no?<p>You can specify how much withholding you want. There are just penalties if you end up owing too much in the end, because otherwise people would specify none all the time and we&#x27;d be back to tax debtors prisons when they didn&#x27;t have the money at the end of the year.<p>So you can say on March 1st that you want the $1000 now. Then on March 3rd when you find a new job, you immediately go back and specify a different withholding amount which claws it back so you don&#x27;t have to pay the penalty for not withholding enough now that you&#x27;re making more money again.<p>&gt; And reporting daily is a <i>huge</i> amount of overhead for someone.<p>Not if you&#x27;re only reporting changes in your withholding amount. Then there is only something to file when your job status changes. You lose your job, you file a status change, money is immediately transferred into your account. You get a new job, you file again. At any other time there is nothing you have to do.<p>&gt; The logic is exactly the same if you report every second or only once per year.<p>Other than the immense practical difference between having to wait for money for one year and having to wait for money for one second.<p>And even that doesn&#x27;t exist because filing doesn&#x27;t have to happen after the fact at all. If it&#x27;s February 15th and your employer says you&#x27;re laid off in two weeks, you can change your filing status before March 1st and get the money at exactly the same time.')
