Supply-side economics never had any evidence behind it; it never had any support in academic research; it barely even had any support among economic researchers and forecasters in the business world. It was and remains crank economics pure and simple, with nothing going for it except political convenience.</i><p>&gt; <i>Yet 35 years ago the GOP was already willing to embrace this doctrine because it was politically convenient, and could be used to justify tax cuts for the rich, which have always been the priority.</i><p>&gt; <i>And given this, why should anyone be surprised at all the reality denial and trashing of any kind of evidence that followed?
