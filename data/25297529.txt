That fiction allows a visa that is by its terms a nonimmigrant visa for temporary workers to be treated in practice as the first step in the path to permanent immigration. The 1990 INA doesn&#x27;t change that in substance--it merely excludes H-1Bs from a presumption to avoid blowing up the fiction. This is the result of H-1B being a statutory kludge in response to the executive branch&#x27;s longstanding abuse of the H-1 visa created in the 1952 INA.<p>Other countries have real skilled immigrants visas that are designed to be such. They work very differently, and make much more sense because they were designed for that purpose.
