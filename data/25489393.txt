(Windows, macOS, Linux)<p>- is it supported by build systems and&#x2F;or CI products?<p>Through the filter of &quot;stuff I know&quot;, my choice for most things at this point is F# on .NET Core&#x2F;.NET 5. (and&#x2F;or Fable).<p>For learning something new, I&#x27;d probably choose elixir with elm, or maybe Rust, depending on the application.')
