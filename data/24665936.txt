Numbers six and seven in the article very much resonate with me:<p><i>6. They say no to giving the steering wheel of life to anyone else. Another Buffett quote affirms this: &quot;You&#x27;ve gotta keep control of your time and you can&#x27;t unless you say no. You can&#x27;t let people set your agenda in life.&quot;<p>7. They say no to people-pleasing. Successful people don&#x27;t neglect their deepest wishes and desires to accommodate and yield to others&#x27; wishes and desires.</i><p>As a woman, I find that pretty much everyone thinks I should do stuff for them &quot;out of the goodness of my heart&quot; and, no, it doesn&#x27;t come back to me as career networking or some crap. I was literally homeless for years and people would be all gushy about what a wonderful person I was and how much value I added to both HN and other forums and then be all basically &quot;STFU and stop whining at me, you worthless bitch&quot; if I was all &quot;That&#x27;s great, but I can&#x27;t fucking afford to eat. Can I get some help trying to establish an income here if you think I&#x27;m so wonderful?&quot;<p>Nope. Absolutely not.<p>So one of the ways I have slowly begun making my life work is by walking away from a zillion opportunities to be a chump and be helpful to people who will never, ever, ever, ever do a fucking thing in return for me.<p>It hasn&#x27;t made me a millionaire, but I have saved millions on what my medical condition is supposed to cost, so it is clearly worth real money and never mind how dirt poor I remain, in part due to rampant and blatant sexism while everyone acts like I am higher than a kite for pointing that fact out.')
