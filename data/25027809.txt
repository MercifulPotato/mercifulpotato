Generally I set it up, and it works great for ages, but when something eventually does break, it&#x27;s been so long since I touched it that I&#x27;m lost.<p>Another issue is &quot;works on my machine&quot; - with containers I don&#x27;t need to worry about what packages and versions are available in the package manager. I can run a container anywhere.<p>And in the case where there is a hardware failure, it takes an age to get everything back up and running. Using containers forces you to have everything setup in a reproducible way.<p>If you&#x27;re not familiar with containers, I understand that the learning curve might seem steep, or that it might seem too complicated, but it&#x27;s honestly not.<p>Now, I wouldn&#x27;t personally advocate for running k8s, or even k3s, on a personal server - they really are very complicated, and k8s in particular uses a lot of CPU and RAM to do even nothing. But Docker Compose and Swarm are pretty simple really, and life before them was absolutely worse - I love these tools.')
