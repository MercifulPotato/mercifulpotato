The bells and whistles on the Dream Machine + Unifi OS are appealing in an ooh-shiny-things way, but I can&#x27;t help thinking that it&#x27;s way overkill for a (or at least my) home network. When I&#x27;m troubleshooting the network performance at home, it&#x27;s usually to get housemates back online as quickly as possible. A comprehensive analytics platform is cool, but seems like a distraction compared to the outdated-looking but functional TP-Link interface.<p>Then there&#x27;s the tacit upsell of it all. Of course all those bells and whistles are a lot more relevant and useful the more you buy in. If you&#x27;re going full Smart Home, it&#x27;s cool that Ubiquiti offers an enterprise-y experience for your residence, but if you just want a cable to the outside world, as OP seems to want, Ubiquiti <i>does</i> seem confusingly elaborate.<p>(Also I imagine a lot of us spend enough time looking at network analytics at work; I don&#x27;t want to go to sleep with graphs behind my eyelids.)')
