We&#x27;d no longer be the product — our data not for sale — and the companies would make more money! Knowing that my message would get received, I&#x27;d happily pay to slide into the DMs like people do to me on LinkedIn (mostly service providers, but I&#x27;ve gotten some great biz dev connections from InMail).<p>So my inbox is the product? I think the number of people willing to pay $36 per annum to not see sponsored content in amongst all the organic marketing spam in newsfeeds is a negligible proportion of the user base, especially since ad blockers can be configured to hide it anyway.')
