One cannot &quot;time&quot; the market. However, the playbook to survive in an early vs late scenarios are different. When you are entering a market late, you don&#x27;t have to work hard to educate the market. For example, Apple literally created the touch screen mobile phone segment. Android phone makers only had to sell into that hype. However, when you are entering a crowded market, you need to have a really strong go-to-market strategy because you will have to find a way to break the strangelhold that your  competitors have over the coversation.<p>On the other hand, when you enter the market too early, you might have the &quot;novelty&quot; factor but it&#x27;s really difficult to stay under the radar: clones show up fairly fast. So unless you are able to stay underground <i>and</i> still grow fast (improbable but not impossible), your early-to-market advantage is really not that big of a deal.<p>Finally, the size of the addressable market also plays a big role.
