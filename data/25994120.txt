I want the FDA inspecting facilities.  I want them testing purity, and then testing the tests that they use test the previously tested test.  When I buy aspirin I want to know it is aspirin and not anything else.  &quot;Let the market decide&quot; doesn&#x27;t help me once I&#x27;m poisoned.  Please government, regulate drug manufacturers.')
