A job-income is 100% guaranteed to be received if one worked. Even if the business paying the said wage doesn&#x27;t make a profit, they still have to pay the wage. The owner cops the loss.<p>Therefore, to encourage investments, the taxes are lowered on the profits of such type of investment (which is what capital gains are). The person trying to make capital gains income has to take on a risk that a wage earner doesn&#x27;t, because the capital gains aren&#x27;t guaranteed.<p>If capital gains are taxed the same, you will find that there will be less investments, which leads to less jobs and less wealth overall.')
