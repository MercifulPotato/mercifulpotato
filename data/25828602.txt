In 1990 they decided to divide the whole country into blocks. [1]<p>&quot;An automated computer process looks for all visible and nonvisible features in our geographic database (MAF&#x2F;TIGER) that should be a block boundary and creates a block each time those features create a polygon.&quot; [2]<p>Kind of an interesting extension of the &quot;block&quot; concept. It would seem that population density should be more of a factor. Automatically generating 5 million unpopulated census divisions seems a bit like something out of a Terry Gilliam movie.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Census_block" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Census_block</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.census.gov&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;random-samplings&#x2F;2011&#x2F;07&#x2F;what-are-census-blocks.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.census.gov&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;random-samplings&#x2F;2011&#x2F;...</a>')
