Yeah, that&#x27;s basically the numbers I also found -- although the number of instructions decoded per clock cycle is a different metric from the number of µop that can be issued, so that feels a bit like moving the goal post.<p>But, fair enough, for practical applications the latter may matter more. For an apple-to-apple comparison (pun not intended) it&#x27;d be interesting to know what the corresponding number for the M1 is; while it is ARM and thus RISC, one might still expect that there can be more than one µop per instructions, at least in some cases?<p>Of course then we might also want to talk about how certain complex instructions on x86 can actually require more than one cycle to decode (at least that was the case for Zen 1) ;-). But I think those are not <i>that</i> common.<p>Ah well, this is just intellectual curiosity, at the end of the day most of us don&#x27;t really care, we just want our computers to be as fast as possible ;-).')
