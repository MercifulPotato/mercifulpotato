I&#x27;m really sorry that I have to do this thing but there is no other option. I&#x27;m really sorry.<p>I have to close this pull request because pulseaudio maintainers are bastards who decided to merge this pull request and later rework code to remove dependncy on codec libraries (which ensure proper audio quality) and replacing it by codecs provided by gstreamer which do not support neither SBC-XQ, aptX-HD nor FastStream. Both libsbc and libopenaptx libraries are required to have improved bluetooth codec quality.<p>Without them quality would stay low as it is without my patches. As pulseaudio maintainers stated in this and other discussion, including todays dicussion on IRC that they will do replacement, there is absolutely no reason to merge this pull request, which the only purpose is to improve bluetooth quality... as quality would be again decreased by usage of other unsuitable library.<p>Game is over. I&#x27;m closing this pull request now.<p>Blame namely @arun who from begining (see first comments) is working on decreasing quality by replacing codecs by gstreamer and @igor.v.kovalenko who today after IRC dicussion forced me to this thing and explained it by that linux distributions are not going to compile&#x2F;whitelist libsbc and libopenaptx libraties like Ubuntu...<p>Good bye. It is pity that I have not do this thing year ago and I spent time on this, now useless project.<p>EDIT: Do not expect any bluetooth improvemnt in pulseaudio project. Maintainers are doing obstructions for 2 years to prevent merging this pull request in any form and rejected any other compromise or fixes which were proposed here in this pull request.<p>I get lot of emails from you &quot;users&quot; that you want better bluetooth audio quality. But I was not able to do anything for 2 years, you have to blame pulseaudio maintainers. Some of you sent me information that they are paid by either Red Hat or Microsoft&#x2F;Apple to ensure that bluetooth quality would be catastrophic. I do not want to believe to these conspiration theories but reality is simple: Maintainers are doing everything to not improve quality -- either by blocking merging this pull request for 2 years (see that first version of patches were created prior gitlab existed and were only on mailing list) or forcing to use ffmpeg&#x2F;gstreamer which does not support none of codecs in this pull request. And they do not want to change their mind or fundamentally did not understood this issue.<p>(PS: Reason for existance of LDAC, aptX and other proprietary codecs in bluetooth headsets is just because of poor implementation of SBC codec in systems)<p>So if you are asking, what to do: switch to other operating system. As you can see maintainers really do not want any improvement in Linux pulseaudio. I cannot help more<p>I would not reply to any other user comments, please send them to pulseaudio maintainers.“')
