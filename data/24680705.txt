The differences could be societal, cultural or biological. For example, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s contested that at least some women pick some career choices due to the want to have&#x2F;raise children. People could argue indefinitely as to exactly how much influence each factor plays, but to call &#x27;sexism&#x27; simply because there are gender differences seems incorrect.')
