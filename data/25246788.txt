Just ordered physical book on Amazon.<p>I’d like to share a tangential thought in case others have noticed the same. One thing I’ve found odd with the CIA and “Intelligence” community is they seem to use the terms “Information” and “Intelligence” interchangeably. Labeling their Information as Intelligence, I would think introduces cognitive bias. Perhaps Authority Bias or another.<p>Going with the DIKW paradigm:<p>- Data<p>- Information (The symbols and words we assign to the Data)<p>- Knowledge (Which I’ll define as a storage of Information with Metainformation attached to it. Kind of like a computer filesystem. The actual file is Information and has Metainfo like Source, Timestamp, filetype, and other contextual properties which is useful for processing and thinking about during decision-making.<p>- Wisdom (Which I’ll defined as the process of consciously running Knowledge through your Mind and Emotions and Third-party Cognitive Fallacy Checklists) and then drawing a Conclusion.<p>When they say “Intelligence-gathering”, really they mean “Information-gathering.”<p>Long story, short: if I ran the CIA, I’d change the name to “Central Information Processing Agency”')
