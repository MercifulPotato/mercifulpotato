And that&#x27;s clear censorship.<p>What you describe is far more murky territory.<p>If I build a public database which curates newspapers in my local region and I decide to not include a particular outlet, am I engaging in censorship? Not really. As a private actor, it&#x27;s my prerogative to curate by my own standards. Moreover, one can always go to the library and find that journal in their holdings.<p>The same principle is true at the scale of search engines. These aren&#x27;t public institutions. These are private enterprises. They are free to curate content in their own particular fashion. And if one doesn&#x27;t include your website, well, others might and will.<p>The issue here isn&#x27;t that Google doesn&#x27;t show the website in the search results.<p>The issue is that Google dominates the search market, and has locked the attention the usage and the vast majority of people using the Web&#x2F;Internet.<p>That&#x27;s a different issue which has less to do with censorship, and everything with being able to establish and hold a monopoly in a particular yet massively important market - information dissemination and communications - for almost 2 decades.<p>Ask yourself this: Would you or the author of that tweet have made the same loud objection if a website didn&#x27;t appear in DuckDuckGo?')
