We don&#x27;t have enough (read: any) data on hiring practices and resume review in Europe, Middle east, Africa or Asia. We really don&#x27;t want to do any harm, so we are not yet able to offer our services there.<p>If you&#x27;re based outside of US &amp; Canada, but work remote for US or Canada office of a company, feel free to sign up.  But if you&#x27;re based outside of US&#x2F;Canada and plan to work outside US&#x2F;Canada, then we are not yet competent to handle your resume well.<p>Give us some time! :)')
