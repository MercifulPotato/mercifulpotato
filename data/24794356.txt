Not all. That is my point. I live in a community that the police absolutely have no interest in protecting. We are a problem to be dealt with, not a community to protect.<p>Not everyone has that experience, I understand that. But police are, by virtue of who pulls the purse strings, an extension of the power of government.<p>I never said all police don&#x27;t care about protecting you. I said they absolutely care about protecting you, as long as your wants align with the needs of the state.')
