Seatbelts were important in case of accident, but not needed in regular traffic. Traffic and cars are very different today, everything is faster and jittery.\nNowadays, my experience is that seatbelts are needed always - they are securing kids even in regular traffic. And without proper car seat, seatbelt does not fit and function properly.')
