Item(by='gsnedders', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604703456, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25004519, text='&gt; The two-axle Volvo truck is comparable to a Freightliner M2 106, a straight-truck, not a package car. And the Volvo truck has a maximum GVWR of 16 tonnes, the final configuration would be lower, and you could operate it without a CDL. The poster is correct about licensing requirements. I do not have a CDL, but I can drive the straight trucks and package cars because they are under the 26,000lbs GVWR limit in my state.<p>Note that within the EU, in general &quot;large goods vehicle&quot; licenses cover everything over 3.5 tonnes, so these Volvo trucks are _well_ into that category. Package delivery companies avoid such large vehicles for last-mile deliveries.<p>But yes, two-axle trucks like what Volvo is proposing do of course see heavy usage for deliveries in commercial&#x2F;industrial settings. Most smaller supermarkets are supplied by such trucks, for example, especially within cities (where loading bays are rare).')
