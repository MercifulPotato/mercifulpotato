In Azure you write their equivalent function and one of the built-in trigger options is HTTP, you enable that and immediately get a URL. Lambdas are quite close to that now I think if you&#x27;re using the console UI, but you used to have to go through API gateway and set everything up manually.<p>But the point is that Lambdas aren&#x27;t HTTP APIs that listen on a single port. They receive events that can be proxied HTTP requests via API Gateway, or messages on queues, or completely arbitrary invocations from step functions, or notifications that look nothing like HTTP from S3 buckets. I&#x27;d like the Cloud Run model when my lambda is acting like an HTTP API, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be much fun to have to treat every AWS event as a full HTTP request for everything else.<p>I&#x27;m not very familiar with Google Cloud, but I think their equivalent is Cloud Functions which looks very similar to Lambda&#x27;s pre-container model: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;functions&#x2F;docs&#x2F;writing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;functions&#x2F;docs&#x2F;writing</a>')
