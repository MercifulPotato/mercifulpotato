But on the other, 99% of users have no need for, or cannot be trusted with that freedom.<p>I mean I&#x27;ve worked with Windows for multiple generations of the operating system, and once the internet became a thing it was just complete shit. I had a side job fixing computers for people, and it was always adware, viruses, etc messing things up.<p>That was caused by an insecure operating system on the one hand - which can and has been fixed by core operating system mechanics - but a big factor was both freedom and lack of expertise from users. They&#x27;re easily tempted by e.g. &quot;install this browser bar for dank discounts&quot; without understanding the consequences. They may not even really register what&#x27;s going on because so much is going on.<p>99% of users need to be protected from themselves. And developers need to work with that.<p>Apple has already proven how a closed ecosystem is ultimately beneficial for the consumer - how many security incidents has the iphone had, ever? I can&#x27;t think of ANY to be honest, outside of the odd scummy app slipping through that is a bit too liberal with user&#x27;s data. But they have never compromised a user&#x27;s system. Mobile banking apps became a thing while I was an app developer, and that would never have flown on an unconstrained system. Pretty sure they had a lot more trouble with the Android version as well in that regard.<p>Tl;dr, 99% of users will never know any better and will not care, they just want to hit install and for things to Just Work.')
