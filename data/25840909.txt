I&#x27;m doing research and a full-time student. Essentially I&#x27;m like a grad student + 50% Dad. If I were working one of my old dev jobs, I&#x27;d probably hate the lack of work&#x2F;life separation. Also synchronous schooling for the kids is much easier on me than the old asynchronous schooling. They just disappear into their room and pop out for recess and lunch, instead of me having to cut&#x2F;paste&#x2F;spend hours with them on BS make work.<p>EDIT&gt; Kids are 7 and 12. If they were pre-schoolers ... <i>shudder</i> ... it&#x27;s hell.')
