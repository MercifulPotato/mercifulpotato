There is a heater duct opening behind it.  At the top of that cavity is a 4&quot; elbow turning up, a temp controlled fan an a pipe up through the ceiling and into the attic.  Open end has screen to keep any rodents out.  Door has a small vent to let air in. Works well, I don&#x27;t hear the noise unless I&#x27;m right next to the door.  Closet also has the wifi and other stuff in it.')
