Item(by='2bluesc', descendants=None, kids=[25674230, 25673916], score=None, time=1610039773, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25672871, text='Another vote for Kraken.<p>I discovered <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptowat.ch" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptowat.ch</a> and thought it was the most polished and feature rich trading UI I had seen for crypto. I later learned this is a Kraken project that works with any exchanges and that they use mostly the same UI for their trade UI.  After poking around the UI I was convinced they cared about UI&#x2F;UX and their fees seemed better and I made the jump.  Haven&#x27;t looked back to Coinbase since.')
