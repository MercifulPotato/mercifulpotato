Item(by='curryst', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611867201, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25945371, text='&gt; This whole problem is actually to do with what the public wants. Designers are delivering exactly what they want. And customers are ruined by conditioning from marketing that &quot;touchscreens are better! who wants those stupid buttons and dials&quot;, bean counters are getting their bonuses because they just replaced expensive buttons&#x2F;dials (with automotive reliability ratings) with a $13 touchscreen a bunch of software to control stuff. So, we&#x27;re never going to get out of this.<p>The problem is that it&#x27;s one of those things where it&#x27;s best to be a thief among honest people.  People want to drive cool cars, regardless of safety.  However, they do not want other people driving unsafe things to crash into them.<p>So we end up in this weird situation where consumers are demanding the exact same things they want safety boards to ban.  Some people want these new Knight Rider steering wheels, but they don&#x27;t want people using drag tires on the road.  The people that want to use drag tires on the road don&#x27;t want people to have the Knight Rider steering wheels.  So we end up with demand for both, and safety commissions trying to ban both.')
