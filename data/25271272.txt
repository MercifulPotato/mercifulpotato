Item(by='dheera', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606864127, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25267847, text='Generally I give and enjoy receiving edible gifts. They don&#x27;t take up space, they don&#x27;t end up stashed away for years, they don&#x27;t clash with my artistic side, and it&#x27;s much harder to go wrong. Tea leaves, desserts, those sorts of things are all good gifts IMO. Homemade edibles, even better, even if it&#x27;s not perfect I value homemade things and as a friend I very much value the fact that you tried.<p>What I really hate (inside) is when people try to buy things related to my interests and hobbies, including electronics and outdoor gear. I&#x27;m most picky about those things and there are very specific things I look for in hobby gear that most people outside the hobby wouldn&#x27;t understand. Also I don&#x27;t like when people buy household things like silverware and decorations. I have matching sets of those things and if the &quot;intruding&quot; gift doesn&#x27;t match it will basically sit in a box and never get used.')
