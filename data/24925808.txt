If you invest $400 in the market it should pay out about that much, so you could make it a one-time payment of $400 for a 5G chip.<p>Consumer network connections, of any kind I&#x27;m aware of, don&#x27;t go down to $1 per month. Maybe with a big volume order and a low bandwidth cap the cell companies would do it, or maybe 5G itself is just cheaper, but where does that monthly cost come from?')
