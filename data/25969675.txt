I&#x27;m reluctant to order from other sites because there&#x27;s a whole new set of dark patterns I may fall victim to. At least I&#x27;m familiar enough with Amazon to know I&#x27;m not getting charged for things I didn&#x27;t intend to order, the low stock warnings are somewhat legitimate, etc. I&#x27;m not saying Amazon doesn&#x27;t have its own issues, but at least it&#x27;s a known quantity.<p>If it weren&#x27;t for Amazon&#x27;s dominance, other sites would be able to compete without resorting to these dark patterns, so this is a self-perpetuating cycle: people only shop on Amazon -&gt; the only other sites that can survive are the ones that engage in deception -&gt; trust in non-Amazon shopping sites decreases -&gt; people only shop on Amazon -&gt; ...<p>I don&#x27;t mean to cast these scammy shopping websites as victims. My concern is more about how the legitimate sites that could exist don&#x27;t because they&#x27;re crowded out by Amazon (and other big players like Walmart) and the scammy shopping sites this article discusses.')
