And he was spot on. I’m a young engineer in my 20s and if I don’t get in-person training soon (I started over a year ago and haven’t gotten any since we’ve been remote the entire time), I’m going to quit and go elsewhere. This is in spite of working in the best team of engineers in my city, working on an awesome problem. But I can’t sacrifice my career for their desire to work from home.')
