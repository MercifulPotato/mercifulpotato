It&#x27;s mostly a matter of throwing enough money at optimized infrastructure.<p>However, replicating the search quality stack is going to be very hard, unless someone makes a huge breakthrough in machine learning &#x2F; language modeling &#x2F; language understanding at a thousandth of the cost it currently takes to run something like GPT-3.<p>The most likely candidate to execute properly on that last bit is - unfortunately - Google.')
