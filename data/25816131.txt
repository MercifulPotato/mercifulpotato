It&#x27;s enough to have photosynthesis producing free oxygen.  That produces an energy store at the water-air interface.  That would lead to life forms evolving to take advantage of the benefit of living at that boundary and that would eventually lead to the formation of biological rather than geological land masses.<p>Hm, sounds like a good premise for a SciFi novel.  :-)')
