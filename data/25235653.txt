Nevertheless, there are reports from programmers and video editors that suggest that the 16 GB on M1 go a lot further than 16 GB on Intel. No hard technical reasons on why that would be.<p>(Also, anecdotally, I don&#x27;t understand why HN keeps saying 16GB of RAM isn&#x27;t a lot. I just upgraded my home desktop to 16 GB, and only because I also upgraded my screen from 1080 to 1440, and videogames were dipping below 60fps. Sure, at work my desktop has much more RAM, but for a laptop? 16 GB seems fine.)<p>On GPU: There&#x27;s been some speculation that the eGPU&#x27;s don&#x27;t work due to driver support, not hardware issues. Once again, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the higher end chips in 2021 have a dedicated GPU inside the Pro and Mini.<p>On real world workloads: See the above about anecdotes about programmers and video editors. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any great sources here besides reading twitter and trying to avoid biased fanboys.<p>I&#x27;m waiting for more of the languages and tools I use to become fully supported on the M1 before I bite the bullet, but I&#x27;m finding fewer and fewer reasons to be skeptical of the performance numbers...')
