They&#x27;re no longer testing contacts of people with COVID, they&#x27;re testing people with symptoms. The positive rate went from 8% -&gt; 40% in that time.<p>Anecdotally, I had no 1st order contacts with Covid (i.e., I know them well, rather than my sister&#x27;s friend sort of thing), and over Christmas that went to more like 5 in three separate clusters.')
