Biden just raised and spent $1 billion on the 2020 campaign, but you won&#x27;t see The Guardian claiming Biden &quot;bought the election&quot;.<p>Yet if ridesharing companies spend money to advertise their position that, if the new ride-sharing rules were upheld, they would be forced to leave California, depriving thousands of people of work, that&#x27;s somehow &quot;buying a law&quot;?<p>It was a referendum. People voted. The facts were on the side of Uber and Lyft, and they were able to persuade the public to see that.<p>The law was being pushed knowing full well that it would have killed Uber and Lyft. It was strongly supported by the unions who see Uber and Lyft as an existential threat. The unions can&#x27;t compete with them, so they tried using the politicians they&#x27;ve bought to effectively outlaw them. Fortunately, it didn&#x27;t work.<p>Uber and Lyft provide a service millions of people voluntarily use, with drivers who voluntarily chose to work. That&#x27;s how our society should work. Government shouldn&#x27;t be interfering with voluntary transactions.')
