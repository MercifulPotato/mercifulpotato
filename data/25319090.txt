To get the context (how ideas evolved over time) you need to learn a bit about the history of philosophy.<p>On the other hand reading original sources gives you more than a summary. The way of thinking leading to the idea or the way the idea is presented is often more interesting than the idea itself.<p>Take Platon for example. The way he teaches his ideas in dialogue form is very pedagogical. It is even used in psychology [0].<p>An other example is Freud. He uses a very genius style of logical reasoning. Reading a summary of his ideas doesn&#x27;t help you because you&#x27;ll probably not understand it (and think it&#x27;s nonsense) and sometimes he is just wrong (e.g. homosexuality is mental illness).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Socratic_questioning#Psychology" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Socratic_questioning#Psycholog...</a>')
