Tether &quot;breaks the buck&quot; (price goes under $1.00), and on USDT exchanges there&#x27;s a spike in all other cryptos as people buy anything and everything to get rid of it.  On exchanges with actual fiat, people get spooked and start selling crypto for fiat, spooking more people into selling and triggering a market crash.<p>This, incidentally, is pretty much what happened when Mt Gox disclosed that they were backed by hot air because they had most of their reserves stolen.')
