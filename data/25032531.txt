So carry look ahead seemed like something we could integrate and have fairly low real estate overhead and, as you see, the whole carry look ahead is just a very small portion of the chip.&quot;</i><p>This is a very strange remark. Setting aside whether Feeney actually did design it, that look-ahead carry takes up a huge area of the chip -- almost as much as the whole rest of the ALU.<p>If they had cared about speed, they would not have shoehorned it into 18 pins.<p>According to Federico Faggin (Italian: &quot;Fah-jeen&quot;), Intel considered itself a memory company, and the 8008 project a waste of attention. They weren&#x27;t about to set up 40-pin infrastructure for a nothing part like that when no memory chip would ever need 40 pins.')
