The democratically-elected Nazis formed a coalition government with the democratically-elected German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP); it was this coalition government which was approved by the democratically-elected Hindenberg.  The Enabling Act was also first passed by the democratically-elected Reichstag.<p>So yes, Hindenberg failed to fulfill his role as the &quot;check and balance&quot; against the rise of someone like Hitler; but it&#x27;s not like what he was doing was strange or unusual.')
