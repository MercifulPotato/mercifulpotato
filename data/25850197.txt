I’m not an audiophile by any means, and I didn’t know it was possible for audio to sound this good. These are a quantum leap better than the Bose and Sony headphones ANC headphones I’ve owned, on a sound quality, aesthetic, and functional level. The noise cancellation was a little questionable at first, but it seems to have improved somewhat (firmware update?), although I was hoping for more. My biggest complaint is I wish they were lighter, and gripped my head better. I’ve had them nearly slide off my head when I leaned my head back to drink.<p>I found the ifixit teardown interesting. I wonder if the “open” case is a nod to the fact these are made incredibly sturdy and only the inside of the cups need protection. Still, I would prefer if they were completely encased.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ifixit.com&#x2F;Teardown&#x2F;AirPods+Max+Teardown&#x2F;139369" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ifixit.com&#x2F;Teardown&#x2F;AirPods+Max+Teardown&#x2F;139369</a><p>“With all their intricate, precision-engineered parts, AirPods Max remind us more of a mechanical watch than of any pair of headphones.”')
