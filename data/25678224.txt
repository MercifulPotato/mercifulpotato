Item(by='bichiliad', descendants=None, kids=[25679525, 25678465], score=None, time=1610057025, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25674964, text='A while ago, I had a landlord who withdrew rent directly from my bank account[1] and who kept charging me rent after I had left. They also refused to return the money to me and insisted I file an ACH dispute through my bank, Simple. I was responsible for rent for me and my roomate, so being double charged rent for a month meant I was suddenly short two peoples&#x27; worth of rent.<p>Simple was super, super good about the whole thing. They gave me an interest-free loan for the whole amount and told me that if the dispute was successful (which it was), I&#x27;d just get to keep the loan. They also put an ACH block[2] on my account, and generally were super responsive in support.<p>Simple wasn&#x27;t great for a lot of stuff you could expect from normal banks, like writing checks (for a while, you couldn&#x27;t get a checkbook from them), cashier&#x27;s checks, and money orders, but for everything else, they worked really well. I&#x27;m kinda sad to see them go.<p>[1]: I now know this is a bad idea. Always use a 3rd party or pay manually!\n[2]: ACH blocks are weak, but they&#x27;re the only sort of protection against malicious actors like this. They prevent a specific amount of money from being withdrawn from a specific party, but there&#x27;s no way to, say, block all withdrawal attempts from a party.')
