According to Wikipedia one Russian ISP and China has already blocked ESNI&#x27;ed connections, which is probably a good sign that it&#x27;s doing something.<p>But still, it feels like such a hack throwing this into the DNS records. A mess for server operators to implement if you don&#x27;t manage your DNS records via an API today (since they&#x27;ll need to be changed when certs rotate). And I&#x27;m guessing that a wast majority of people use the ISP default DNS (or Google&#x2F;Cloudflare), that brings plenty of privacy problems on its own...<p>Maybe ESNI&#x2F;ECO is really worth the hassle in a future where the whole Oblivious DNS-thing[0] is widely spread.<p>[0] Someone like Apple would proxy your encrypted (DoH) DNS requests to Cloudflare, so neither Cloudflare nor Apple can see what a specific user is querying')
