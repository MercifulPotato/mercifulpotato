Social media is not just a few popular sites.  It is the entirety of the internet.  You get rid of the &quot;social media&quot; sites and people will still connect.  Crap will still flow.  You&#x27;ll obviously see a temporary drop until people adjust and reconnect.  The internet is about connecting people and making the exchange of information easier.  You cannot get rid of &quot;social media&quot; without getting rid of the internet.')
