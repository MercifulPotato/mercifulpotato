I liken it to multiple layers of security. Almost no single layer is 100%, so you stack. In covids case, masks, distancing, and hygiene are the layers. None are 100% on their own (unless you live alone and have zero interaction), but taken together on a population level they can work to lower R0 below 1.<p>Side note, I recently read a good book that addressed why people have such a hard time with percentages. People tend to take numbers like 20% and think 0 and 80% and think certainty.')
