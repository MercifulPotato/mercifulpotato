It should come as a great compliment and testament to their efforts that many Australian ISPs took the unprecedented action of blocking access to Voat some time ago - a line in the sand was crossed that day, and it made me ever more aware of the need for free speech platforms, my appreciation of Voat, and the hostility of power to curiosity.<p>Any platform that does not aggressively censor disallowed facts and opinions will tend right. Voat was a home for us who refused to switch off and participate in the degrading, mind-numbing, false and deceptive consensus of modern progressive propaganda that proliferates on all mainstream services - all heavily censored.<p>Time for a new home.')
