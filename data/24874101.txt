Our org was big enough that people would be working on pages without context for the bigger design themes (especially related to sales&#x2F;marketing). We required any UI variations to be added to the style guide, and we required a minor justification to add styles. This added just enough friction that a lot of the unintended variation went away, and a lot of the variation just to be different  became explicit so discussions about the design could be more deliberate.')
