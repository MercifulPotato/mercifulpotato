They need the business, and verifying would require actual effort, possibly even investigation. At least I suppose that&#x27;s how it goes.<p>That&#x27;s why I trust very little of what is written about, e.g., North Korea: it doesn&#x27;t mean that everything that sucks and supposedly happened there is true just because the system there indeed sucks. I think everybody is maybe predisposed to believe whatever they read about a topic they don&#x27;t know about themselves as long as it fits in their worldview, so journalists get a free pass doing less checking than Wikipedia editors as long as the &quot;news&quot; is believable.')
