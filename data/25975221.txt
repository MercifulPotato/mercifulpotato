All those reforms are targeted at specific community to promote a narrative which follows dictatorial style to follow a specific Hindu way of living (inspired by Nazi, supremacy of Aryans).<p>India is in a downward spiral on every measure which matters like mal-nourishment, infant mortality , poverty (i.e. HDI), education, economic development, healthcare even before COVID-19. This is made worse by the pandemic. This is not somewhere in between enough research and UN data is available to verify it. Neighbouring countries of India did much better in many parameters.<p>Current protests of farmers are a result of disrespecting India’s diversity and consensus based approach. If you look at the actual text of the reforms there are two sides and government should have put this text for consultations and than accommodated the changes. They didn’t go through the process, just diluted it and rammed through the reforms taking advantage of pandemic lockdowns.<p>You can read many accounts how constitutional safeguards were diluted or twisted to pass many so called reforms, this is the reason of widespread prolonged outrage. There might be some vested interest trying to take advantage of this, but that’s due to authoritarian non-consensus based approach.')
