They could use one to see family during the holidays, they could go to a protest, go to a wedding, celebrate in the street, go to a movie, etc.<p>We could even track them as discrete tokens, or &quot;social credits&quot; using blockchain technology. This would allow contact tracing software to be able to determine the &quot;cost&quot; of an event based on how many people were exposed and then withdraw the appropriate number of credits from the participants.<p>In a system like this, people who don&#x27;t go anywhere or see anyone would be able to redeem their excess social credits for things XBoxes or VR headsets.')
