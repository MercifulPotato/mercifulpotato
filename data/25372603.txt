But you&#x27;re not even connecting from a web origin but from localhost and you&#x27;re trying to defend from <i>all</i> access except by your frontends. For this, you need a shared secret between the server and the frontend.<p>A further limitation of CORS is that certain requests are allowed even if they are not from an allowed origin.<p>To conclude, you definitely need a secret.')
