Over the years we’ve tried almost every form of transportation: train, renting a car, flying, dirt cheap buses, very fancy buses.<p>Bang for the buck, I’d say our preference became car, train, fancy bus, flying, bad bus.<p>They all pretty much take the same time, door to door, because the airports are not particularly accessible from our starting point and destination.<p>The key factors were autonomy and punctuality. If the train or bus hit traffic or broke down, you were totally screwed. Sometimes for hours. If the car hit traffic, we stopped for dinner. The plane is the most expensive, and provides some of the worst experiences of the three. They were rarely late, but really made you suffer for the price.<p>I never thought I’d become a car person, and yet here I am!')
