The UK would no longer have to support that deficit and they wouldn&#x27;t have to provide services to 5 million Scottish people.<p>The loss of the HMNB Clyde (the Trident base) poses problems, but not insurmountable ones. Devonport in Plymouth and Miford Haven (more problematically) are suitable replacements. Also, Trident provides about 8,000 jobs to the Scottish economy, and they&#x27;d all move south too.')
