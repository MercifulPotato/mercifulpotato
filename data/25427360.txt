Assumed I was not musical. Until picking up a banjo about 7 years ago.<p>Some music is about performance, but that requires a level of dedication I don&#x27;t have.

There are lots of music genres that seem to focus more on fun than grind. Classical violin probably isn&#x27;t one of them. Old-time fiddle on the other hand...')
