Within somewhat recent history, humans ate diets composed almost entirely of potatoes...it did not kill people in large numbers.<p>Obesity in the case of countries like the US is largely due to an excess of calories...maybe other stuff is bad for you but the evidence for that is kind of hard to demonstrate when there is so much obesity.
