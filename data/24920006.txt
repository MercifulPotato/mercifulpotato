Local papers have always functioned as a sort of news aggregator. They aggregate local news together with national news and serve you that as a sort of localized feed of information. It&#x27;s similar to Reddit; the NYT and national news are like &#x2F;r&#x2F;worldnews (purely in topic, not content) and local papers are like your city&#x27;s subreddit. Letters to the Editor are like comments.<p>Theyre actually so similar that Reddit et al are killing them. Reddit even often has local reporting from Redditors; I find out about lots of happenings directly from Redditors.<p>I think national news will likely survive in some form because of the investigation required (and the legitimacy granted by an organization like the NYT reporting on it), but local papers are going to go the way of the pay phone.')
