Item(by='dragontamer', descendants=None, kids=[25688566], score=None, time=1610132132, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25688401, text='&quot;Censorship&quot; seems to work pretty well around here in HackerNews.<p>When someone&#x27;s opinion becomes violent or unhelpful, the mods around here will delete their post, curtailing discussion and making this area more reasonable for overall discourse to move forward.<p>There are unreasonable opinions and unreasonable people out there. The only possible weapon online groups have to combat unreasonable people in a discussion forum, is censorship.<p>-------<p>But sure, feel free to use the decades old arguments of &quot;unmoderated speech&quot; from the days of USENET. Some of us have been around long enough to see this argument style play out over-and-over again.<p>Again-and-again, the only USEFUL discussion forums are those who are run by good moderators. &quot;Censoring&quot; Spam, pornography, doxxing and yes, censoring calls to overt violence in the real world, is incredibly important to keep online discussions safe.<p>Cutting out hateful groups is _effective_. Its the weapon of last resort, but given what we&#x27;ve seen this past week, it is a well warranted move. It is no different than a moderator coming around here to delete spam.')
