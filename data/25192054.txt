But what your breasts look like when you are naked is really not important to your social life per se.<p>Someone I knew who chose to not have reconstructive surgery after a mastectomy once said about a mutual acquaintance who had a lot of cosmetic surgery for various reasons &quot;She is covered in scars and only looks good in her clothes.&quot; The unstated subtext there being &quot;I also look good in my clothes, even though I only have one breast.&quot;<p>If your life partner is okay with it and you are okay with it, the rest of the world can butt out.

There are men who like it like that and I have been fortunate to know such men.<p>At the time, I was getting a lot of ugly feedback from &quot;random internet strangers&quot; about how desperately important it is for a woman to be thin.<p>That experience informs my opinion that &quot;What random internet strangers think about your naked body is of little consequence compared to actual intimate partners in your life.&quot;<p>FWIW and all that.')
