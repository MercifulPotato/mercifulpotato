That is, phone companies are not required to censor hate speech, and ISPs are not required to censor unlawful content that passes their pipes, because they are just, well, pipe, oblivious of the bytes they pass.<p>Platforms are in the business of making content <i>available</i>, so they are forced to control the availability, and censor unlawful content. They choose to censor any &quot;objectionable content&quot; along the way, without waiting for PR attacks or lawsuits. I can understand that.<p>(What is harder for me to understand is when these same platforms extoll the freedom of expression. I&#x27;d like them be more honest.)')
