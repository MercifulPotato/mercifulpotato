One non-Google player I know is seriously concerned about what the cookie-less web means or online ads. Essentially the entire online advertising industry, both publishers and advertisers, is built on 3rd-party cookies.<p>The goal: to show you only ads for things you care about and are likely to buy and be influenced by advertising for, is good. But the reality is a mess.<p>Some of the downsides of Google&#x27;s proposal are obvious, given its position, but there&#x27;s at least one downside that users might notice: lots more ads targeted only by the demographic of the publication, making the web look more like print media or TV and presenting you and me with a lot more space on our screens wasted showing ads for things you don&#x27;t care about.<p>As for the &quot;fingerprinting&quot; proposals? Bad. Very Bad. Think digital &quot;facial&quot; recognition bad.')
