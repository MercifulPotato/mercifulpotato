Yes, historically, implemented to the scale of governments, this has caused many wars, much bloodshed, countless millions of lives lost, etc., etc.<p>But the central idea (although poorly implemented historically by governments) was that of sharing, helping others, etc., etc.<p>If you truly cannot see this central idea present, then I cannot help you.<p><i>But you post your very message on an Internet whose totality was half-created by this idea...</i>')
