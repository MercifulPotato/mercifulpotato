The cost of labour is actually generally agreed to be the replacement cost of the labour.<p>As a society, the only thing that we take out of Zuckerberg is his labour, so he shouldn&#x27;t get anymore than the replacement cost of his labour. In other words, if someone would have done Zuckerberg&#x27;s work for less compensation - and the GP asserts it is the case - then we as a society lose by having Zuckerberg do it instead of the lower compensated alternative.<p>In other words, when someone gets paid more than their replacement cost, there is a market inefficiency that causes loss to the vast majority.')
