M1&#x27;s definition:\n&quot;M1 includes funds that are readily accessible for spending. M1 consists of: (1) currency outside the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve Banks, and the vaults of depository institutions; (2) traveler&#x27;s checks of nonbank issuers; (3) demand deposits; and (4) other checkable deposits (OCDs), which consist primarily of negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts at depository institutions and credit union share draft accounts. Seasonally adjusted M1 is calculated by summing currency, traveler&#x27;s checks, demand deposits, and OCDs, each seasonally adjusted separately.<p>I agree with this line of argument for the 2008 era  quantitative easing! But my read is that M1 explicitly excludes bank reserves, so the M1 created can&#x27;t be locked-up reserves, right?')
