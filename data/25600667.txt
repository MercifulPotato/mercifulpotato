I&#x27;ve been hacking on Music Thing Modular Chord Organs for some time: they are a little Eurorack oscillator that can play chords, based on a Teensy. The Teensy audio library determines what waves you can get, and there&#x27;s a 12 bit DAC built in.<p>You can specify the sampling rate of the Teensy with a bit of fiddling, and the limits depend on what you&#x27;re asking the audio library to do. The stock Chord Organ&#x27;s set up to run at 44.1k, using a couple of submixes in the library to do things like set waveform levels independently.<p>You can also set an oscillator to drive the output pin directly, with just one waveform.<p>I&#x27;ve got a couple of &#x27;em running at 2,822,400hz instead of 44,100hz. That&#x27;s 2,822k for one oscillator (I can get four running at 768k), by telling the Teensy its sample rate is something hilariously high, just to run some square and 12-bit triangle and sawtooth waves.<p>I avoid aliasing pretty well :) and it&#x27;s definitely a fully digital DAC output. It&#x27;s just good at being free from aliasing because I&#x27;m not concerned about what the sampling rate &#x27;means&#x27; in terms of &#x27;usable notes&#x27;. The only thing I care about is getting my waves nicer. The Teensy also has a rectangular wave, which is PWM adjustable. That, at 2,822k or even 768k, is quite nice even when it&#x27;s a really thin pulseâ€¦<p>And of course you could use the square to drive an integrator :)')
