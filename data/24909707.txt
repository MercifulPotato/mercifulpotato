And even in cases where you have a lot of IO - a decent NVMe SSD can do several 100k IOPS (with some doing more than 1M IOPS), with per IO latencies in the mid two digit microsecond range.<p>And because common queries can be processed within fractions of a millisecond, often 500 busy connections can be handled by a few cores.')
