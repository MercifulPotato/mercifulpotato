Not doing so is just lazy and frankly, I sense it&#x27;s a masturbatory habit of a lot of brilliant people, capable of incredible engineering. It&#x27;s more FUN to dream about what could be engineered than to do engineering of something.<p>Edit: perhaps it&#x27;s not lazy if they don&#x27;t realize they&#x27;re doing it. I didn&#x27;t account for that. Either way, timeline budgeting eliminates many categories of excuses.')
