Here are my no bullshit questions:<p>Has the team ever produced a product without Angular, React, or similar MV*?<p>Does the team find state management challenging?<p>Do you conduct end to end test automation, including DOM interaction in the browser?<p>How many dependencies does your team require, ballpark, to perform basic simple automation on the terminal with Node (simple count of packages in the flattened node_modules folder)?<p>How up to date is your internal documentation?<p>What is the average timeframe for the team to move from receipt of business requirements to business approval of the completed work?<p>Are the business requirements design by committee or is there a single bus driver?<p>Which is a higher priority for the team: framework choice, available tooling, or accessibility?<p>Is there performance testing of the UI code?<p>By what metric(s), on paper, do you rate developer competence?')
