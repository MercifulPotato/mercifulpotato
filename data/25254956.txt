When I took the one kubernetes certification exam as part of an old job, you used software like this and at one point I leaned too close to the screen and the proctor couldn&#x27;t see my face and that got me flagged.<p>People that want to cheat or game the system will find ways, it isn&#x27;t hard to do. In undergrad we setup a copy of the code checking software that our department used so that we could share code without it getting flagged as copies. I&#x27;m sure there are ways to game these systems too if you are motivated enough.<p>One of the issues is also just academia being so hyper-focused on thinking everyone is there to become an academic which is not the case for the vast majority of people. So these exams and the guidelines for student evaluation is grounded in that expectation instead of the reality.')
