For instance, you can accept that your father was a pirate and a good man or you can’t. But pirate is in your blood, boy, so you’ll have to square with that some day. And me, for example, I can let you drown, but I can’t bring this ship into Tortuga all by me onesies, savvy? So, can you sail under the command of a pirate, or can you not?&quot; (Jack Sparrow)<p>So, the question is what these other guys can do vs what you can do. You probably want to keep track of any correspondence regarding this matter in case legal action becomes an option. I hope no sane board will think that facing legal action is worth any cofounder&#x27;s &quot;wants&quot; and &quot;likes&quot;.')
