I had an issue that the mirrors what was happening on the zxing reviews. I was getting a full page ad every 15 minutes or so after unlocking my phone.<p>The rub? It wasn&#x27;t this app. It was another one that was also called barcode scanner. It was also beginning to garner negative reviews, which the developer (had a Ukranian email address) had begun responding to saying the app was perfectly legal because it was serving ads only inside the app itself.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if that deluge of bad reviews is directed at the wrong app? I&#x27;ll look to see if I can still find the google play page for the one I had.<p>Also, I had that app for a LONG time before it started displaying this kind of behavior just last month, which also corresponds to the bad reviews starting on the zxing app.')
