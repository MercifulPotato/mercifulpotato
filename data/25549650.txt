I disagree with that - I think they do deserve it because it keeps them happier. I find your description of cats (“terrorizing wildlife”, “tearing up my garden”) to be hyperbolic. Domestic cats don’t typically do things like eat through a vegetable garden. As for leash laws - that’s more necessary for dogs because of their potential for aggression and harm to humans. Cats are VERY rarely aggressive, non threatening to almost all humans, and are more likely to run away from humans than say a pit bull.')
