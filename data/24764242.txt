In fact, if you (intend to) form a legal entity and sell your code as a SAAS product, the MIT License is quite likely <i>NOT</i> the license you should choose!<p>I don&#x27;t blame these guys a bit for switching to the AGPL now but I can&#x27;t stress enough that selecting the proper open-source license is an important decision for any &quot;serious&quot; project. Please make sure that you understand exactly what the terms of your chosen license <i>really mean</i> before you decide on it -- and if your stated goal is to &quot;grow a sustainable open-source project&quot;, well, the MIT License (and similar) is almost <i>certainly</i> not the best choice.<p>--<p><i>ETA:</i> Also, props to Plausible for choosing the AGPL as the license going forward. As mentioned, going closed source would have been the &quot;easy choice&quot;. Alternatively, you could have selected something like the &quot;Commons Clause&quot; or one of the other recent &quot;open-source but not actually open-source&quot; licenses. In my opinion, the AGPL was absolutely the best choice. I&#x27;ve never used your product -- or even heard of it before now -- and probably never will but thank you for your contributions to open-source nonetheless!')
