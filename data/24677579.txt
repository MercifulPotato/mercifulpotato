There&#x27;s a short boost in clock speed, after which the processor almost immediately overloads the power delivery and cooling system and clocks down to base clock.<p>This means the laptop feels incredibly quick for launching programs and doing short intensive tasks without turning on the fan because the processor unleashes hidden performance when you do something that you&#x27;d expect to be slow. It looks and feels like magic to people coming from other platforms, which is probably what Apple is going for with their designs.<p>However, this also artificially limits the CPU performance because of aesthetics and form over function. Long-duration workloads like games suffer from substandard processor performance at the cost of the device, which is multiplied by the stupidly high resolution requiring more rendering power. It&#x27;s even worse in bootcamp because Windows can&#x27;t use many of the sensors and power features because of a lack of drivers.<p>Perhaps Apple knows their own chips will net about the same performance as their current limited CPUs for a lower cost and it doesn&#x27;t want to redesign the experience to make effective use of Intel&#x27;s turbo frequencies. Even though AMD is surpassing Intel as we speak, their high-end processors are incredibly fast if you just give them some space. They suck in a lot more power that way, but giving people the option to choose performance over battery life would probably solve a lot of grips for Apple users who only use the laptop at work or at home, near a wall plug where they can recharge whenever.<p>I am really impressed with Apple&#x27;s speakers though, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything that comes close to their laptop speakers.')
