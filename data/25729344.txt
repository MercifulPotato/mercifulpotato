Still against state law either way.<p>If you&#x27;re going to go with the election fraud claim, at least provide evidence rather than just beating around the bush. Also, please cite how &quot;people that would never set foot in a voting place were fine with circling &quot;biden&quot; on a mail in ballot and dropping it back in the mail box&quot; is against state law.<p>&gt;Oh and very few ballots were contested due to signature mismatches. Funny because Obama won his senate seat in the 90&#x27;s by having a team canvas all of his competitors primary ballots and had them whittled down until he was the only one running for the office that year.<p>How is this relevant? Is there a process for invaliding signatures that the republicans haven&#x27;t invoked? Do democrat voters&#x27; signatures get invalidated at a higher rate than republicans? Is the &quot;normal&quot; invalidation rate high enough to surpass biden&#x27;s lead in the key states?')
