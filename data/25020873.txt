Every vote is checked off against the voter registration rolls. The Board of Elections knows when you have voted. You should volunteer for your local board of elections next election. Maybe it will give you more confidence in the system.<p>To vote get excess votes, you have to first commit voter registration fraud or vote for people you know will not vote. And you have to do it in large enough numbers to make a difference. And you have to assume only one party engages in fraud. Also, it’s a felony to commit voter fraud.<p>Voter ID is an attempt to fix a problem that doesn’t exist in the real world. Meanwhile, it suppresses votes.<p>There’s a large amount of “cure” work that’s occurring right now by both parties throughout the country because of votes that weren’t counted due to all sorts of innocuous mistakes people make. It’s thousands of ballots in some places. Meanwhile fraud? There’s no there there.<p>My brother helped to cure ballots in Florida because people forgot a signature. Someone has to go to their house and get them to sign an affidavit that they voted.<p>There’s cure efforts in NC for provisional ballots for things like the DMV failing to forward a registration to the Board of Elections. Or someone who voted in the wrong precinct by accident.<p>These are all valid votes that won’t be counted due to a mistake by the voter unless someone contacts them and helps them to provide the documentation necessary to the BOE to validate their vote.<p>Stop spouting nonsense about fraud and volunteer for your local election board or your party.')
