Postgres is amazing and this area is the one place where eg. MySQL has a clear lead.<p>&gt; Postgres is an open source project. It&#x27;s useful in a lot of cases. It&#x27;s not in some others - partially due to non-fundamental limitations.<p>For me at least, postgres has the problem that it&#x27;s <i>too</i> useful. It has so many clear advantages over the alternatives that it often makes sense to choose postgres over more specialized tools.<p>For example, even if I was primarily storing JSON data, postgres is still a good choice, because it offers better consistency guarantees than most document databases, and has a more powerful query model.<p>The end result is that the few limitations remaining (eg. the connection model) are felt all the more strongly: I cannot simply say &quot;ah I need lots of connections, I&#x27;ll use MySQL here&quot; without also giving up on all sorts of other features that I would normally use. (Although MySQL is still improving)')
