You &quot;don&#x27;t get this market&quot; probably because you haven&#x27;t understood what the companies you&#x27;re applying to are looking for, and you haven&#x27;t understood what they&#x27;re looking for likely because you need to recalibrate your understanding of value delivery and expectations in the industry as opposed to academia.<p>You can contact me (info in bio) in case you want me to look at your CV, want to do a mock job interview or want other sort of feedback.<p>In any case, stay strong!
