The companies selling these obviously say to buy the newest version, but that feels like a waste of resources and money to me. As much as I try voting with my wallet, I think this is getting worse with more &quot;smart&quot; devices, where there is little choice.<p>[0]: I noticed this post is right below a post on a GPS issue concerning a Garmin smartwatch I own [1], that might get this update because a famous blogger posted about it, but not other fixes, like podcasts since Catalina [2]\n[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25620372" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25620372</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.garmin.com&#x2F;apps-software&#x2F;mac-windows-software&#x2F;f&#x2F;garmin-express&#x2F;234966&#x2F;garmin-express-and-mangled-podcasts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.garmin.com&#x2F;apps-software&#x2F;mac-windows-software...</a>\n[3]: I have an iPad 3 lying around, which is mostly useless to my workflow because it doesn&#x27;t sync the Safari bookmarks, can&#x27;t install an alternative browser and doesn&#x27;t include most icloud features. Another example are routers and other consumer networking equipment, that frequently end up not getting updates soon after release.')
