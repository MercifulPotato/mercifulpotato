On-prem Confluence is as good as working in Microsoft Word -- a desktop application experience -- while Cloud is like working in Windows 3.1, with a little hourglass cursor to wait for between every action you take. I&#x27;m glad I never migrated my notes to Confluence.<p>Also, they&#x27;re going to lose secure government contracts with this, because Data Center is way above the size of a project team.')
