I find working from home too lonely, and I detest spending hours of every day on video calls. Of course, I&#x27;m just a single data point, and perhaps not representative, but I&#x27;m also generally <i>less</i> social than other people, so I find it hard to believe there won&#x27;t be a lot of people feeling the same.<p>I&#x27;m sure that there will be a much greater prevalence and acceptable of working from home after the pandemic, but I&#x27;m equally sure that there will be a gradual but significant shift back to large numbers of people working in offices. The only way this won&#x27;t happen is if there genuinely is a major uplift in productivity from remote work, and I&#x27;m incredibly sceptical about that. Self-reported improvements in productivity are worthless, IMO.')
