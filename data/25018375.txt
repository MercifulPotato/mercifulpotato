Implement trade-protectionist tariffs and import restrictions.<p>2. Unionize rural workforces to make the pay and work conditions attractive.<p>3. Offer massive tax incentives to build manufacturing centers in rural states.<p>4. Reinstitute a manufacturing oriented education system that outputs ready-to-work trained trade employees.<p>The parties are too far apart now to be able to put in place something like this.')
