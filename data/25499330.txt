The concept being that for things which are powered from a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, it&#x27;s safe to treat the RAM as storage.<p>Because there&#x27;s absolutely no scenario after launch, in which the constant trickle of wattage flow from the RTG to the onboard DC distribution buses and computers would ever be interrupted.<p>If the power from the RTG were to ever be cut off it would be a catastrophic mission failure anyways, entirely aside from the power to the onboard computing systems being interrupted.')
