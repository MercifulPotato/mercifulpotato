The answer in MS T-SQL is to use a recursive CTE.  It is not a common problem, but it comes up once in a while.  Using a CTE is a better solution than calling an SP recursively because you can only nest 32 calls deep.  In the MS Azure SQL Data Warehouse product you are simply fucked if you need to do recursion.')
