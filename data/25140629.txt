Of course, the idea that the market is &quot;too democratic&quot; is absurd. At least, I haven&#x27;t seen a democratic system where 1% of the population gets 40% of the vote.<p>As long as &quot;willingness to pay&quot; is the market proxy for the utility a consumer gets from a good, the market is not &quot;democratic&quot;.')
