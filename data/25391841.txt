A Texan in Dallas&#x2F;Austin is used to paying $250k for that same house, and has a relatively lower salary to match.<p>The Californians, after years of having higher salary, more savings, and a job that lets them move, goes to Texas and offers $400k for that same house. The Californian thinks it&#x27;s a great deal, because they get the same size house they previously lived in for only half the price! And the seller thinks it&#x27;s great, because he now suddenly gets a huge premium on his previously-valued-at-$250k-house. All of the real estate responds in kind, expecting to get $400k+ from all the Cali transplants. However, the average Texan, who doesn&#x27;t have that high paying salary, gets priced out and can no longer afford a house in their city.<p>This has been happening en masse to the northern suburbs of Dallas, as well as many neighborhoods in Austin. It&#x27;s gentrification, more or less, and it comes with all the same problems.')
