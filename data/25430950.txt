Let&#x27;s not pretend that Apple &#x27;cares&#x27; all of a sudden. They only &#x27;care&#x27; because it&#x27;s a convenient position for them to take. Their business model isn&#x27;t directly tied to the collection of data, which allows them to differentiate themselves from Google and make surgical changes like this. I propose we ask Apple to go further:<p>If Apple really cared, they&#x27;d make IDFA opt-in only. Why are we now applauding the option to disable a feature that the EU deemed illegal from the start? [1]<p>If Apple really cared, they&#x27;d remove Google as the default search engine and forgo the $8-12 billion they make from Google. Then, allow a fair bid for privacy focused search engines (or make their own).
