It doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it will.<p>This is still good news. But it should be put in perspective, this does not automatically translate to &quot;this vaccine will work fine in both young and old&quot;. It just means we can have some higher hopes that it will.<p>Only RCT results of the real infections will show if it really works. (RCT for the vaccine is running and first results are expected soon.)')
