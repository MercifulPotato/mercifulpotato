Things that make it complicated are:<p>- Only executable code should be translated, data shouldn&#x27;t be. Sometimes (like with jump tables) they are ambiguous.<p>- Different CPUs have different memory consistency models for parallel threads, leading to race conditions when translating<p>- Special instruction sets like AVX can be hard to translate<p>- Anything with a JIT compiler (including most web browsers) needs special handling.<p>That said, qemu works for the great majority of emulated &amp; host CPUs.')
