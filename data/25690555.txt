Claiming to secede for a couple of blocks in a neighborhood in Seattle, is incredibly stupid and dangerous.<p>My point here is the scope of things, armed insurrectionists stormed the capitol building. Three pipe bombs were recovered and disarmed. What do you think would have happened if the person who laid the pipe bombs had gotten to Nancy Pelosi? Further the President of the united states was pleased by these actions and told them he loved them. He refused to call the national guard and the department of defense initially refused several requests. Somehow, the VP who doesn&#x27;t have the authority to, called in the  national guard. CHAZ was not supported or incited by Joe Biden. And CHAZ did not threaten our democracy or interrupt the democratic process.')
