They view themselves as the moral owners of that earned private property, and the state as the thug hired by the masses which is attempting literal theft (in the moral, not legal sense) at figurative gunpoint (don&#x27;t obey - go to prison). They view their wealth as the fruits of value adding voluntary exchanges that is theirs and only theirs to reap, distribute, horde, burn, spend, etc.<p>That is the libertarian philosophy that undergirds these kind of actions.')
