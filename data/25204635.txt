It&#x27;s a remote-accessible listening device, controllable by someone who is <i>not</i> you. By any classical definition, this is a spy device...<p>&gt; Yes, the argument that anybody who uses one of these devices has then essentially no right to control or complain about the privacy of them is obviously dumb.<p>Moving goal posts and bordering a straw-man argument by adding the &quot;no right to control&quot; part, but saying it&#x27;s obviously dumb doesn&#x27;t make it so and isn&#x27;t productive conversation.<p>When you buy third-party hardware running third-party software that you cannot audit <i>yourself</i>, there is implicit risk that the device can do nefarious things. I don&#x27;t explicitly believe that Amazon is doing anything malicious, but I also don&#x27;t trust their systems implicitly. One developer with the right access can potentially remote-access any device, anywhere...<p><i>I</i> understand this risk, and I believe you do as well, but I also don&#x27;t go around complaining that this risk exists. This is implicit in purchasing third-party products, which is the underlying point the argument tries to make...')
