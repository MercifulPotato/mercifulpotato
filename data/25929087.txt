Sometimes it&#x27;s the same robocall 3 times a day for a week.<p>Phone companies also reuse numbers, and their lists of active numbers leak now and then, so even if you get a &quot;new&quot; number, you can still get spam. I don&#x27;t know how feasible it is for spammers to wardial every number, but it might be possible.<p>And I think there used to be a bug where certain characters in a text could crash am iPhone, or something to that effect.<p>Apple has spam detection in the Messages app now. If it&#x27;s anything like email, spammers will try anything to bypass it, like replacing characters.<p>So in conclusion, there&#x27;s not much you can do about it until phone companies fix Caller ID.')
