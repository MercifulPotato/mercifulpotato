Item(by='coder543', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605715945, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25138383, text='&gt; I&#x27;m not welcome to buy your app on the App Store though.<p>If I never release it for iOS at all, you&#x27;re also not welcome to buy it through the App Store! See how that works? The developer&#x2F;publisher <i>obviously</i> does get a say in what happens to their app... this is not even slightly shocking. Apple can&#x27;t force me to develop and release an app for the App Store, which is what you seem to be hoping?<p>However, there are many publishers competing for your attention. You <i>have</i> a choice, and many of those developers will always choose to use the App Store, since a lot of users browse the App Store. Users vote with their wallets, and developers who don&#x27;t publish on the App Store would be keenly aware of the uphill battle they might have in convincing users to download their PWA.<p>&gt; It enables <i>publisher</i> choice and creates this loop where publishers who have a customer bases just move to the store with the fewest restrictions and fees. It&#x27;s a race to the bottom where the user loses.<p>Android has supported both sideloading <i>and</i> PWAs with push notifications for many years. Ever notice how the Google Play Store isn&#x27;t a ghost town? Most Android users still only download apps through the Google Play Store. This is fine -- the users have made their choice, and that&#x27;s the important thing.<p>Your doomsday, slippery slope hypothesis of developers vacating the Play Store en masse never occurred on Android. It seems equally unlikely to occur on iOS, unless Apple <i>seriously</i> mismanages their App Store. Still, users and developers should have the <i>choice</i> for meaningful apps to be distributed as PWAs, which essentially requires push notification support.')
