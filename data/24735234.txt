Most of the world by population lives in a country building nuclear power. This claim is throughly divorced from reality.<p>&gt; Yes, you&#x27;ve repeatedly claimed I&#x27;m wrong. You&#x27;re the one who is wrong. Your objections are spurious, as I&#x27;ve repeatedly explained.<p>Yet you neglect to actually point out any such inaccuracies, just insist I&#x27;m wrong without any specific criticism.<p>Meanwhile, I&#x27;ve actually pointed out which of your claims are false: the notion that we can use existing hydrogen infrastructure ignoring the problems of hydrogen corrosion, assuming that underground hydrogen storage is ubiquitous, and trusting highly optimistic claims on the efficiency of electrolysis.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nuclear_power_by_country#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File%3ANuclear_power_station.svg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nuclear_power_by_country#&#x2F;me...</a>')
