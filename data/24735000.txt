Studying such instances and seeing if they have unique characteristics that could be incorporated into a model or practice that is reliable and scalable seems like a fine idea, anyone who undertook that task would have my full support.<p>However, I am interested in the opposite: scenarios where human beings <i>cannot</i> cooperate (reliably, consistently, and at scale), and more fundamentally: <i>where</i> it seems not possible to achieve this cooperation (even though it is in both party&#x27;s best interests), <i>why</i> is it not possible?  Is there an underlying cause, and if so, what is it?<p>I happen to subscribe to the theory that the problem is innate (in some manner),  neurological&#x2F;psychological in nature, and I think there is plenty of evidence to support <i>this type of</i> theory.  As a thought experiment, imagine it like this....let&#x27;s assume that there are certain things that the human mind simply can not do (the reasons are irrelevant for now), certain ideas that the human mind simply will not compute - full stop.<p>Now, imagine if one of these ideas was a pre-requisite for achieving reliable, consistent, at-scale cooperation (perhaps not in all instances, as your example demonstrates, <i>but sometimes&#x2F;often</i>, which seems to be the case).  Also imagine that there is another one of these &quot;neurological cannot do&#x27;s&quot;, and this one just so happens to be a pre-requisite for the cognitive processing required <i>for identifying the first one</i>.  But because CannotDo #2 cannot execute, CannotDo #1 cannot be discovered.<p>If this was the case, you would then have yourself a situation where a fundamentally important problem can be identified, that all&#x2F;most parties support fixing, there appear to be no impassible blocking barriers to fixing it, <i>and yet it cannot ever be achieved</i>.  You are stuck in an unsolvable problem, blocked by something that you cannot see.<p>So now that you have this theory, is it possible to find some real world examples of unusual&#x2F;illogical human behavior that plausibly matches this theory (which would represent a sanity check, not a proof)?')
