We had a big bloated library handling emoji stuff for us in our product [0]. Then one day, someone said that they wanted the comment threads to behave more like Slack - that if only an emoji was typed in a comment (without any additional text), it should appear big, otherwise it should be small. This required detecting when text was only an emoji which required me to learn how the heck this stuff actually worked. Great experience and I&#x27;m forever indebted to emojis.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kitemaker.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kitemaker.co</a>, an awesome new issue tracker with tons of hotkeys (and emojis)')
