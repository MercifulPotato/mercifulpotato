The working out of technological artifice and political institutions are among the ways humanity was to do this.<p>Kelly just takes this (dubious, reductive) reading of Hegel, which was spun into apologetics for Prussian absolutism, and spins it into apologetics for contemporary tech entrepreneurship.
