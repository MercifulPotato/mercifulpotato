Your 40s and 50s are great because most people have a surplus of 3 vital resources: time, money, and health. You have the time because your kids are older or have moved out of the house. You have money because you&#x27;ve reached peak earning power. You generally are young enough to still have your health so you&#x27;re still able to do things. It&#x27;s great. I know people who kept learning new things well into their 70s and 80s.')
