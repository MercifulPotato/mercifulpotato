Many American sinks have two basins, and the second basin often contains a dish rack for drying dishes. Why not just have a top cover that you lay over the second basin, that you could close?<p>There’s already a drain, so the water has somewhere to go. Ideally you could use the already existing faucet to provide the water source to negate the need for a pump — just attach the faucet to a spout, and it provides the pressure to wash the dish.<p>Since the racks are cheap, you could fill it up, turn on the dishwasher, and then just move it to the side to dry, and swap in the empty rack to start the process all over again.<p>Seems so obvious to me, and cheap to build too. Am I missing something?')
