I dropped out of college for unforseen circumstances and had to self-learn things like maths, data structures, and algorithms as academics routinely use these as litmus tests in interviews.<p>My learning wasn&#x27;t social. It was spent during my breaks at my dead end jobs, after work, etc. If I found a topic I didn&#x27;t understand there was no tutoring, professor to reexplain, or even friends to ask (for a long time I didn&#x27;t know many people in this industry)<p>The result is that I learn new things quite easily, I can usually distill topics down easily for folks or represent them in a multitude of ways, I&#x27;m unafraid of failure, and I don&#x27;t spend my workdays socializing. I still enjoy socializing, just not at work.<p>This is why meetings at companies seem so frivolous. What could be communicated in an email, slack message, or hallway conversation is left to a meeting and I often wondered if it&#x27;s just because these folks want free lunch and some socialization.')
