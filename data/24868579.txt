Each of them support various forms of exporting&#x2F;importing logins, so there&#x27;s not much risk of vendor lockin with those. I&#x27;d assume it&#x27;s the same for other managers, but you&#x27;d have to check.<p>My biggest issue has been that I only saved passwords when I started with keepass instead of username+passwords, which lastpass all imported as secure notes instead of logins.')
