I guess secondarily, a small or handheld terminal display is really the most important piece, since plugging in a usb keyboard is fairly trivial (could android phone be used for this?).<p>This seemed like a project that one of you smart people would have tried out, and I just thought I&#x27;d ask.<p>Or if there&#x27;s a much easier solution than what I&#x27;ve been doing, I&#x27;d love to hear.<p>Thanks')
