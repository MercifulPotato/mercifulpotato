Even if a regulatory body is making impractical demand, I very much doubt they are demanding companies lie to their users and potential users. Even if they were &quot;just following orders guv&quot; is not an acceptable excuse.<p>The key facts: Zoom lied. They didn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to. They could have accurately reported what encryption they use and what they were working towards if that was due to change.<p>Even if we accept that the initial claims were wrong due to executives misunderstanding what their own security&#x2F;dev people had stated, that doesn&#x27;t defend continuing to make the claim without seeking further clarity after questions were raised.')
