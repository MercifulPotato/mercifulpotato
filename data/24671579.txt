Item(by='cmehdy', descendants=None, kids=[24677790], score=None, time=1601728465, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24670978, text='It&#x27;s a cool idea and looks pretty good!<p>I would however do a few things to make the experience worthwhile to the reader: either list the resume directly, or add many &quot;easter eggs&quot; that are the typical commands anyone will use when playing with the shell (as already mentioned: ls&#x2F;pwd&#x2F;man&#x2F;cd etc). And the scrolling should be super fast - that sort of slow display is cooler in a movie than when actually having to wait for it.<p>If it&#x27;s to share with someone actually into recruitment I&#x27;d do something like pre-write on the line `.&#x2F;resume.sh` and fake &quot;echo&quot; a message saying to just press ENTER, which then prints it all neatly at once for reading (and then you can always have a fake `ls`, a fake `resume.sh` file with read-only attributes, and you can troll your visitor differently depending on if they try to use vim&#x2F;emacs&#x2F;nano, and more things along those lines). An option to get a PDF would be awesome too.<p>I&#x27;m having a lot of fun thinking about doing things with what you&#x27;ve done (particularly at the expense of the visitor, I wonder what that says about me..), but ultimately you&#x27;re the one who coded the site already - so all props to you!!')
