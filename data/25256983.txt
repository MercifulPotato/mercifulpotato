It they don&#x27;t value it they don&#x27;t value it,<p>I would argue that a lot of consumers _do_ value it, but they don&#x27;t know enough to ask about that up front.<p>Most people want to buy a thing, then use that thing, and when it breaks they reasonably assume that they should be able to get it fixed if they&#x27;d like.  Cars work this way, appliances work this way, etc.<p>I think the reason why people don&#x27;t ask for this up front is that<p>(1) most people would assume they have the right to repair (and thus don&#x27;t think to ask) and&#x2F;or<p>(2) life is short, and we shouldn&#x27;t need an advanced degree specializing in a particular category of products in order to know all the ins and outs of buying one :)')
