You mention your &quot;what can you do?&quot; shrug.<p>From what I understand of your situation, you should be proud of what you&#x27;re doing. You aren&#x27;t living with your mother because you can&#x27;t stand to leave the nest, you are taking care of your aging mother because she can&#x27;t take care of herself (small assumption on my part).<p>If you were able to succinctly describe this in a way you are proud of, which shows that you are mature, responsible, and caring, I wonder if you&#x27;d get a better response.<p>I think the stereotype (as the article somewhat alludes to), is that young adults are living with their parents due to negative circumstances (economic, psychological, etc). It may be ignoring another underlying metric which is that as parents have children later in life, the parents are less able to care for themselves as the child reaches the age when most would be leaving the home.')
