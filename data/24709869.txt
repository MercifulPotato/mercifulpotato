A launch day model and a PS4 Pro. Both sound like harrier jets taking off when they&#x27;re under load. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s uncommon and something I&#x27;ve heard others mention a well. I&#x27;m just looking forward to a quiet running game system. I don&#x27;t much care how big it is, which is a common complaint, as long as it runs quiet.<p>My only other really big complaint about the PS4 is how terrible the battery life is on the DS4 controllers. I really hope that&#x27;s also resolved with PS5 and it&#x27;s new controller.')
