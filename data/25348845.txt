In our area we find that sometimes multiple trucks meet at the grocery store parking lot and further pass out packages.<p>I wonder if the issue is more the volume over the year never let up and rolled into a marginally increased holiday shipping or if it&#x27;s really a multiple factor of shipped packages over last year.<p>Either way, Penske , Uhaul, etc. who&#x27;ve probably had less rentals this year vs previous, must be happy to see their stuff being delivered.<p>Even amazon has people delivering from their own cars around here.')
