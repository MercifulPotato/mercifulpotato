But I also don&#x27;t believe we had perfect election integrity either. In my mind any system involving hundreds of millions of people is bound to have <i>some</i> bad actors, mistakes, fraud, etc. It&#x27;s important to acknowledge when and where it happens, and how to improve. But claiming any given election had near perfect integrity raises some alarm bells with me at least.')
