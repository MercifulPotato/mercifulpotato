I personally HATE them and am quite annoyed that people pretend the issues they cause don’t exist. They mess up my ability to read and to telegraph social cues, make it difficult for people that read lips to aid poor hearing, and constantly fog my glasses. And I still wear them when indoors in public like I believe everyone should!<p>But what I said which you trimmed off was that they are low cost _relative to other measures_. People wearing masks well is likely to reduce the need to use far more onerous measures like the lockdowns or having to decide who receives hospital care and who doesn’t.')
