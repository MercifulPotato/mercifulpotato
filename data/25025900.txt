That doesn&#x27;t mean he&#x27;s some secret conspiratorial white supremacist talking in code. It just means he&#x27;s a juvenile idiot.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that the second is somehow better than the first. It&#x27;s not. They&#x27;re both equally despicable and I have zero respect for Trump being the former.  But it&#x27;s equally reprehensible to have a crowd on the sidelines chomping at the bit to exaggerate, fabricate or concoct stories, simply because they don&#x27;t like someone.<p>It&#x27;s &quot;he&#x27;s not our guy, so the end justifies the means&quot;, and it&#x27;s an incredibly disturbing trend that goes beyond Trump.')
