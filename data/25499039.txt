At some point the founders decided to cash out, but instead of selling, they started paying out dividends.<p>That first check alone more than tripled my money - and came with a cap table, too, so I could see the $1m+ payouts to each founder as a nice little lesson in the disparity between founder and early-employee outcomes.<p>Not that I&#x27;m complaining - this has turned into the single highest-performing investment I&#x27;ve ever made :)  Career-wise it launched me into the big leagues.  A+, would do it all again.<p>The only other startup that paid me equity money, I got enough to buy a used motorcycle.  Yay.')
