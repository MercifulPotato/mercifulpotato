Those who would disagree are obviously trolls spreading disinformation. The marketplace of ice cream can&#x27;t function if we have other flavors like pistachio or strawberry being labeled &quot;best&quot; instead of the only truely best ice cream. Obviously these strawberry promoters are just manipulating other gullible ice cream consumers for their own ends.')
