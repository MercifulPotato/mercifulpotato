It&#x27;s the one with 3 ports and merges into one. I forget which version it was.<p>It was horrible. The HDMI port wouldn&#x27;t work.<p>I had purchased two. They were absolute trash. That&#x27;s $140.<p>I replaced them with two Amazon versions for half the cost. They worked.<p>It was only after I purchased that I noticed that the reviews on Apple&#x27;s own website showed it rated under 2-stars, with lots of angry reviews from people having the same exact problem.<p>I will say Belkin&#x27;s USB-C dock works amazingly well. I love it.')
