In effect, they are &quot;gamed&quot; to make the cars equal to ensure closer competition.<p>F1 is more of an engineering competition than a driver competition, but both are extremely important. There are very few similar motorsport series. Le Mans used to be that way (and died a slow death due to rising costs), Dakar is like that, rally? I believe is like that, but really don&#x27;t know any others.<p>I am an F1 fan and I really like the engineering aspect of it.')
