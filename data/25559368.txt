My (maybe unpopular?) opinion is that Python and Ruby are practically the same language. With different syntax, sure, but the same in the sense that there is a large overlap in terms of what they are good at and bad at. If Python is a good fit, then Ruby probably also is. If Python is not a good fit, then neither is Ruby. Unless you really depend on libraries that are only available in one language (say data manipulation libraries).<p>So I would personally recommend learning something new that is quite different. For high level coding you could give Elixir a go. I&#x27;ve seen it used at a very high level to orchestrate machine learning jobs running in either Python or Java. Ruby&#x2F;Python are probably still better for little scripts though. For data manipulation maybe give Julia a go? For lower level programming maybe try Go or Rust?<p>Whenever I need to reach for async in Python I ponder rewriting the program with Go or Elixir. Python feels like a very high and expressive language with tedious, low level async primitives bolted in...')
