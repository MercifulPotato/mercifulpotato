My use case is specific: I&#x27;m a dev but since we&#x27;re 2 in the IT service with barely any budget I&#x27;m also a (modest) sysadmin and they also call me when the printer or the TV doesn&#x27;t work.<p>So a few years ago when Debian decided to have faster release cycles I migrated all my VM to CentOS: once the OS is installed I don&#x27;t want to think about it for the next 10 years.<p>I still didn&#x27;t finish my Windows 7 to 10 on all my desktops, I&#x27;m swamped with users wanting to do Zoom &#x2F; Teams &#x2F; Skype &#x2F; Whatever visio conferences, I have 3 new dev projects for 2021 and now I have to migrate all my CentOS VM...<p>Yeah, thank you RedHat I won&#x27;t forget &#x2F; forgive that.')
