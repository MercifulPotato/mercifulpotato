That led to the creation of Yellowstone National Park, which became the world&#x27;s first national park in 1872. Nearly all of Yellowstone National Park lies within the far northwestern borders of Wyoming.<p>&gt; In August 1886, the U.S. Army was given administration of the park<p>&gt; Democrats and Republicans alike in Wyoming Territory agreed by the late 1880s that it was time their territory became a state.

The territories were created and managed by the US federal government, with every expectation that they would either become states or simply remain US-controlled territory. They were never independent pseudo-states, and if they remained a territory, they had even less control over their own destiny than if they became a state.')
