Tom&#x27;s Hardware also compares it to the AMD Platform Security Processor (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;AMD_Platform_Security_Processor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;AMD_Platform_Security_Processo...</a> ), which is AMD&#x27;s CPU-embedded answer to Intel&#x27;s chipset-embedded Management Engine.<p>Both PSP and ME have had several reported security vulnerabilities. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if on AMD CPUs, Pluton is implemented as basically just reflashing PSP&#x27;s firmware. As Microsoft is much more experienced at secure software than the AMDs and Intels of the world, I have a bit more hope about Pluton not introducing an <i>accidental</i> back door into my machine!')
