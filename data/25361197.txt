Last month still MAY be the turning point, which is why I pointed out the recent outperformance of value, in contrast with what just Apple has done, which is irrelevant.<p>Of course we can’t conclude anything by a month’s worth of market data by extrapolating to the future. That’s why OP answering<p>“value may be turning around”<p>with<p>“no it’s not back”,<p>is incorrect, as they’re concluding growth has and will keep outperforming value.')
