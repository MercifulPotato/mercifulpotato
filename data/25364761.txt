There has been no &quot;roping in&quot; of any sort that I have noticed, and while my experience is clearly anecdotal, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything to link to that that I&#x27;ve observed. Perhaps I&#x27;m naive, but it would be good to see something concrete in this regard.<p>&quot;The monetisation of your data in exchange for adverts can be seen as the cost of the platforms. By aggressively increasing advertising on Instagram and attempting to take steps to monetize WhatsApp, Facebook are raising prices. As far as I understand the question is whether it is their abuse of monopoly power that allows them to do this.&quot;<p>I guess I would call that profit-making, not &quot;aggressive monetization&quot;. The alternatives exist and they are all easily accessible. Put yourself in their shoes - would you run a non-profitable enterprise? At what cost? Let&#x27;s not lose touch with the fact that this is still a capitalistic economy.')
