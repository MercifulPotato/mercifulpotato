(Obviously much flatter for protons or x-rays than for visible light.)  If you&#x27;re going to go very deep, you&#x27;re going to want to use at least X-rays if not electron or proton beams.  Even with UV, it&#x27;s just not very efficient to lose such a high percentage of energy near the surface.<p>But, you&#x27;re right, probably 20 years ago I saw photos of a device for converging proton beams on brain cancer.  It just doesn&#x27;t work very well using anything weaker than X-rays for anything very deep.')
