Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611089635, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25830583, text='<i>&gt; someone with diabetes walking in to pick up a take-out salad from a bar</i><p>Can simply <i>not do that</i> in the current high risk environment. There are plenty of places offering take out food that <i>don&#x27;t</i> require you to go into a room full of unmasked people to pick it up. So voting with your wallet seems like a perfectly viable option to incentivize businesses to take proper precautions and ensure that their customers do.<p>Also, are you assuming this person with diabetes is properly following all the guidelines? Are they wearing an appropriate mask, and wearing it properly (covering both their mouth and nose with a good seal all around)? Are they washing their hands right afterwards? (Or wearing gloves--my wife and I do that in cases where we can&#x27;t be sure about whatever we&#x27;re going to have to touch.) Are they minimizing the time they spend in enclosed spaces that aren&#x27;t their home? Those are all things you can do to mitigate risk in situations where you <i>have</i> to go somewhere, such as the grocery store.<p><i>&gt; It feels legitimately odd to need to explicitly defend the idea that there exist inescapable negative consequences</i><p>They&#x27;re not &quot;inescapable&quot;. That&#x27;s the point. If you <i>know</i> you live in a society where a lot of people are not taking proper precautions, then <i>you can take that into account in planning your own life and taking your own precautions</i>. My wife and I have been doing that since the end of February 2020. It&#x27;s doable. And since it&#x27;s doable, I don&#x27;t buy the claim that there are &quot;inescapable&quot; negative consequences.')
