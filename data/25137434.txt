One lives in SF, another in Kansas City. Both apply to the same remote position for a SF-based company. The company will always take the one in KC. I don&#x27;t see how negotiation skill has a role in this. Unless there are people out there who have successfully negotiated a SF-level salary while living somewhere like Kansas, but I haven&#x27;t heard about it.')
