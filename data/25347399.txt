They can&#x27;t stop distributing the LGPL version or alter the deal anymore.<p>Unlike what you hear you can make commercial closed source software and  link LGPL binaries dynamically or statically, makes no difference. You just need to have to provide linkable object files to comply. Just stuff them into some &#x2F;gpl_comply&#x2F; directory and be done with it.')
