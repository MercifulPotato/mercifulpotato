If they have the same title that means that I can train the model to combine them.<p>They also could be press releases, considering the same title was found for multiple articles over the past 30-45 minutes. The data pipeline currently removes duplicate titles, but only inside single batches. So, it could be a long sustained press release.. like propaganda.<p>As of writing it shows three different stories though:<p>- 12:15 Will there be a coronavirus relief bill with $1,200 checks?<p>- 12:30 Nigeria protesters break curfew amid gunfire, chaos in Lagos<p>- 12:30 Google antitrust case to turn on how search engine grew dominant<p>Maybe what you&#x27;re seeing is a bug in the website client, I&#x27;ll investigate it.')
