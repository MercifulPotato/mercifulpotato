Looking at this spec sheet from 2020 eyes, I&#x27;m \n  imagining that this computer would run today&#x27;s software reasonably \n  well if macOS supported it […]\n  \n  It&#x27;s also noticeable how innovative this iMac is from a design \n  standpoint. My eldest daughter was born a year after this computer \n  went on sale. I should have recorded her comments as she saw it. \n  &quot;It&#x27;s sooo cute... why don&#x27;t they make computers like this anymore?&quot;\n  \n  I&#x27;m pretty sure that if they sold a Mac like this with modern components, \n  she&#x27;d be first in line. […]\n  \n  By comparison, today&#x27;s devices are slabs of machined aluminum and \n  display panels. Functional? Certainly, but missing the whimsicality \n  of these older machines. I miss that personality. There&#x27;s not much \n  JOY in today&#x27;s MacBook or iPhone. Hoping that we can see a return soon...</code></pre>')
