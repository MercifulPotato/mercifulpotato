This &quot;cell phone pinged near the capitol&quot; is the kind of language I expect them to use in a press release.  It&#x27;s generic enough and close enough to true that it conveys the basic idea without revealing secrets.<p>Another recent example is how the FBI was asking people to help identify people who entered the White House on Jan 6 by their pictures.  I&#x27;m sure the FBI has some of the best facial recognition software on the planet at their disposal and they knew who those people were in real time during the event.  Asking the public to help identify people serves two purposes.  First, it doesn&#x27;t reveal their full facial recognition capabilities to other threat actors.  Secondly, it trains the population to snitch on each other.')
