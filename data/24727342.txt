I find that I&#x27;ve gotten a number of compliments that I compile for my yearly performance review. I like my client and my manager, and while it may not affect my compensation (I get regular, small increases), it seems to keep negative micro-management from affecting my day-to-day work, and feeds the cycle of positive feedback that allows me to do interesting work, instead of defending how my hours are spent.<p>I&#x27;d encourage positive communication between clients and managers. My dad had a lot of good things to say about his military service. One of them was cultural: tell the guy what he could do better. Tell his superior what he&#x27;s done well.')
