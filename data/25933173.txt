Multiple SSIDs, run 802.1x authentication (maybe with certs), MAC filtering maybe (bypassable sure, but will foil most casual users), run their own simple portal and shunt different classes onto different VLANs with different levels of isolation and traffic shaping, etc.<p>Ultimately if there is one password which then gets any device on, well that&#x27;s that. Sharing has always been pretty trivial. If the owner of a network wants more fine grained and powerful security, all the tools exist to do that already, but they&#x27;ll have to use them.')
