Actually, when I learned touch typing I realized how much was I slowed down by typing before.<p>You might argue that I need to think for a time before I start typing. That&#x27;s right. But:<p>1) Once I start, it flows and it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m reviewing the code as I type, correcting and expanding.<p>2) Writing fast somehow makes me think faster for the next &quot;pre-typing&quot; thinking cycle.')
