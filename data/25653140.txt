MORE ACCESS POINTS!<p>Every time a friend tells me about getting a mesh system to cover dead zones in their place I cringe at the thought of more 2.4 GHz blasting everywhere. 99% of the time the problem can be solved by better placing their current access point, whether that means moving their ISP provided router&#x2F;AP, or installing a standalone AP and disabling whatever they&#x27;re currently using for WiFi.<p>I don&#x27;t really know the answer to fixing the issues but it seems to me it&#x27;s not technical, it&#x27;s better information about placing the devices.

ISP installers are not incentivized to care either, install as cheap and quickly as possible and get out.<p>Mesh definitely isn&#x27;t the answer though. It&#x27;s the anti-answer.')
