Item(by='MeinBlutIstBlau', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603807421, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24907404, text='The way I see it, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, Google are so massive that they&#x27;ve become the defacto &quot;public speaking&quot; ground for online discussion nowadays. Nobody goes to generic-forums.com anymore to discuss their absurdist views unless they can&#x27;t go anywhere else (like Voat). Discord is subtly filling this niche now but I&#x27;m unfamiliar with any moderating censorship similar to the ones I&#x27;ve stated above.<p>The majority of the niche platforms don&#x27;t have an issue with censorship because they know their community will just naturally downvote things they dislike. That&#x27;s why it never was an issue. But when things get as large as most social media has today, they are more than clearly stating they have a bias toward what people can and can&#x27;t say whether or not it was said to a large or small group of people. Even trying to censor the president or cover up allegations against a candidate.<p>Whats weird to me is why Big Tech isn&#x27;t trying to self regulate in a way that would appease the conservatives that are upset? That would for sure keep the government off of their tail. They didn&#x27;t however and they tried doubling down on their agenda. Depending on the next election, this could really hurt them depending on how badly they want push for monopolistic practices.')
