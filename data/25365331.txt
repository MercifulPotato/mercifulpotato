People enjoy hamburgers. They just don&#x27;t want to think about cows while they do.<p>It might be better for their health and the environment if they learned to eat a wider variety of foods. Vegetarian food is incredibly diverse; more so than the fake diversity of putting 20 toppings in 2^20 different combinations on top of ground beef. But that&#x27;s not nearly as strong as cognitive dissonance people have to sustain around knowing that animals suffer and die for their dinner.')
