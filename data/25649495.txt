Fewer than if I project more certainty.  So even if I know that X is just our current best understanding (say, 60% probability of being right), we still have a better expectation value of the outcome if more people follow the plan that has 60% chance of being right.  So I oversell the certainty to up the compliance, in the hope that it&#x27;s actually helpful.<p>The problem is that, while this may help in the short term, in the medium term I&#x27;m setting my credibility on fire, and if we need compliance in the future on a plan that we&#x27;re 80% sure is right, we may not get it, because nobody believes me by then.')
