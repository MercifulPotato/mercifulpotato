This would make it a real pain. I am explaining this to people since the birth of gmail, but no one listens.<p>Let me think for a moment, what would happen if google does this to me...<p>[x] No google email (I have my own mail server - it is just a $90 motherboard with onboard cpu with disks)<p>[x] Modified ROM, no google on android<p>[x] No google cloud (Nextcloud is just fine, for virtualization I have bhyve. They are both just great)<p>[x] No applications bought from google play (If application doesnt provide &quot;off google&quot; licensing, I am not buying it - voting with my money)<p>[x] No content served by google (If I want to share video, I just upload it to my server. No annoyances about copyrights or anything else. It just works.)<p>[x] No data whatsoever stored in google ecosystem (actually actively fighting against them storing any information about me)<p>Hm, looks like - nothing?')
