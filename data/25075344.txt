But officials from the Florida Department of Health said that person has since been removed from the count.<p>I can&#x27;t read the paywall&#x27;d Telegraph article but I think this [2] is the same:<p>&gt; The ONS looked at nearly 4,000 deaths during March in England and Wales where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate. In 91% of cases the individuals had other health problems. The most common was heart disease, followed by dementia and respiratory illness. On average, people dying also had roughly three other health conditions.<p>So basically -- people&#x27;s other health problems cause them to be more severely affected by a respiratory disease that has also been shown to affect the heart and brain [3]. That seems like an intuitive result, and the study backs it up.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s really only excess mortality we can count on right now.<p>The excess mortality will certainly show the bigger impact in the long term, but to imply COVID-19 death numbers are being artificially inflated or so grossly inaccurate that they&#x27;re useless is irrational.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;fact-check&#x2F;florida-motorcyclist-covid-death&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;fact-check&#x2F;florida-motorcyclist-covid...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;health-52308783" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;health-52308783</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayoclinic.org&#x2F;diseases-conditions&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;in-depth&#x2F;coronavirus-long-term-effects&#x2F;art-20490351#ad-mobile-top-container:~:text=Organ%20damage%20caused%20by%20COVID%2D19" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mayoclinic.org&#x2F;diseases-conditions&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;i...</a>')
