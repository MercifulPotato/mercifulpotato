Item(by='jldugger', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605381479, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25094174, text='&gt; let us note that Christensen himself assessed the iphone as non-disruptive.<p>Which I suppose it is, but I think it&#x27;s important to ask: if Apple didn&#x27;t introduce a disruptive technology, why were they able to do what Nokia didn&#x27;t?<p>Its hard to deny how the iPhone represented a power shift away from carriers. It&#x27;s easy to forget but a decade ago you had to pay carriers for the privilege of changing your ringtone. They had their fingers in every pie, in exchange for access to the market the carriers more or less controlled. Hell, you often couldn&#x27;t even bring your phone if you switched carriers.<p>Nokia was too busy pleasing their customers: the big cellular providers who ordered most of their phones. And the status quo heavily favored them -- the top selling phone of all time is still a Nokia phone from 2004. They didn&#x27;t really have any idea how to market direct to consumer and their brand had no particular meaning -- they made as many SKUs as carriers wanted. Since they were in a clearly dominant position, they had no need to arm twist the weakest player to break into the market, and a lot to lose if they played hardball.<p>Clay&#x27;s right that it&#x27;s not a traditional &quot;cheap tech finds a new purpose undermining more expensive status quo&quot; but it definitely rhymes -- all the incentives are the same and adequately explains why Nokia fell apart.')
