Item(by='aronpye', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606172293, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25179728, text='I think emitted light from monitors and displays causes more eye strain than reflected light, as people tend to have their monitors set too bright and with a colour temperature that is contrasted to the ambience of the room. Whereas compared to reflected light, the reflected light is always as the same intensity and colour temperature as ambient light, thus reducing strain as the contrast is lower.<p>Thus, my recommendation is to set monitor brightness and colour temperature to match the ambient lighting conditions. I have no data to support this, other than my own personal comfort. I also suffer from eye floaters, so I use dark colour schemes to reduce contrast so I notice them less. A downside to this is that text can appear to be more fuzzy if you suffer from astigmatism.')
