What bothers me is rather Tim Cook and his super coordinated and carefully planned movements, camera angles, facial expressions, etc. It&#x27;s not natural - although maybe he is in fact an android? I am not sure I would like to work with that guy. He seems extremely tense and probably would freak out at someone having a bad day or even making a bad joke in the same room.')
