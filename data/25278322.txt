Item(by='credit_guy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606928075, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25274455, text='CDC has a page [1] with the notable historical vaccine adverse events. I think it&#x27;s an informative page to read, but just in case you don&#x27;t have time, here&#x27;s my summary:<p>- most adverse events were due to manufacturing issues (e.g. contamination with some live virus). In this respect, I don&#x27;t think the Covid vaccines are likely to be any more or less risky than other vaccines, such as the annual flu vaccine<p>- two vaccines had an association with the Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome (GBS). Even nowadays, if you take the annual flu vaccine they advise caution if you&#x27;ve had GBS before.<p>- one Rotavirus vaccine was quickly discontinued after they saw it can cause a serious condition called intussusception<p>- finally, a case that you&#x27;ll hear lots of people talking about, a possible link between a flu vaccine adjuvant (AS03) and narcolepsy. The CDC page directs you to the actual study [2]. My summary is that this link was observed only in Sweden and Taiwan, but in no other countries. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do not have adjuvants (but Novavax and others will have).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccinesafety&#x2F;concerns&#x2F;concerns-history.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;vaccinesafety&#x2F;concerns&#x2F;concerns-history....</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;30122647&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;30122647&#x2F;</a>')
