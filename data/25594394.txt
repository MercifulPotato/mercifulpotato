When people don&#x27;t like something, they avoid it.  And therefore they wind up not really using it.<p>Take me for an example.  All that I needed to know about Flash is that someone, somewhere, thought my computer should randomly start flashing and making noise.  And the way that they did it really sucked to experience on Linux.  (Not that I wanted the intended experience.)  The fact that the plugin that I needed to let them do so was a repeated source of security holes was just icing on the cake.<p>So I avoided Flash.  And disabled the plugin at some point.  With the happy result that a lot of particularly annoying ads went away.<p>Now I&#x27;m sure that there were a lot of people whose experience was better.  It was popular for a reason.  But it wasn&#x27;t a better experience for me.')
