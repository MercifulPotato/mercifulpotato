That would destroy visual&#x2F;muscle memory and undermine the users sense of control and mastery. Bad news.<p>It would be pretty great if programs with tool palettes came with a configurator so that the user could <i>deliberately</i> move things around, remove and add tools, and otherwise customize. As long as it was saved in a plain-text config that they could move around, this would be a win, just like it is in text editors.')
