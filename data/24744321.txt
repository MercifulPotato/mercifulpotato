If the buyer opts for a neutral&#x2F;non-polarising color, then the depreciation is lesser than compared to choosing a different color. This is because it is assumed (mostly correctly) that it will be relatively easier to sell a grey&#x2F;black car than a bright yellow&#x2F;red car.<p>That also results in the non-neutral coloured car costing more to finance over the term.')
