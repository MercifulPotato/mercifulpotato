Where things like cars and phones functioned on their own in a much more reliable manner.</i><p>I grew up in the 80s and have owned several cars from that era. They were <i>significantly</i> less reliable than cars of today. Carburetors were still present (though being phased out) and there were always vacuum hoses that, when they leaked, caused your car to run like crap.<p>Also, phones: Cellphones were extremely expensive and unreliable. Landlines were extremely unreliable at <i>reaching other humans</i> because as often as not, the recipient wasn&#x27;t home. Also, I remember all kinds of problems with landline wiring leading to noisy connections. Also, unless you were calling a close neighbor, you paid high per-minute charges.<p>It&#x27;s really hard to find something that was better in the pre-internet era. Cars and phones aren&#x27;t it.')
