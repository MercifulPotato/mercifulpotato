I would like to suggest, humbly, that they examine their hearts and determine whether advocating genocide is the type of thing they would want to restrict in their own terms of service. If not, please avoid criticizing Facebook for their role in spreading the propaganda used to justify the genocide in Myanmar. And if it is, please ease up on Twitter for enforcing that policy.<p>Personally, while I think you should be able to set up a personal webpage saying whatever you like, I find this stuff extremely distasteful and did report the Chinese embassy for advocating violence towards specific ethnic groups. It is a violation of Twitter&#x27;s terms and tremendously odious.')
