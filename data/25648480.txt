It will take roughly 4000 years to have an hour drift absent leap seconds.<p>In 4000 years we can adjust all the timezone definitions by 1 hour, if we even still care about how close noon is to solar noon. The once per 4000 year adjustment could be planned tens or hundreds of years in advance (just less than 1000 years in advance, for accuracy reasons).  Timezone differences&#x2F;changes are already handled pretty well by existing systems too, so it isn&#x27;t the case that extensive new plumbing would be required for this.<p>In exchange we save tens (to hundreds) of millions of dollars a year that are spent on preparing for, managing, and suffering from leap second disruption, building systems that are tolerant of &#x27;time&#x27; being discontinuous or even non-monotone. We avoid de-synchronizations from systems which handle leap seconds differently.  We also gain the ability for independent atomic time to keep subsecond accurate civil times without some costly to obtain (and often dubiously secure) date feed of unpredictable leap seconds -- something that will likely become more relevant as solid state optical atomic clocks become something commercially producible.<p>At the moment we appear to be moving in the direction of a negative leap second.  If one occurs the disruption will likely be substantially greater than the typical leap second disruption (which is still significant-- and growing the longer we go without a leap second).  I hope we abolish the leap second before a negative leap second is issued, but if we do not I hope that it will at least be the last leap second.')
