The other responses are good, but they&#x27;re not exactly responding to your comment about the parent commenter&#x27;s change from agnosticism to atheism upon learning the scale of the universe.<p>I&#x27;ve had a vaguely similar experience, but over a longer period, not a single &quot;moment&quot;, and not entirely to do with the physical sciences.<p>They way I look at it is this: To ants, we are gods. We can provide an unimaginable bounty to them by simply dropping the remains of a sandwich. We can destroy their entire world with callous indifference. A step in the wrong place is all it takes to crush an anthill.<p>But do we care about an individual ant&#x27;s good behaviour? No. Not in the slightest. I don&#x27;t meet out punishment on one particular worker ant because it failed to respect the queen, or move enough seeds one day.<p>Simply put, we are so far removed from ants, so far <i>above them</i>, so much greater, that there can be no meaningful interaction of this type. The UN general assembly does not give a flying fuck about the misdeeds of a particular ant in some particular ant-mound in some particular forest, in some national park, in some country far away. Conversely, an ant can have no concept of the latest UN resolution&#x27;s effects on international tourism and its side-effects, such as the likelihood of an increased number of dropped sandwiches in national parks. There is no though that an ant can possibly have that can encompass even a fraction of such concepts. They&#x27;re simply too abstract, too advanced for such tiny brains.<p>Any God that could possibly have made a Universe as vast and complex as ours would be similarly far removed from us. We would be ants to such a God. Personal, individual communication of any type would be hopeless. A &quot;relationship&quot;, as Christians like to say, would be absurd in the extreme. Ants don&#x27;t have relationships with senators, or kings, or generals. It&#x27;s simply unthinkable.<p>Science could study such a God, if it existed, but it wouldn&#x27;t be entirely clear if it would be possible to actually gain a truly meaningful understanding. A superficial, surface knowledge, perhaps, but that is all. Prayer would certainly be an utter waste of time. Holy books could not have possibly be written or inspired by such a God. Rituals would be meaningless. Rites and celebrations would also be embarrassingly pointless.')
