It depends on the people.  Sometimes small children, or even adults, are better able to cope with you being occasionally gone, than with you being there, but don&#x27;t bother them.  You could end up either being continually interrupted, or else having to say some variant of &quot;stay away from me&quot; to a loved family member.  Neither is a good situation.<p>Not to mention that some people, for financial reasons, must live in places far too small to spend their waking lives in along with their sleeping lives.')
