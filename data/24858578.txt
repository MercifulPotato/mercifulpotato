So your route becomes Earth -&gt; Jupiter Communications Satellite 3 -&gt; Callisto ComSat 10 -&gt; Callisto Base Alpha<p>Assuming you want to send a message to the far side of Luna, even then the best path may be a commsat in high orbit around Luna -&gt; Comsat in low orbit around Luna -&gt; FarSide Base.<p>I agree, rarely are you going to need to bounce from Mars to Jupiter, but for low-priority bulk traffic (scientific images, etc) and enough nodes, it might be worthwhile to bounce from Mars to Jupiter to Luna to Earth if all communication nodes were otherwise idle. The Delay Tolerant Network Vint Cerf is working on supports knowledge of when certain antennas have available communication windows to different nodes, and can schedule and route communication accordingly.<p>Source: Myself, did a presentation on it in college')
