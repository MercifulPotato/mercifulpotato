Item(by='potatoz2', descendants=None, kids=[25649083], score=None, time=1609871302, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25648711, text='&gt; That&#x27;s just as true of our actual responses to COVID.<p>Please expand on that point to clarify. The second order negative outcomes of a botched vaccine rollout would be enormous, both for this particular pandemic and longer term.<p>&gt; I explicitly said in my post that not all Americans would choose to take the vaccine. You are attacking a straw man. I was simply giving the highest possible upper bound to the expected number of deaths from vaccination.<p>This is a key point that you cannot elide though. If 30% of the population takes the rushed vaccine but 70% takes the tested slowly rolled out vaccine, the difference in the herd immunity outcome is large.<p>&gt; Yes, and why is that? Because despite all of our &quot;respected&quot; institutions saying that the vaccine is safe, many people don&#x27;t believe them. Why not? Because they know that those same institutions lied to them, repeatedly--and not just in general, specifically during the whole COVID crisis. So why should people believe those institutions now?\n&gt; In other words, we have a problem with the status quo.<p>The FDA never lied during the pandemic, that I know of. Broadly speaking people do trust them, and the tests and approval has a positive effect on vaccine acceptance. Also note that this isn&#x27;t a binary choice &quot;status quo&quot;&#x2F;&quot;not status quo&quot;, you have to offer a realistic alternative to the status quo that we can measure the status quo against. Rushing the vaccine has more negatives than positives, in my opinion (both in hindsight and even more so with the information we had at the time).<p>&gt; Who would be reporting and exaggerating the side effects in a way that everyone would hear about? The mainstream media.<p>No, mostly social media. But even if the mainstream media is responsible (whatever that term means, it encompasses local stations, cable news, NPR and newspapers like the NYT&#x2F;WaPo, each of which have different propensities to exaggerate), you&#x27;re not offering a solid alternative.')
