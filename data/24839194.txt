They&#x27;re also cheap. They&#x27;ve been conditioned by the FOSS movement to think all software should be free as-in-beer. (The people who started FOSS didn&#x27;t say that, but that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s become.) They say they want free as-in-freedom, but since they are not willing to pay for it they don&#x27;t exist. Those who pay set the agenda for everything.<p>Developing a truly polished operating system with a whole ecosystem of services is far, far beyond what volunteers and hobbyists can achieve. It&#x27;s just too much work. It also requires focus and coordination and someone who is able and willing to say no. Without that the FOSS community rewrites everything over and over again instead of doing the not-fun parts of programming like fixing bugs and edge cases.<p>TL;DR: we get what we pay for. We don&#x27;t pay for freedom so we don&#x27;t get it.')
