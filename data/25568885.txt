While we&#x27;re not there yet, I think it is likely we will be soon. If e.g. border crossings, airplane rides or certain public gatherings require vaccination.<p>Think about the other people involved.<p>If I&#x27;m unable to take the vaccine for medical reasons, I need the others around me to be vaccinated in order to be safe. If you allow unvaccinated people to roam unrestricted, I&#x27;m unable to participate safely in society.<p>So you have a choice between infringing on the freedoms of those who have a choice and those who don&#x27;t. Which group should be protected?<p>I see no reason why the group that has a choice should be given priority over the group that doesn&#x27;t. The group that has a cnoice can choose to take the vaccine and the restrictions end.<p>You can also take the argument to an extreme: what if the disease was life-threatening?<p>Should society respect somebody&#x27;s freedom to the point of allowing them to endanger the lives of others?<p>If not, at what point does the severity of the disease make it okay to risk inflicting it on others?')
