That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve been building my own HN copy (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackerdaily.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackerdaily.io</a>). It shows all posts per day, which has a few benefits:<p>1. It doesn&#x27;t become an addictive slot machine that updates every minute.<p>2. The conversations have already happened, which makes it easier to see which threads are interesting and informative and which are not.<p>It also uses an outline.com like style for the articles, which removes the tracking and spamming and places the focus on the articles itself.<p>It&#x27;s still in active development and so far I&#x27;ve only used it myself, so all feedback is welcome!<p>Ps. Itâ€™s an PWA, so you can add it to your homescreen and use it like an app.')
