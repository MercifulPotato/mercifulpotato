There needs to be a very strong &quot;pull&quot;, with a lot of organizing and pressure on politicians and agencies, to counteract corporate influence - and it&#x27;s not enough that the reality is obvious.<p>Also, in most world states, large corporations are able to threaten leaving - stopping activity in the country - which can be quite a hit to the local economy for smaller states and larger corporations.<p>Another point which hinders your suggestions is the imbalance between world powers, especially the US (and to some extent the EU and China) - so that if one or several of those are beholden to corporate interests, then the others, or world-wide bodies, will find it very difficult to mandate things, apply taxation etc.')
