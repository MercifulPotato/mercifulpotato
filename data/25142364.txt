I&#x27;m relatively new to HN and I am consistently frustrated by the &quot;completely uninformative title&quot; fetish link submitters seem to have.<p>I also wish that when people submit what is clearly a &quot;new version of software&#x2F;thing X&quot; they would submit a title like:<p>&quot;Salami 2.0 released, this popular meat product now has substantially more zest.&quot;<p>Instead people just submit:<p>&quot;Salami 2.0&quot;<p>That&#x27;s no better than Freshmeat.')
