The teachers were instructed to comment on the availability of the cookies only by saying: ‘I&#x27;ve brought some chocolate biscuits.’ Teachers were allowed to eat one chocolate cookie themselves to break any reservations about taking the first cookie. The control groups received no chocolate cookies.<p>&gt; If students brought cookies or other sweets for their group, the teachers were instructed to report this to the study group.<p>&gt; At the end of the session, all students were asked to fill in the anonymous end‐of‐session evaluation form. While the students answered the questions, the teachers were instructed to leave the room. The forms were collected in a ballot box. After all students had left the room, cookie consumption was determined by subtracting the weight of the remaining cookies from 500 g.')
