Elon Musk is perhaps close to unique in that intersection.<p>Are there other people who could do it but were not in the right place in the right time or didn&#x27;t have the right leverage (money, connections, etc.)?  Lots.  If you took away those parameters, if Elon was just an engineer working for Boeing with just enough money to go on vacation every year, then he probably wouldn&#x27;t have founded Tesla.  He&#x27;d be some middle manager somewhere like lots of other smart&#x2F;capable people.')
