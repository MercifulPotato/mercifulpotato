The hearing, to be decided by a judge, has apparently been set up to conclude that Julian Assange is to be extradited to the US.<p>The UK and the US appear to be willing to discard years of diplomatic sophistries – such as the &quot;rule of law&quot; – for this to happen. This should be troubling to citizens of those countries, because they are openly adopting the tools of the despot.<p>It&#x27;s notable that despite being &quot;open court,&quot; access to the Assange hearing appears to have been deliberately restricted, despite being paritally online [1]. Notably, generally-respected international NGOs like Amnesty International[2] and Reporters without Borders [3] have raised concern about this. From Craig Murray&#x27;s coverage, it looks like restricting access was precisely because this hearing was prejudiced.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.craigmurray.org.uk&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;your-man-in-the-public-gallery-the-assange-hearing-day-6&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.craigmurray.org.uk&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;your-man-in-...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.craigmurray.org.uk&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;your-man-in-the-public-gallery-assange-hearing-day-18&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.craigmurray.org.uk&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;your-man-in-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amnesty.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;documents&#x2F;eur45&#x2F;3076&#x2F;2020&#x2F;en&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amnesty.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;documents&#x2F;eur45&#x2F;3076&#x2F;2020&#x2F;en&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rsf.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;news&#x2F;usuk-julian-assanges-extradition-hearing-marred-barriers-open-justice" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rsf.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;news&#x2F;usuk-julian-assanges-extradition-hea...</a>')
