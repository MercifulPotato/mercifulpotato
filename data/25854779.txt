The American Red Cross sometimes gives away small gifts ($5 Amazon Gift Card, windbreaker with ARC logo, etc.) to promote donation.   The are now testing blood for COVID so I&#x27;ve had one free negative test so far.<p>There are different tests that you can get from places like LabCorp or Quest Diagnostics - doctors working for these places prescribe the test.
