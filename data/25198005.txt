I had a question about this passage however:<p>&gt;&quot; MyNOR is a single board computer that does not have a CPU. Instead, the CPU consists of discrete logic gates from the 74HC series ...&quot;<p>Isn&#x27;t that still a CPU just not a integrated chip or microprocessor? Isn&#x27;t a board with discrete logic gates basically how mainframes and minicomputers such as PDP-11 etc were built before the advent of the &quot;microprocessor&quot;?')
