It was a greasy and miserable place run by people who should have retired long ago. Everything was waterfall development, and there was a yearly slave-rush to their miserable convention show, where only half the stuff really worked.  No one really knew what they were doing.  It was like a time machine back to 20 years ago.  So glad I left.')
