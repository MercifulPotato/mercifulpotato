The only amend I can make is to be a better person, which I think I am.<p>For me it was important to forgive myself even when no one else would. My view is forgive (myself) but not forget. Forgiving allows me to move forward. Not forgetting is a guardrail against moving back.<p>Having said that, life is full of actions with consequences that are truly final and one-way tickets. I&#x27;m not judging how people perceive the pain of their own dilemmas. That&#x27;s a deeply personal call.')
