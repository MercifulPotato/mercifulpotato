(It was probably when this incident first hit the news.)<p>The doors are electronic.  The front doors have a mechanical override simply by pulling the door release lever further than usual. That&#x27;s OK.<p>For the rear doors, there&#x27;s an emergency cable to pull on at the very bottom of the door[1].<p>I was 11 when my dad crashed our car, at night at a decent speed.  When we stopped moving, the car next to ours was already on fire, and I&#x27;m told ours also caught fire, although I didn&#x27;t notice it at the time.  My dad&#x27;s (driver&#x27;s) door was blocked, so he had to clamber across my younger sister in the front passenger seat.  I unbuckled my younger brother (age 5), opened his door a bit, but had to kick it to get it to open sufficiently -- it was also badly dented in the collision.<p>If we&#x27;d had a Tesla, would you expect 11 year old me to know to &quot;look below the seats for the carpet flap, find the little plastic tab, grab it and pull it to the side&quot; -- and to be able to kick open the door while pulling that tab, since the side of the car is smashed in?<p>(We were all uninjured; some people in other cars had broken bones.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;01lXcD_Uz74?t=41" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;01lXcD_Uz74?t=41</a>')
