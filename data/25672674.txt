Compared to 4K, it looks so pixelated that I feel like I&#x27;m back in the 90s.<p>I don&#x27;t know, that sounds a little embellished at first read. Either you sit way closer than ergonomic norms or you have irregular vision.<p>Should you be able to notice a difference? Yeah that&#x27;s plausible. To see pixelation at 1440p doesn&#x27;t sound right however. Claiming it is like the 90s borders on absurd.')
