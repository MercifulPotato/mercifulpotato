Otherwise it can open a Pandora box of interpretations.<p>For example:  Is the Scottish word Sassenach offensive, as an English person I can laugh and appreciate it, others may not and take offence.  Equally in today&#x27;s society it is easy to take offence and that right there is how they class a hate-crime in some circles - if you offend somebody and by that, they take offence even if no offence was meant nor intended.')
