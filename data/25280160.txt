It does not go through the whole official promotion system.<p>&gt; but also serves as an implicit suggestion of the superiority of the Chinese system in contrast to western democratic systems.<p>This is clearly a wrong impression. The superiority is always in the context of being for China. Without that quote, it becomes a challenge to US hegemony.
