There is gigantic amounts of economical lithium in Western Australia. There are still large untapped lithium in North Catalina. There is untapped potential for lithium in Czech Republic. There are lithium projects in Canada as well.<p>There are lots of companies working on lithium extraction from clay salts, and if that is cracked, the amount is literally unlimited.<p>In fact, once you start locking into batteries, by far the biggest problem is actually nickel, not lithium. Nickel is of course already a large market because of stainless steel and already having issues with growth. Once we add absurd amounts of battery production for cathodes, the nickel is by far the biggest bottleneck.<p>Getting away from nickel would be the real win condition in terms of price and sustainability. Lithium mining is actually relatively reasonable environmentally speaking. Nickel mining however is growing in Indonesia where they use very bad process and using coal power to do it.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that we are already at 80-90% nickel in the cathode, and likely soon go to almost 100%. In comparison, lithium is only 1-2% of the battery, while nickel is around 50% depending on what and how we measure.<p>There is a reason Elon Musk tweeted out &#x27;Mine more nickel&#x27; and not &#x27;Mine more lithium&#x27;.')
