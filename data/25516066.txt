It has that powerful OCaml&#x2F;F# vibe.<p>Built-in Datalog is indeed a surprising feature. Strongly reminded me that we may come to a universal data model someday just like we rely on universal computational model (Turing &#x2F; von Neumann) nowadays. Under that model, we would not make distinctions between various sources of data and we would be able to efficiently query them in every structural dimension they offer.')
