Didn&#x27;t even think of EV. Why should I. It costs more. It weighs more. There is no infrastructure. It has a short range.\nAlso bought and new apartment recently (Germany, in a big city). There is no chargers in the underground garage, no infrastructure whatsoever.\nHow should I visit my family&#x2F;friends, leaving far away? Plan additional 2 hours each way to charge a battery.\nIn this case I didn&#x27;t even look at the Plugin Hybrid. Why? Above points apply. Trunk is smaller!!! Horsepower?<p>I&#x27;m not against it. I could consider Plugin Hybrid, if I would have charger dedicated for my parking spot.\nBut IMHO, governments are approaching this from the wrong angle. Instead of fining manufacturers , and increase taxes, focus on the infrastructure, and the rest will follow.')
