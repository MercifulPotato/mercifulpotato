The 10x10 grids are hard-coded in the network architecture so it&#x27;s not possible for the system to perform any better without re-design and re-training.<p>Trains on a dataset augmented to 1500 tasks by permuting colours and &quot;exploiting that the tasks are invariant to rotation and symmetry&quot;. So it&#x27;s cheating, but that just goes to show that the ARC dataset is not the full-proof benchmark of intelligence that its author meant it to be. It&#x27;s possible to solve at least a quarter of the tasks by cheating and without demonstrating what the author considers the hallmarks of intelligence- the ability for abstraction and reasoning [2].<p>____________<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fchollet&#x2F;ARC" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fchollet&#x2F;ARC</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1911.01547" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1911.01547</a>')
