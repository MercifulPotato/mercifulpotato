That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s rather meaningless to talk about the resolution of analog photos or video, the actually information density will vary depending on a large number of factors and may not even be the same depending on what you measure. For instance old school analog TV had significantly more information in the lumas than in the chroma.<p>And then you have old school lenses vs. modern lenses and many other factors.<p>I agree with the parent that the end result is an amusing novelty but if the intention was to fool me into thinking that it was actually an ancient recording I don&#x27;t think I would&#x27;ve fallen for it. It&#x27;s too sharp, the blurring effect on movement feel wrong too and the dynamics are off I think (film has amazing contrast that digital sensors still struggle to emulate).')
