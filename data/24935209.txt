I&#x27;ve switched my email to a third party service, and if I restore my blog it&#x27;ll probably be to github pages.<p>I spent 16 years maintaining those things in the decentralized style, and I think it&#x27;s fair to say that effort was of literally no benefit to anyone, other than the hosting company I paid hundreds of pounds to for the ultimately doomed VDS. It&#x27;s a relief to have finally handed them over to people whose job is to maintain them.<p>Edit: Also when my blog had a comments section I got like 10-20 legit responses to posts and hundreds of spam messages that were a huge pain to manage.')
