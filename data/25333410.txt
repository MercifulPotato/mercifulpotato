You can synthesize methane, methanol or ammonia with hydrogen and CO2 and go on from there to build everything that is built from oil today.<p>This isn&#x27;t exactly efficient, and doing this at scale is a huge challenge. But in the end we&#x27;ll have to find alternatives for all oil products, because making them from oil will inevitably lead to carbon emissions (both in the refinery and at the end of life of products when they decompose in a landfill or get burned).')
