For example, what is your experience with React? What have you built using it? Have you used Storybook, Jest, etc? Tell me about a scalability problem you solved. What is your experience with AWS Lambda? My resume listed out my jobs for the past 10+ years, and they didn&#x27;t feel the need to give me a leetcode interview. There was nothing to &quot;crack&quot; or study for, I just told honest stories about what I have done over the course of my career, and we had a conversation. Working out well so far!')
