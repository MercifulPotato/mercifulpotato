When I bought a pair of overhead cabled headphones with a long cord I found the cord was in the way of my mouse and keyboard. It was workable but annoying. I would even run over the cable with my chair sometimes.<p>When running, climbing or just doing chores around the house, wireless headphones really make it easier to not get them yanked out of your head.<p>If your use cases don&#x27;t run into any limitations with a 3.5mm cabled headphone then you certainly shouldn&#x27;t pay the extra money to be able to freely move your head&#x2F;body around. For me I am very happy to pay for that as it has improved my experience dramatically.')
