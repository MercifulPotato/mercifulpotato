We are able to eliminate the chaotic mess of signs, divergences and curls that we have in Maxwell&#x27;s equations and write it as a single equation, that essentially has the structure D F = J, where D is a differential operator, F = E + I B is a combined electromagnetic field, and J contains the charge and current densities.<p>Geometric algebra is not unique as a mechanism to grouping Maxwell&#x27;s equations into a more coherent structure.  This can also be done with both the tensor formalism and differential forms.  Each of these can encode Maxwell&#x27;s equations into a single equation for the electric sources, plus an additional equation for the (zero) magnetic sources.  So the fact that we can write all of Maxwell&#x27;s equations as a single equation, when compared to the tensor formalism or differential forms, is only an incremental improvement.<p>However, some interesting opportunities are made available by putting Maxwell&#x27;s equations into this single equation form.  In particular, the system of equations is put into a form that we can invert using a Green&#x27;s function for the differential operator.  This gives us a way to solve all of Maxwell&#x27;s equations in one fell swoop.  It&#x27;s well known that this is possible for the statics equations of electromagnetism, but we can also do this for the time dependent case, and obtain Jefimenko&#x27;s solution of Maxwell&#x27;s equation ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jefimenko&#x27;s_equations" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Jefimenko&#x27;s_equations</a> ) directly.  That solution can be obtained without first having to resort to solving the second order potential equation, and differentiating those fields to find the electric and magnetic fields.<p>The geometric algebra form of the Jefimenko&#x27;s solution is much simpler than the conventional form, because it is expressed in terms of a single electromagnetic field variable (F = E + I B).  There are many other such examples, where things become simpler to express when the fields are grouped logically into a single entity.<p>A great reference that explores electrodynamics and many other geometric algebra physics topics is Doran and Lasenby&#x27;s &quot;Geometric Algebra for Physicists&quot; ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cambridge.org&#x2F;core&#x2F;books&#x2F;geometric-algebra-for-physicists&#x2F;FB8D3ACB76AB3AB10BA7F27505925091" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cambridge.org&#x2F;core&#x2F;books&#x2F;geometric-algebra-for-p...</a> ).<p>Be warned that the reference above is a tough read.  I have a for dummies exploration of some of the electromagnetism applications of geometric algebra in my book (free pdf available here: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;peeterjoot.com&#x2F;writing&#x2F;geometric-algebra-for-electrical-engineers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;peeterjoot.com&#x2F;writing&#x2F;geometric-algebra-for-electric...</a> ).  I don&#x27;t use the explicitly relativistic invariant form of Maxwell&#x27;s equations used in Doran and Lasenby -- it is beautiful, but makes things somewhat more inaccessible.  My book is fairly small, and is grouped into three pieces (geometric algebra basics, integration theory, and finally applications to electromagnetism.)  I don&#x27;t touch the mixed signature (projective, conformal, and relativistic) geometric algebras that ganja supports, as I tried to keep things as simple as possible.')
