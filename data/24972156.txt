Its platform is about twice as wide as the original subway station platforms, and it&#x27;s far longer than it needs to be too. On top of that, it has a full-length underground mezzanine above the platform, which is unnecessary. Overall, the effect when I first used it was &quot;why is this so unnecessarily massive?&quot;<p>Oversized stations are even more problematic when you consider that the MTA wants to build all of these by mining rather than using cut-and-cover, because cut-and-cover has too much disruption to surface tenants. And mining is far more expensive than cut-and-cover, so the extra volume you need to dig out for excessive station sizes hits your purse even faster. For as high as the actual tunneling costs are, it&#x27;s the station costs that truly make the subway extensions stratospherically expensive.')
