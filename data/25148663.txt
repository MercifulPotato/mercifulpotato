They were always on my back, watching and controlling everything.<p>If I wanted to do something they did not approve, they were angry or mocked me. They forced me on activities I hated because THEY liked it. Never aknowledging my wishes or needs.<p>Never had privacy because they always had to check everything I was doing. Even closing my door made them angry. God save me if I dared to actually lock it, hell would loose on me.<p>When I asked for help, they never really bothered, they even laughed at me and made me feel like I should be ashamed to ask a question.<p>I lived under ridiculously strict, completely non-logical and arbitrary rules in everything in my life. Even daring to ask an explanation made them angry because I was defying their authority.<p>Want to get this nice book you like? Too bad, you don&#x27;t have money. But mom does not think this book is interesting, so we&#x27;ll get this other one instead. <i>What, you already want to buy something else? We already bough you a book last week, you should be grateful.</i><p>They moved in the countryside because they are completely antisocial.<p><i>What, you want to visit a friend? I&#x27;ll have to drive you, you are so annoying. We&#x27;ll do this another time.</i><p><i>What, you want to go to disneyland? And a shopping center? Do you even know how much it costs and how many people are there?</i><p><i>What, you don&#x27;t want to spend every sunday with us visiting completely uninteresting places with us? What&#x27;s wrong with you, why don&#x27;t you never get out of the house?!</i><p><i>You got punished again at school?</i> [hell looses on me] <i>I was sure your friends were not very frequentable, stop stop meeting them. Seriously, why didn&#x27;t the teachers see that? Parents and teachers are so incompetent nowadays. Fortunately you have parents giving you a good education.</i><p>Computers were the only place where I could escape from this hell. I could have my own virtual world and they could not control it. I could subscribe to a PhpBB forum and talk with actual human beings about things I actually liked. I could choose any video game, movie and music and get it on Emule without asking permission.<p>This had and still have devastating consequences on my well-being.<p>You should be listening to what your child wants and teach her how to make her own smart choices. You should give her freedom, love and care, not arbitrary limits without even un explanation.<p>If I did not have my computer that my parents did not understood, if they had the power and knowledge to control and choose what I am allowed to do with it, I probably would have ended-up killing myself or something.')
