(I&#x27;ve just rented electric cars). None of the charging stations take credit cards; they all have some byzantine payment method.<p>There are weird resellers abound - some have apps that work, some have crashy pieces of crap. Some have clear pricing models, others have weird &quot;memberships&quot; and surprise bills. The same charging station can cost wildly different amounts to different people.<p>It reminds me of the bad old days of American long-distance service. Really difficult to actually pick the right provider.<p>There are a lot of EV chargers in Germany but they&#x27;re such a bizarre experience. And they&#x27;re not cheap! It costs ~15eur to fully charge a car here in Berlin.')
