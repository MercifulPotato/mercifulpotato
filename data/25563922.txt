It sounds like you were eating larks tongue in aspic and are now buying year-old potatoes at the Latvian coop.  Remember, some in an international audience may have done just that at some point.  Is that what happened?<p>Wonder if a functional kitchen should be thought of as an expense-management device.  No matter what the financial situation, in the US without a kitchen you can always find something to eat to keep body and soul together, but with a functional kitchen you can always eat something both tasty and healthy (if you can cook).  You can choose to cook if you have the cash; you may need to do that if you don’t.  The fact that you always can is a very consoling fact in rough economic times.')
