Item(by='cs-szazz', descendants=1, kids=[25969217], score=2, time=1612015400, title='Ask HN: Can you secure a loan from a friend with startup options?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hi HN<p>I&#x27;m in the fortunate position of having a large amount of money (on paper) in startup options, and in the unfortunate position of not being able to afford the tax.<p>It seems that generally people recommend borrowing from family or friends, and then paying back when the stock is liquid. I have a friend willing to lend me a not insignificant amount of money ($350k), so I can exercise my remaining options.<p>However, my startup&#x27;s option agreement says that:<p>Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  this  Agreement,  this  option  and  the  rights  and privileges  conferred  hereby  shall  not  be  sold,  pledged  or  otherwise  transferred  (whether  by operation of law or otherwise) and shall not be subject to sale under execution, attachment, levy or similar process.<p>For anyone who&#x27;s been in a similar situation, does this kind of legalese preclude me from saying &quot;When company X is liquid, I&#x27;ll pay you back the loan, otherwise I&#x27;ll give you the options&quot;?<p>Of course I suspect the real answer is to talk to a lawyer, if anyone has any recommendations for that I&#x27;d be all ears as well!')
