Cranelift started in the same way, and now is gaining more passes and IRs, etc.<p>I think more passes and IRs is good for clarity, correctness, and programming productivity, and single-pass designs are too brittle since the purpose of all software (the requirements) changes over time.<p>The solution is we redouble our focus on fusion techniques to try to allow algorithms specified in multiple passes to be fused into a single pass. Then libraries like cranelift and LLVM can prevent a variety of passes, and one has the option to either go for compiler performance, picking only those that fuse or speed of compilation code, picking additional ones that don&#x27;t fuse.')
