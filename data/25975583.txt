Norway doesn&#x27;t have 25% energy sitting there unused, ready for EVs. Quite the contrary, Norway uses pretty much all of its power. Norway&#x27;s economy is built around it. We have a lot of really power hungry industry developed here over many years due to access to large amounts of cheap electric power.<p>In fact there is a battle over building wind turbines in Norway now, because we need them to cover higher future electricity demand from EVs.
