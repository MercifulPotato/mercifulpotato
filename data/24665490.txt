If not, the models are tweaked or thrown away.<p>You could call it a branch of mathematics, but in a sense all theoretical physics starts out that way, so we just call it theoretical physics when the goal is to model observed reality while providing a useful underlying model.<p>Browse the papers on arXiv.org or any theoretical physics journal and there&#x27;s a lot of exploratory model-building like this.  It&#x27;s very common.<p>Graph-space models are also not unique to Stephen Wolfram.  Several physicists (paid ones) are exploring these models as an approach to reconciling relativity and quantum physics.  In a sense, this is what deriving from observation looks like: We&#x27;ve observed relativity and quantum, and we still haven&#x27;t figured out how to understand the logical consequences of both together, so exploring theoretical underlying models like this is <i>necessary</i> to understand current observations.<p>The article&#x27;s theory is not &quot;philosophical&quot; or &quot;metaphysical&quot; theory where nothing can be tested in principle.  He explicitly talks about measurable effects differing from other models, albeit with many difficulties and potential intractibility due to computational limits.<p>But the point is there are, in principle, observable differences, making it more than just a metaphysical model, and if it&#x27;s intractable to access them we can&#x27;t figure that out without studying the model further.  Even if we can&#x27;t, there not being able to may have consequences as well (like the way the Heisenberg uncertainty principle turns out to have logical consequences, not just preventing measurements).')
