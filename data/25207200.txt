Basically, our brains all learn language in the same manner no matter what language and no matter what age. Children don&#x27;t learn their native language through reading books on grammar, they acquire it through listening and reading stories which they can comprehend. Adults are exactly the same.<p>(The theories of the existence of a physical module in the brain or innate universal grammar are not widely accepted science today, but it is inarguable that the above second-order effects have been observed regardless of the mechanism of action.)')
