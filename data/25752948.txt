Conspiracies are to be debunked, not banned. Otherwise, people who believe such conspiracies simply go underground and we end up cultivating anger, distrust, and cynicism. Is that covid-19 would turn into a global pandemic back in Feb a conspiracy? Is criticizing USSR in the 30s a conspiracy? Is that earth is not the center of our universe a conspiracy 700 years ago? Is that FBI&#x27;s infiltration and surveillance on political groups a conspiracy? Are all the questioning on the reasons for the US to invade Iraq conspiracy theories? Where are the WMDs now?<p>In general, are we sure that no conspiracy ever turned out to be true? How many heresies turned out to be correct and changed the course of our history? And how many people were persecuted in the name of spreading conspiracy? Why are we so afraid of conspiracies?')
