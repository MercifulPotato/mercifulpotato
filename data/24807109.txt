I&#x27;ve bought probably over a thousand books of all sorts from thrift stores, often for less than a buck. I have a nice set of encyclopedias I cannot give away. There&#x27;s a sign at the local used book shop &quot;we don&#x27;t want encyclopedias&quot;. There are two Little Free Libraries in my neighborhood I salt with good scifi books, no takers. The local supermarket parking lot has a dumpster which says it collects books, lots of mine wind up there.<p>I gave a box of scifi books to the electrician who came by to do some repairs.<p>I buy grab-bag boxes of scifi off of ebay for $.50 a book.<p>Books are not hard to come by.')
