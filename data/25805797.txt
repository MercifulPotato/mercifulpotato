Item(by='robocat', descendants=None, kids=[25807705, 25810888], score=None, time=1610833534, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25805436, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve heard people complain that the cashier at the grocery store asks &quot;How are you doing?&quot;. &quot;They don&#x27;t really care, why do they ask!&quot;<p>Uggghhhh, I <i>loath</i> being asked that. Firstly, the staff are forced to say it as part of their job and they are checked. It’s inhuman to make someone do that. Also it fucks with my head - now I feel forced to do some interaction to lessen the evil of their work day (it is always shitty jobs) and I find it draining by sympathy. It breaks the humanness of just being polite and thankful to anyone you interact with that is working hard (even if they are tired, emotionally drained, or don’t want to be there).<p>&gt; especially if it&#x27;s only reserved for the local in-group, see: southern &quot;hospitality&quot;<p>Can you explain that?<p>&gt; tipping, I can&#x27;t help but think that it does create some positive incentives in staff here.<p>Tipping is outright disgusting: paying people to be nice just creates inhuman fakeness. The image of some fat leering arsehole, or ugly souled woman, getting their ego stroked by a young wage slave is abhorrent. The worst I ever saw was young American tourists on the coast of Mexico (a small town called San Francisco I think) - the way the tourists treated the staff was wretchedly vile (maybe due to the staff being mostly poor and Mexican?)<p>Edit: that sounded a bit US bashing, so I will add that I have met many wonderful, kind, interesting and friendly Americans. I have even been treated to Southern Hospitality and it seemed genuine enough to me (even though me and my partner essentially just gate-crashed their party on short notice!). Being white and kiwi might help my impressions though...?!<p>Edit: in my experience Canadians and New Zealanders have similar outlooks.')
