Item(by='Arainach', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604800202, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25021491, text='&quot;Ergonomic&quot; is not a boolean value.  Is an ortholinear keyboard 1% more ergonomic than a staggered keyboard?  10%?  Is there even one universal scale?  For me, and for all of the people I know who have tried many keyboards, a split layout is a HUGE improvement over a standard layout.  Ortholinear is far less obvious - the few people I know who have tried one (such as the Kinesis Advantage) have given it up and gone back.<p>Anything different means that you have to switch layouts whenever you go to some other device - whether that means your laptop or someone else&#x27;s machine or whatever.  It requires relearning some bit of mental memory, and even if it can be done it&#x27;s absolutely daunting to users and not something to be dismissed.  If it&#x27;s confusing, that is a risk to sales.<p>I have a Moonlander on preorder and will see if it&#x27;s better than my current staggered split keyboards, but to claim that staggered keyboards aren&#x27;t ergonomic isn&#x27;t just controversial - it&#x27;s flat out wrong.')
