On the other hand, if I have to be completely honest, I can&#x27;t wrap my mind around why would anyone pay for what are you doing, let alone so many people. There is so much free resources on Internet on popular topics (such as Ruby&#x2F;RoR in this case), that I simply don&#x27;t understand how people can pay for something like this (I didn&#x27;t read your articles, but if you churned out 30 articles in 50 days then I dare to make a bold claim they aren&#x27;t world-changing, or presenting something that wasn&#x27;t already there). Just as I will never comprehend how sane person can regulary read tabloids. But as I said, I admire you and would  gladly be in your position, well done.')
