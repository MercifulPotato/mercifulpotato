School should teach you the fundamentals of how to acquire knowledge and then get out of your way.<p>That&#x27;s utopian and a rather unrealistic, incomplete view.  Education is also about imparting a fundamental shared body of knowledge as well, and it also has to deal with a very wide diversity of ability and motivation.  Your proposal is pretty lacking in specifics, but what you have in mind seems to be something that&#x27;s optimized to work very well with an idealized student, which would only be a small fraction of all students, and would likely do worse on average when considering all students.<p>&gt; Reading, writing, speaking, logic, geometry, mathematics, and programming along with a whirlwind tour of all the good and bad ideas throughout history then pack it up.<p>That&#x27;s a weird list.  You include programming but not civics?')
