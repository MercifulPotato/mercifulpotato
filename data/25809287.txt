I&#x27;m American&#x2F;Pakistani (dual passport), with significant family who are in India (including my spouse and grandparents who are Indian citizens).<p>I went with my wife to Pakistan last year. I have plenty of Indian family who visit Pakistan regularly. It can take 6 months-ish to get a visa though and it is very annoying, so I would not blame you for not wanting to go through the process.<p>By the way, as an American I can&#x27;t visit India. I used to visit pre-2007, but since the Mumbai attacks (and further strict restrictions imposed in 2011 onwards) they no longer allow me to apply on my American passport and I&#x27;ve been rejected every time I try on a Pakistani passport.<p>The animosity in that region is so unfortunate and I hope it ends in the future. I&#x27;ve seen countless families kept apart because of it.')
