Am I missing some statement that “not implemented” is temporary?<p>&gt; Calm down.<p>I’m sorry I took my exasperation out on this project which I’m sure is awesome. It’s just a <i>very general</i> frustration I feel about the priorities of the FP+lisp community generally. Like I expressed, it’s exceptionally common to announce a new lisp (language or syntax) where static types are <i>explicitly</i> called out as a headline non-feature.<p>It’s disappointing because every time I see “lisp”, especially “Clojure like”, and I see types addressed explicitly... I keep hoping someone’s come along and married a syntax and (hopefully) state management approach I adore with a static analysis DX I also adore. And 100% of the time so far it’s been... “Types? Glad I got your attention, this isn’t for you!”<p>I’m well aware I’m not entitled to other people building the language I want. I’m even well aware I could build it myself, probably on top of these existing lisps.<p>I’m just disappointed to see so many projects <i>explicitly</i> identify something I want in a way that feels hopeful and bury the “nope we didn’t actually bring a type system to something like clojure” behind the headline.<p>I’m not losing sleep over it (other than to type this between falling asleep on the couch and proper bedtime), but can you understand how that messaging is a disappointing thing?')
