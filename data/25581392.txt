Item(by='addicted', descendants=None, kids=[25583021], score=None, time=1609334362, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25581025, text='The Swedes have been misleading so much on this whole issue it’s hilarious.<p>First, Tegnell refused to believe in asymptomatic transmission.<p>Then he lied that herd immunity was never considered but we have emails from him to the broader scandinavian health directors saying that they should consider herd immunity through natural infection.<p>Then they insist that the only reason Sweden looks so bad is because of care homes (which, btw, is greatly affected by the fact that Tegnell didn’t believe in asymptomatic transmission well after every health department was officially basing policy on it). Well, care homes amounted to about 50% of Swedish deaths. So even if you completely excused Swedish care home deaths, while doing no such thing for its neighbors, it still had a death rate that was 2.5x that of Denmark and even worse compared to its other neighbors. So if we count Danish care home and old people deaths, but don’t count Swedish care home deaths, Sweden is still 2.5x worse in terms of death rates.<p>Finally, for all of that, Sweden was also close to the worst performing economy among its neighbors. Final economic numbers will take some time to really settle in, but what is clear is that Sweden didn’t get any economic benefit for not declaring an official lockdown.<p>Finally, let’s not compare for a moment. Sweden failed on its own terms. Here are some of the things Tegnell said we’re gonna be the benefits of the strategy:<p>1) Close to herd immunity in major parts of Sweden especially Stockholm after the first wave. This was absolutely destroyed when it was discovered that the worst parts of Stockholm had about 10% infected at most. It was nowhere close to the minimum 20-25% they were predicting. \n2) Much better second wave than neighbors. Besides a couple of weeks lag (I’m not entirely clear why this lag existed, but Swedes have a summer tradition apparently of retreating to nature etc, which likely played a role in the improvement over summer as well as delaying the spread), Sweden has once again become the worst affected of its neighbors. \n3) Better 2nd wave than 1st. It’s not worked out that way. The 2nd wave is worse than the first.<p>It would be one thing if the Swedes were like “oh well, this is how we want to do it”. But Tegnell has relied on both Swedish exceptionalism “oh, we Swedes are better than everyone else and so don’t even need to declare lockdowns” and contradictorily has also criticized other governments any week things haven’t looke as bad in Sweden.')
