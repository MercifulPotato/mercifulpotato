A good Spanish teacher emphasizes the parts of the sounds that are different from English, and doesn&#x27;t slow down even close to 0.5x -- it&#x27;s more like 10%, but a much clearer 10%.<p>In this example, a Spanish teacher would have put more of a pause between &quot;Mi&quot; and &quot;hermano&quot;, not such a weird elongation of the &quot;o&quot; in &quot;hermano&quot;, and less emphasis on the &quot;es&quot; (even a native conversation would not have that kind of stress on the &quot;es&quot;).')
