I remember having read this post at the time and considered that that was exactly the right way to go. I started using Whatsapp and paying for it in that moment. I convinced many family members and friends to start using it because of this. Then, when they got enough users, they just decided that none of what they promised was important.<p>Since then, I have actively trying to convince my contacts to move away from WhatsApp, but it is really hard now. This clearly shows that no matter how much trust a company might inspire at a given time, nothing prevents that ten years from now, when everyone is dependent on their technology, they will not change the rules. And nobody will be able to do anything. (Next: Apple, maybe?)')
