There are important pieces of legislation missing around controlling how and when politician&#x27;s can fundraise. Most normal countries legalize lobbying &amp; restrict electioneering to a ~3 month window prior to an election. Additionally, they usually line up election cycles so that you&#x27;re only having an election every 4 years on all parts of government.<p>America has no such restrictions. Members of Congress &amp; the President start running &amp; fundraising now ~2 years before an election (&amp; unofficially before that). For the House of Representatives, that means members are in an electioneering &amp; fundraising mode non-stop. The staggered election cycle in the Senate means that a large portion of the Senate is constantly campaigning further making focusing on the act of governing difficult. Fixing these issues doesn&#x27;t solve all problems obviously but making no reforms isn&#x27;t going to improve things either.')
