The default CSS browser stylesheet is a reverse engineering of how Netscape 2.0 rendered HTML. It had to be, since otherwise CSS wouldn&#x27;t be backwards compatible, which would have killed it. But it was also a good starting point because browsers had to solve this exact problem: Layout text so it it readable regardless of screen dimensions.<p>Except that HTML rending was never specified (and varied significantly between browsers), so CSS basically codified the defacto HTML rendering in mainstream browsers, and then described this as the &quot;browser style sheet&quot;.<p>CSS then allowed the author to override anything they wanted to change. But the default for anything not overriden was the browser style sheet, which was a sane default which adapted to all screen sizes.')
