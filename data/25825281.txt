You pick the doctors and you pay them fully out of pocket.  Your insurance company reimburses you at ~80% of reasonable and customary rates.  If you wind up going for inpatient care it’s different, as is the situation for those in extreme poverty.  Also, you can pay extra for 100% coverage if you want, but ISTR it was expensive and not really worth it for us.<p>Now, when I left, the doctors and insurance companies were setting up an analog of the US system:  If you saw certain doctors, they would not charge you at point of delivery and there was no co-insurance requirement.  It was still new and inconvenient, so I don’t know how that’s worked out.<p>I don’t have direct experience with the Swiss system, but from everything I’ve read, conversations, etc., it’s a slightly cheaper version of the US system.  You buy leveled insurance, you have to pay some out of pocket, etc.')
