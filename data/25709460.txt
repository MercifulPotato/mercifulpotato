What happens when you&#x27;re walking to the store one day, a protest passes by, and you no longer can fly ever again because you were identified on camera in a protest? &quot;But I was just talking to the store!&quot; Sorry, you cannot defend yourself against this because there no longer is any due process. You were on camera and that&#x27;s the entire process. That part of your life that involves flying is now over regardless of your (non-existent) level of involvement in the protest.<p>You really should be careful what you wish for because at this rate, you&#x27;re probably going to get it and much more of it than you ever imagined.')
