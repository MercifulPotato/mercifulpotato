If you don&#x27;t know what to call something, or need to know common practice rather than every possibility, or comprehend an error message, it&#x27;s a lot easier to get it from somebody else who has already solved that problem.<p>Of course somebody has to ask the question first, but with StackOverflow, one person can ask it, and then everybody else can find it via the magic of Google. (And I do mean &quot;magic&quot;: beyond matching keywords, a search engine can, on a good day, point you pages popular with people having similar problems.)<p>I&#x27;m on StackOverflow any time I need to learn a new piece of software, which is pretty common. When I&#x27;m &quot;just programming&quot;, I can get my work done without it due to decades of experience. But keeping current with new technologies often means getting lost in the implementation weeds, and it&#x27;s great when others have already been there and can give me a shortcut out.')
