Those who for some reason don’t understand it. That’s obvious from the scope of problems they highlight. The problem of resolving the data is not really that hard. If someone’s complaining only about it, it can only mean that got stuck at the fist step: making it work. Those who got it work, talk about other problems, that are real: caching, for example. Or lack of URI and troubles with supporting linked data, structuring mutations, etc, etc.. Here, in other threads some people are saying it’s a FAANG only thing and big problems. Others say it’s a small-project scale and solution only to you problems. Make up your mind.\n2. Those who would feel comfortable with backend if thinga stayed at cgi&#x2F;Perl level. I actually have nothing against it.')
