Better shared pool management by the larger senders would help, but a smaller sender should be able to more aggressively protect their shared IPs; I agree in principle. This is extra important for infrequent sending.<p>I still contend that a dedicated IP is superior for deliverability reputation as long as you are sending enough email. For a brand new (to you) dedicated IP, it will need to be warmed up (gradually increase the amount of traffic it sends). There are automated and manual processes to accomplish that, including &quot;pre-warmed&quot; dedicated IPs that were previously in a &quot;good enough&quot; shared pool.')
