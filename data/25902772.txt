We do get benefit out of them, but I think it also leads to people waiting for the next standup to communicate instead of fostering a culture of communicating more pro-actively.<p>In your example: why wait for a standup?  Why not just drop a message in slack saying &quot;working on Y and not sure how to proceed; any ideas?&quot;<p>Personally, I don&#x27;t see the need for standups as long as the team is open about sharing blockers as they come up instead of waiting for the next standup cycle.')
