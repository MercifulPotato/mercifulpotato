So if you&#x27;re looking for Image Capture, you can find it with Transfert d&#x27;Image and with Image Capture.<p>In the case of Gmail, it would mean that you could search both for in:Bin and in:Trash. The only issue would be if someone creates an additional Bin label in a US locale, then in UK, when searching for that label it would also show items in the trash but that&#x27;s a better trade of I think.')
