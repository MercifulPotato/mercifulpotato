Again, all these incidences of journalists being &quot;targeted&quot; have a familiar theme: a journalist is embedded within a mob, and the actions of the mob lead police to arrest the mob (including the journalist). From your article:<p>&gt; Huang was filming a handful of men who had gathered outside the hospital making anti-police statements.<p>&gt; Huang said she followed deputies who were chasing one of the demonstrators after the small group dispersed. She began recording the protester&#x27;s arrest when the deputies shouted at her to â€œback up,&quot; she said.<p>&gt; Sheriff Alex Villanueva refused to apologize for Huang&#x27;s arrest and accused her of &quot;crossing the line from journalism to activism&quot; by coming too close to the scene of the protester&#x27;s arrest.<p>&gt; &quot;In the heat of the moment, when these protesters are calling or chanting for the death of the deputies in the emergency room, she picked the worst time possible to try to get an up-close of the deputies making an arrest,&quot; Villanueva said during a news conference on Monday. &quot;And that&#x27;s on her.&quot;')
