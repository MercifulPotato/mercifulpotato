Like as in cortisol levels spiking from something unexpected or something.<p>But it does cause me problems.  What has helped me a lot is working from home. I have been doing that mainly for like ten years or more.  Not having to deal with the stress of commuting and possibly getting that much more sleep and having 1 or 2 hours of extra time, is a huge deal for me.  Because the biggest symptoms with my health are fatigue and needing to go to the bathroom a lot from the IBS.<p>But you did use the word stress.  I think that is the biggest adjustment I have made compared to most people.  I have deliberately reduced a lot of the causes of stress that people normally have in life.  I have a greatly reduced social life.  Don&#x27;t own a car.  I actually moved to Mexico so that I would be able to easily save money.<p>But the weird thing is because I have always had asthma and acid reflux (which in my adult life has really been a significant breathing issue especially at night etc.), I suspect that most people often think I am just lazy or something.  Especially since those are common problems and lots of times I can operate just fine for hours.  I just usually look tired and sometimes need breaks to crash out for a couple of hours.  But people don&#x27;t see how tired I am because I don&#x27;t go out much or go on video.<p>I was actually hesitating to say that I have those issues. Because a lot of times they end up being fairly minor for other people with good treatment.  For me, in my adult life the acid reflux has been a big deal for breathing and waking up tired and my first surgery attempt so far was not successful.<p>But people generally don&#x27;t cut me any slack for it.  And with a flexible work-from-home schedule, I don&#x27;t need to ask for slack.')
