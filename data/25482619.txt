Visualizations are definitely the most requested feature and something I&#x27;m working on.  It&#x27;s a hard problem to distill so many papers (5-150k) down into a usable graph.  I&#x27;ve made big ones that look amazing but which are not that useful.<p>I like the idea of interactive filters to allow the person to explore it visually. I&#x27;m hoping to have something people can play with in the next few weeks. I hadn&#x27;t really expected the site to take off the way it has and so it&#x27;s not really feature complete yet :)')
