(And therefore I suspect politicians talking about land taxes will by a sign of the end times.)<p>But it is very easy to have cheap housing and lots of it without a land tax. If I could sign a 50 years lease with strong protections that might even be better for me than buying, and landlords would have the usual incentives to build lots of houses if there is demand.<p>The problem in California sounds like the landholders who are being rewarded are the ones who choose not to build more dwellings. Greedy landlords in high-demand areas would build more, because then they make more money. I&#x27;d rather rent to an apartment building of people than a wealthy middle class family. And they&#x27;d be making generational fortunes doing that.')
