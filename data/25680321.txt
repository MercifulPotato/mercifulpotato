Quite a nice setup partnering with a geothermic power plant!<p>Currently I prefer reforestation (or even better yet restoration of swamplands), because it&#x27;s partly EU funded, so there&#x27;s a small multiplier effect, and there&#x27;s still a lot of land for &quot;low hanging&quot; forests, which help with local climate patterns a bit.<p>I&#x27;m aware of what &gt;&gt;we&lt;&lt; need to do, and I&#x27;m already working on the better heating&#x2F;insulation part. But individual action is nothing compared to advocacy in terms of impact.')
