The best phase diagram for H2S and methane that I could find only went up to ~140 barr. Though there were some interesting papers on clathrates and methane in the kilo-barr range, but I&#x27;d not think those were interesting for deep earth experiments. The deep earth is ~3.3 mega-barr, for comparison.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engineeringtoolbox.com&#x2F;hydrogen-sulfide-H2S-properties-d_2034.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engineeringtoolbox.com&#x2F;hydrogen-sulfide-H2S-prop...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engineeringtoolbox.com&#x2F;methane-d_1420.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engineeringtoolbox.com&#x2F;methane-d_1420.html</a>')
