I asked what we do we know about the long term effects of RNA vaccines? Preferably in humans. But as they the vaccines are new and haven&#x27;t been authorized for humans I am skeptical that we can say anything conclusive. So far you haven&#x27;t named one thing that we know. &quot;Lots&quot; isn&#x27;t an answer.<p>&gt; What I do know allows me to conclusively exclude the possibility of the RNA in vaccines incorporating into the host genome (because that notion is simply not coherent).<p>You are just using a strawman argument that some conspiracy theorists have come up with. I never suggested that would be the case.')
