Worse, the UN just made CCP a member of their Human Rights Council until 2023. Meanwhile they keep expanding their concentration camps for Uyghurs and even bragging how they decreased Uyghur birthrates by applying &quot;family planning policies&quot;.<p>And again, the whole world watches, this all brings me to the realization that the slogan &quot;Never Again&quot;, is just that, a slogan, politicians and people in general throw around to signal. It really disgusts me.')
