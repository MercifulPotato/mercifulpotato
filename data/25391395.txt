Then their friends will get them to use it, because a sketchy app will be in that store that offers free money, or some other scam.  My parents will then breach the secure containment of their phone, without really understanding what they&#x27;re doing.<p>It would harm Apple, because when users try the third party app store and have problems, they will expect Apple to support it.
