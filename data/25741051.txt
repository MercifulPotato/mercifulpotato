And I remember riots all summer. It&#x27;s unfortunate that those people succeeded in storming the Capitol, but I see it more as a coincidence than specific to Trump fans. BLM tried to take down federal buildings, too.<p>And what would be the point of taking over more capitols? It&#x27;s not as if as soon as you occupy the capitols, you magically get to control the country. All that will remain from last week is some people being thrown in jail (or worse).<p>So no, I don&#x27;t see it as a credible threat.')
