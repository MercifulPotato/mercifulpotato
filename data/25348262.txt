He spoke about how there&#x27;s some trips where you&#x27;re miserable in the moment (cold, bug-bitten) but when it&#x27;s all over you have fond memories of the experience and consider it worthwhile.<p>If you mean specific to Jobs, I don&#x27;t have any and was just trying to relate to the OP comment, which is why I couched it with the caveat that I have no insight into his psychology. Maybe he generally was happy during the moment and maybe he was actually miserable when reflecting on his life, I have no idea.')
