It&#x27;s a product produced by interpolating data from validated weather stations, taking into account elevation among other things. For example, doing straight interpolation between weather stations without taking into account elevation can lead to some very wrong results. In fact, PRISM stands for &quot;Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model&quot;[0]. Also, the high-resolution PRISM data is not free, as it&#x27;s a data product of OSU&#x2F;NACSE. It costs real $$$.<p>Aside from point, weather station observations, most weather&#x2F;climate data is gridded and you are right, GDAL provides lots of tools for processing and transforming gridded (raster) data products. DevelopmentSeed (no affiliation) creates some neat tools and I&#x27;d recommend following OSGEO[2] and the FOSS4G conference.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prism.oregonstate.edu&#x2F;documents&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;1997appclim_PRISMapproach_daly.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prism.oregonstate.edu&#x2F;documents&#x2F;pubs&#x2F;1997appclim...</a>\n[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;developmentseed" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;developmentseed</a>\n[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osgeo.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osgeo.org&#x2F;</a>')
