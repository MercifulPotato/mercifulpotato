With you alluding to be a liberal, you&#x27;ve just proven that racism transcends American politics of left and right.<p>&gt; I hate racists too which is why I prefer not having them in my state.<p>I am sorry that somewhere along the way you were hurt so much that it would push you to blame all of your misfortunes on another race or ethnic group, similar to poverty stricken members of neo-Nazis and the KKK; but you need to have a hard look in the mirror and do some serious self-introspection.<p>Let&#x27;s re-read your comments.<p><i>&quot;_You_ go to Idaho and Wyoming. California is our state.&quot;</i><p>I didn&#x27;t understand it at the time, but you were telling me that CA only belonged to members of your own ethnic group.<p><i>&quot;My qualms are more with the demographic changes these massive migrations brought. Just very greedy overly ambitious and pretentious people. To me they make terrible neighbors and have zero regard for the land, nature or the people here. Some I assume are good people but I haven&#x27;t met any.&quot;</i><p>Your comments in just a single thread, really just this specific comment, already meet the textbook definition of a racist. In fact, I can attribute what you just wrote to a white supremacist, and it wouldn&#x27;t seem out of place.<p><i>racist - a person who is prejudiced against or antagonistic toward people on the basis of their membership in a particular racial or ethnic group with the belief that groups of humans possess different behavioral traits corresponding to physical appearance</i><p>If you can&#x27;t reconcile this and change, then I agree with your statement. I also prefer not having racists in my state and I like diversity because life is richer with it, so it would be nice if racists like yourself left California or the United States entirely, regardless of whether they think they are conservative or liberal. In fact, please leave HN. People with your ideology need to either change or leave.')
