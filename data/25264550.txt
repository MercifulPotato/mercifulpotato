If there are 5,000 categories constructed and they are roughly evenly distributed, &quot;top four&quot; tells us nothing. If 99% of the probability mass is in #1, &quot;top four&quot; tells us nothing.<p>That is correct, but please note that it&#x27;s still a significant component. In the 15-24 age group, the top 1 cause has 13.4k deaths, the top 2 has 5.7k, and homicide has 5.1k. That&#x27;s not very far away in relative terms.')
