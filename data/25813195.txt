That comment was <i>not</i> made by the employee who was fired.)<p>(edit: see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25813184" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25813184</a> which adds some additional context. I assumed when writing this comment that the nazi healthcare joke was part of the 1&#x2F;6&#x2F;2020 thread &amp; a direct response to warning about violence in DC. Apparently that post was <i>NOT</i> made a direct response to the thread on 1&#x2F;6, but was instead made in a context where it&#x27;s meant to be taken as a tounge-in-cheek criticism of nazi&lt;-&gt;X equivocation rather than as a basal joke... Unfortunately, I wrote this comment assuming that the joke was basal and now I can&#x27;t delete this comment but there&#x27;s substantial down-thread discussion already. Therefore, I am leaving my original comment, which I wrote before seeing that clarifying post, so that the down-thread discussion doesn&#x27;t cause even more confusion.)<p>Original comment:<p>I&#x27;ve interacted with people who think jokes like this are funny, even when there&#x27;s no extra layer of hidden meaning or anything like that. Where the joke is literally &quot;haha nazis gave jews healthcare haha get it because they actually killed all the jews haha&quot;. That&#x27;s it. No hidden meaning, no second layer, just... a really stupid &quot;joke&quot;? in terrible taste.<p>Probably it&#x27;s  safe assumption that most of the people who think these sorts of jokes are funny are in fact actually genocidal or at least anti-Semitic?<p>I have met one person who would laugh at these sorts of &quot;jokes&quot; and who I sorta don&#x27;t think was actually anti-Semitic. Or at least that&#x27;s not <i>all</i> that was going on. Both because he was a practicing jew and also because he laughed at a lot of other really stupid and tasteless but not overtly bigoted &quot;jokes&quot;. Stuff like taking pictures of his poop.<p>I really can&#x27;t explain why he thought these sorts of jokes were funny. I&#x27;m not a psychologist so I genuinely don&#x27;t know the word for what&#x27;s wrong with him.<p>There are A LOT of people with undiagnosed psychological disorders for whom complaints about &quot;PC police&quot; are an entry-point to radicalization. The &quot;spark&quot; is being fired or socially marginalized for lacking any amount of social awareness. Through that entry point, they find people on the internet who tell them that there is nothing wrong with them and that it&#x27;s all the fault of the &quot;PC police&quot; and &quot;cancel culture&quot;. And then the radicalization starts.<p>IDK what the solution is. To be clear, people really should not be expected to work alongside others who make jokes about genocide or harass co-workers with scat pics. But also, to be just as clear, there&#x27;s a very dark strand of US politics that is growing stronger, can&#x27;t just be ignored anymore. That movement is making an intentional effort to radicalize people who are fired from their jobs, or fear being fired from their jobs, for their lack of social etiquette.')
