TOC could message, and manage your buddy list, and set your idle time and your status message; but it couldn&#x27;t do typing notifications, and probably not some other things. I believe they used TOC tunneled over HTTP(s?) for their Java applet client, if you used that.<p>I seem to recall it went through periods of unavailability from time to time, so I would go back and forth between TOC stuff I wrote and understood and OSCAR libraries that barely half worked.')
