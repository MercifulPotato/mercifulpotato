I hope everyone who can gets one.  These are just my thoughts on why we see skepticism.<p>The more the media treats covid vaccines like they&#x27;re marketing the latest iphone release the more skeptical I become.  It&#x27;s very unsettling to me personally.<p>Black people in this country have the Tuskeegee experiment as a huge reason to be skeptical of vaccines.<p>Over the course of the last year the sense-making organizations have lost a ton of credibility by lying to get the outcome they wanted instead of educating us.
