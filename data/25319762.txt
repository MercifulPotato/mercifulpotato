When CEOs are hired they are screened to be the sort of people who want to make money. If I had a controlling share of a company and the CEO didn&#x27;t want to make profitable decisions there isn&#x27;t any special legal construct needed - he&#x27;d be gone and somebody new would be hired. Most shareholders are the same.<p>&gt; ... regardless if they might feel that the community would be better served by using the land for something which would, incidentally, make less money for them personally ...<p>The community obviously disagrees with our landholder in this scenario, or the community can stump up the cash to pay the land taxes or hold the land publically.<p>It is just 1 more expense. It isn&#x27;t like running a soup kitchen was ever free, someone is paying for the soup. Giving a donation of space is the same as giving a donation of time and materials.<p>There are incentives, but there isn&#x27;t anything especially new here. It isn&#x27;t going to be radically different from a mortgage in the short term, and in the long term the change is competent people will own land instead of old families.')
