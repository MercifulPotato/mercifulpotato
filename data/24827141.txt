If you produce 3,120 lbs a year, that gives you about a million calories.<p>Now, let&#x27;s assume a family of three - an average person needs around 2,000 kcal a day. That&#x27;s 2,000 * 365 * 3, or around 2,200,000 kcal a year. So, you come quite a bit short. And that&#x27;s on a good year; you&#x27;re gonna have bad years, too.<p>Also a function of climate and soil. In the 19th century, settlers in the plains - Nebraska, Wyoming, etc - often couldn&#x27;t make it work on 640 acres granted by the government. In contrast, there are eastern states where 20 acres would be more than enough.<p>(Farming in the West is now much more viable thanks to deep wells and mechanical irrigation, but that&#x27;s a capital-intensive and resource-intensive approach that works best at a scale.)')
