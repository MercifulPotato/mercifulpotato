I was amazed at how well it worked out, but it is a bit fiddly to use. Then again, musical notation can be fiendishly complicated, so figuring out how to make a music scorer that a rookie like me can use at all is quite an accomplishment.<p>It&#x27;s a lot nicer for me to use than Lilypond&#x2F;Frescobaldi - especially when I want to use handbell articulations (martellato, tower swing, gyrate, and so on). I transcribed a couple of vocal pieces using Frescobaldi, and while that worked, I started running into blank walls when I wanted to do something handbell-related.')
