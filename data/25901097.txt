We also considered the PHEV (plugin hybrid with battery for up to 60km) but it has a bit less storage space (because of the battery), we don&#x27;t have anywhere to charge it and it&#x27;s quite a bit more expensive. It can work very well for people who can charge at home with 30km commute (or charging also at work and 60km commute) though and it&#x27;s still cheaper than pure electric.')
