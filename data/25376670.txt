In the case of the weather, disseminating the forecasts is just as critical as making the forecasts in the first place.<p>These forecasts directly affect everything from air travel to crop planting&#x2F;harvesting to sea travel. They are <i>critical</i> for our economic (and citizen&#x27;s) ongoing health.<p>And the internet, for better or worse, is the primary means of dissemination for the NOAA. Failing in this is failing at one of their greatest duties, IMO.')
