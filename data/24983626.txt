Maybe because they like finding their home state&#x2F;county&#x2F;city.  For whatever reason, they love maps.<p>I&#x27;ve also learned the hardest part of my job is getting people to read and remember the data.  Replacing their preconceived notions is difficult.  I&#x27;ll use any cheap trick (short of showing data inaccurately) to do this.  So I make them the maps they love.  I use the colors they expect.  If I show tables, they&#x27;re used by experts for further analysis and ignored by the people who actually make decisions.<p>&gt;The saturated red and blue colors have an almost astrological meaning to people, it&#x27;s got nothing to do with information.<p>That meaning is information.  Is it the best thing for a nuanced data graphic?  No.  But showing a nuanced graphic is like handing somebody <i>Principia Marhematica</i> when they ask what 1 + 1 is.  Sure, it had the answer.  And sure, it&#x27;s great for people with mathematical skill.  But it&#x27;s overkill most of the time.')
