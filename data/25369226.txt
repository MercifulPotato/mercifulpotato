At the time I think it started to mess with my confidence too.<p>&gt; As an aside I know a guy who completely fucked himself by doing mdma farvto much. It was really sad to meet him after a few years, he&#x27;d gone from happy outgoing to a paranoid mess.<p>The public discourse on MDMA is in a strange place. Many people desperately want to believe that it doesn&#x27;t have negative consequences, but anyone who has watched acquaintances go downhill with repeated MDMA use knows that it&#x27;s hardly free of side effects. The problem is that internet commenters will quickly come up with any and every excuse to dismiss negative studies, anecdotes, and evidence. The usual strategy is to blame polydrug abuse or imply that the drugs were somehow impure.')
