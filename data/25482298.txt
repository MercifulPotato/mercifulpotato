I&#x27;m not sure what to expect when you compare the lowest end first generation processor from Apple to one of the more high-end of the spectrum x86.<p>Edit: Forgot to mention how the power draw on the M1 is still significantly less; m1 with all cores @ 100% is ~20W whereas the x86 ryzen was at 17.3W for 1 one core<p>&gt; To conclude that it performs better than the existing x86 CPUs, is a mistake.<p>True, no denying that. Exciting times in this market; I wonder how much better gen 2 of Apple&#x27;s chips will be if the lowest end can do this.')
