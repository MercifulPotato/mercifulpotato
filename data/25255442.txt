Item(by='FpUser', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606753487, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25251521, text='This drive train simply can not handle high torque as the chainrings will bend under load. They admit it themselves. Increasing their thickness will cause a whole lot of compatibility problems and also turn the whole thing into a monster.<p>This expensive ceramic bearings are exposed and will experience significant wear. Properly insulating them would wipe out whatever miniscule gain in efficiency they claim as the insulation increases losses.<p>Finally reducing chain friction (which is already very low on a tuned drivetrain) to some fraction (that has yet to be proven for real conditions) is tantamount to snake oil in my opinion.<p>These are just few. I could go on but it is not worthy the typing and mental efforts.')
