I’m not entirely sure I want to put that in, though. The message I’m “preaching” is that you have full decoupling with queues - not sure that should be diluted.

It seems unlikely that Amazon would stop selling stuff just because the order-confirmation-email-sending-service was backed up, for instance. The point of using SQS would be that the sales system wouldn’t have to care.')
