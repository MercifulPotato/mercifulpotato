That&#x27;s an insane number if correct. Here in EU a car that averages 7-8L&#x2F;100km is considered to have poor fuel economy. My previous car was a Mercedes AMG that over 4 years averaged 12L&#x2F;100km and that was considered absolutely abysmal by everyone, people were wondering how I can afford the fuel for it. And you&#x27;re telling me that the <i>average</i> for Australian cars is higher than that??')
