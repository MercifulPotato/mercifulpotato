For me personally, I was happyish during my career but I&#x27;m definitely much, much happier now that I&#x27;m wealthy and retired. And it&#x27;s not a short term buzz, I&#x27;ve been retired for 2 years and the feeling hasn&#x27;t worn off. I know it sucks we don&#x27;t have unlimited resources for everyone in society to be free and 100% happy. Maybe someday we will with full automation.<p>In the meantime, most people tend to agree with me that at least to a degree more money = more happiness, it&#x27;s the reason that capitalism works afterall, and it raises the standard of living - or choice of not working - for all of us over time')
