The company demanded 11,000€. I think that was 2017 or 2018.<p>Supposedly I broke my contract by not following protocol after the accident and therefore my insurance was nil.<p>Suffice to say I did. I had four witnesses, date &amp; time &amp; incident number of the police report, yadayadayada.<p>I got a lawyer[1]. The whole thing went nowhere. I.e. I didn&#x27;t pay, except for the lawyer who wrote exactly one letter to them.<p>But I was blocked to use their vehicles until that company and another joined into a new enterprise.\nUpon which my record was magically wiped clean – I could use the part of the new fleet belonging to the vendor whose car I had had the accident with again.<p>Ah, the merits of database mergers ...<p>The issue all these car sharing companies have is their insurance.<p>When these businesses started they needed insurance. What happened was that all the car insurance companies declined. Because how do you calculate the insurance if the driver changes all the time?<p>So what these companies did was open their own insurance companies. While these are separate business entities it boils down to any damages coming out of their pockets. They have a vested interest in finding you in breach of their TOS so you are not covered by (their) insurance any more.<p>How do I know? The lawyer I got was an expert in those cases. I was not the first of his clients with this issue.\nI can suggest him to anyone in Berlin who runs into such an issue.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ra-samimi.de&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ra-samimi.de&#x2F;</a><p>P.S.: A Canadian friend of mine had exactly the same happen to them there. Accident with car2go. Car2go purports breach of contract and demands full damages. He gets a lawyer. The thing goes nowhere. But he is since blocked from using car2go. Go figure.')
