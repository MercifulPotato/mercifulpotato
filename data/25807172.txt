It&#x27;s fun to collect the orb while you escape from the pirates. But after a while it&#x27;s boring, so it&#x27;s nice to have an upgrade to get magnetism. (It&#x27;s also a tradeoff, you can buy weapons or shield or comfort.)<p>For me it&#x27;s fine that magnetism and vision are in the same upgrade.')
