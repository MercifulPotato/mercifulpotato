But who cares? There&#x27;s nothing in there that&#x27;s secret, and it&#x27;s just the same as what you would get from the public GitHub repo, so whatever.<p>That some linting tools warns on this: sure, that&#x27;s reasonable.<p>That random bots start emailing me about this without even the slightest scrutiny because it <i>might</i> expose my super-duper secret proprietary code: that&#x27;s just spam and rude.')
