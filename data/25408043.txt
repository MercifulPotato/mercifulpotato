With bonds you are virtually guaranteed to lose value over time as real yields are negative (against inflation).  Thats a risk.  Getting poor slowly and not keeping up with other rising assets is a threat to wealth even when you might feel safe from low vol.  With bitcoin the long term moving average is up despite short term volatility and network effects are quite difficult to overcome.  Bitcoin is a good holding if you plan to lock it up for 10 years vs bonds.<p>It was crazy to think this 5 years ago, now its less crazy, and tomorrow it will be normal.  That my thesis and its also why billionaires are pouring in right now.  If you asked me to hold a bitcoin vs a bond equivalent for long term the decision is easy for me especially knowing that global debt monetization is essentially a necessity at this point.')
