I personally think drive hardware is rather more fallible than this article assumes.<p>With that said, of course ZFS is not a magic bullet, and there&#x27;s no substitute for backups - but ZFS does make that easier too, because snapshotting is trivial, and zfs send | zfs receive is very useful for transferring the snapshots to another pool for backup. And it does require an amount of reading and understanding before you set it up.')
