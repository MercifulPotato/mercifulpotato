Depending on the language they&#x27;ll show me all references, take me to the definition or declaration, stack those jumps so as I follow the links I can pop back a level to where I was. All of this is instant. 1000x faster than opening a shell and trying to grep all the project files for word phrases which, not being language aware, can&#x27;t tell if one &#x27;foo&#x27; is relevant or irrelevant from another &#x27;foo&#x27;. They&#x27;ll also let me refactor various things from renaming a method&#x2F;class&#x2F;variable&#x2F;function and correctly fixing all the related files to doing things like changing class members to getter&#x2F;setters and other things.<p>The difference is like using a hammer vs using a nail gun. There are times where they hammer is useful but given the job of constructing a building a nail gun will get the job done much faster.')
