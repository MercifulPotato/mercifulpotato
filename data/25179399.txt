This lets me program and test the peripheral on a desktop PC, and use it in both worlds if I want to. Plus, it&#x27;s easy to spin up real time functionality on an MCU that&#x27;s not trying to run a full blown OS. I use one of the many MCU boards that&#x27;s programmed via the Arduino environment, but that&#x27;s certainly not obligatory.')
