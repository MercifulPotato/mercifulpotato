Why do they need so load so much just to show a chat widget circle in the corner that likely won&#x27;t even be clicked on the majority of the time?<p>170KB for the chat widget is good but when you&#x27;re trying to make minimal fast loading pages, this is still feels like a lot. If you avoid JS, use minimal CSS and stick to SVG images, you can get whole landing pages to load in under 500KB.<p>One trick I use though is to delay loading chat widget JS for about 5 or 10 seconds after the page loads. It&#x27;s not needed immediately and the delay lets the browser prioritise loading the rest of the page first.')
