Matrix (Element) is ever so sloowly getting there, it&#x27;s slightly better than Signal now in some areas and worse in others, but neither (nor whatsapp or any other messenger) come close to Telegram.<p>Wire is also a good contender but they seem to have found that if you don&#x27;t sell user data, there is little money to be made from personal accounts and are focusing more on business accounts. You can still register and use it as an individual, though (and I continue to do so). It has more features than Signal and isn&#x27;t funded by Facebook so that&#x27;s a plus, but the UX is slightly worse than Signal.<p>Makes you wonder what Telegram is going to make money with though. It&#x27;s a huge liability for me, just so damn convenient... Need to find a better alternative.')
