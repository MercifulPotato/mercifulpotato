Their billing system was set up so that you couldn&#x27;t update the features on an account (a feature being a data plan or texting plan, for example) unless _all_ of the features on the account were current.<p>It was a pretty blatant move to push customers off of grandfathered plans. For example this was about 10 years ago when iPhones were becoming popular, and at the time at least there were iPhone specific features for data plan and visual voicemail. So someone upgrading to an iPhone would be forced to give up any grandfathered plans on their account.')
