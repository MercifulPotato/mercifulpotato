Item(by='iso1631', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611516355, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25891170, text='One of my cars does 30 miles a day and is in the driveway from 1600-0730, so needs 10kwH in 15 hours, or a draw of 700W. 10 years ago the lights in my house drew about 700W.<p>The other car does 6 miles 3 times a week and is in the driveway almost all the time.<p>Sure, there are whales that do 300 miles a week, but that&#x27;s not most people.<p>Looking at a sample of about 13 million vehicles that passed MOT tests in both 2018 and 2019, and thus reported the milage<p>Percentiles\n  20%: 2700\n  40%: 4800\n  50%: 6000\n  60%: 7000\n  80%: 10500\n  90%: 14000\n  95%: 17000<p>Lets assume that&#x27;s all commuting over 5 days a week, 47 weeks a year. That means in an average 12 hour night:<p>20% of cars would need less than 11 miles of charge, or 4kWh -- 350W<p>Another 20% of cars would need less than 21 miles of charge, or 7kWh -- 600W<p>Another 20% of cars would need less than 10kWh -- 850W<p>Another 20% of cars would need less than 15kWh -- 1.25kW<p>Another 15% of cars would need 24kWh -- 2kW<p>All of that is less than a kettle, an average 13A plug is more than enough.<p>Now if those mileages include many people doing long distance drives at weekends and not regular commuting, the actual top-up needed every night isn&#x27;t anywhere near as much. Some cars will do lots of miles at the weekend and need to draw the full 3kW out of a standard socket, sure. My kettle doesn&#x27;t have an issue with doing that. For every car needing that full charge on a Sunday and during the rest of the week, there&#x27;s a dozen that don&#x27;t. OK, your battery might be down to 10% on Sunday night, but then you charge it to 20% for Monday morning, drop to 17% after your commute, charge to 27% Tuesday, and so on.<p>100A, or even 60A, house breakers aren&#x27;t going to have an issue with keeping 95% of cars topped up, so you&#x27;re at the next level. On the rare occasion you need to fully recharge really quickly, go to a specialist location with a 20kW+ charger. The data shows that most people won&#x27;t need that most of the time.<p>Looking at newer cars -- ones made in 2016 (and thus having first MOT in 2019), you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d have a higher mileage. And they do, median is 8400, and 80%ile is 13,300, 95% 22700 -- about 30% higher in each bracket, but that&#x27;s still well within a home charge range, even for the 95%ile, and only 1 in 4 cars are new enough to be in that category, so median mileage of all cars would be under 7,000 miles a year range.<p>You&#x27;re right there&#x27;s a grid level problem -- the dip in power generation in the UK overnight is about 10GW, which could sustain about 14 million cars - not too great when there&#x27;s more than twice that needing power.<p>Assuming that in a given area cars are distributed fairly evenly as above, with some cars needing 24kWh a night, but others needing 4kWh, the average overnight draw would still only be 700W, that doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to trip neighbourhood substations, but further upstream could be problems.')
