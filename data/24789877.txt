Pharmaceutical companies have the benefit of knowing &quot;product-market fit&quot; ahead of time so a successful phase 3 is all but guaranteed a multi-billion dollar acquisition (it even happens at phase 2 for promising candidates). This has been going on for decades with increasing frequency thanks to the pharma industry falling off the small molecule cliff and analyzing these companies in the same group as VC subsidized rideshare or whatever isn&#x27;t going to yield the best results.')
