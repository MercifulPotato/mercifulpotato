Solve that problem.<p>The solution to this problem seems quite trivial to me: to equip all cars with alcohol (and, perhaps, some drug) sensors [not breathalyzers, but rather some more sophisticated remote-sensing devices], strategically located throughout interior to prevent cheating &#x2F; gaming the system, and integrate them with ignition and engine. As long as the system determines that a driver is drunk or under influence of drugs, it prevents the car from starting or (in case someone starting drinking or using drugs after stopping a car, but leaving it idling) moving.')
