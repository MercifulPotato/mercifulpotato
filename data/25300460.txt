Ideally contractual protection for the employee equity pool.<p>* Offer documents must include a 409a valuation and share price.  (I have gotten multiple offers with just a number of shares.  And in one case the company was literally peddling a false valuation in my offer).<p>* 401k with company match, even for a small company.  Lottery ticket is not a retirement plan.<p>Ideally in my mind:<p>* Employees get convertible debt that is either as senior as investor debt or pays a 5% dividend.<p>* Double standard employee pool to 20%; keep 30% founder pool size.<p>* No ISOs or non-quals ever.  Extremely tax toxic, and employees can actually get driven into debt from the job.  Options should be outright forbidden for comp packages under $1m &#x2F; year.  The tax games are absolutely not worth it.<p>The main way any positive change can happen is for employees either to negotiate for it during offers or for founders to just start doing it to be more competitive.  One might argue that Carta has made 83b easier by chasing a private stock marketplace... perhaps there are other mechanisms for change.')
