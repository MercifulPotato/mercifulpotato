We had shared terminals, Sun was even trying to turn remote VMs into a feasible business model. I am very skeptical of the idea that Open Source developers never considered that someone might want to sell computer hosting or provide API access to a virtual environment.<p>I mean, doesn&#x27;t the whole problem with modern Linux security stem from the fact that it&#x27;s user-specific; that it was designed around this idea that it would be running on a server and accessed by a bunch of different user accounts &amp; terminals? It was personal computers that were the surprise, not shared hosting and remote terminals&#x2F;APIs.<p>Am I off base here? This doesn&#x27;t square with how I understand computing history.')
