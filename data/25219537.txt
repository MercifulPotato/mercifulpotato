Stuff gets better, cheaper, and more convenient for the consumer, while the companies duke it out to get ahead.<p>But when things get overly regulated, subsidized, or effective cartels are formed, you end up with situations like monotonically rising US healthcare costs, monotonically rising US housing costs and monotonically rising US college costs.<p>This isn&#x27;t an issue of too much free market competition.')
