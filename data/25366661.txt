Item(by='qchris', descendants=None, kids=[25366825], score=None, time=1607555199, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25364878, text='I know that there&#x27;s a formal definition of capitalized &quot;Open Source&quot; by the OSI, but I&#x27;m also not enchanted by that being the only definition for lower-case &quot;open source&quot;. I think that the lower case open source is really more about a general approach to software (or intellectual property in general, really). Some people want to use terms like &quot;libre&quot; to refer to projects that have most of the practical characteristics of open source projects, but not an OSI-approved license, but I kind of think that the lower-case version of the term is important because it&#x27;s reached a point of basically a colloquialism.<p>There&#x27;s room for a grey area, but I think that the parent&#x27;s comment about how Mongo&#x27;s license relates to the overwhelming majority of it&#x27;s community to use it (in that, functionally, it doesn&#x27;t) still pushes farther towards open source than it does proprietary with source-available.')
