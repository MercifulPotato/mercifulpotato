It&#x27;s great for people who game, but beyond a certain baseline, it&#x27;s pretty pointless for most of us.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not saying this isn&#x27;t good, it&#x27;s great for people editing, but this isn&#x27;t a general indicator of performance<p>Umm, it&#x27;s also great for people who watch YouTube or Netflix. Zoom calls use the encoder and the decoder. Fundamentally, modern computers do a crapload of video (and audio!) decoding and encoding. Arguably for most of us, it is more important than having a high performance GPU.<p>This is all trebly important when you are using Netflix, YouTube, HBO Max, Zoom, Skype, etc on battery where the specialized encoder uses about 1&#x2F;3 the power as the CPU.')
