But travis made it so damn easy <i>and</i> free to turn on, there was no reason not to try it. Once tried, there was no going back, we would never want to do otherwise.<p>Travis really defined this market and opened up CI testing to entire communities. We owe them (employees, former management) a debt of gratitude for that.<p>But then we come to depend upon it for sure. Which they had no obligation to supply it forever, and perhaps it wasn&#x27;t even sustainable business to do so. So now what? Well, now we move over to other free options like Github Actions which fortunately exist.<p>But is it dangerous to depend on the largesse of for-profit companies? FOR SURE.<p>Is it, at this point, hard to figure out how to do otherwise? FOR SURE.<p>So, what could we do instead? In my dream world, we&#x27;d have a non-profit collaborative project to provide CI to open source on an ability-to-pay basis. Is that likely? I dunno, raising money for open source is already a problem. And it&#x27;s a hard project. As long as there are companies providing it to us for free, it&#x27;s definitely less likely.')
