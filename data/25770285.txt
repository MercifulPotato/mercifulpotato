As some people have pointing out &quot;a new administration will be inaugurated on January 20&quot; could mean &quot;my second administration&quot; and not &quot;Biden&#x27;s administration.&quot; I realize that&#x27;s splitting hairs, and I don&#x27;t think that Trump is so clever as to rely on such a level of plausible deniability, but there are several among his supporters who will hold to that interpretation.<p>And after he put out that video, he went back on Twitter to complain about election fraud, which rather undercuts his message.')
