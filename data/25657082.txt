It was used for netowkr configuration and it was only partly programmed in Prolog:<p><i>Microsoft&#x27;s Windows NT operating system uses an embedded Prolog interpreter to configure its local and wide-area network systems. Interdependent software and hardware components are abstracted into a simplified object-oriented framework using declarative information provided by each component&#x27;s installation script. This information, along with the Prolog algorithm, is consulted into the embedded interpreter, which is then queried to construct the most usable configuration. The algorithm which solves the plumbing problem is described, including its positive and negative constraints, Prolog database and efficiency considerations. The results of the query, stored into NT&#x27;s configuration database, inform each component of its load order and binding targets. A description of theC++ wrapper class is given and portation considerations are discussed. The Small Prolog interpreter is briefly described.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20040603192757&#x2F;research.microsoft.com&#x2F;research&#x2F;dtg&#x2F;davidhov&#x2F;pap.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20040603192757&#x2F;research.microsof...</a><p>I&#x27;m not sure how &quot;super important&quot; that was to be honest. My impression has always been that the programmer in question simply wanted to use Prolog in his day job (a feeling I can very much sympathise with).')
