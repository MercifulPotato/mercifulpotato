Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608411225, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25475506, text='<i>&gt; Why is it so hard for people to look at the system instead of just themselves?</i><p>Vaccines were never intended to benefit the system at the expense of individuals. Every vaccine was a net benefit to individuals when it was first made available. That is why there was never any serious objection to widespread adoption of vaccines.<p>There are cases where people might have to sacrifice their own welfare for the good of society, such as military service in combat. But I don&#x27;t think vaccination is, or should be, one of those cases. If a person believes their risk of harm from a vaccine outweighs the benefit, they should have the right to choose not to take it.<p>There are also cases where people might have to forgo short-term <i>benefits</i> for the long-term good of society. I think far too little attention is paid to such cases, to the detriment of all of us. But vaccines are not such a case; no one is forgoing a short term benefit by taking a vaccine. Individuals gain a benefit from a vaccine, the question is whether that benefit for the individual is worth taking the small risk of harm from the vaccine.<p>What <i>does</i> seem like a case where people should forgo a (perceived) short-term benefit for the long-term good of society, is trying to justify things like forcing people to get vaccinated on the basis of flawed arguments and distortions of the facts. And of course Boeing with the 737 MAX is another such case.')
