Merchant A calculated they can earn $x from y customers in a hours, so they can afford rent accordingly.  Merchant B calculates they can earn more than $x by increasing the number of customers, therefore merchant B offers to pay a higher rent.  Now they have to make sure sufficient customers (or sufficient revenue per customer per hour) is being met to afford the rent.<p>Only solution would be to move to a place with lower rents, I think.  Or start explicitly paying rent for your table at the cafe per unit of time, but that might be unsavory to most people.')
