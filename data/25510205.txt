I know some people with liberal views who voted republican simply for tax purposes. Ignoring that this itself may be considered a bad view, I don&#x27;t look down on republicans like some of my fellow liberal &#x27;elites&#x27; do. I see them as human beings who I want to give healthcare and education to, like any other.<p>But, just as republicans have generalised the motivations of democrats to justify certain destructive behaviours, I generalise the actions of republicans.')
