I don&#x27;t consider myself as weird, so I act like I normally would, otherwise I&#x27;m setting myself up for failure later on.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t wear to an interview what I wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable wearing on a normal working day. I dress casual on purpose (but representably casual, not weird casual -- but that&#x27;s my personal opinion of course).')
