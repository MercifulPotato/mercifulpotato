Or if you prefer a &quot;proof of work&quot; system like Bitcoin.\n Without consumerism, a person whose only skill is &quot;making near-useless stuff&quot; will starve, and likewise will a person with skills but can&#x27;t get a job because someone else is willing to work 60hrs&#x2F;wk instead of 2 people x 30hrs&#x2F;wk.<p>At an individual level, you could pay businesses&#x2F;people to do useful work like picking up litter or charity&#x2F;NGO projects')
