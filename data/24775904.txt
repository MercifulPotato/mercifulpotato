I&#x27;d love a pattern matching macro because that would let me express my logic in a manner which more closely matches the semantics.<p>Macros can be abused just like decorators, classes, or functions to make complex code that&#x27;s difficult to understand or modify. While macros give you a bit more rope, used properly they can be very handy.')
