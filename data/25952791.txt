Third-party clients bridging different networks together in a single polished app for user’s convenience become a viable possibility.<p>Suddenly, the field is more competitive. Not having to compete against incumbents riding on investor&#x2F;ad money and past network effects anymore, new social networks can survive by differentiating themselves—by price, uptime, speed, privacy and security controls, customer care, data interoperability, different standards of moderation, and so on.<p>Suddenly, troll armies and mass misinformation campaigns become less viable: payments leave traces, and social networks no longer benefit from inflated active user counts.<p>Apple might be well-positioned to start this trend, though I have qualms about them doing it. Based on their approach to other products, it seems unlikely they would offer a complete and well-documented API to empower third-party clients.')
