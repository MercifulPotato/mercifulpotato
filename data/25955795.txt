As far as I can tell, you need the app installed to review. I&#x27;m guessing you can only review one. I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;d need to use separate accounts, but that you could use one physical device (although Google could obviously limit reviews-per-device to a reasonable number). Can you affiliate more than one account with the same bank account?')
