Intentionally causing a surveillance device to be installed in someone&#x27;s home (which he clearly did) without their consent must present some legal issues?<p>Likewise, individuals are in some cases liable for the results traps they set. For example, the countdown (on the latest video) is troubling because it&#x27;s reasonable to expect people to panic, and act erratically in response. What happens if they seriously injure themselves trying to escape the imagined bomb?<p>Someone else doing something illegal (stealing your &quot;trap&quot; package) doesn&#x27;t protect you from prosecution or lawsuits.<p>Anyway, it would hear about the discussion with they had with lawyers before they did this. There&#x27;s very little depth in many of the more recent videos. They&#x27;re merely entertainment, not educational&#x2F;engineering videos.')
