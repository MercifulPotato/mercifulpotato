I&#x27;m not from the US so maybe it is yet &quot;Another US Thing I Don&#x27;t Understand&quot; (sorry). Where I&#x27;m at (in Scandinavia) not only would this not be allowed on the roads but even if I buy an old car and want to <i>upgrade it</i> (modern brakes?) it wouldn&#x27;t be allowed without a car inspection and it would no longer have a cheaper vintage car insurance, registration fees, etc. etc. It would be very costly if at all possible. AFAIK this is equally so in all of the EU.<p>Seems to me this is a giant loophole. Like as if Coca Cola re-released an old recipe with real coke in it and everyone just went &quot;Sure! It&#x27;s authentic!&quot;<p>Could someone enlighten me?')
