How can you claim Yale is being racist? Should the number of Asian students at Yale be higher? And why should it be higher? Which numbers should be lower at Yale so there should be more Asians, and why?<p>White 43%\nAsian 19%\nHispanic&#x2F;Latino 13%\nBlack or African American 8%<p>If your claim is that Yale should be accepting students blindly on merit only, and that as a result the number of Asian students would go up, then it would be hard not to conclude that you think one race is superior to the others and should therefor be accepted at a higher rate than their representation in the general population. Or is there some other conclusion you could come to?')
