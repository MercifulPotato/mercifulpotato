Is there an actual case that&#x27;s raising this argument? I&#x27;ve yet to see any cases with arguments that make me worry, so it would be something new.<p>In general I can&#x27;t see a signature &quot;verification&quot; law as anything but an attempt at disenfranchisement. Many people have repeatable signatures, and many do not. A signature is not a method of technical verification, but rather legal authorization with a <i>possibility</i> to argue authenticity based on stroke angles etc. If I usually make a half-attempt at writing my name, but sign my ballot with an X, that&#x27;s legit. The best way to prevent a person from filling out multiple ballots is to make sure everyone votes so there are few unused ballots to steal in the first place.')
