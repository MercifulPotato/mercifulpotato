Oh and it probably came with a pension.  Everyone smoked indoors.  Companies felt obliged to look after their (male) workers and sexual harassment of female employees was routine and casual racism was baked-in to the culture.<p>Over the years CEO pay has risen something like 1000% and worker pay less than 20%.<p>Now companies spy on their workers and engage in union-busting while paying their workers a pittance such that even a person working two minimum wage full-time jobs is barely able to sustain a family in the USA and Canada.  We don&#x27;t smoke indoors any more.  Sexual harassment of female employees is still routine and casual racism is institutionalized but perhaps less overt today.<p>I guess society can pride itself of the smoking thing but we&#x27;ve either made no progress or regressed in a lot of ways.<p>&gt;someone fired end of story<p>Take off your rose-coloured glasses.')
