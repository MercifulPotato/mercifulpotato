Those spots are typically empty - or if close to the door filled by a gas car (ignoring the electric car only sign).  Most people with an electric car don&#x27;t need to top off their car when they are shopping - they just charge at home.  The only people who need to charge someplace other than home are on a long trip and that is less than 5% of all driving.  This puts a ceiling on demand for chargers.<p>Even ignoring the above, state laws often give the local utility has a legal monopoly on selling electricity. Stores that have a charger are giving away the power to whoever uses the charger. Until the law allows some sort of profit from having a charger it doesn&#x27;t make sense to have one.')
