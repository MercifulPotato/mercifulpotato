They are doing what they need to do to survive since they don&#x27;t want to risk losing this one large client and having the entire consultancy go under.<p>Approach the situation with grace and tact. Tell them you understand their position. Either you or the company should propose the terms. Ideal terms to me would be (if you were full time)<p>1. Company treats it as a layoff and you are able to claim unemployment insurance. However you need to check the rules in your state for how this might work.<p>2. You get some severance. Standard is a week for every year of employment. Honestly you&#x27;d be lucky to get any but 1-2 weeks worth would be reasonable.')
