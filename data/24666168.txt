Not everyone is happy that their movements and whereabouts are being registered.<p>Well, you can argue that we all carry a smartphone so anyhow our mobile operators (and so, the government (yours and maybe others too)) register our movements history, but at least you can <i>choose</i> not to carry a smartphone, but how can one choose not to be photographed&#x2F;videotaped?')
