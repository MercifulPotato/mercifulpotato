The per-line thing makes sense if you have multiple individuals on the account and want to opt in (I&#x27;ve never heard of such people, just saying). The toggles are straightforward although this is a rank lower in UX compared to the standard email &quot;unsubscribe&quot; pages, IMO. The more egregious thing is this is opt-out instead of opt-in ... probably something we need legislation to solve.')
