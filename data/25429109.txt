With a &quot;nature&quot; argument, you don&#x27;t have to think about the &quot;nurture&quot; argument - your actual skill. Then you can give up without being ashamed.<p>99% of the people you&#x27;ll actually meet are averages with interests and luck to manifest their skills in the right way. And on the other hand, I&#x27;ve attended local Mensa chapter meetings to see first-hand that &quot;geniuses&quot; can in 99% of cases be just ordinary people with some special interests on which they may or may not capitalize.<p>So - always value contextual knowledge, skill and effort, and encourage yourself and other people to develop. Because otherwise you just like to play the lottery and complain how the numbers are too random to your liking.')
