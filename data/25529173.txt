Are you not free to leave at any time to a place more in line with your preferences?<p>Even within the United States, are you unable to find an urban geography to your liking, say in Manhattan or San Francisco?<p>Upon further analysis, you might actually find that the street and transportation network design in any given area is largely optimal given the relative costs of time, land, labor, transportation and energy. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s enjoyable to be stuck in traffic - that sucks, and there are alternatives (like living in Manhattan), you just need to pay for them - they&#x27;re not absent due to widespread ignorance.')
