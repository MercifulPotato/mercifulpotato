Item(by='qayxc', descendants=None, kids=[25203820], score=None, time=1606257178, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25203714, text='&gt; Usually progress bars implicitly measure &quot;time left&quot;, but the total isn&#x27;t known in that case, so progress bars are inapproprate.<p>Are you sure about that? I&#x27;d argue that most progress bars <i>explicitly</i> measure tasks&#x2F;work left and it&#x27;s the <i>user</i> who wrongly correlates this with &quot;time left&quot; in many cases.<p>Note that the OP didn&#x27;t complain about time, but about the percentage not going from 0% to 100% for example.')
