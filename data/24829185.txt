That&#x27;s incorrect, these are decisions that the boomers made. If they outsourced the decisions poorly, the blame still lays with the boomers.“<p>Only if your goal is to create an arbitrary division between generations using the concept of blame.<p>As far as I can see there is literally no amount of money the Boomers could have ‘saved’ that would have made any difference if there isn’t enough surplus value (not money) generated in the present day economy to service their needs.<p>This has nothing causal to do with generational debt - that is just a symptom.<p>It has everything to do with economic decisions made by politicians and economists, around education and trade policies, that leave the US (and many other economies) in a weak position.<p>You can certainly argue that whoever was around to vote for these policies is responsible for them, but that’s a weak position.<p>Voting is too coarse grained to assign that level of responsibility to the group.<p>Individual political and economic decisions are in fact important, not who happened to be a certain age when the decisions were made.')
