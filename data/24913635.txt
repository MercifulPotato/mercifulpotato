I cannot say, but I do think that COVID-19 is a case of mass hysteria, possibly the largest we&#x27;ve ever seen.<p>I do not deny many have gotten sick and died, but I also think this is nowhere near as bad as people are making it out to be. The elderly should have been protected. The rest of us should have been allowed to make our own choices about risk. And the &quot;long COVID&quot; stories might be true or might be purely psychological.<p>This is not a time of honor.')
