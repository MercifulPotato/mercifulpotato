It&#x27;s just background noise that sometimes flares up in intensity, like when I feel like I should have known something or I failed at a task. That isn&#x27;t fun. I work to address this by constant self-improvement and making and achieving reasonably attainable goals. That helps.<p>I guess I also worry about the health of the relationships I have with important people in my life and what I&#x27;m doing to maintain them.<p>I don&#x27;t think any of these things qualify as depression though. It just feels like to me that&#x27;s what life is.')
