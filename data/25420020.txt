They used it as a secure credential storage. Majority of their internal panels didn&#x27;t have a 2FA and we found internal VPN server credentials too (which didn&#x27;t have source ip restrictions), so we could freely access tons of data. The bounty we got was around  $1000 if I could remember, I think this would motivate a lot of hackers to not go the responsible disclosure way, as the incentives are ridiculously low.<p>But I could access literally everything related to that organization and their clients from that single Github leak (of Jira creds).')
