But where the cap is set, who it applies to,  when it’s updated and when it comes into effect are more important than the number of TBs.<p>For instance, setting it at 1.2 TB today seems fine, but in 10 years that won’t be nearly enough, but will Comcast update it? Or just push ‘heavy’ user to their ‘prosumer’ plans.<p>It’s similar in financial regulation. Transactions over $10,000 must be reported for KYC&#x2F;AML purposes. Sounds fine when it was implemented, but now it seems very low.<p>It wouldn’t take much to future proof decisions like this, by default. Inflate by 10% per year, or some other metric. And the lack of such features hints at the fixed amount being the feature.')
