Ominous pronunciations don&#x27;t count, though. Is there some social media platform Jones is using that I haven&#x27;t heard of that allows him to reach tens of millions of people and make up for his losses on FB, YT, and TW? Are his website stats wrong or irrelevant for some reason that is uniquely invisible in my bubble? These would be valuable bits of information to me.')
