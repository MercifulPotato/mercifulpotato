This is just fact. People delay preventative treatment, they get depressed, overweight, suicides skyrocket. In Melbourne in particular, there was a giant spike in 12 year olds getting prescribed serious anti-depressant medication.<p>Four newborn babies died because the South Australian government did not want to risk flying them to Melbourne for treatment.<p>Lockdown primarily harms young people (ostensibly to save old people, the primary victims of the virus). I think this is such a sickening calculation.<p>We&#x27;re enslaving our children to debt, depriving them of social lives (this can have permanent impacts), some of them commit suicide, some of them are denied treatment by government and die and they&#x27;re not getting as much exercise and are also eating poorly.<p>I&#x27;m really tired of seeing people gloss over the effects of lockdown, because lockdown is dangerous in itself. Is the virus or the lockdown more dangerous? Well, that remains to be seen.<p>In Australia, an additional 4,000 - 7,000 suicides were projected beyond the norm as a result of lockdowns. [1] This is significantly higher than the death toll of the virus and is only a single datapoint. It doesn&#x27;t include people skipping preventative appointments and dying as a result, or the long term effects of massive depression and obesity spikes.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ama.com.au&#x2F;media&#x2F;joint-statement-covid-19-impact-likely-lead-increased-rates-suicide-and-mental-illness" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ama.com.au&#x2F;media&#x2F;joint-statement-covid-19-impact-lik...</a>')
