For me it&#x27;s cultural rather than regional because I&#x27;m in the southwest--and now that I think about it, I&#x27;ve never given much thought to people giving a non-apology &quot;sorry.&quot; It could be there&#x27;s a bit of a cultural mismatch here since there&#x27;s an air force base nearby, and we often have people from the Commonwealth here (UK, Canada, Australia, etc).<p>I&#x27;m actually not sure what sort of answer that is now that I think about it.')
