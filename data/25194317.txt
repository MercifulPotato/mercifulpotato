It&#x27;s not a computer message; think 1970s tech. There&#x27;s a accelerometer to say you need a head-on crash and a seat mass sensor to say there&#x27;s a large enough human in the seat. There are cases where the passenger bag did not deploy, for example a stuck-closed accelerometer, and then a responder knelt on that seat getting to the driver, satisfying the last condition, and causing a deployment with obvious injury.')
