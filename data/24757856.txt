For Westerners, possibly. But already for immigrants from Islamic countries in Western nations, it falls apart. Many of them aren&#x27;t like &quot;yeah it happened, and it was great, I will now deny it to remove guilt from Germany and make Germany the victim&quot;, because they don&#x27;t care about Germany&#x27;s past. They simply don&#x27;t believe it because that&#x27;s what they learn from friends and family.<p>The same applies to most conspiracy people btw. They don&#x27;t secretly believe that chemtrails aren&#x27;t a thing and just pretend otherwise to get under your skin, they really believe what they say.')
