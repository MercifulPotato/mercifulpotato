My comment — &quot;All of those reasons ... apply ... to VS Code itself&quot; — includes LSP.<p>In fact, the only reason you can claim &quot;while Pylance is fully portable by design (could be incorporated into competitor products instantly!)&quot; is because of LSP!<p>Besides, it&#x27;s not like competitor IDEs that have taken VS Code&#x27;s codebase wholesale don&#x27;t exist.
