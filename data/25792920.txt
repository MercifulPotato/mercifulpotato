Nobody would buy the laptops if they said &quot;this thing is 10x slower than a random desktop cobbled together from parts purchased on Ebay, and gets hot enough to burn your lap when you use it as a laptop&quot;, so they kind of had no choice but to add some sort of whizbang wowie zowie add-on to stand out from PC laptops (that also used the same slow and inefficient CPUs).  Now that their laptops are as fast as desktops and use very little power, they can sell them on computing power alone, meaning they don&#x27;t need to inflate the BOM with gizmos and gadgets.  One less thing to break.  Good riddance, I say.')
