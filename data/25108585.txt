My guess is at +280kmh (175mph) driving speed most of the time on the highway to make up for that.\nIn times of covid and partial lockdowns it&#x27;s not unusual to have empty highways (depending on the time window this happened). In germany you can definitely average 230km&#x2F;h (140mph) when the Autobahn is empty, eg. at night. Conditions need to be perfect  though (almost no traffic, weather, powerful car and a fit driver). Maybe they changed seats after refilling.')
