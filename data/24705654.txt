If there is a variant of spawn that asserts there is no concurrency is required for the child task, I&#x27;d imagine the runtime can do more optimizations (Julia doesn&#x27;t have it but there was an experimental PR [1]). But concurrency sounds like a very basic thing in JavaScript so I&#x27;m not sure if it fits well in the language. But I don&#x27;t have experience in serious JavaScript programming so I don&#x27;t know what fits best there. I&#x27;d imagine you can build some data parallel libraries already with web workers API.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JuliaLang&#x2F;julia&#x2F;pull&#x2F;31086" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JuliaLang&#x2F;julia&#x2F;pull&#x2F;31086</a>')
