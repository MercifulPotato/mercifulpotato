Item(by='javert', descendants=None, kids=[25013204], score=None, time=1604713706, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25004040, text='&gt; You&#x27;ve confused a critique of your rhetoric for a critique of yourself.<p>If you call my comment hypocritical, I think you&#x27;re calling me hypocritical. Apparently you don&#x27;t think so. That&#x27;s fine. It could be a cultural difference. Let&#x27;s not litigate it.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s no need to defend a turn of phrase so vigorously. If you&#x27;d just led off with, &quot;No, I didn&#x27;t mean it like that,&quot; as you&#x27;ve done here, then I&#x27;d have shut up.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is a charitable thing to say. If there was no need for me to defend it, there was no need for you to &quot;attack&quot; (criticize) my comment in the first place. If you don&#x27;t agree, that&#x27;s fine. Again, let&#x27;s not litigate it.<p>&gt; I mean, come on, surely you recognize how &quot;Do you have a citation?&quot; falls into the camp that both of us apparently dislike.<p>I don&#x27;t agree. As I already explained, I think it&#x27;s OK to ask for a citation, in a certain context. I don&#x27;t think I was doing the thing you&#x27;re complaining about and which annoys me. If you disagree, that&#x27;s fine. Let&#x27;s not litigate it.<p>I would have liked for you to find a way to continue communicating without continuing to criticize, but it didn&#x27;t happen. Oh well. Let&#x27;s call this conversation finished. Take care. On the bitcoin stuff you are bringing up, that looks fine to me. I don&#x27;t have anything more to say about that.')
