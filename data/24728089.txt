I added a hub to the backside of my monitor, works without issues even though the chain is now laptop-monitor-hub-device.<p>Switching between laptop and desktop is also another consideration. I have desktop with DisplayPort cable + USB-C 3.0 for peripherals. Then I got a short USB-C male-female extension (3.1 gen2) so I can switch laptop&#x2F;desktop cables without wearing out the monitor USB-C port.<p>So yes some dabbling required.')
