If I had my holdings at a brokerage that suddenly decided to restrict trading that was previously allowed, without some sort of law change or lawful order from the SEC (presumably something that would apply to <i>all</i> brokerages), I would immediately transfer all my assets out.  Doesn&#x27;t even matter if their restriction didn&#x27;t affect me at the time.  I would not want to give my business to a company that would do that.')
