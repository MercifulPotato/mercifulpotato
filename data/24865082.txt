But right now I don&#x27;t have better alternatives. Yes, I&#x27;ve taken breaks for up to a month (without needing to ween, never upped my dosage).<p>Cannabis doesn&#x27;t work. Paracetamol&#x2F;acetaminophen, ibuprofen, NSAID&#x27;s don&#x27;t work.<p>Morphine, codeine and tramadol do. Tramadol is the best of a bad bunch.')
