When we finally forced him to update the status page, he would only change it to yellow and write vague updates about how service might be degraded for some customers. He flat out refused to ever admit that the cloud services were down.<p>After some digging, he told us that admitting your services were down was considered a death sentence for your job at his previous team at Amazon. He was so scarred from the experience that he refused to ever take responsibility for outages. Ultimately, we had to put someone else in charge of updating the status page because he just couldn&#x27;t be trusted.<p>FWIW, I have other friends who work on different teams at Amazon who have not had such bad experiences.')
