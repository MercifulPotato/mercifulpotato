And to be clear, that is not my view of developers. I point it out because I agree with the author of the article that there are differences in companies. I&#x27;m sorry that those traits did not get you where you wanted, but they are not bare minimum in a lot of companies. I&#x27;ve walked engineers from their seats over to the counterpart&#x27;s seat and have had others who do not go outside of their area due to an inaccurate belief that it&#x27;s not what their manager wanted.')
