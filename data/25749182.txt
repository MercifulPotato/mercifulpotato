So Trump could tweet outside the rules and not have them removed, but Kathy Griffin should not be able to.  That&#x27;s what I think you meant when you said<p>&gt; It&#x27;s the only reason Trump was allowed to stay on Twitter as long as he was<p>But here we have the data point of Kathy Griffin&#x27;s tweet staying up while Trump&#x27;s tweets are taken down and blocked.
