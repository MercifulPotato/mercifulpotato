Being able to build your entire site with React, make all of it statically rendered, and then opt into interactive&#x2F;dynamic parts as needed is really great. Pulling in data sources at build time can be excellent. Overall I like the ideas behind Gatsby a lot.<p>But with real websites, I struggled to get Gatsby to be performant both at build and runtime. Gatsby really wants to preload other pages on your site in an attempt to speed things up, and you can&#x27;t opt out of it. Whether this preloading is a benefit is a real mixed bag, and I have found myself spending a lot of time tweaking things to try and make it a net plus across the site. Mostly with bad results. gatsby-plugin-no-javascript can really improve things here a lot. It allows you to opt into JS only on pages that really need it, kill off the preloading entirely, and gain more control over the end result of your site. It&#x27;s very strange that to get something like Gatsby in the ballpark you want you need to strip out JS, but well, it&#x27;s true.<p>gatsby-plugin-no-javascript is not a perfect solution. It&#x27;s too coarse. But I have found overall it can be a net positive. What I really want is the ability to say &quot;this part of the page&#x2F;site&#x2F;whatever is truly static, please don&#x27;t rehydrate it at runtime&quot;.<p>Gatsby&#x27;s plugin system is nice. I like being able to handle things like robots.txt, sitemaps, favicons in a well defined, easily managed part of my app. The downside being you gotta accept what the plugin gives you. For example the favicon plugin generates favicons that are over 30kb. In my case, the favicon is often larger than the entire rest of the page combined. So I still find even here Gatsby is a good idea with questionable execution at times.<p>Gatsby has strict caching requirements -- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gatsbyjs.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;caching&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gatsbyjs.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;caching&#x2F;</a> -- and if you can&#x27;t meet them, your site will have subtle bugs. This means Gatsby is not compatible with Github Pages, and is a major downside to Gatsby.<p>This article spent a long time complaining about MDX. I agree, I think MDX is quite bad. But of the 4 complex Gatsby sites I have built, none of them used MDX. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to conflate MDX&#x27;s short comings with Gatsby.<p>I&#x27;m currently playing with Svelte&#x27;s Sapper. It might possibly become what I always wished Gatsby was.')
