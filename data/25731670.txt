Focus on the things you think are making you unhappy, not what you think will make you happy. Read it out loud in private. After that, hide it away for a while where only you will find it.<p>2) Keep your goals private. Especially keep progress private. Trying to stop smoking&#x2F;drinking? Folks will notice, but politely decline to answer that infamous &quot;how long since...?&quot; question. Don&#x27;t externalize the rewards.<p>3) Focus on very small results. Find a way to make them stick. Build on that and in time you&#x27;ll find that amounts to a LOT more progress and personal satisfaction.<p>IMO build from the ground up and the fancy big goals will come more easily and naturally. You won&#x27;t have to game it.')
