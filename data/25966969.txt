Ethereum Classic, the original chain, is still in operation, and in that fork, the DAO fix never happened. But since the DAO affected the core Ethereum developers and early proponents and backers of the system, all the talent stayed with the chain that corrected the issue. To me, that&#x27;s a fair outcome. Forkability is a necessary feature, not a bug, of immutable blockchains. Just like it is for open source.')
