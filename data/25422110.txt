At Google or Facebook scale, it would seems like having a more localized UI per region would make more sense.  It isn&#x27;t like they don&#x27;t have the money to do this, and most of the service is behind an API&#x2F;server-side, so having a different front-end better localized to, say, Arabic users, doesn&#x27;t seem like it would place an undue burden on them.')
