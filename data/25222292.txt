Those emergency exit signs existed before any sociological study of them. It&#x27;s not the case that sociologists said &quot;Hey, we just invented emergency exit signs and predict they will save lives,&quot; rather they&#x27;re saying &quot;You know those things that people have been using in emergencies to save lives for decades?  Turns out it works.&quot;<p>To be clear, I like sociology and the sociology courses I took I did find enriched my understanding of society at large.  But I do not believe sociology helps us predict the future any more than history does (another field I love!). In contrast, fields like climate science say &quot;If you release carbon, temperatures will rise&quot; and that falsifiable prediction has born to be true.  And I wager that sociologists will be more like historians with a diversity of opinion, than climate scientists who overwhelmingly agree with falsifiable and predictable claims.')
