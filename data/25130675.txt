If you&#x27;re into data and ML, those are things you ought to know too.<p>For a data&#x2F;ML position, in most cases, I&#x27;d expect you to be able to handle data cleanly and efficiently.<p>If you can&#x27;t, there are jobs far over on the data side, but:<p>1) As a business data analyst, you&#x27;re fine with Excel and PPT, but you&#x27;ll be paid roughly 1&#x2F;3 of an ML&#x2F;SWE position, and you should have excellent communication skills.<p>2) There are primary mathematical positions, where you work with a data engineer, but you&#x27;d better be awesome at math. AND it still helps to be able to handle data cleanly.<p>Even so, good data workflows require knowing what you did, when, and to which version of data. Properly used, git provides an archival log of some of that. I use very similar data structures when I build some of my own data pipelines too, with data stored under its hashes, Merkle trees, DAGs, and similar. If you find that &quot;annoying and time-consuming,&quot; I&#x27;d hire you for a business data analyst, and not much more.<p>It sounds like you find that stuff boring, though. It&#x27;s a test of interest, passion, and drive, much more so than diligence and grit. Although those are important too.')
