I know tons of developers that skip Unity or Unreal because there is a learning curve and they can already render a cube themselves. They think &quot;I just write a model loader&quot; and ship and not realize how many man years of work they are ignoring in all other parts. Input systems across 10+ platforms, graphics APIs across those 10 platforms, physics libraries, post processing library, all the edge cases of importing that took man years to find, gaming networking libraries and on and on.<p>Of course is their choice and if they enjoy reinventing the wheel good for them. But they&#x27;ll spend 6 to 18 months working on reproducing some fraction of the features they&#x27;d have for free instead of working on what makes their thing unique.')
