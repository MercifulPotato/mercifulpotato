For example, functional programming, especially as you get closer to point free style - some people love it and find it truly beautiful and others find it obtuse and distasteful.<p>That said, I do think that Ruby is one of the most <i>expressive</i> general purpose languages, for reasons like being able to chain function calls without needing to add parentheses or some other call notation. There are surely DSLs or more obscure languages that are more expressive, but I would argue that few general&#x2F;widely used languages are as expressive as Ruby, and so to answer your question if allowed to equate beauty with expressiveness, I think Ruby ranks very highly.')
