Just like any other place. Maybe take some humble inspiration from places where it can and does work better. It doesn&#x27;t mean system ends up with communism, dictature and whatnot. Just a slightly more humane system to live in, where rich stay rich just with tiny little less wealth, on levels that don&#x27;t make any difference to their luxury lives.<p>If the country is so prosperous as US, its also important for those rich and beyond such petty worries to live in well working society anyway. Otherwise they end up in their little fenced paradise with wolves roaming everywhere outside.')
