It&#x27;s possible to do an all-PDF workflow for most things.<p>I make do with a little wi-fi thermal sticky label printer, for the few times I need an address label, because I am vehemently opposed to the concept of handwriting.  I have a letter laser printer, which I have successfully avoided needing to use.<p>The only time I&#x27;ve used it in recent memory (2 years?) is to print off updated car insurance documents, current copies of which must be kept in the car by law (and of course they change every six months).

I technically don&#x27;t need to print them myself.<p>You just have to be a little bit stubborn in refusing to use paper, and it&#x27;s possible now.')
