Those decisions should be left for team to make and, yes, opinion of more experienced devs should be weighted more, but everyone should have a right to speak.<p>Something that connects with above statement: most architects are involved only at the beginning, which is so unimaginably stupid considering the fundamental truth about software development which is: &quot;requirements will change&quot;.<p>Personally, if I hear from recruiter that they havea an architect in team I always say &quot;thank you, but no thank you&quot;.')
