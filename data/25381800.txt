The one I was talking about has 90 attendees total, only one session at a time in the same room, and in snowmass Colorado so if you&#x27;re outside the conference hotel we can literally see you from up to half a mile away. Almost no one skips a single session in these conferences, especially the professors. For the most part they&#x27;re paying attention as well, no one&#x27;s on their laptops or dozing off.<p>Again, I spent a decade in academia, and if you&#x27;re in fields such as biology and in some top institution, it&#x27;s very rare that professors up to doing something meaningful have anything less than 60 hour weeks at any point in their career. This is more or less what me and my roommates actively discussed most of the time all through a decade, so I&#x27;m not just talking about anecdotal evidence. From what I understand, academia in other fields especially tech related can be less stressful than this. Being a oroefssor in a competitive field is really back breaking - You have to juggle a large number of roles and are constantly responsible for the lives of numerous people and lack many of the protections one would normally expect from any regular job in some ways.')
