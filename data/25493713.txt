Item(by='sbacic', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608547421, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25493623, text='&gt; What does that even mean? What&#x27;s the difference between paying for something or having the cost fall on ones shoulder&#x27;s?<p>The difference is that you get it either way and only really pay the cost back if you make over a certain amount of money. And there&#x27;s absolutely nothing stopping you from never paying back that &quot;fair share&quot;. You can just decide that taking long walks in nature beats making more money (and thus, paying more taxes). Not a problem for you, but the government can&#x27;t exactly slap a VAT on that to pay for all the public services you consume.<p>&gt; The difference in salaries between the Bay Area and Europe is really big, although I don&#x27;t think it holds for most of the rest of the US.<p>Not just &quot;Europe&quot; - we&#x27;re not comparing SF compensation with rural Bulgaria here - we&#x27;re talking about European cities with the highest salaries (and highest COL, on average).')
