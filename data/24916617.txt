It would only keep him slightly afloat, compared to being careful about his business, where he could have kept a significant portion of it.<p>The line between being careless and blaming the victim is blurry, so I&#x27;m not going to discuss it.<p>However, building a successful startup is fundamentally different from running a sustainable business: in the former case, you deliberately make a high-risk, high-reward bet, while in the latter you want to take only enough risk to keep going. I had the impression that the story was about a business trying to be sustainable getting ruined.')
