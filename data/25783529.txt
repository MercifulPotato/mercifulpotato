When I was over 300 pounds every day was an experience in pain.<p>So if that&#x27;s the case, why does it matter what the Huffington Post says?<p>I&#x27;m not morbidly obese, so perhaps I&#x27;ve missed the pro-obesity PR. A fashion magazine might give a cover to an obese model once a year, but the other 11 months all seem to have the same rail thin models that have dominated since the &#x27;80s.<p>Same goes for TV and movies. Producers wouldn&#x27;t hire a fat guy to play Mark David Chapman, it&#x27;d be an easier sell to get a fit actor and have him balloon up to that desired weight.<p>The only obese poeople of renown in our society are older politicians and the rich, i.e. people that do not care about meeting society&#x27;s beauty standards.')
