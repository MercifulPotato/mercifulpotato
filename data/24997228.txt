So we are looking at on order of magnitude more heat for the same electrical consumption 40% vs 400% efficiency. Instantanous renewable energy prices are low, but rarely that low.<p>The limit of efficiency  is dictated by the boost in temperature needed, so you can&#x27;t use heat pumps to get the 1000C generated by iron oxidation. There is certainly a niche for industrial processes requiring very high temperatures, but I can&#x27;t imagine why on earth would a brewery need such temperatures.')
