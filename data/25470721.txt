This had the advantage of getting project members to think about hard about the content of the bylaws.  However, it had the downside of producing a lot of sloppy bylaws with ambiguous or otherwise unworkable rules.  For instance, some bylaws were written to require 3&#x2F;4 of the all eligible voting members to change them, rather than 3&#x2F;4 of those who vote â€” which can become a problem as members with voting privileges go inactive and become unreachable.<p>Documenting processes by which conflicts are resolved is hard.  If you&#x27;re lucky, most of the time, the rules don&#x27;t matter as people reach consensus without having to go through exacting, difficult negotiations.  But when you really need a formal process to resolve conflict, then it matters if your process is borken and pathological.<p>The best high-level design is to have the rules for resolving conflicts written by a few specialists who really care about precise drafting, and for most other entities within the organization to inherit those rules whenever possible.')
