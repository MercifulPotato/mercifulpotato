But from what I see not so many people in the world care about &quot;good&quot;. They just &quot;want more&quot;.<p>For example, when a customer reports a problem, and I admit that there is a bug and explain a workaround some of them will say: &quot;you have buggy software, bla bla I will use Google&quot;. But if you say: &quot;Strange. This might some very strange setup issue - here is the workaround&quot; - no problem.<p>Of course, some of our customers <i>love</i> honesty but the vertical I&#x27;m working in, honesty is not a thing.<p>Depressing... I know.')
