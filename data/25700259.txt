Item(by='Fnoord', descendants=None, kids=[25701304], score=None, time=1610199808, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25700033, text='PM means post meridiem. That&#x27;s Latin, but you don&#x27;t have to remember it. If you simply remember the P means &#x27;post&#x27;, and the &#x27;M&#x27; means the exact middle of the day (12 noon) then you know 12 PM is 12.00 (after noon hence afternoon) and 12 AM is after midnight or 0.00 (the hour after previous day&#x27;s 23.00 &#x2F; 11 PM). Then you just need to remember morning is AM, afternoon is PM, evening is PM, and night is AM. That&#x27;s it. Yeah, I find 24H system easier, but its what my native locale uses, so I am biased... (as is everyone else)')
