Given that the graph started in 2009, 1 year after Chrome was first released and only the last datapoint is after the date, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re related at all. We all know that Chrome captured the IE&#x2F;Firefox market share in the whole last decade and that&#x27;s what the graph&#x27;s showing.<p>Second, your concept of rapid decline clearly differs from mine. That is an eleven year decline and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s &quot;rapid&quot; at all for a browser.')
