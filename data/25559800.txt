So yes, they are custom, but they are somewhat uniform in the switches themselves.<p>60% keyboards are a gimmick. The addition of arrow keys and a nav cluster adds an inch to the physical footprint and doesn&#x27;t affect ergonomics or portability enough to matter.<p>Unless you routinely type in Japanese, Japanese legends do not add anything but visual clutter.<p>I don&#x27;t think any of these are office friendly. Too many bright colors and noisy switches.<p>This comes down to preference I suppose, but from the &#x2F;r&#x2F;mkb subreddit it seems that the demographics of mechanical keyboard community is mostly guys in their teens to mid-twenties and mostly gamers, not programmers and power users. I think it&#x27;s cool that mechanical keyboards are coming back, but it&#x27;s unfortunate that stock&#x2F;custom options are so limited. Maybe this will improve as the community grows up.')
