Need lots of software for that).<p>If there is one takeaway from working in both fields, I think it is that a lot of computer scientists believe their systems are deep - it is nothing compared to biology.<p>Biotechnology also has a fundamentally different culture than tech, and so there can be some culture shock between the two.
