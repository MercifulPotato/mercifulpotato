Girls outperform boys in every subject, science and math included, and have for decades[1].  Women are admitted more to colleges and graduate more[2].  Then there are structural programs at major companies to advantage women in hiring and career growth, as I mentioned.<p>It is true that women face the subtle kinds of discrimination referenced elsewhere.  I&#x27;m not denying that.  I&#x27;m saying that instituting programs which relatively disadvantage my career and opportunities due to my gender strikes me as unfair.  I don&#x27;t get a benefit because the executive leadership team is mostly men.  They don&#x27;t share the money and power with me because we are all men - so why am I disadvantaged because other men have achieved success?<p>1 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apa.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;press&#x2F;releases&#x2F;2014&#x2F;04&#x2F;girls-grades" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apa.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;press&#x2F;releases&#x2F;2014&#x2F;04&#x2F;girls-grades</a><p>2 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;education&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2017&#x2F;08&#x2F;why-men-are-the-new-college-minority&#x2F;536103&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;education&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2017&#x2F;08&#x2F;why-me...</a>')
