It&#x27;s too easy to just dive in and figure things out as we go but I&#x27;ve found that we end up reworking quite a few things. I&#x27;d like to rework less and plan more.<p>I&#x27;d appreciate the wisdom of the HN crowd.<p>Ideal would be light overhead but accurate spec. Although not sure if that exists.')
