Or perhaps mistrust of authority and experts?<p>It would seem like perhaps an uneducated but highly communal&#x2F;cooperative&#x2F;respectful-of-authority society would have better outcomes than one with well educated individuals who have a culture of disregard for institutional science or the idea of technocrats and bureaucrats that might know more than Joe Sixpack. You could argue that education is what creates the values we&#x27;re hoping for here, but that is kind of what I&#x27;m questioning. Perhaps the culture itself is the problem not the test scores.')
