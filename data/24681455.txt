Item(by='simias', descendants=None, kids=[24681574], score=None, time=1601838298, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24680526, text='Interesting, I&#x27;ll be sure to try it out.<p>And yeah I actually found the first couple of hours actually more fun than Factorio (at least once you know how Factorio works) because you get started much faster. But yeah, Shapez loses steam a lot faster too, while Factorio keeps ramping up.<p>I think the main problem of Shapez is not so much that there aren&#x27;t logic or wires though, it&#x27;s that (with the exception of blueprints) you only build disposable components. In Factorio with the exception of science packs every production artifact can be useful on its own which means that you build to build to build to build... Whereas in shapez once you&#x27;re done making your &quot;blue stars in red squares with a purple circular corner&quot; factory then you can forget about it completely.')
