At one place, reporting an email as suspicious would trigger a scan of the email which crawled every link, including the &#x2F;phished&#x2F;&lt;my-unique-guid&gt; links. The people with the worst scores were precisely those who followed corporate policy to the letter and reported every suspicious email. It took about one cycle of that nonsense before everyone had email rules deleting the simulated phishing emails.')
