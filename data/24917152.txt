They are stuck. What a nice way of saying it.<p>Targetting a single platform and taking advantage of its features is totally fine for a small developer or niche app. It&#x27;s a lot easier to get going, maintenance costs are lower.<p>However for a big app like Sketch cutting corners like that becomes a liability in the long term. Porting to another platform would mean rewriting the rendering layer or reimplementing the system frameworks to keep their designs work 1:1. It&#x27;s now a huge strategic disadvantage.')
