Or even Swift, despite Apple being more serious on the server-side roadmap lately and hiring a bunch of people from the JVM world.<p>Kotlin doesn&#x27;t bring anything new and is full of ad-hoc design decisions, and Java itself is catching up (and even potentially surpassing it, see pattern matching for instance). I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a huge threat. Sure you&#x27;ll see people who didn&#x27;t really understand the point of Scala move to Kotlin because they just wanted a better Java really, and Kotlin does that well. But I think it&#x27;s been clear that Scala shouldn&#x27;t try to pursue this goal, for the past 5 years at least, after the hype around Spark cooled off.<p>I&#x27;m happy that Scala 3 is focusing on the biggest pain points. I&#x27;m also quite happy with the resources that have been added behind the tooling and ecosystem lately. The Scala center wouldn&#x27;t exist if there wasn&#x27;t a real demand for improvements in the mid to long-term future.')
