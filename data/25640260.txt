But at the time of JWZ&#x27;s resignation letter, Martin Fowler&#x27;s book Refactoring had been out for all of 3 months.<p>Nothing has fundamentally changed between now and then. Sure, the information may be more readily available, and we can argue that it&#x27;s unfair to judge Netscape by today&#x27;s standards, but even so, I think the article you linked makes a strong argument that technical debt <i>did not</i> kill Netscape, and that their approach to managing it <i>did</i>. This is why it goes on to discuss other, more successful approaches.<p>&gt; In particular, Netscape was faced with a choice: they could either do a total rewrite quickly, or take much longer to do a slow rewrite while still pushing forward, but at a much reduced development speed.<p>Were they actually faced with this choice? The article you linked points out there are <i>at least</i> 3 reasons people choose to do rewrites. This is one of them (&quot;architectural problems&quot;). Even still, the article&#x27;s argument is that this is a false dichotomy, and that there are better alternatives.<p>I also think &quot;total rewrite quickly&quot; is an oxymoron and a bit disingenuous. Your article points out it took them <i>three years</i>. In my experience, they typically take full-blown products at least two years - if they are successful at all.<p>If you are worried about Microsoft beating you because you are slowed by technical debt, you certainly need to be worried about Microsoft beating you because you didn&#x27;t ship anything for <i>three years</i>. That is the entire point the article makes. The very first sentence reads:<p>&gt; Netscape 6.0 is finally going into its first public beta. There never was a version 5.0. The last major release, version 4.0, was released almost three years ago. Three years is an awfully long time in the Internet world. During this time, Netscape sat by, helplessly, as their market share plummeted.<p>I find your next point surprising, given your citation:<p>&gt; There&#x27;s little reason to think a slow cleanup would have been any better than a fast rewrite for Netscape.<p>The article you cite makes this exact argument:<p>&gt; You are putting yourself in an extremely dangerous position where you will be shipping an old version of the code for several years, completely unable to make any strategic changes or react to new features that the market demands, because you donâ€™t have shippable code. You might as well just close for business for the duration.<p>It then goes on to list alternatives, including a &quot;slow&quot; rewrite, during which time you can still ship code.<p>None of this is to say that too much technical debt can&#x27;t slow you down to the point that you cannot keep up with your competitors - but it is certainly not the argument your citation makes. Its argument is tangential, and related only in the sense that technical debt is presumably what pushed Netscape to make the decision it did.<p>I have to say, I am fascinated by our difference in takeaways from this article.')
