With Go you’re encouraged to deal with the error directly (two choices: return it, or do something about it), so that when reading you can follow what is happening at any time. When reading a Go function you can always say for sure if an error occurs with a given call and how it is handled.<p>If for some reasons the project consider that checking errors should be enforced, that’s simple to do by using go-lint or other linters.')
