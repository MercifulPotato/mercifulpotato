Item(by='magnusbaringer', descendants=None, kids=[25170900], score=None, time=1605976420, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25169970, text='Thank you for your reply and your feedback.\nI&#x27;m not sure about the NSFW tag - however if you select age under 18 you cannot start the survey, so I hope it is ok without the NSFW tag.<p>The order of the images is completely randomized - so the survey is never the same for two participants.\nThe images however follow a complex algorithm - no image pair shows up twice. The number of images - although admittedly quite high - is the absolute minimum amount to simulate every important condition&#x2F;decision-combination relevant for surgery.\nThe load time was optimized - however depending on your location and server load it might of course be a little to long (I try to further improve that). Thank you very much for your support!')
