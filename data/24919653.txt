Most will admit when pressed a bit that the CIA&#x2F;NSA&#x2F;FBI do not have our best interests at heart and are out of control. They have repeatedly lied under oath, lied to congress, lied to the public, run human experiments on unwitting citizens, collect data on all of us, etc with complete impunity.<p>However many people somehow simultaneously hold the belief that these agencies should continue to exist, are deserving of our taxpayer dollars, and are generally Good Guys who happen to do bad things sometimes. Perhaps it&#x27;s just too exhausting to consider the extent of corruption in the USA.')
