The people you were working for were probably just like you a few years ago and when they first arrived the guy they worked for was a prick just like they were to you. They knew nothing and their job was on the line. They probably went home every night for a year, puked their guts out and frantically did everything they could to learn as quickly as they could while during the day keeping their head down, and trying to keep the look of panic off their faces.<p>Now they&#x27;re established, they&#x27;ve got their place. That boss that they struggled under is still there and they&#x27;re going to do to you exactly what he did to them. It&#x27;s like hazing. Sure one of them might choose to break the cycle and take you under their wing but they&#x27;re taking the risk that after you learn the ropes you&#x27;ll go to their sadistic boss and stab them in the back. You know you&#x27;d never do that but this is a workplace where everyone stabs everyone else in the back so why not. Also don&#x27;t think that there hasn&#x27;t been someone that&#x27;s already tried that and got stabbed in the back so everyone has seen it and knows what can happen so they&#x27;re not going to do that.<p>What they were probably looking for were two things. You could take a certain amount of shit and not fight back or at least fight back but only to a limit. They wanted to know that you knew your place. The second thing is they wanted to know if they could trust you. Until they know that you&#x27;re not going to go to their boss and say something like, &quot;I have no idea what they&#x27;re doing. They don&#x27;t even know XYX hot new tech&quot; you&#x27;re an enemy.<p>Not staying there very long was probably a blessing. Working in these environments can leave some serious scars. You read about stuff in history books were you think, &quot;wow, how can someone be so angry that they do such terrible things to other people&quot; then you work at a place like this and you find yourself thinking, &quot;if I came across him in the parking lot having a heart attack I&#x27;d step over the body and smile the whole ride home.&quot; Then you&#x27;ll know.')
