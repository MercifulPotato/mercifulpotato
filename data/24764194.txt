We need an AGPL++.<p>AGPL tries to target hosted services, preventing cloud companies from taking open source components without contributing anything back.<p>But you know what the AGPL misses? Our data.<p>We need open source licenses that require the systems that make use of them to provide data export and the right to be forgotten. We should encode the GDPR into our licenses. This would prevent Facebook from taking open source and using it to lock away our data.<p>We should also fight back against embrace, extend, extinguish. Apple is trying to take over computing and prevent us from running our own software on our own devices. We should prevent them and anyone else trying to do this from using our software.<p>No right to compute on your platform? Fine. No rights to open source software.<p>We have to defend computing and open source, otherwise we&#x27;ll all wind up using thin clients to access walled silos. And we&#x27;ll be renting the access, too.')
