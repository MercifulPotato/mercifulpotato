Especially when one side is 100x larger and more powerful than the other by any metric: number of people, revenue, marketing and PR budget.<p>Are we really supposed to believe uncritically that Red Hat, a publicly traded company with billions of revenue and an army of engineers at their command, are being bullied by a startup of what, a couple hundred people?<p>I’m sure the people at Docker did behave badly in some way to piss off people at Red Hat, but whenever I dig into the underlying facts, it’s always something silly and sometimes ridiculous. I’ve seen a talk by a Red Engineer dedicated entirely to the topic of how mean Docker maintainers were to him. The actual offense was 1) refusing to merge certain PRs Red Hat deemed important, 2) a tweet by an individual maintainer’s personal twitter account making fun of Red Hat for sending low-quality patches. That’s the kind of ridiculous petty food fights this whole “Docker vs the world” drama is built on. I mean, who cares?<p>TLDR: the real story is probably more complicated than “everything was great then Docker was mean and then they failed because they were mean, the end” and best told by a less biased source.')
