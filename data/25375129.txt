Maybe 7 days or so. We are about 280 days into the crisis, so it&#x27;s time for our normal political process to decide matters. (2) we need some way to allow people to voluntarily take vaccines faster. Like a special board that can override the FDA for individuals or groups who have over 1 in 1,000 chance of dying from a disease in the next year.')
