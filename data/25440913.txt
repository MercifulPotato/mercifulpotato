It also minimizes useless fluff to make it easy to have even more windows operated in parallel.<p>Windows, macOS, GNOME and others do various degrees of tiling as a sign of the usefulness. Even fullscreen is just a special case of tiling with 1 window.<p>If you&#x27;re a kind of person that always fullscreen things, you&#x27;ll enjoy a tiling WM.<p>(I don&#x27;t understand people that work with small floating windows. It&#x27;s a waste of limited screen real estate, and means you don&#x27;t get to see as much of what you&#x27;re working on as you could. Suboptimal.)')
