Years ago when I worked at Unisys, it was reported to HR that upon leaving an interview at our Training department the candidate overheard &quot;We don&#x27;t need any bitches working here!&quot; and general laughter. That was Friday. On Monday morning that Training department didn&#x27;t exist. All 6 employees dismissed instantly; the department functions farmed out to different groups. Some of those employees had worked there for a decade.<p>But at a startup 10 years later, after interviewing a recent graduate from the local college I asked our VP Engineering if she was a fit. He replied &quot;Did you see the guys around her? If I hired her, we&#x27;d get nothing done around here!&quot; I was appalled. He later became an executive at Carbonite.')
