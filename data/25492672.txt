Item(by='aidenn0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608533436, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25492472, text='&gt; Morals are personal&#x2F;cultural values<p>This phrase is something I completely disagree with.  Morals are how one ought to behave, and how one ought to behave can intersect with cultural and personal values, but is not determined by cultural and personal values.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m really not following how this relates to my original comment either, I meant your idea of &quot;fairness&quot; depends on personal values. The fact that people have different ideas of what&#x27;s fair is conclusive proof.<p>I missed that subtlety , I thought you meant the general discussion of whether meritocracies are good depends on personal values.  That stronger statement (that I now see you didn&#x27;t make) is what I was disagreeing with.')
