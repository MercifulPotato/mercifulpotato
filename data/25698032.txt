That or mine is special, because if I said to them to change from WhatsApp to whatever in the basis of privacy concerns they&#x27;d say that:\n1. FB already knows everything about them (btw, a social network the still use)\n2. They&#x27;d lost contact with a lot of people<p>And all this without taking into account features that can make the product even more pervasive (I&#x27;m thinking payments)<p>The problem is that once a product becomes the de facto solution and everyone is onboard, is hard to change it, specially one with network effects. If it wasn&#x27;t we would be using e.g. other search engines,  wouldn&#x27;t be?<p>Finally, I&#x27;d say the announcement of this change is perfectly timed: just after Christmas and in the middle of a pandemic. By the time we meet again with our extended families and we do the de rigueur holidays&#x27; technical support this change will have been forgotten by most people ;)')
