I like it on my phone in particular because I can pull things up faster and save data by not going to multiple pages for specific searches. Examples:<p>!s - start page, a google proxy\n!yt - youtube search\n!w - wikipedia\netc.<p>Almost all I use I just figured out because it&#x27;s obvious. !az = amazon, !ebay = ebay, etc. Usually just guessing gets me there 90% of the time, and then I can learn to use it again.<p>But again, that&#x27;s just my workflow, not for everyone if you don&#x27;t care if you use google for 99% of your searches.')
