So if your judgment about what you can keep in your head is good, you never have any bugs and you really don&#x27;t need TLA+. But if you <i>do</i> happen to have bugs occasionally, then your belief about how much you can keep in your head is sometimes wrong. TLA+ is a very quick way to <i>write down</i> what&#x27;s in your head so you can think about it more rigorously. Surely, if you can truly keep it in your head, it should be easy for you to write it down precisely. And just in case you&#x27;re wrong, there are tools that can <i>check</i> if you&#x27;re right, just to be extra sure. In short, TLA+ helps if you ever have bugs. It doesn&#x27;t help if you never do.')
