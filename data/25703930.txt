And they&#x27;re not using it for the small stuff; for example, Cisco has built its entire security platform with it.<p>Clojure is the third most popular JVM lang. To be fair though, this is mainly due to Kotlin taking over Scala. Also, Clojure probably is the second most popular lisp dialect on GitHub (after Emacs-lisp).<p>So I think the claim is correct. At least within the FP world - Clojure currently dominates over Haskell, OCaml, F#, Scala, Elixir, Erlang, etc.')
