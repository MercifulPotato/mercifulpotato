You&#x27;re confusing a bazaar with a retail store; the two are nothing alike legally or economically.<p>The supermarket pays for everything on its store shelves (except, rarely, for certain new products on a consignment basis in which case it only sales for units actually sold). Thus, it is irrelevant to the manufacturer whether the supermarket promotes their store-brand product or the name brand product; <i>they&#x27;ve already been paid by their primary customer.</i> Moreover, in essentially all cases, the name brand <i>also made</i> the store brand.<p>In contrast, Amazon not only sells alongside its third-party sellers, it uses its access to their sales data to come up with its own competing products. Notably, and very importantly: Amazon does not pay for the third-party sellers products available on its website, the third-party sellers have to pay that.<p>The manufacturers get paid either way (by the retailer, third-party seller, or Amazon if Amazon.com is the seller). But in the case of Amazon, the third-party sellers on Amazon&#x27;s website get screwed, and <i>that</i> is where the antitrust concern lies.')
