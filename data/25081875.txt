And this is reflected in <i>everything</i> they do.<p>The idea that Google is a technology company --- is really just another marketing facade.  Their technology is only as good as it has to be to further their advertising objectives. Any product they offer is subject to the whims of their advertising needs.<p>All of which leads to the current state of affairs.  You wouldn&#x27;t expect &quot;free&quot; technology or data storage from a restaurant. And you shouldn&#x27;t expect it from an ad company either.<p>Any disappointment here is really a reflection of unrealistic expectations and naive acceptance of Google&#x27;s marketing hype.')
