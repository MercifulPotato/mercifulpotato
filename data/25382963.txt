That is, SF, NYC, and a few other metros. There are businesses that probably run Java or something on their cash cow and want to throw a few bones to the developers for recruitment&#x2F;resume-driven-development purposes. Whereas JavaScript&#x2F;C++&#x2F;Java developers exist at every company and in every tiny city with a much broader pay scale.<p>Anecdotal, my company does some Clojure. But it&#x27;s limited to a handful of internal tools and we pretty much ended the experiment years ago. Nothing new is made in Clojure. To my knowledge, we&#x27;ve never hired specifically for Clojure. It&#x27;s always some dev that knows another language.')
