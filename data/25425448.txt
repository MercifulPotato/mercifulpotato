Not wearing a mask or taking the shot isnt an attempt to take away freedom, civilization has agreed that its murder, and so long as people are willing to put others at risk over a minor inconvenience the economy will stunted and some of our more fragile Americans will die. If you dont like how things are right now its on you to change, deflecting or claiming some inalienable right doesnt work, it hasnt worked. You&#x27;re hurting your country.')
