Their motto for removing him is essentially &quot;At any cost&quot; at this point.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;re framing his actions or words along the lines of &quot;fascist dictator&quot;. This is simply a continuation of the vitriolic rhetoric I&#x27;ve been trying to combat for years now. It&#x27;s crazed, and I do not understand why you - someone who can write clearly enough that you must be intelligent - cannot see it. It&#x27;s rhetoric like that that is driving so many people to distrust you.<p>Trump will challenge the election results in court and succeed or fail. It&#x27;s as simple as that. Personally, I hope it&#x27;s a failure because I don&#x27;t want there to have been any impropriety. If that&#x27;s the case, Trump is done. There is no fascism. There is no dictator. Please stop catastrophizing.')
