In a typical modern day computer instructions, and the data to be manipulated are put in the same place [1].  This is a critical feature that makes things like downloading a program and running it possible.  But for programmers to keep their code &quot;safe&quot; they must enforce artificial boundaries between the instructions (code) and the data.  Hackers are experts at crossing those boundaries and tricking computers to treat data as code when they shouldn&#x27;t.<p>Mathematicians have the good sense to keep their data and instructions separate.
