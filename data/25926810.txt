Specifically, color separated film: three rolls of B&#x2F;W PET-base film, one for each of red, green and blue. These are expected to last 100+ years, are trivial to read and have color stability beyond any kind of color film (because the color information is encoded in black and white films instead of pigments) and offer more than sufficient resolution (they aren&#x27;t prints, but made using laser film recorders). This sounds expensive but is apparently ~one order of magnitude cheaper long term than digital &quot;archival&quot;.<p>If companies with Hollywood funding consider digital archival too expensive and too fragile... should really tell you something.<p>Other long-term archives are not digital, either. Germany&#x27;s Barbarastollen houses thousands of stainless steel barrels with black and white microfilms - about a billion of them.')
