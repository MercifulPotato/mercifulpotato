It&#x27;s not random, it&#x27;s AI-complete. We literally <i>can&#x27;t handle</i> it formally, and that&#x27;s why we need to defer to the only &quot;general AI&quot; we have - or as its ordinarily called, human judgement. And human judgement is not random - it&#x27;s taking into account vast amounts of data, like ethics&#x2F;morality and social context, which for now escape our attempts at formalizing them.')
