At this rate by the time a federal increase happens we&#x27;ll already be another 20 years behind.<p>Worse yet is that labor data shows that more and more adults are working in minimum wage jobs, so the talking point of &quot;it&#x27;s just summer jobs for teenagers&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s entry level work to move on from&quot; is very out of touch with reality these days. There are millions of people trying to survive on these wage levels and without benefits and it is not working.')
