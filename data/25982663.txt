It is a fact we can be pretty sure of, and we know the context of that fact. Obviously, once we extrapolate from that experienced fact, it becomes bias.<p>&gt; A fact that is not a personal experience is difficult to trust.<p>I think this is a very common sentiment, because of the immediacy of the experience, but that doesn&#x27;t make it true.<p>My biggest gains as a human came when I started questioning whether my natural interpretation of the world was actually very good.  It turns out, my natural inclinations for understanding things is pretty bad, and now that I recognize that, I am a much more effective human being.<p>Having gone through that journey, I now spot it all over the place with others.  People misinterpret the world all of the time, and they do it without question because it&#x27;s their personal experience, and how can that be wrong?  It&#x27;s too bad.  We waste so much potential not accounting for our own limitations.')
