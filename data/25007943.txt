Its not a line limit, its a mean length issue. If you spend more and empty the line, then you haven&#x27;t made a dime more. In fact if you spent money doing that, you lost money.<p>That&#x27;s the issue - if the customer pool is inflexible, the rational thing is to raise prices until you hit that limit.<p>Now if the line is self-limiting (folks wont queue if it &#x27;looks too long&#x27;) then there&#x27;s something to that.')
