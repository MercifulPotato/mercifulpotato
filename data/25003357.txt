I&#x27;ve had this thought floating around in my head for a long while. The only affordable high-density cities I can think of are in Thailand, Africa, and maybe Eastern Europe? I think NYC is our best comparison though... it&#x27;s actually much more expensive per square foot to buy in Manhattan than it is in SF, and the rental prices are approximately the same.')
