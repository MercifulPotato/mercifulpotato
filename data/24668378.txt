It shouldn&#x27;t really be in the publisher&#x27;s interest to prevent libraries from lending more copies. They&#x27;d just be limiting their own customer base.<p>That&#x27;s the capitalist ideal though, there&#x27;s plenty of reasons why it&#x27;s not currently happening. Most publishers still seem to think they can continue pricing digital and physical books the same and turn the <i>significant</i> savings in printing costs into pure profit. And they might have some second thoughts about this whole &#x27;lending books&#x27; thing.<p>CDL is interesting here because it is in essence a threat that failing to provide a fair digital alternative will just lead to libraries digitizing the books for themselves, and in the worst case <i>cooperate</i> so you can lend a copy of the book provided <i>any</i> (statewide, countrywide, worldwide) library still has an unlent copy.')
