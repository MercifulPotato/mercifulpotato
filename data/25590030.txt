Have you seen how arduous Medicaid is? Food stamps? That&#x27;s not a vocational training program, that&#x27;s a punishment for being poor while having a system set up explicitly to make you poor. After all, this is <i>not</i> subsidizing the individuals, it&#x27;s subsidizing the business.<p>It&#x27;s a blunt instrument right now. Just paying minimum wage doesn&#x27;t guarantee any sort of education or training. What corner store offers education and training programs?<p>The rational approach is to make companies pay a living wage as a baseline, and then if you want to encourage certain behaviors - like educational training, for instance - offer tax credits and rebates. Or, if you want to subsidize specific low value added businesses like corner stores, subsidize them directly.<p>Begin with a baseline of livability, and then, if the company wants to go above and beyond, reward them for doing so.')
