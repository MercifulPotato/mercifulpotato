The very nature of fingerprinting makes it difficult to prevent without some pretty severe compromises, and it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if advertisers enter an arms race with Google instead of caving in.<p>Of course the economic strategy for Google to avoid that is to reduce the price&#x2F;limits of this service to so low that this isn&#x27;t worth doing, but if the effort Google puts into preventing fingerprinting is insufficent then this would lead to a &quot;worst of both worlds&quot; situation - Google gets to pseudonymously track the internet with their &quot;privacy sandbox&quot;, and nefarious trackers&#x2F;advertisers can combine that with fingerprinting to create an even more reliable picture of who&#x27;s who on the Internet.<p>FYI, this[0] appears to be the explainer of what Privacy Sandbox actually is, and it&#x27;s quite vague, presumably because the actual implementation details of this would be difficult to determine.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;michaelkleber&#x2F;privacy-model" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;michaelkleber&#x2F;privacy-model</a>')
