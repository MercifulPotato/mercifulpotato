Credit cards here don&#x27;t usually have good rewards either. If you spend 10000 euros you might get 10 back in the end of the year, hardly something to hurrah for. Sometimes they give you a free TV if you open up a bank account with the bank and change to the bank to receive your monthly salary, but that&#x27;s about it. So don&#x27;t really have any reasons to use a credit card instead of a debit, as I only spend money I have anyways.<p>If I remember correctly, banks here also always give you a debit card when you sign up with them, while credit cards have to be applied for separately and also usually has a yearly fee, compared to debit cards that are free.')
