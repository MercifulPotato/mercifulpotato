Enter: Xoloft followed by Trintellix (1 week in). I dealt w&#x2F; them pretty well, I&#x27;d go lay down, breathe and maybe take a cat nap, wake up in 30 minutes go back to work feeling like a million dollars. Now, not so much.<p>So, I started xoloft a month ago, it screwed up me libido and made me continually &#x27;want it&#x27; but not able to &#x27;deliver&#x27; (or it&#x27;d take way too long). Switched to Trintellix, still have panic attacks, sex is better, but anxiety doesn&#x27;t seem affected. Now, I feel I&#x27;m actually more depressed though, and just not wanting to get out of bed. Motivation is rough.<p>I&#x27;m also taking Vyvanse for ADHD. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as it was before adding anxiety meds.<p>Should I just scrap the anxiety meds altogether and just deal with adhd? Anyone else w&#x2F; similar experience want to chime in? It&#x27;s really messing me up, and I&#x27;ve recently lost my main client so I really need to focus and get some income (web dev&#x2F;laravel), or I&#x27;m gonna be homeless (40 w&#x2F; wife and 2 kids - so not an option).')
