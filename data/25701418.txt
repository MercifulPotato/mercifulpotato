It&#x27;s the kinetic energy, the design of the bullet, there&#x27;s recoil mitigation, bullet cavitation, etc.  They are weapons designed to reduce the amount of effort required to stop people, permanently.<p>(I&#x27;m not a gun nut but I am a physics nerd, so i read up on how assault weapons differ from more conventional hunting weapons.
