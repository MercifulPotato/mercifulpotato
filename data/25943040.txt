On the other hand, the big tech companies did not view video calls as a critical use case until ~9 months ago.<p>You can see this in how much Chrome has improved in its last 3 releases. A year ago, you could play ~15 videos simultaneously in a page on Chrome before &lt;stalling, chaos, and crashing&gt;. Now, on the same machine, you can play &gt;50. This matters for video calls because the standard stream topology these days for multi-party calls is 1 up, N down, where N is the number of participants in the call.<p>Hardware and OS support is critical, too, so this is an ecosystem challenge.<p><pre><code>  - encoder pipelines don&#x27;t do low-resolution streams very well, which matters for large video calls\n  - encoder pipelines don&#x27;t do variable framerate, variable resolution, large resolution&#x2F;low-framerate, and &quot;non-standard&quot; resolutions as well as they could\n  - hardware support for newer codecs (vp9, h265, av1) would help\n  - decoder pipelines aren&#x27;t great at decoding lots of small videos in parallel\n</code></pre>\nEveryone focused on single-stream video playback for the last few years, which led to really amazing improvements <i>watching</i> video. Nobody complains anymore about their fan spinning up every time they watch Netflix. Now we have to put the same effort into the building blocks needed for video calls.')
