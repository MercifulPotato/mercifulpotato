If I sleep 11-11.5 hours, then I&#x27;ll feel rested, but this rarely happens.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there are plenty of days I have an early meeting morning and sleep for 6-7h, but I will feel even more tired than when I sleep &quot;only&quot; 9h. Frustrating because 9h is on the verge of &quot;too much sleep&quot; for most people.')
