Just had a new hire join the team and we had a sprint to release a slack app we were using internally.<p>We call it Beacon. It hooks up to your data warehouse or transactional db and allows you to query and access the latest data right in slack.<p>We use this for tracking daily active users, revenue, and other high level KPIs. We often end up using it to debug queries in the data team too.')
