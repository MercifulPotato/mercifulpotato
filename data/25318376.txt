Most of the world doesn&#x27;t have the problem that you say is intractable. So doing a web search, I found this that says that North Americans really are a complete outlier on grocery shopping habits.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;priceonomics.com&#x2F;how-the-world-shops-for-groceries&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;priceonomics.com&#x2F;how-the-world-shops-for-groceries&#x2F;</a><p>I live in NA, but a grocery store is an easy walk, and was on my daily commute in pre-COVID times. This makes me an outlier among North Americans I guess. But it would be the norm for places that allow for car free life.<p>The following is therefore speculation, but the best I can come up with to try to meet you where you are. Right now, your car based life is so inconvenient and so inefficient, that stopping by a store is something to be minimized, to do as infrequently as possible. So to you, going to the store more than once a week is an inconvenience. You have to drive somewhere special outside of your normal route, park, walk a long distance from the car to the store, wander around a store so large that the idea of stopping and grabbing something quick is almost inconceivable. You likely even have to wait in line, because checking out a single person with a full week of groceries takes many minutes.<p>Once we allow the possibility of <i>not</i> living with a car, which means all of your daily needs within walking distance, an entirely new world opens up that is much more convenient. There is a smaller, well stocked store along most routes you take. Grabbing groceries for a day or two is not an affair that has an extra half hour of driving and walking. It&#x27;s a quick hop in and out. You can always have fresh food, because you stop frequently and quickly, without having to wait a week in between trips because to shop more frequently would be wasteful of time. Run out of sugar? No big deal, it&#x27;s conveniwnt to buy some more.<p>Once cars are gone and cities are designed around that, everything is more accessible and convenient. I mean, the whole thread started with how life in cities so not need cars, and how having cars in cities ruins life there. And for that matter, much of small town life can be similar to cities, because there, needs can also be within walking distance for a small compact town.<p>It&#x27;s only car-based suburbia with highly restricted unmixed land uses that leads to this &quot;I can only go the grocery store once a week&quot; attitude. Life does not <i>have</i> to be that way, people that want it should be able to live like that, and those that don&#x27;t want it should be able to have walkable lives. Walkable areas mean more accessibility than car-based areas, because stopping does not involve parking.')
