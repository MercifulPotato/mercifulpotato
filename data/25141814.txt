I <i>know</i> that there are kids out there who started out with a significantly-higher ranking within a year of playing than I will ever get to as an adult.

But I think it&#x27;s fine for me to say &quot;this isn&#x27;t my game, I will play it so long as it&#x27;s fun, but I won&#x27;t ever be a genius at it.&quot;')
