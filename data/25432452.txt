I&#x27;m not actually a big fan of the Gmail interface either (and it&#x27;d be better if they actually followed material design, imo).<p>But this spirit is fundamentally opposed to people in corporate environments doing good work. Blameless portmortems exist for a reason. Because otherwise, every systemic or personal failure devolves into a scapegoating competition designed to find and remove the most vulnerable member of the team. My criticism is directed specifically at folks suggesting that <i>internally</i> peers at my workplace should harass designers.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25422855" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25422855</a>')
