Item(by='frongpik', descendants=None, kids=[25598332], score=None, time=1609451584, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25594499, text='&quot;Life doesn&#x27;t violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics&quot; sounds similar to &quot;magnetism does no work&quot;. Yet we know that magnetism creates macroscopic effects: a magnet can lift an iron nail, despite it does no work. The way it&#x27;s explained is that magnetism somehow redirects other forces that do the work. My point is that something can do work without doing work &quot;on paper&quot; because all the work is done by others.')
