I don&#x27;t want to suggest that you&#x27;re bigoted as this is getting alarmingly close to a culture war topic, and I recognize the difficulty in conveying that in person, much less over the internet, where &quot;I don&#x27;t mean to offend but...&quot; is usually followed by something offensive. But I do want to understand your analysis of the game-theoretic conditions that you believe lead to smaller groups outcompeting larger groups.<p>Why would the most beneficial group of people that we want to band with be optimal when limited to a subset of the population, whether that&#x27;s simply a random selection, or a potentially bigoted selection&#x2F;identification mechanism like skin color, wealth, religious sect, family name, etc.?<p>I don&#x27;t understand why a broader grouping (possibly global) of people wouldn&#x27;t outcompete a smaller group, the larger group by definition has a larger capability...intra-group communication may be slightly more difficult with language barriers and cultural differences, and the relative contributions of sub-groups of members may differ based on their resources, but the sum total would still be greater.')
