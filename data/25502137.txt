You go to a restaurant, they say you can buy the tasting menu for $100, but they have a temp chef working that day which will cost you $50 extra, which you find out as you&#x27;re paying.\n&quot;<p>In the US you go to a hospital and basically sign a contract &quot;you can charge me for whatever you feel like&quot;. What surprises me is that they get away with often charging for stuff that never happened. When you confront them they just say &quot;Oops!&quot; ad take it off only to try it again next time. I don&#x27;t understand how they get away with that.')
