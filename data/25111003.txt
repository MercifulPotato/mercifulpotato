Item(by='hyperpallium2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605531124, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25106001, text='Not sure if fatal to your argument, but zero doesn&#x27;t need to be remapped: showing two sets can&#x27;t be mapped doesn&#x27;t require every element to be remapped.<p>But maybe your point about needing infinite digits is the reason? Anyway, here&#x27;s a sketch of the &quot;proof&quot;:<p>list the natural numbers, in binary, simply in order, from zero onwards. But written in reverse, eg 100 (4) is written 001<p>[NB: the list will grow longer faster than the length of each number, so the diagonal will be all zeros.]<p>now construct the &quot;diagonal&quot; number: taking its ith digit as the complement of the ith digit of the ith number in the list. This will be all 1&#x27;s.<p>This number isn&#x27;t in the list, because one of its digits differs from each one of them, by definition. Therefore, this list of the natural numbers can&#x27;t enumerate all the natural numbers.<p>Perhaps the flaw is simply that although there are infinitely many natural numbers, each of them only has finite digits. That all-1 diagonal has infinite digits, so it isn&#x27;t a natural number (as you say).')
