It’s a third of the age of the Universe. That is just mind boggling. While I have trouble mentally grasping ages on the magnitude “billions”, I do know what a third is. It’s a very sizable chunk. And for this very old thing with life as you say very early — it’s crazy how we’re here only now. The sample size is small though. I have no idea if quirks on the path took evolution unusually long or if we’re early, or what. Still, yes, this is something to consider.')
