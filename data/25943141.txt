I wanted to get some reasonable people to follow based on my interests (programming, tech, philosophy, etc), but I couldn&#x27;t really find how to find these people. I tried googling top mastodon people to follow to no avail. No beginners guides apart from the mundane how to create an account. If anyone has any tips, let me know')
