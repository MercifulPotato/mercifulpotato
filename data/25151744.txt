Honestly, it&#x27;s just the teachers, my high school teachers taught with passion in college it was a chore for my professors.<p>An AP biology teacher in high school is teaching a class with disproportionately the most predisposed-to-be-engaged students, and its the central part of their job, in which they are secure and focussed. A lower-division biology professor in a university is probably teaching a class with disproportionately the <i>least</i> predisposed-to-be-engaged students, and if they are a tenured or tenure-track professor at a research university, its also not the core of their job (if they aren&#x27;t, its a core part of their job -- but one in which they are insecure, are more likely to be adjusting to, and which may be one of several jobs.)')
