The thesis is that language ability is better predictor of coding ability than numerical ability. The problem here—as in so many psychology studies—is that you need to substitute &quot;____ ability&quot; with &quot;performance on a test that is designed by psychologists to measure ____ ability, but probably measures test-taking ability instead.&quot;<p>More specifically, they found that their language test (MLAT) is a better predictor of their coding test (Codecademy) than their numeracy test (Abbreviated Numeracy Scale). But there needs to be some argument as to why this isn&#x27;t just a relic of the test formats, and I am not seeing it.<p>After looking at some sample questions from each [1], [2], the MLAT questions simply look more like Codecademy questions than ANS questions. We&#x27;ve learned something about the relationship between these tests but I&#x27;m not convinced we&#x27;ve learned anything about language, math, coding, or their relation to cognition. You might disagree, and I&#x27;d be interested to hear opposing points of view. I encourage you to take a look at the tests yourself.<p>I should mention that I am not interested in gatekeeping, or saying that people who find math difficult shouldn&#x27;t do CS. I was a bad math student in high school, and I would probably get a bad score on all these tests (not that I would take them without a gun to my head). I&#x27;m now happily employed as a data scientist. On the contrary, I think that if we are going to say &quot;people like <i>this</i> are good at coding,&quot; regardless of what <i>this</i> is, our evidence should be more solid than this study.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-020-60661-8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41598-020-60661-8</a><p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lltf.net&#x2F;mlat-sample-items&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lltf.net&#x2F;mlat-sample-items&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1002&#x2F;bdm.1751" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1002&#x2F;bdm.1751</a>')
