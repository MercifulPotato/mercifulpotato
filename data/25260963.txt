It has lots of what you&#x27;d expect from Yngwie, but it is nearly entirely acoustic and tr√®s romantique.<p>It&#x27;s actually one of the most intensely relaxing albums I own. You don&#x27;t usually expect to hear that in re an 80&#x27;s shredder. I usually play stuff like this when people who dislike metal (gasp!) are visiting.<p>PS: Symphony X is pretty great, too. Reminds me of 80&#x27;s thrash with a neo-classical accent, and has all the prog elements that make the genre great.')
