I drove it quite a bit this past weekend, in lovely Dallas winter conditions. (No snow, no fog, no rain.) While snow is obviously a challenge, the Tesla is so far from being able to handle routine driving in unchallenging conditions, it would be a big miscalculation to think, for example, that Teslas drive with FSD just fine in normal conditions. I would estimate that I take over about once every 3-5 miles in absolutely routine conditions.')
