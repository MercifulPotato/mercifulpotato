The stock market is not the economy. Big Tech bubbles are bad, but this isn&#x27;t 2008 where people lost their houses because of financial engineering.<p>I think the bigger story (and issue) is just how few people are involved in and benefiting from Tech. These companies have massive market caps because they employ a tiny amount of people relative to how much money they make. For every one tech worker making high six figures there are a 50 people doing low-level healthcare service work. The vast majority of Americans own trivial amounts of stock, so they don&#x27;t even benefit indirectly from the Tech bubble. All of this is just exacerbating the radical divergence of the haves and have-nots in our economy.')
