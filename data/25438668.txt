If I get only six hours of Cyberpunk 2077 played at $60. That&#x27;s 10&#x2F;hr for entertainment... which is better than a lot of stuff.<p>I&#x27;ll probably sink 50 or 60 hours into the game completing the main story. That&#x27;s $1&#x2F;hr of entertainment... ridiculously good value.<p>The amount of time we have is finite, attaching a dollars per hour figure to it is a hilariously bad metric to judge how much value entertainment has.  People don&#x27;t play X&#x27;s and O&#x27;s all day because it&#x27;s great value.')
