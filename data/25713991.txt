Once he gets used to moving, he will ideally be in the right frame of mind for adding something more.<p>My father is 77 and two years ago started exercising after a life of enjoying food a lot, being relatively inactive, and years with a troublesome achilles tendon.<p>He started with gentle walks, aiming for 5k steps a day. After several months, he added weekly circuit training with a group (he now does that three mornings a week). Then during Covid lockdown, gym with a boxing bag in his garage and long walks in the hills. And more recently fast rounds of golf, carrying his clubs, at 6am when the greens are empty.<p>He&#x27;s now in the best shape he&#x27;s ever been. Stronger and with more endurance than when he was in his 20s.<p>Just before Christmas, his step counter said in the previous 4 months, he had walked 1.4m steps, 1000 km.<p>Good luck with your dad!')
