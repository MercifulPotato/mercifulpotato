Item(by='ecmascript', descendants=None, kids=[24836664], score=None, time=1603197383, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24836422, text='&gt; If you measure the unemployed as anybody over 16 years old who isn&#x27;t earning a living wage<p>That seems like it will give you a really bad number because they are for sure unemployed but a lot of people in the age 16-20something will go to school.<p>I didn&#x27;t earn a living wage until I was 22, but I also earn pretty well nowadays and pay a more taxes than most of my friends.<p>Seems like the author has come to a conclusion before writing the article. A pretty dishonest piece imo. Because if you include students, why not include children and retired people as well?')
