So if the admin of the foo site and the admin of the bar site are adversarial, they can steal each other&#x27;s cookies?<p>That doesn&#x27;t seem right at all... I hope I am misunderstanding.<p>Now, if the admin of foo overrides the cookie scope to be *.example.com instead of the default foo.example.com, then yes it&#x27;s expected that the admin of bar can steal foo&#x27;s cookies. This is mentioned in the NextDNS Medium article you linked to, toward the end. This is definitely a &quot;gotcha&quot; situation but at least the default is safe, as far as I can tell.')
