I have been running the Matrix bridges for each[1] and am donating monthly to the creator. It&#x27;s worth it.<p>So far the &quot;network effects&quot; have been coincidental: one small group of colleagues registered on matrix.org after one more colleague from our small circle turned out to have a home server. There are 7-ish of us now, 2 with their home servers (myself and the &quot;other colleague&quot;), and 5 with accounts on matrix.org.<p>To go &quot;native&quot;, I see one lacking point with discoverability: I don&#x27;t know of a way to discover my &quot;contacts&quot; whether they use Matrix without asking them first. Which is not true in any other messaging apps I have tried: Signal and WhatsApp use my address book and their phone numbers, Messenger is tied to my &quot;friends&quot;. However, although Matrix allows entering phone and e-mail identifiers, I haven&#x27;t seen an easy way to &quot;find&quot; them. Any pointers?<p>Overall, Synapse is easy to install and run. Took about two evenings to configure synapse + 3 bridges (whatsapp, messenger, hangouts).<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;bridges&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;bridges&#x2F;</a>')
