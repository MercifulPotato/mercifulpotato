The biggest change until now was to immersion lithography as we started getting into UV.  Now we&#x27;re into EUV (extreme UV).  Lenses no longer work, everything has to be done with reflective optics (and even then the mirrors get ablated over time).  It&#x27;s the biggest single change in lithography we&#x27;ve seen and Intel still hasn&#x27;t been able to pull it off in volume.')
