I&#x27;m old enough to remember when cable was first rolled out and a big selling point for it was commercial free channels. And, as you mentioned, look at it now. Channels like TBS and TNT take it to such extremes too. A movie with a runtime of an hour and twenty minutes takes 3 hours to watch! If not for DVR I probably wouldn&#x27;t watch any network or cable TV at all these days.')
