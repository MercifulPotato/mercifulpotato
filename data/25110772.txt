While it is certainly true that intonation (or rather pitch accent) is not <i>written</i> in Japanese, it is absolutely an important part of the language. If your pitch accent is wrong, people will have a harder time understanding you, or may not understand you at all, especially if you make other mistakes on top of it or are using a word that means different things depending on the pitch accent.<p>The never-ending myth that &quot;Japanese is flat&quot; or that pitch accent does not matter in Japanese is one of the primary causes of Japanese learners ending up with poor prounciation and difficulty sounding natural. It&#x27;s like having all the accents wrong in Spanish (my native language); sure, people will eventually understand you, but it&#x27;s just awkward and not correct. Except it&#x27;s worse in Japanese due to the much higher occurrence of homophones only differentiated by pitch accent.')
