He hasn&#x27;t left Pennsylvania in 15 years. Someone typoed a plate number. He either had to pay $55, drive over 100 miles to appear in court, or not pay the fine and become a criminal. How many people are victims of another&#x27;s incompetence? Or get points on their license because they drove five miles over the speed limit on the day a shitty cop was trying to make their quota? Or lost their license because they had points from that situation, but still needed to get to work? There are so many gotchas that, for the middle class, amount to very little. But for less fortunate folks, can ruin their lives.<p>When you live paycheck to paycheck, the smallest infractions have a nasty habit of snowballing.')
