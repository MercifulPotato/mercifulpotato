For example, I have seen Himachali speakers from neighbouring districts communicate with each other exclusively using Khariboli Hindi, rather than their native Himachali dialects.<p>This is probably true of most large, diverse languages. Each dialect has drifted sufficiently far from each other than while it is possible to communicate with other dialects, it&#x27;s most convenient to use the shared formalized standard register. So while a Malvani speaker can largely comprehend the dialect of somebody from Gadchiroli, more often both speakers will switch to the standard Marathi register they learnt in school.')
