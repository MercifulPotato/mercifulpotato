I recently got a Recumbent exercise bike which is compatible with iFit.<p>Does anyone know any apps which are able to communicate with iFit compatible equipment without needing to use the iFit app? I&#x27;ve got a 1 year free account with them but after that it doesn&#x27;t really feel like their all offers enough for the monthly cost.
