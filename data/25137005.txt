As someone who struggles with ADHD one of the best things I stumbled across are accountability groups.  I have no problem with focus, structure and deadlines when it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m really into - but for everything else it can be a real struggle!  Some groups are just like minded people who get together, in my experience the better ones are formalized as part of a paid program.<p>Probably because a bunch of people that don&#x27;t do well with unstructured systems probably shouldn&#x27;t be trying to run structured systems :)  So we pay people who are good at organizing to do it.<p>I set my tasks and deadlines (and the group can help with that if I get stuck), and I have partners in the group that provide that deadline accountability and also the structure of checkins for regular progress.  Something I scoffed at first but find to be valuable is just being on a zoom meeting with someone else while working on a task.  Not necessarily interacting with them, but just knowing someone else is there helps with focus, tends to keep distractions&#x2F;procrastination in check, etc.<p>Probably sounds crazy to most reading this but for those who are wired a bit differently strategies like this can make all the difference.')
