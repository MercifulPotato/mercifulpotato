I&#x27;ve been working a booth at a convention showing off some tech and asked a passing worker for an extension cord. The response was that they asked on the radio, but the only person available to perform this role was on lunch so it&#x27;d be at least 45 minutes until I could get an extension cord.<p>While the anecdote is true, it&#x27;s also FUD, because there&#x27;s no good reason to expect a tech worker&#x27;s union would work like that. It would exist to solve tech worker&#x27;s problems, which are different than those of a convention center worker.  If tech workers would chafe at rigid role definitions, a tech worker&#x27;s union that they control would not impose them.')
