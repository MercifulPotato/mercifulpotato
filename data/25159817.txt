I&#x27;ve been a linux user for 13 years but never felt the need to have a fileserver. Now being able to plug a drive in and take a snapshot without rsyncing or thinking about what I&#x27;m snapshotting, having it be inherent to the filesystem, was a game changer.<p>Not to mention being able to snapshot important folders to the native drive in case I need to recover a file from a previous state. I run datasets for categories of data and I can choose categories that I want regular local snapshots of (zvol&#x2F;crypt&#x2F;Documents, zvol&#x2F;crypt&#x2F;scripts, zvol&#x2F;crypt&#x2F;Papers)<p>Essentially, ZFS manages my files <i>for me</i>. And it all comes with things I didn&#x27;t know I needed, like filesystem compression. I know BTRFS also attempts to provide this, and there&#x27;s the licensing issues with ZFS, but I wanted MacOS compatibility also. Although that was an adventure on its own.')
