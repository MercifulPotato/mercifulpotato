Apparently Mediatek is the one building the kernel of the device and not even HMD has knowledge on what modifications have been made (for example is DuraSpeed, which was an aggressive battery saver that ruined some apps, was enabled without permission and even HMD cannot disable it permanently). Qualcomm SoC devices are okay, but expect a slight delay (around a week or two especially if it was a device from a carrier) for updates.')
