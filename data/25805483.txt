However, &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; (misinformation) and damage is a slippery slope.  <i>Who</i> gets to decide what&#x27;s damaging &quot;information&quot;?   That is the question you&#x27;re replying to, and you missed that piece - that is not a nuance, but <i>the</i> critical question we should consider when we call for removal of megaphones, censorship and so forth.<p>You mentioned government v. private platforms, and reminded me that those examples I gave of government don&#x27;t apply.  But again I wanted to point out the examples of the &quot;who&quot; part, and the same argumentation they had &quot;this _ is harmful&quot; where _ is art, or books, or speech. <i>Who</i> bloody decides what is true and false, how do we choose them, and what credentials makes them the choosers?  And what if today&#x27;s choosers and tomorrow&#x27;s choosers have completely different notions of True and False?<p>You&#x27;re defending censorship using an ancient argument of &quot;harmful information&quot; that has dangerous downstream effects is the point I am driving at.')
