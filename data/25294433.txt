Particularly single people living alone without kids (I fall in that bucket).<p>I&#x27;ve &quot;abused&quot; the system in the way you describe when I moved from SF to NYC.<p>The only alternative was to drive cross-country, or put my dog under the plane in a crate for 10+ hours unsupervised. That it not something I&#x27;m comfortable doing. My pet isn&#x27;t luggage (at least in my eyes, others may disagree).<p>I&#x27;d gladly pay for 2 seats on a plane if airlines allowed it. They don&#x27;t.')
