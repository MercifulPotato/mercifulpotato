When I said &quot;functions&quot; I meant &quot;pure functions&quot; in the sense that you can call them anytime and don&#x27;t need to consider any special rules. An example would be `Math.pow`.<p>Hooks are not _just_ functions, they are special functions where that (by the documentation) should not be called inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. These are severe restrictions compared to the &quot;normal&#x2F;pure&quot; functions that I meant.')
