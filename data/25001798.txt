Here in SF, it&#x27;s an entirely paper election, and at every precinct there is a ballot scanner.  As people fill out their ballots, it gets scanned, tabulated (aka &quot;counted&quot;), then deposited in a locked box that&#x27;s part of the machine.  Your ballot has no personally identifying markings, and is now lost in a pile of other ballots.  That is how ballot secrecy works in practice.<p>At the end of the night, the electronic tabulation is removed from the machine (CF cards), then given in a security sealed bag to a deputy officer who takes it to city hall to be summed up for the results.  The paper results are organized, and put in security sealed bags, and given to a sheriff (person with gun), and locked into a van to be transported back to city hall.<p>So now we have the best of both worlds: fast results, and paper audit trail.  Any precinct can be retabulated - just run all the cards thru a machine again.  The mail-in ballots are processed separately, and once the envelopes have been verified, the ballots are put thru a tabulation machine as well.  My understanding is city hall has a ballot tabulator for every precinct mail-in, and as they process mail they drop them in the appropriate machine. If a mistake was made - it&#x27;s easily correctable because each ballot has the precinct number printed on it.<p>It&#x27;s a very easy to understand system, that requires only basic elements of computer security.  Cross checking a ballot tabulator for accuracy is easy.  Recounting is easy.<p>And finally, for accessible voting, people use a tablet to choose their selections, then their ballot is printed out, which contains the summary of the vote, and a QR code the ballot machine scans.<p>Oh yes, and the ballot machine scans and keeps image files of every ballot.  I&#x27;m not sure what they do with that, but there we go.<p>It&#x27;s fascinating, and my experiences in the SF elections department gives me high confidence that the SF election, and any run like it, are very secure, and accurate.')
