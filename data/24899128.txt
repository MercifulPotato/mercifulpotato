The government does. By what authority does this government have to execute punishments outside of the law? If the government has authority to execute punishment outside of the law then it becomes judge, jury and executioner. That&#x27;s not a hypothetical, when there is power, those who wield that power will use it. Is there really any doubt that this would extend beyond just chemical dumping to other things? To me there isn&#x27;t.')
