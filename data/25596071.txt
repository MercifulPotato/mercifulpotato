Every recent study (past ~decade) that I&#x27;m aware of has shown no effect.<p>Here&#x27;s an article that discusses one recent study:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chicagotribune.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;ct-bias-hiring-0504-biz-20160503-story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chicagotribune.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;ct-bias-hiring-0504-...</a><p>The problem with the original study was that it used names that denoted socio-economic status as much as race (ie, &quot;Dahntay Smith&quot; or &quot;Shaniqua Thomas&quot;). That&#x27;s a problem, too, but I suspect a similar effect for professional job applicants can be shown using &quot;lower&quot; socio-economic status white names (ie, &quot;Bobby Lee Jones&quot; or &quot;Tommy Ray Brown&quot;).<p>Regardless, I would be <i>strongly</i> in favor of anonymized job applications, since that would eliminate any suggestion of such bias in whichever direction.')
