I have no actual confirmation as to why it&#x27;s there, other than the fact that i just noticed it one day i was staying in a hotel, and it&#x27;s been there ever since. That was 10+ years ago. I assume it&#x27;s the &quot;usual&quot; causes, too much loud music and decades of riding my motorbike with crappy helmets, though mine is not caused by hearing loss.<p>Normally it&#x27;s just a slight ringing that i hardly notice if there is other stuff going on, but when i get stressed, or slouch in my office chair, it can gain volume in the evening.<p>I&#x27;ve learned to &quot;ignore&quot; mine. As i&#x27;m typing this i&#x27;m very aware of it because i&#x27;m &quot;focusing on it&quot;, but when i&#x27;m doing work, watching tv, or even walking the dog i don&#x27;t notice it. I find it to be the most annoying when i&#x27;m trying to listen to quiet tv, or trying to fall asleep.<p>What i normally do is try to focus on some other background noise. Rain falling on a window, my wife or dog breathing. This usually makes it &quot;go away&quot; for long enough that i&#x27;m not annoyed by it anymore.<p>Fun fact, ANC headphones will make mine disappear which makes absolutely no sense as the noise is non audible, so there&#x27;s no noise for the headphones to cancel, and yet it goes away, or at least becomes inaudible.')
