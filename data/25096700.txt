Item(by='lmeyerov', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605397151, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25095744, text='yep. it&#x27;s a negative suggesting multiple potential issues: political&#x2F;misdirecting, lacking positives that they could have instead highlighted, awareness+communication issues where they didn&#x27;t realize the mistake, etc. none of those may be true, and even some they are, not matter for the role, so you&#x27;re right, can be fine.<p>but in a startup scenario.. there&#x27;s less room for hiring mistakes than in a bigco, so I wouldn&#x27;t just ignore. I&#x27;ve definitely passed on folks after catching lies in their CV - trust is a pretty basic ingredient before asking someone to own something. overclaiming here isn&#x27;t a 100% lie, but it is a warning sign on issues like the above that are worth understanding.')
