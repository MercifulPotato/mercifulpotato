I have two reddit accounts that I use for different subreddits, and they got totally different results.<p>One is my main that I use for most boring stuff, some niche stuff - it&#x27;s one where if someone knew me well, they&#x27;d probably figure out it&#x27;s mine - and I&#x27;m ok with that. The other is for discussion topics that I don&#x27;t want tied to me in an obvious way (ie, politics, religion). I won&#x27;t share the name of either account, but it&#x27;s interesting that the &quot;main&quot; account, got 60% ESFP, and &quot;discussion&quot; account got 40% INTJ&#x2F;INTP and 30% INFP&#x2F;INFJ.<p>I don&#x27;t feel like my writing style is incredibly different between each account, so I wonder if the specific subreddits that a user prefers contribute to the label. It&#x27;s either that, or I really do self-censor more dramatically than I had imagined.<p>Edit: I&#x27;ve always got INTP or INTJ in past MBTI tests - though it&#x27;s been near a decade since I took one last.')
