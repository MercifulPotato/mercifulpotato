The most interesting thing was that keyboard at IBM (at the time I was there) were a &quot;green&quot; tag part, meaning that you could just replace at customer no questions asked, not a ton of tracking. The number of these that got swapped just because they were dirty was scary. We did not have to account for them. I wish I had kept a bunch at this point.<p>My Model M is used on the gaming PC (Civ, XCOM and the like, not FPS).<p>For everyday use on the laptop I have a Japanese layout Filco Majestouch Convertible 2 TKL w&#x2F;Cherry Red switches (45 cN force). I also have the same with Cherry Brown switches (55 cN). Not sure which I like the best at this point. The Model M is 70 cN.<p>I have a Model F somewhere around here in box. I think I need to find it and clean it up.')
