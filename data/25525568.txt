Tilde. Heck, it&#x27;s even the name used for the ~ symbol in Unicode, which famously names all characters with upper-cased English words. Just because it&#x27;s not used in English orthography doesn&#x27;t mean that there isn&#x27;t a name for it, even if it&#x27;s merely a borrowing.<p>&gt; If you were studying Greek, you&#x27;d call it a &quot;circumflex&quot;.<p>I suppose I would. Somewhat off-topic, though.<p>&gt; Spelling it as &quot;tilda&quot; just reflects the fact that a reduced vowel in English may be spelled in any number of different ways (and &quot;e&quot; is particularly unlikely)<p>Or, as GP explained, they just misspelt it.<p>Responding to a later comment:<p>&gt; you could easily go your whole life without ever using the word<p>That doesn&#x27;t invalidate the word&#x27;s existence in the language.')
