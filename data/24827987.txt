Was looking for a place to rent near tech companies here in brazil, one house was obviously heavily modified to withstand floods, all doors were made of aluminum, there was in multiple places tubes to get rid of water, raised platforms for expensive objects and so on. Asked realtor about it, he said the area used to flood often, but all that stuff was a relic of the past, because there was no flood last year so he was sure it wouldn&#x27;t flood again.<p>2. I rented another house, place didn&#x27;t look like a floodable place, it flooded anyway because there was river channeled under the house, when there was rain in another town upstream the river managed to gush out of the drains and become above ground along its original course, cars on the street even floated away. My stuff got destroyed so I asked the realtor why he didn&#x27;t warn me, he replied that last flood was 20 years ago so he didn&#x27;t think it was relevant because he believed it wouldn&#x27;t ever flood again...<p>EDIT: just to make clear, these was two different realtors, also although both places was in same city, they were in wildly different areas.')
