Non of his research is worth the paper it&#x27;s written on. He has no solid acediemia and he oversells his weak ties to MIT via marketing which is build on lies. Do the research, there&#x27;s plenty of content online about this guy, and the rest of the Rogan network shilling people out of their cash.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amp.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;thefighterandthekid&#x2F;comments&#x2F;jinaos&#x2F;quick_rundown_on_lex_friedland&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;amp.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;thefighterandthekid&#x2F;comments&#x2F;jinaos...</a><p>Lex kisses rogans ass hard because he knows its going to get him more followers he can exploit.<p>On a personal level, I find lex to be dull and offer little to no insight in the tech realm. Just another dude who got on board the AI hype train and is trying to ride it into dollar bill land at the expense of people who lack critical thinking abilities when it comes to this kind of stuff. An endorsement is not always a true seal of quality.<p>Edit - let&#x27;s not forget the censorship an blocking people on twitter. Lex is a shill.')
