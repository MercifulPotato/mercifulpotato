For $11 more, I can get 50&#x2F;25.  I&#x27;m not eligible for the 100&#x2F;X service which would be about $25 more.   I don&#x27;t have to pay for a rooter.  Above in a rural area by a local monopoly.<p>Given the apparent high initial cost, this does not look like a viable option to replace my current service.  I think cost would need to get down to 75 ish a month and maybe 200 startup.<p>Does anyone know how this has help up in bad weather (rain? snow?)')
