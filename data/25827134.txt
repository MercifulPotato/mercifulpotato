It would be fairer to say they constantly spam you with scare mail.<p>&gt; In the event this fails, they may arrange a visit from enforcement officers.<p>That&#x27;s what they want you to think. In practice it never really happens. Too expensive. Hence the spam.<p>&gt; These officers arenâ€™t empowered to forcibly enter homes, so in the event a homeowner declines to cooperate with an investigation, TV Licencing will apply for a search warrant.<p>I would be quite surprised if this has actually ever happened.<p>It&#x27;s pretty obvious they don&#x27;t do any fancy detection these days (if they ever really did). It&#x27;s just way too expensive.')
