But my point is that Bitcoin is highly speculative and risky compared to pretty much any other kind of investment. Even gold has industrial uses and isn’t simply a token of value like Bitcoin.<p>I will concede though that there is a huge market of derivatives which often seem pretty unusual and risky to an amateur investor such as myself, so maybe Bitcoin isn’t that different from some of those investments. I don’t know a lot about that market, other than that it played a large role in the Great Recession, which is a dubious distinction.')
