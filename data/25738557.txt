But your story has nothing to do with the DC Mayor.<p>EDIT: For yall who are downvoting me. The Mayor controls the DC Metropolitan Police Department. A COMPLETELY different set of officers than the Capitol Police. Furthermore, the DC Mayor has no access to a National Guard militia for backup, and relies upon the President for that. That&#x27;s just the facts in this matter.')
