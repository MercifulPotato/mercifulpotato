I think the people who are most benefiting from Dropbox (creatives, etc) are heavily impacted by COVID recession.<p>There is no business case for running Dropbox in a large enterprise (I tried... our creatives cried about it), and it&#x27;s an increasingly difficult case to make for a home user, as all of the alternatives are pretty good.<p>The other thing is that Dropbox is an easy app to fall out of love with as an individual.<p>They <i>constantly</i> upsell, even after you bought the product. I was paying &gt;$100 year for Dropbox for years and they pushed Dropbox Teams at me relentlessly for most if it. Problem: I don&#x27;t have a team! They also didn&#x27;t pool storage (I think they do now), so sharing stuff with my wife like video would consume 2x the storage, unless I paid 5x for the business product. Google Drive or Office 365 are a way better value in any dimension.<p>Basically they have a solid core product, but instead of doing something productive with it, the surrounded it with layers of bullshit. While meandering around, they eliminated the portion of the product focused on the #1 generator of storage needs (ie. photo&#x2F;video), segmented basic features like PDF search, etc. All at a 20-70% premium over competitive offers.<p>Good riddance.')
