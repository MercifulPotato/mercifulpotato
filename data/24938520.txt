Not that Bernouilli doesn&#x27;t work, they both give the same results in the end, and they are both a simplification of the &quot;truth&quot; which is the Navier-Stokes equations.<p>The reason I like the Newton explanation better is that if you start with the Bernouilli principle, it is much easier to come up with the wrong idea. The Newton is straightforward: push air down, plane goes up. A bit shallower but at least, the basic idea is hard to get wrong.')
