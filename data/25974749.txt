Melvin Capital claiming they got out of short positions, without any significant changes in short %.  The entire financial media propaganda telling people to sell GME. etc.<p>I didn&#x27;t say WSB crowd was acting with noble reasons, but they are acting with more than financial interests.  If you&#x27;ve read recent WSB posts, lot of the emotional appeal is ideological and class fragmentation, than lolz gainz.  And, very few people actually posts in forums, so you have to multiply the sentiment by thousands, if not millions.<p>The bottom line is the price of GME, it&#x27;s still above $300. Which everyone knows and agrees is over valued.  Why, especially after the turbulent week?')
