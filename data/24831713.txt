One person is forced to defend every tiny point, the other person does not have to defend anything.<p>That is often how people use the Socratic approach today, but it is not fundamental to it. One can make it two sided, with both sides participating and asking&#x2F;answering questions.<p>&gt; It is much easier to ask questions then to answer them.<p>Indeed. I&#x27;ve at least once told the other person that it takes almost no cognitive load to ask a question, but plenty to come up with a meaningful answer, and that I was done answering his questions unless he brought something to the table.<p>Now if the questioner is indeed trying the Socratic approach, he probably is putting quite a bit of thought into his questions. But for the recipient, it is hard to tell if he is or isn&#x27;t. Furthermore, asking questions <i>is</i> a tactic used by people to confuse others, so the questioner can&#x27;t tell if you&#x27;re being sincere with your queries or not (hence why people say &quot;Don&#x27;t answer my question with another.&quot;)<p>&gt; Of course there are ways to counteract that, but people will still perceive you as hostile&#x2F;unfair rather then cooperative.<p>I mentioned a way in another comment: &quot;It sounds like you have concerns with my approach. I&#x27;d like to hear those concerns.&quot; For most sincere people, this is enough. If they keep asking questions, I switch to responding with further questions: &quot;Would that not mean that if you do X, then Y will result?&quot; to which my response would be &quot;Would it?&quot; or &quot;Can you explain how you came to that conclusion?&quot; or even &quot;I&#x27;m not sure. Can you explain why that is a concern?&quot; If they answer, then I get to respond by questioning them.')
