Given this hypothetical income growth, what would the distribution of wealth look like today?<p>As far as I know, the distribution of wealth is even more skewed in favour of the rich, with some fraction of people at the bottom having &#x27;negative wealth&#x27; i.e. more debts than assets. Wealth also seems to have a compounding effect, in that richer people have a higher savings rate and access to better investment opportunities. So would more equal income growth necessarily lead to a more equal wealth distribution, or are there other factors to account for?')
