What helped was ballance exercises, learning how to use skeletal muscles and paying attention to the whole aspect of walking: in the end it should feel effortless. I was also stepping on the foot wrong, was applying too much pressure on the front of the foot and leaning the trunk forward a few degrees more than now. The rest was trial and error and it took a while to fine tune it but as soon as I found the sweet spot - and you know it, it feels just right and you’re relaxed - the rest is making this a habit so you don’t really have to consciously think about it and it happens naturally. I also fixed a lot of static postures such as sitting on a chair, etc I sometimes fall into the old postures but now can adjust accordingly<p>What I forgot to mention was stretches which do help but if the motion isn’t fixed the tense muscles tense back as they try to compensate for the incorrect movement.<p>There are multiple paths to this and yoga could be one of them. Im just a stubborn self lerner and went through a lot of trial and error. At the beginning i studied muscular imballances and did a lot of strenghtening and stretching but that didn’t help too much as my bad habits were reverting all the progress and certain muscles would tense up and others wouldnt fire. Once i figured out the correct posture it all fell into place')
