We got sent home due to COVID a few months after that. Management talks a lot about how they know remote isn&#x27;t ideal and want to get us back in the office as soon as possible, despite most of the software teams finding they&#x27;ve been equally or more productive as before.<p>For me, this has been the first time I&#x27;ve been WFH on an equal footing with the whole team, I _love_ it, and I never want to go back to the office. I actually prefer meeting via Teams since I can&#x27;t hear well and the built in captioning makes it easier, I have better monitors at home than I do at the office, there&#x27;s never a wait for the bathroom, can pull some lunch out of the fridge or pantry and heat it up at my convenience.<p>I know some people lament the whole &quot;not having hallway conversations leading to innovation&quot; thing but I&#x27;m honestly curious how real that is. I&#x27;ve been in the industry for over 20 years now, the bulk of that in software-focused companies or teams, and while I do have casual conversations with coworkers I can&#x27;t recall any of them ever segueing into &quot;so here&#x27;s the challenging thing I&#x27;m working on right now...&quot; -- I&#x27;m not saying it never happens, just that I can&#x27;t recall it&#x27;s ever happened to me.<p>Some of my coworkers do miss whiteboarding, though I don&#x27;t have strong feelings about that one way or the other. I&#x27;m more of a textual than a visual thinker personally so I&#x27;ve never found diagramming things out to be particularly helpful.<p>At any rate, while I really like my boss and my team, the day management sends out the &quot;mandatory full-time return to the office in (x) months, including the development teams&quot; email is almost certainly going to be the day I update my resume.')
