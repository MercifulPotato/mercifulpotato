By contrast, after reading unpoly&#x27;s home page, I have no real idea what it does or how it&#x27;s relevant to me. I wouldn&#x27;t call this just marketing though -- presentation reflects a distinction of thinking.<p>Regardless, it is fantastic that there are two alternatives in this space! This is the lovely thing about ideas and open source works. Validates the concept and provides communities that can learn from each other. Thank you for the pointer.')
