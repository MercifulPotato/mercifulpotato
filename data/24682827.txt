Hooked’s CEO pitched the idea to Apple, providing background information about the engineers and sending their resumes. Apple responded that it might consider paying a “finder’s fee”...<p>Even if was inclined to take Hooked&#x27;s side on this, it was a huge mistake to send information about those engineers without an existing agreement.<p>(Also: I wonder if the CEO intended to split that &quot;finder&#x27;s fee&quot; with the employees she was trying to &quot;sell&quot;.)')
