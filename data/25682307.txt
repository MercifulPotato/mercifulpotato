From a justice perspective, we&#x27;re in murky moral waters. An analogy would be to punish everyone in a shared household if we know that one member of that household committed a crime but we can&#x27;t determine which one specifically (and let&#x27;s assume that the innocent members of the household don&#x27;t know and aren&#x27;t hiding information). This would be a state of affairs that everyone would rightly protest. So we need to think carefully as to whether we want to enact your proposal.')
