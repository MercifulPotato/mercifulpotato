Item(by='audunw', descendants=None, kids=[25926695, 25927210], score=None, time=1611744547, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25926368, text='&gt; I guess the argument would go that we would be better off building small quantities of long-lasting re-usable furniture, rather than building and throwing away lots of new cheaper furniture<p>No way. Not as long as population growth is a thing. A lot of people shopping at IKEA are buying furniture for the first time.  Imagine if we switched to all hardwood furniture. People would still need to buy as much furniture for the next 20-40 years or so at least, but now those furniture will have a huge environmental impact. Maybe you reduce the long-term impact, but probably not for 50 years at least.<p>Making things out of cheap and low-impact particle boards, cardboard cores, etc, is probably the most <i>realistic</i> way of reducing the environmental impact. It maximises the use of the wood, you can make it out of fast growing wood, and you minimise use of materials. If you reuse more of the wood fibers through recycling, it&#x27;d be even better.<p>I feel like this whole &quot;we should use long-lasting re-usable furniture&quot; thing is more about upper middle class people wanting to feel good about buying expensive furniture or spending the time to find and refurbish old furniture. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with it, but it doesn&#x27;t scale.')
