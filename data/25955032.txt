If that was the case you could explain anything with &quot;a wizard did it.&quot; Occam&#x27;s razor says that if you have 2 possible explanations, but one adds unnecessary clauses, the one with only the necessary clauses is more likely right.<p>For example, two explanations:\n1. There was an avalanche and birds ate the soft tissue\n2. There was an avalanche, birds ate the soft tissue, and Mars was in retrograde<p>Occam&#x27;s razor  tells you the first explanation is more likely to be correct. It does not tell you 4 or 5 natural events occurring can&#x27;t be the best explanation if there isn&#x27;t a more parsimonious alternative explanation.')
