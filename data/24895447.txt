I live in Michigan. I would <i></i>love<i></i> to work with Microsoft or Google, because they do some very interesting work. However relocating across the country, away from established friends and family, isn&#x27;t something I can currently consider.<p>Average developer salaries for my area are between 60-100k, so if Microsoft can offer 120k+, a lot of (great) devs in my area would probably take that. Local devs get better wages, and companies save some money.<p>However, they could also outsource to India for even cheaper results, but who knows how well that will go.')
