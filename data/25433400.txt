Your product is integrating multiple tools and data sources to provide value beyond &quot;just grafana&quot;.<p>2. You&#x27;re are not Amazon, and I think that is actually a big point here. It&#x27;s unlikely that someone will choose your product over Grafana if they are <i>just looking for a hosted Grafana</i>. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s really the case with an AWS alternative.')
