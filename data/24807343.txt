This isn&#x27;t what &quot;lesswrong rationalism&quot; is about, that is about frantically trying to eliminate as many contradictions as possible even if it means being less effective at actually optimizing the values, whether it is by eliminating flexibility, increasing the likelihood of error, or abstracting away the contradictions to such a level that they can&#x27;t be consciously dealt with anymore.<p>As you&#x27;ve missed in my first post, the issue is that personal philosophies are fundamentally different from physics, in that in physics there <i>is</i> a correct model, that can be reached by eliminating contradictions and constantly iterating. As far as models to maximize personal success, however that is, there is no such thing as a correct model, there will always be contradictions, and hyperfocusing on the most rational possible model to optimize for an irrational goal will almost always yield worse results.<p>Rationalism doesn&#x27;t just mean &quot;we can derive some benefit by carefully trying to use rationality to arrive to better models and decision&quot;, the same way that scientism doesn&#x27;t just mean &quot;we can derive some benefit by using science&quot;, rationalism is the idea that *all beliefs and decisions should be based purely on rationality&quot;. Unless your goal is purely quantifiable and free of contradictions, this is actively harmful.<p>I never once suggested that rationality isn&#x27;t useful or that resolving some contradictions is useless, I actively stated the reverse, that they are both useful insofar that they actually make the situation better for you, which is absolutely not what rationalism is about.<p>Rationalism presupposes the supremacy of rationality, which itself cannot be rationally proved.')
