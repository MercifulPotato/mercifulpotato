They did a great job collecting the low hanging fruit in terms of engaging all types of users in working with APIs. They&#x27;ve been a bit slow since then to build out their full API design and verification functionality, but they are making steady progress, and it seems like UI in 8.0 cleans up a lot of the rough edges they&#x27;ve accumulated over the years.<p>They also make it simple, if not necessarily easy, to use your collections in other places, either through Newman, API access, or direct export. I know Blazemeter, for example, allows you to build load tests from Postman collections, and it&#x27;s relatively trivial to have Newman running as part of your CI.<p>So having worked in this space for the past two decades, and quite recently felt a lot of those same pain points, I&#x27;m skeptical of any solution that doesn&#x27;t either challenge Postman head-on, or build around it.<p>Without significant financial backing, it will be very difficult to get traction otherwise. That said, I&#x27;ll certainly take a look at your project, should you share it.')
