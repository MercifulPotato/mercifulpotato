We had wagons to drag the stuff around everywhere. Everything was very accessible, you can even get between the buildings without stepping outside thanks to tunnels above or below ground. Elevators or long slopes where there is need. The local university is a relatively new one, about 55 years old so I guess it was planned from the beginning.')
