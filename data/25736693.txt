She is listed as COO on her social media profile for the company.<p>She is also in a bunch of groups about gardening in our local area.<p>During the height of BLM protests and CHOP&#x2F;CHAZ, someone made a post that was very off-topic for the group, basically saying we should all support what was happening in the CHOP and all the violence against cops was justified due to racial injustice.<p>My wife took no position on the issue but politely replied saying the post felt off-topic and she didn&#x27;t want to hear about politics in her favorite gardening group.<p>Several people attacked her on the post, calling her white privileged, racist, etc... all for suggesting the post was off-topic (even though the group&#x27;s own rules prohibited political content).<p>One person took it a step further and went on her profile to see where she worked. They then messaged our company&#x27;s social media profile to tell our company that my wife was a racist, and she should be fired or reprimanded because she had made racist comments in a FB group (she had not, and the person provided no screenshots&#x2F;proof either).<p>Unfortunately for that person, they did not realize they were talking to my wife&#x27;s husband (me) who promptly banned them from our page and blocked their profile from my&#x2F;my wife&#x27;s profiles so they could no longer bother us.<p>However, this type of new &quot;online activism&quot; is rampant nowadays. Small companies often have little choice but to comply or be publicly shamed&#x2F;bullied, including doxxing or going after individual employees, as in our story.<p>I disapprove of this type of behavior. This is mob justice in a different form. It is the court of public opinion rather than an actual court of law where someone would get a chance to defend themselves. It is wrong and our society needs to grow up past this childish phase it&#x27;s going through where every angry person riled up by this or that party&#x27;s rhetoric feels like they have the right to attempt to destroy another person&#x27;s livelihood for the sake of pushing &quot;their truth&quot; or &quot;justice&quot;. That&#x27;s not what Justice is.')
