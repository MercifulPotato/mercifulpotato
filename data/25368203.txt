Item(by='toomuchtodo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607562803, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25368040, text='&quot;Birthright funds&quot;, as described by Ackman, are Social Security with more aggressive investments (equity index funds) versus conservative special issue US treasuries [1].<p>We could just as easily increase taxes progressively (the wealthy derive more income from, wait for it, investments and capital wealth [2]) and increase Social Security payments instead, without the rube goldberg index fund investment component (which would end up enriching someone like Blackrock or someone similar to manage these broker-dealer accounts).<p>At the end of the day, it&#x27;s about capturing and distributing the wealth generated by the economy to the citizenry (and where does that wealth come from collectively? labor and productivity [automation and machinery]). We&#x27;re just arguing over the how. Social Security is very efficient, by the way [3]. It costs only 0.6% of annual benefits distributed to administer the entitlement program. Between them and the IRS (tax collection), is that more efficient than running index fund accounts for every American? I argue yes.<p>Not following such a course results in disaster [4].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbpp.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;social-security&#x2F;policy-basics-understanding-the-social-security-trust-funds" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbpp.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;social-security&#x2F;policy-basics-...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;blog&#x2F;up-front&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;25&#x2F;six-facts-about-wealth-in-the-united-states&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;blog&#x2F;up-front&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;25&#x2F;six-facts...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbpp.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;social-security&#x2F;policy-basics-top-ten-facts-about-social-security" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbpp.org&#x2F;research&#x2F;social-security&#x2F;policy-basics-...</a> (Control-F Fact #3)<p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;04&#x2F;baby-boomers-retirement&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;04&#x2F;baby-boom...</a> (Millions of baby boomers are getting caught in the countryâ€™s broken retirement system)')
