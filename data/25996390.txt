Like, you can&#x27;t rely on an established &#x27;Stadia playerbase&#x27; right now, so there&#x27;s no natural incentive for studios to integrate with it. Other platform owners solve this by paying for exclusivity or something, but as mentioned above, reports say that Google wants to pay insultingly small sums of money for that work. Unless that changes...no one is gonna use it.')
