People in WSB probably bought low and haven&#x27;t sold at all or sold on the way up. Look at the volume. Who is shorting at these prices with this kind of activity?<p>Who has the money to keep buying at $350 to propel the stock to $400? Definitely not WSB. I know plenty of people dipping their toes in and buying 10 or 20 shares for fun right now. But there&#x27;s 55M shares trading at all time highs. That&#x27;s not retail. That&#x27;s day trading shops and deep pockets.')
