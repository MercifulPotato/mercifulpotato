Enforcing historical birthrights is a form of explicitly racist discrimination against non-European migrants (being especially harmful to Africans) who disproportionately benefit their new nations and who are desperately needed if Europe is to thrive.<p>No, that&#x27;s just your SJW opinion. The countries involved can&#x27;t wait to vote as far right (nationalistic) as possible.<p>I wonder why that is? Maybe they should send their trillion euro welfare bill for 1+ million illegal economic migrants to you. Britain found out that, &quot;The trouble with Socialism is that eventually you run out of other people&#x27;s money.&quot; I guess you&#x27;re a slow learner.')
