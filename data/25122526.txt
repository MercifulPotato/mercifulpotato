That&#x27;s how easy it is.</i><p>A copy&amp;paste of my previous comment:<p>Everybody&#x27;s brain is different but I actually understand all of git&#x27;s internals (the &quot;plumbing&quot;) but it <i>doesn&#x27;t help me</i> with the git CLI (the &quot;porcelain&quot;).<p>Yes, I know that Git is a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), and that HEAD is a pointer, and the file format of BLOBs and SHAs, etc. If I were to implement a DVCS, I would inevitably end up reinventing many of the same technical architecture decisions that Linus came up with. <i>But none of that insider knowledge really helps me remember git syntax</i> if I haven&#x27;t been using it in more than a month. Even though I grok git&#x27;s mental model, I still can&#x27;t answer the top-voted &quot;git&quot; questions on Stackoverflow without a cheat sheet: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;tagged&#x2F;git?tab=Votes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;tagged&#x2F;git?tab=Votes</a><p>The git UI and unintuitive syntax is just too hard for me to remember unless I use it every day.<p>Also to add.. the concept of &quot;git index&quot; as a staging area adds some complexity as well.  Yes, there are good reasons for it (1) it lets one craft a <i>specific subset</i> instead of <i>all changed</i> files to commit and (2) it&#x27;s a performance boost because a Big-O type O(n) loop runs faster when iterating through the <i>staging index</i> (small &quot;n&quot; of dozens) to detect changes instead of looping through the entire source code tree (large &quot;n&quot; of 10,000+ files in a big repo).  But that flexibility adds an extra cognitive burden when a newbie just wants to save a &quot;backup snapshot of the repo&quot;.  For a newbie, the extra indirection layer of &quot;staging index&quot; seems superfluous and confusing.  That&#x27;s why some present an alternative porcelain to git that doesn&#x27;t expose the staging concept:  e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitless.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitless.com&#x2F;</a><p>(To clarify, I&#x27;m not recommending Gitless but just giving an example of why some felt motivated to simplify Git&#x27;s porcelain.)')
