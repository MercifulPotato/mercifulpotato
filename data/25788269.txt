This makes it not credible, I don&#x27;t think you should trust a source like this. If you choose to, it says more that you want some easy to pretend to justify your disbelief of it. Confirmation bias.<p><i>&quot;The Stargate Project was terminated and declassified in 1995 after a CIA report concluded that it was never useful in any intelligence operation. Information provided by the program was vague and included irrelevant and erroneous data, and there was reason to suspect that its project managers had changed the reports so they would fit background cues.&quot;</i> This is not the final nor the only word on it. After many reports lauding how effective it was, it was terminated? Seems more likely it continues in a special access program, and the release was either to shake up the personnel structure that controlled it, or the reason I stated in my previous comment.<p><i>I&#x27;m not really qualified to read through CIA papers.</i> Then you&#x27;re not qualified to be credible nor have an opinion, if you choose to not look at the evidence for and against evenly. This seems like a lazy pretense to avoid looking at information that challenges your preexisting biases. In other words, you&#x27;re choosing to make yourself a victim to confirmation bias. That makes what you say not very credible.<p><i>People who are seem to not agree with you.</i> I disagree, and since you&#x27;re not qualified to &quot;read&quot; these papers (which are created by the CIA, they are from various service branches), you&#x27;re not qualified to say who is or who isn&#x27;t qualified, right? So...who disagrees? Plenty of people agree with me, plenty of military people with first hand experience of these results agree. So if you&#x27;re standard for belief is people and &quot;qualified&quot; people agree with me, then you have it. This seems pretty like a pretty bogus and lazy dismissal, &quot;invoking authority&quot; to hide your desire to stay within your preexisting bias. Confirmation bias.<p><i>If remote viewing works, wouldn&#x27;t all major companies have departments full of viewers spying on competitors?</i> If intelligence collection works, wouldn&#x27;t all major companies have departments full of corporate spies spying on competitors? Is this how it works? I think they contract it out, I guess the same for RV, but probably less because &quot;people are reluctant to believe it&quot; even when shown it works, as you seem to be demonstrating.<p><i>I&#x27;ll note that the James Randi prize has not been won.</i> Which may not prove anything? Why close the prize? Perhaps he didn&#x27;t want to pay it. Or it could have been a charity to people like yourself who want a very comforting (but not very informative) dismissal, instead of looking at the data. I had a prize open for 10 Million dollars for the first alien life known to humankind to prove that it really exists, but no aliens came to claim it, therefore humans are alone in the universe. Correct? Of course not.<p>So what happened here?<p>You asked me do I believe RV is real. I said unequivocally yes and gave you multiple resources to not only read straight away but to find out more, including going to a subreddit and seeing regular people trying it for themselves and getting results, which I encouraged you to also do. And instead of responding to, being open to, or curious, or even doing something, about that very generous offer of information and time I made you, you decided to ignore all of that supporting evidence (under the weak and pathetic excuse of saying you&#x27;re not qualified to read it ~~ then of course you&#x27;re not qualified to read Wikipedia and decide against it, either right?), and remain where it seems you are comfortable -- which appears to be a preexisting bias against believing this. So what have you demonstrated with your choices here? Confirmation bias in action.<p>It&#x27;s very common, and a very predictable reaction. It makes sense as a defensive reaction to protect you from investing time, or belief in something which you fear may not be true, and may expose you to social ridicule. But at what point does that useful skepticism reach the point of diminishing returns where you need to stick your head in the sand and live in a made up fantasy world delusion where you have to manufacture excuses just so you can ignore evidence and shut your eyes against the truth? When do you choose comfort over knowing more? Confirmation bias.<p>Your fear to open up to this data, and your preference to remain in your confirmation bias, does not have any relation to the reality of RV, and obviously your choice to react like that doesn&#x27;t mean RV is not true. You were given evidence that supports a claim you seem to not want to believe, and you ignored it. This is confirmation bias. This means your opinions about this are not credible, and one reason they are not credible is because you have not yet invested the time in investigating them honestly.<p>I guess you like playing innocent and trying to pick on true believers to try to get a rise out of them, because that makes you feel people are paying attention to you? So predictable, and easy right? No skin in the game tho? The reason I didn&#x27;t address your points yesterday is because it seemed to be you were just doing precisely this, so I deliberately didn&#x27;t give you the reaction you wanted. And I felt satisfied when it seemed you were incensed with my refusal to play your little game, and I instead dismissed your replies with even handed positivity. Moreover, it seemed you were questioning without making the effort to learn and be open to the data I shared and without really caring about the topic, so I wasn&#x27;t going to reward your dishonesty and contempt for a serious topic with more informative responses when you&#x27;d already shown your contempt for this. The reason I&#x27;m putting it here now is for other readers who drop by in future, and your future self, if you become better (or your current self, if you want to learn how to improve) :) ;p xx<p>It&#x27;s not my problem (and it says nothing of the quality of the data or the reality of this) if you want to remain in your confirmation bias when you have evidence in front of your eyes, and refuse to see it. Neither does your keeping your eyes closed prove there&#x27;s no light in the world. You can pretend that&#x27;s &quot;someone else&#x27;s fault&quot; for not &quot;proving&quot; it to you, when in fact that&#x27;s your responsibility for refusing to see the data, and choosing to keep your eyes closed. If you&#x27;re going to do that, I think you should at least own it, rather than weakly trying to blame it on someone else by pretending there&#x27;s no evidence, when it&#x27;s just your responsibility. And if you do want to treat your mind this way (with confirmation bias) then be careful that you don&#x27;t attack other people or be mean to them just because you&#x27;re choosing to stay in your preexisting comfortable bias, because that unjustified meanness would be extremely bad for your karma. Just know that it&#x27;s your responsibility if you think that way, and own it and don&#x27;t try to incorrectly blame anyone else. Your choice to belief. To investigate. It&#x27;s your mind, I&#x27;m not telling you what to do with it, because it&#x27;s your life. I&#x27;m pointing out the context, the larger context, so hopefully you can make choices that work for you better in future. All the best of luck with that and have a great and a wonderful 2021! :) ;p xx')
