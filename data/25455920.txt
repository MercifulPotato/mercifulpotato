There are also restrictions on true &quot;BnB&quot; or &quot;Inns&quot; in that they were regulated like hotels are. You are definitely on to something in that the concept of a &quot;short term rental&quot; market has been sort of born out of AirBnB&#x27;s existence but that segment is just a cross section of a larger market that has always existed, its just mostly been serviced by larger real estate developers, boutique hoteliers, hospitality management professionals, etc.')
