ElasticSearch I don&#x27;t have experience with, but CentOS is an example of a project I don&#x27;t like in a bunch of ways - and I believe (on faith and anecdotal evidence mind you) that developers didn&#x27;t like it nor choose to use it unless, for some reason, they needed the RHEL compatibility, which means that they need some tie-in to a corporate-commerical-only flavor of Linux.<p>So, I would argue, CentOS doesn&#x27;t have an organic raison d&#x27;etre. If had one, it would be very difficult to &quot;kill&quot; it.')
