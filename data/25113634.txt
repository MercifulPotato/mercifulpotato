( I think you could make a binary scale but I can&#x27;t think what the ratio would be log2(1)? )<p>Anyway, you&#x27;d start with the pantograph&#x27;s base and outer point at the ends of your ruler, mark off the inner point, and then repeat on each sub interval, and then again recursively until you ran out of room.<p>Like I said, I could be wrong about this.')
