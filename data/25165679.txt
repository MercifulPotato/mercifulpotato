Facebook has no moral obligations for what communities discuss or even then go on to do. They probably do have a legal responsibility to do what the police order them to do.<p>It isn&#x27;t like supermarkets have a role in only feeding the righteous, or educators to only educate the children of good people or bridge builders to only build bridges that moral people can cross. Corporations are a tool of doing things, not deciding political direction.<p>If Facebook has a moral imperative to intervene in Myanmar, then they have a moral imperative to try and topple a number of governments that are corrupt or leading their people in bad directions. And they have all the usual human failings in that they won&#x27;t correctly identify which ones. It will end either badly or with Facebook engaging in deep hypocrisy and becoming a corrupt but politically active entity.')
