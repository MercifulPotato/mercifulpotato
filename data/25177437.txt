You will always have to keep some COBOL experts on staff (the conversion is never finished), plus the new LDJ experts.<p>In ten or twenty years, LDJ will be obsolete, now you have to convert to LDJ2. Now you have COBOL programmers on staff, plus LDJ programmers, plus LDJ2 programmers. No one wants to be on the obsolete teams, your salary budget bloats, and you have more Babel.<p>If there&#x27;s always going to be something better, and you&#x27;re always going to be fragmented, why not stay with just the one single obsolete technology?')
