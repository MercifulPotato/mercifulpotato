Item(by='henry_bone', descendants=None, kids=[25950201, 25954280], score=None, time=1611871484, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25948280, text='&gt; I think what many don&#x27;t realise is that it is precisely the &quot;unfree&quot; parts of HN that make it attractive. And by that I don&#x27;t mean centralized technical or organizational structure, but rather stuff like a culture of downvoting destructive, inflamatory or snarky comments, a good and mostly invisible moderation, a strong focus on certain topics etc.<p>I&#x27;m over it.  I see many comments that politely present the opposing view get downvoted to oblivion.  It isn&#x27;t just the &quot;inflamatory or snarky&quot; comment.  Dissenting opinion is censored on this platform.<p>I made the mistake of reacting to it the other day and was punished for commenting on moderation.  Fair enough, I guess, but the reason for the comment was exasperation at the downvoting of opinion.<p>And it bites that downvoted comments just fade away, so later readers can no longer consider it, or respond to it.  Remember that I am talking about unpopular opinion, which may sometimes be objectively wrong, but not rudely presented.  It&#x27;s common for such additions to the thread to be obliviated through moderation.  (I know about showdead, but only learned about it recently).<p>That&#x27;s the thing about free speech: we often don&#x27;t like what other people say.  The price we must pay for that freedom is to be exposed to speech we do not like.  It&#x27;s a cost, that we must pay because we are imperfect.  We make mistakes, we think incorrectly from time to time.  So I say, let it all ride.  On HN at least, the culture of thoughtfulness and intellectualism serves to curb the worst rudeness, but let us be willing to expose ourselves to views that we don&#x27;t agree with.  Let&#x27;s be prepared to have the argument, and possibly be persuaded.<p>So the next time someone says &quot;You know, I think Trump was an alright president, for &lt;reasons&gt; .. &quot;, curb your outrage.  Let it ride, and engage with the argument.')
