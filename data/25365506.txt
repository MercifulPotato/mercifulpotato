In 1876 we had a similar situation where there were charges by Republican&#x27;s against Democrats of electoral irregularities. This was resolved by a 15 member committee from the house, senate and supreme court who effectively appointed the Republican candidate the winner after an 8-7 vote. If this was to happen again and Trump was appointed President would YouTube remove any content that questioned whether this was a legal practice or whether the result of the election was fair. If I was a Democrat and this happened I would certainly be concerned that I was wronged and I think it would be entirely inappropriate for content questioning whether this was the correct decision to be removed.')
