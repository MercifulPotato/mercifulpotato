Here are a few tips if you&#x27;re thinking of doing the same:<p>(1) You HAVE to kill the original community.  Otherwise momentum will keep your users using the old community.  Our first launch saw a successful small website take off initially after it was launched only to have traffic slowly die down over the next several months.  What finally got it off the ground and growing again was killing the original reddit community.  There&#x27;s no way around this.<p>(2) There WILL be resistance and&#x2F;or a drop-off in users.  The good news is now there are a lot more opportunities to grow your community: Advertising, cross-site collaborations, guest blog posts, etc.<p>(3) Do not strive for feature parity with reddit.  Instead, strive to deliver MORE value.  For instance changemyview could add categorization features.  Maybe a search function that lets you search for posts that have been tagged as &quot;view changed successfully!&quot; or &quot;view not changed&quot;.<p>(4) You have to have a business model.  Selling advertising or taking donations are NOT business models.  There was a time when it made sense but many online communities - reddit particularly - are averse to viewing ads.  If you&#x27;re not creating something, selling something, or taking a commission then you haven&#x27;t got a business model.  One model which can be successful for larger communities: Premium membership subscriptions.  You just have to make sure the premium features provide sufficient value that people want to subscribe without making non-subscribers feel like you&#x27;re just limiting features to be greedy.<p>(5) If you have multiple moderators - incorporate.')
