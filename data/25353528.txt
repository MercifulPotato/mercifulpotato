(assuming OEM didn&#x27;t lock down bootloader unlock, which is pretty rare those days) I have my own ROM on small device (kTouch i9), long device (Qin 2 Pro), keyboard device (Unihertz Titan), device with a FLIR and endoscope (Ulefone Armor 9), assistant&#x2F;speaker (Archos Hello 7), comfortable in hand device (Pixel 5), premium device (ROG Phone 3). Those devices (except those last two) wouldn&#x27;t ever have seen custom ROM. But here we are, thanks to Project Treble, the same ROM works on all of them without breaking a sweat. Nowadays when I buy a device to hack with, the only question I have to ask is &quot;can the bootloader be unlocked?&quot; (small photo to make my case <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;phhusson&#x2F;status&#x2F;1308299188153643008&#x2F;photo&#x2F;1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;phhusson&#x2F;status&#x2F;1308299188153643008&#x2F;phot...</a> )<p>As a user, however, it is severely locked down. Installing apps from 3rd party app store was okay-ish years ago. Nowadays, Android just frightens you as much as possible so that you don&#x27;t install 3rd party apps. The battery thing that has already been mentioned is an issue as well. Nowadays you can&#x27;t even use an alternate Camera app, you have to stick to whatever OEM gave you.')
