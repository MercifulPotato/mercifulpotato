Item(by='extra88', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605482361, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25104065, text='&gt; how is it that you are able to read this story and frame it in your mind within the larger context of vaccines, but others aren&#x27;t?<p>A) I <i>didn&#x27;t</i> know the information from the link in the first comment you replied to, about older and newer polio vaccines.<p>B) I&#x27;m able to because I&#x27;m already better informed about vaccines and vaccine safety than most people. I am by no means an expert. And, not to dance around it, I&#x27;m also smarter and better educated than most people; I&#x27;m above average in those areas and I assume you are too.<p>&gt; editorialize and push a point of view<p>Editorializing is offering an opinion. Including salient facts about different polio vaccines or vaccine safety is not editorializing.<p>Everyone has a point of view, that&#x27;s not contrary to doing good journalism.<p>&gt; You clearly understood that this polio outbreak does not mean all types of vaccines are dangerous.<p>And yet there are instances of this story being used as &quot;proof&quot; that vaccines are dangerous. It&#x27;s confirmation bias on their part and it would be more difficult to make that mistake if this story had more facts about vaccines for context.<p>Growing distrust in all vaccines and science in general is a huge problem so while <i>I</i> wouldn&#x27;t choose to include information in this story about how this isn&#x27;t bad news for possible COVID-19 vaccines, I would understand the choice.<p>I <i>do</i> think stories that try to stick to just the narrowest facts do a disservice to their audience. For instance, good-faith context for extreme weather stories should routinely include information about how human-caused climate change is a reason for increased frequency and severity.')
