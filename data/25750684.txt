Yoav[1] was talking about the contract between AWS and Parler as corporate entities. I&#x27;m not sure how you made the leap from organizational relationships to individuals using services implemented on AWS.<p>That&#x27;s why I asked about members of Parler still being able to &quot;use&quot; AWS through other AWS-hosted services. I don&#x27;t get what you&#x27;re driving at.<p>&gt; AWS isn&#x27;t responsible for them.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not sure I understand what point this is responding to. No one is claiming AWS is responsible for the capital hill folks. They are claiming that Parler bears some responsibility and did so in such a way that violated AWS&#x27; policies. So AWS banned them.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25748097" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25748097</a>')
