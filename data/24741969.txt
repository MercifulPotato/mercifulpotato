What?  Vanilla Ice is performing in 2019?  He gets no media exposure and scores no points with the critics by going out and performing his cheesy early hits for a few thousand fans, so at the time I assumed he needed the money.  We dropped my brother-and-law off and next thing you know, there&#x27;s a video on Facebook where he&#x27;s up on stage and Vanilla Ice is sharing the mic with him.  And now I read he&#x27;s been doing fine for money all along.  Much respect to the man for valuing the pleasure he brings to other people, independent of the money.')
