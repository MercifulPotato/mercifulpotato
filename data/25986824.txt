First, you have lots of people living in one country and commuting to work over the border. Second, the economy is so integrated that closing the borders or even introducing border checks leads to major economic disruptions. Third, in democratic countries you&#x27;ll have those pesky people asking you if all these limitations are really necessary and not an undue restriction of their constitutional rights, so it will probably end up before the supreme court...<p>The basic problem i see with &quot;Get to Zero&quot; is that it&#x27;s an extreme position, and politicians always tend to find a compromise in everything they do. So unless you can get <i>everyone</i> to agree to this goal, it&#x27;s simply not realistic in a democracy, regardless of the scientific merit.')
