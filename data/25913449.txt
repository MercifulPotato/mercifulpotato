Item(by='neura', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611646570, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25912256, text='32% of a sample size of 2601.<p>Your is probably an unpopular one, but I&#x27;d guess because of questions like &quot;Who are these people that cared about privacy, were willing to switch and did actually switch, but don&#x27;t realize that their phones might even be trying to upload their lives?&quot;  Unless you meant that the results of that survey showing 32% of people cared enough that they actually did something about it, in which case, that&#x27;s not really an opinion.  Just a fact that a very small survey (out of the people who use services&#x2F;companies that can be switched from, if they cared enough to do so) includes a segment that seems to represent &quot;people [that] care enough about privacy to switch to a service that preserves it.&quot;<p>What this survey does not try to establish is what percent of people &quot;cared&quot; and are &quot;willing&quot;, but found it not worthwhile to switch, for reasons such as &quot;this is how I communicate with my friends and I cannot convince them to switch&quot; or decided it just wasn&#x27;t worth it due to other costs.<p>For me, WhatsApp comes to mind, but I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s a somewhat common problem.  I personally do NOT want to use WhatsApp, but I have a group of friends that will not switch and especially with Covid, I do not want to lose those connections. Replace &quot;group of friends&quot; with &lt;community&gt; and WhatsApp with &lt;whatever app&gt;.<p>Not sure what you even meant by &quot;This is not the source of mistrust&quot;.  m463 pointed out a couple of things, neither of which was a _source_ of mistrust.')
