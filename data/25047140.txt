You could apologize and move on. There should have been backups to restore from but clearly there weren&#x27;t.<p>The gitlab way: Go in great details about how there is no automated backup and the last one that was done manually 3 months ago doesn&#x27;t work... and how there was no testing&#x2F;staging environment to try the change before production... and how any intern could delete it the same way by accident on their first day.<p>There&#x27;s a reason companies don&#x27;t publish gory details and internal discussion.
