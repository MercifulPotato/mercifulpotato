Item(by='kube-system', descendants=None, kids=[24780842, 24780602], score=None, time=1602703969, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24780305, text='&quot;Starting at $x&quot; ads like this are by far the least egregious any of those examples.  I don&#x27;t really see much of a problem with advertising configurable products like this, especially when it is called out specifically as a starting price.  The F150 can be priced from $28,745 all the way to $81,000+ and anything in-between.  People know trucks have options, and they know that when Ford says it&#x27;s &quot;starts at $28,745&quot; they&#x27;re not talking about the top of the line trim.  Nobody is being hurt by these practices.')
