Item(by='anderspitman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606770358, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25252598, text='&gt; The linux-based open-source mobile operating system Android is not only the most popular mobile operating system in the world, itâ€™s also on the way to becoming a proprietary operating system.<p>Android is also making major departures from unix-like OS semantics, mostly in the name of security. I&#x27;m particularly concerned about the directions they&#x27;re headed with storage.<p>As someone with minimal Android development experience, I spent a good chunk of time the last couple weeks getting a golang program to run on Android. The experience was a bizarre mix of things that ended up way easier than expected and things that were incredibly frustrating.<p>Favorite thing that worked:<p>Static linux ARM binaries from the standard go compiler work just fine. The biggest caveat so far is that if your app does any networking, you need to manage DNS yourself because Android doesn&#x27;t provide &#x2F;etc&#x2F;resolv.conf.<p>Weirdest thing that didn&#x27;t work:<p>The only way to run a native executable in an Android app is to pretend it&#x27;s a dynamic library and smuggle it into your APK via the jniLibs directory. You even have to name it lib*.so or the system won&#x27;t run it.')
