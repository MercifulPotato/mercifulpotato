Item(by='philsnow', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607732528, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25390896, text='For years I specifically used a separate emacs daemon for ERC because I don&#x27;t really know how to perfectly cleanly update a given package in a running emacs in-place, and I wanted to keep my IRC uptime (and I&#x27;m not using a bouncer for some reason).  So I would just leave ERC running in a daemon for the machine&#x27;s entire uptime without ever updating any of its packages.<p>This is giving me nostalgia for when I used to use bitlbee + libpurple and have all my chat+irc in a single client (ERC).  Good times.')
