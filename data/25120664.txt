I didn&#x27;t expect that from HN. I am sorry but they&#x27;re not a credible sources either.<p>1, The first wikipedia article (the first link) I referenced was not to take it as a source, but to point out that India&#x27;s unilateral statement is not convincing enough to bring consensus to the table. You missed my point.<p>2, The second wikipedia article (the fourth link) I referenced is something that all sides already agree on, and is adequately sourced. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with using Wikipedia entries to give quick access to information to people.<p>3, I think you may have misunderstood something, HN is not an academic journal, and you would fully expect people to cite Wikipedia entries all the time[1].<p>&gt; Nepal was like a brother, we had everything to share with them.<p>This was what India did in 2015: &quot;Nepal border blockade: Hospitals running out of drugs&quot;[2]. And you are calling &quot;Nepal was like a brother&quot;?<p>&gt; Are you really denying the expansionism by China? If you only care about hyperlink to so called &#x27;International Credible News Sources they&#x27;re not free from Foreign interference either.<p>Please don&#x27;t misinterpret a request for a reliable source as a denial.<p>I never said that the sources had to be from so called &quot;International Credible News Sources&quot;.<p>After all this time, you have not even been able to give news sources from the mainstream credible media in India&#x27;s ally, the United States, that support India&#x27;s claims. (Not just quotes, media also quote the Chinese side)<p>You keep broadening the scope of the discussion. But those &quot;backgrounds&quot; you introduced, true or not, add little credibility to the India statement you support.<p>——<p>Let&#x27;s end this discussion. At first I replied to &quot;perryizgr8&quot; just wanted to know why he asserted that &quot;Chinese soldiers kill our people on the border&quot;, which sounds like they were killing civilians for no reason. By his&#x2F;her reply, I understood that he&#x2F;she was just blindly listening to his&#x2F;her own government. The phrase &quot;kill our people&quot; is just his&#x2F;her way of adding fuel to the fire, which is unintentionally or intentionally misleading.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=en.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;11&#x2F;10&#x2F;asia&#x2F;nepal-border-blockade-drugs&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;11&#x2F;10&#x2F;asia&#x2F;nepal-border-blockade-dr...</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25108360" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25108360</a>')
