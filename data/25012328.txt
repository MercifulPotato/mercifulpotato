I have been across more than 20 states on Greyhound buses and it is generally a great service that provides excellent value. That said, I also have about 2 drinks worth of seriously messed up stories associated with some of these travels. As a man under 40 with a reasonable build and plenty of patience, everything will probably be fine, but I would not necessarily recommend this mode of transportation to everyone.')
