Very few people are doing so as their main (professional) activity.<p>Even those preserving some old way often either say that it offers various advantages (i.e. it is &#x27;more efficient&#x27; upon the set of criteria they chose), or (for a IMHO very minute fraction of them) are into some form of challenge expressed as &#x27;what can I achieve, given a very limited set of resources?&#x27;... which also is a quest for efficiency (in a constrained environment).<p>The central thesis is that technique is &#x27;autonomous&#x27; (has it own dynamics), has a major influence on any society using it, and that there is nothing we can do to &#x27;smooth out&#x27; this influence.')
