If you&#x27;re living in an environment where people go out of their way to make sure you don&#x27;t have any economic opportunity no matter what you do, what the hell is the point of preparing your children for a workforce that is guaranteed to reject them? To try and gain respectability among people who are steadfastly committed to never respecting them, because some day the dominant culture might decide the underlings are actually human beings? Why should they be disinclined to steal or beg from people who guarantee their entire community will continue to fail?')
