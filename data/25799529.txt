Item(by='yudlejoza', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610765310, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25787745, text='&gt; The Newton hypothesis: Is science done by a small elite?<p>That&#x27;s a horrible re-framing of Sturgeon&#x27;s law. I&#x27;m a big believer of it, especially in science and technology. But where does the word &#x27;elite&#x27; come from?<p>Let&#x27;s say you are a recent PhD doing a post-doc somewhere decent, not a top institute, but not low-ranked either. Your thesis was average, your post-doc research topic is kinda boring (for now). Well, does that make you a non-elite? You have 30 to 40 years of career ahead of you. Should you instead be grateful to find a lecturer position in the middle of nowhere and be satisfied with your career?<p>Not to single out, but does being a tenured professor, leading a STEM lab in MIT make you elite?<p>Again not to single out, and may he rest in peace, but Marvin Minsky ruined the field of AI for many decades with his narrow-mined critique of neural networks.<p>MIT tech review tried to bury the field of &#x27;longevity research&#x27; with a vicious, below-the-belt attack on Aubrey de Grey in 2005.<p>STEM history is full of so-called &#x27;elites&#x27; (i.e., those getting fame early in their careers, or resting on the laurels of one branding or another) ruining the overall progress for everyone, and setting humanity back. This is not too unrelated to &#x27;science progressing one funeral at a time&#x27; as observed by Planck.<p>Point: how do you know someone is &#x27;elite&#x27;?<p>You don&#x27;t. You find out after the fact, e.g., at the end of someone&#x27;s career if they don&#x27;t get an early break. In the meantime, you have to give them a chance, and check your &#x27;elite&#x27; bias.')
