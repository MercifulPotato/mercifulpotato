They have too much power.<p>What also happened was Google then actively went after my adsense earnings. All of a sudden I received warnings and sites being deactivated for monetization. \nThe webmaster console also started showing errors and my sites were delisted!<p>Because I didn&#x27;t take no for an answer when Ian Lance Taylor spoke the verdict of God on the documentation needing a more readable font?<p>Fuck github and Microsoft and Google')
