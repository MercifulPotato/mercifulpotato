The better chips have CRC&#x2F;Parity&#x2F;ECC to cover such issues but there are always those magical choke points where the past CRC is tossed and the new one is generated that can leave a gaping hole. The tricky part is how often is this bad memory buffer used...<p>I would use traceroute to find a common bad point for everyone. It is also possible that the networking point where the problem occurs is invisible to traceroute as it could be part of a provider network probably MPLS but at least the common ends of the tunnel would be visible.<p>The fact that it is a a specific interval indicates a stuck bit in memory.<p>Some good previous public stories about such incidents\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.verizondigitalmedia.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;being-good-stewards-of-the-internet&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.verizondigitalmedia.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;being-good-stewards...</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;cperciva&#x2F;status&#x2F;1309568337408454658" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;cperciva&#x2F;status&#x2F;1309568337408454658</a>')
