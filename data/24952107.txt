(That left is called by a lot of different city names.) But it&#x27;s not strictly legal because you don&#x27;t have the right of way to make a turn. But it&#x27;s one of the zillion things that people do (including jaywalking when it&#x27;s hopefully safe) that people do in order to get places and, so long as they&#x27;re not obnoxious or dangerous about it, no one gets either hurt or ticketed.')
