Republicans and Democrats are beginning to see the Bill of Rights as more &quot;suggestions&quot; than the actual foundation of our system of laws. I don&#x27;t even think they consider it a &quot;living Constitution&quot;  anymore and just consider it fodder for election speeches. Do not blame only Republicans for this, the Dems own it as well. Obama kept up mass surveillance and the unPatriotic Act as well as did Bush. They&#x27;re all complicit. Sure Dems have a better record on progressive social issues, and some Constitutional &quot;features&quot; but so do Republicans with gun rights and religious rights. However both are ignore fundamental aspects of it that don&#x27;t fit their narrative.')
