You claim with enough money, it is easy to make money with domains. So do the calculation and go to your bank. How much money will you need, and how much can you make?<p>Or work your way up. You don&#x27;t have to stay on minimum wage forever. In fact, if you are on minimum wage, you should probably think about ways to improve your income. Most people in minimum wage are probably not there forever - they may be pupils or students, or pensioners making extra money, and so on.<p>Also the cost per year is less relevant, if you earn more from selling domains every year. Only the difference is relevant (costs vs income).')
