Item(by='Dylan16807', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602056438, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24705277, text='&gt; You&#x27;re doing this weird math where actively murdering 5 people but saving 100000 is the same as just saving 99995, but it&#x27;s not when the 5 murders were not a requirement to save 100000.<p>I don&#x27;t see it that way.<p>It&#x27;s a completely random set of people that die either way.  And all the deaths basically boil down to &quot;driving is dangerous&quot;.  It&#x27;s not one set of people being saved and a different one dying.  It&#x27;s all one group, so only the total number matters.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not safer! Because that sentence is about the convenience features are not the safety features!<p>Your sentence was about that.  My <i>counterpoint</i> was about more than that.<p>I&#x27;ll reword my point without the word safer:  If the risk reduction from the safety features is <i>bigger</i> than the risk increase from the convenience features, I think things are acceptable.<p>&gt; The safety features save lives. The convenience features, by definition, cannot save lives that the safety ones didn&#x27;t.<p>I wasn&#x27;t trying to say the convenience features saved lives.<p>&gt; No one is saying the active safety features should save more lives, they&#x27;re saying the convenience features need to stop tricking people into driving distracted.<p>I&#x27;m the one saying that safety features need to save a certain number of lives.  And that number is &quot;enough to make up for the risk caused by the convenience features&quot;.<p>&gt; Because those people sometimes die in accidents that wouldn&#x27;t have happened if they didn&#x27;t have them.<p>Eh, someone that&#x27;s distracted could easily die in similar accident in a dumb car.  To me it&#x27;s all risk vs. risk.  Nobody is getting murdered by the car as some kind of sick trade-off.  It&#x27;s not a trolley problem.  It&#x27;s just <i>undoing</i> some of the safety.  But undoing the safety is acceptable, just like a car that had none of those safety features (and none of those convenience features) would also be acceptable.<p>&gt; The safety features would still save the same number of people, just no one would die needless deaths in the name of marketing and looking cool.<p>If it was just marketing and looking cool that would be one thing.  But it&#x27;s also quite hard mentally to pay attention when everything is on auto.  And it&#x27;s a much nicer driving experience that&#x27;s inherently dangerous no matter what the marketing says.  So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to have the convenience without the danger.  You&#x27;d have to disable AP.')
