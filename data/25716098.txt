How about the gay wedding cake situation, should a baker be forced to make a cake for a gay couple? Should I be able to refuse to hire trans people?<p>If you&#x27;re not sure about those, then you don&#x27;t believe in free association as a rule. I&#x27;m not saying anything about you personally, but most people only want to involve free association in the cases where it means they get to refuse people they don&#x27;t like.')
