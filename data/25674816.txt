The excellent performance (CPU&#x2F;power) and surprisingly well built Rossetta 2 has overshadowed potential limitations with memory and IO in the reviews.<p>Lightning fast opening of apps is great, but it&#x27;s not much use to people like me who don&#x27;t close their apps at all! I keep at least 3 browsers(for different projects) with several dozen tabs(with hibernation), Note taking apps, IDE and a VM with a browser open in it. So what&#x27;s important to me here is the memory, at least 32GB is bare minimum.')
