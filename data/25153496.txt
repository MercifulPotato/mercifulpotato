He got roughly 11 million more votes the second time around. That puts him roughly on par with Ronald Reagan as far as popularity the second time around. In terms of raw votes, he&#x27;s the most popular encumbent we&#x27;ve had period.<p>Biden&#x27;s win is a pretty narrow percentage -- in the battleground states it came down to less than 1%.<p>This is very much an unsettled political question. If you think that that political movement has buttoned up and moved on, you&#x27;re nuts. The results of this election are going to be in play in the mid-term elections and the next Presidential.<p>Feel free to downvote the unpopular truth.')
