Scaling out specific resources near the end became a very painful process.<p>I&#x27;m in my second playthrough, and the goal is to build a factory WITHOUT all the complexity. How can I cleanly scale out resource production without things becoming a hot mess? How can I build flexible re-usable subsystems that don&#x27;t restrict systems downstream?<p>Solving simple problems with complex solutions is one thing (over-engineering) but solving a complex problem with an elegant solution is much harder. And factorio is full of complex problems.')
