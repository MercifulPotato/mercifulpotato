I saw that error earlier and forgot to fix it.  The idea was to replicate sublime text&#x27;s feature for highlighting words with ctrl+d, but there is some kind of error for detecting when ctrl is being used as a modifier key in windows.  I&#x27;m going to fix that later today and upload a new build.  Thanks for the heads up<p>EDIT: problem should be fixed now.  I have just uploaded a new windows build to the website and pushed the changes to master on GitHub.  Tested it on my windows machine and it looks like the fix is working properly.  Re-downloading the installer file and installing again should resolve the issue.')
