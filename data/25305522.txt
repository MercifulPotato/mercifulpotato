A country of &quot;Personal freedom&quot; that utterly entraps you to work and shames you as a socialist for asking for support from your government. Ironically, the cut throat work environment that has trained me to always keep an eye out for a better deal is drawing me to immigrating away from this country to the EU.<p>(This is a throw away comment to vent my personal frustrations. I&#x27;m quite afraid of the terrible responses this will draw from my fellow Americans so pardon me if I skip out form here.)')
