This would ensure developers can use it freely but at some time a company would have to either pay it or ditch it.<p>However I see two issues with this model:\n- the community will shit on it like it&#x27;s not real OSS\n- big companies will start banning the use of such licenses<p>The other alternatives many are doing are paid support, priority issues for sponsors, paid for issues, etc.')
