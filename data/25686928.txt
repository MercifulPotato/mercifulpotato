For processors and peripherals that require drivers, it&#x27;s a cost of doing business for them - not an enabling feature.<p>It&#x27;s a cost of doing business that would be ameliorated by telling people how to use the product, because then they&#x27;re not the only ones able to do the work. I&#x27;ll use Linux drivers again as an example: I can only imagine the money it must cost for these SoC manufacturers to keep their kernel forks with binary blob drivers up to date with mainline Linux, and the security vulnerabilities that go unpatched in their products when they don&#x27;t. That&#x27;s money that Intel and AMD just don&#x27;t have to spend; they contribute to the kernel, yes, but they&#x27;re far from the only ones doing the work.')
