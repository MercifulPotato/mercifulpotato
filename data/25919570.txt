Checking a hash of the data they received is sufficient.<p>For a voting machine, what&#x27;s the analogue? If I walk up to a voting machine with an integrity key, how do I check that the source code it&#x27;s running has a given hash or is signed with a given key?<p>If the voting machine itself shows the code or does the check, obviously a person who compromised the machine can fake that bit. If I have to remove the hdd and verify the data on it, and take apart the voting machine to verify there&#x27;s no second hard drive... well, that seems like it&#x27;s well out of reach of any voter verifying it.<p>Integrity keys, hashes, signatures, blockchains, etc can verify digital data, can verify the contents of data that servers serve... But they don&#x27;t seem to solve the problem of &quot;what code is this machine running&quot;, and that seems to be the important problem for voting machine code.')
