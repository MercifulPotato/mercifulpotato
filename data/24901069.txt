If you&#x27;re running files with a high ratio of data:metadata, it works well; if you&#x27;re running something like a git repo on Gluster it is not a great experience.<p>It&#x27;s also thrashing a bit development wise; there&#x27;s a lot of features being pruned, and I&#x27;m a little concerned what its future looks like as Red Hat push harder down the Ceph route, since they&#x27;re the main source of code contributions to Gluster.')
