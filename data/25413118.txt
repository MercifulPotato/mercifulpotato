I&#x27;ll add one more thing against my argument:<p>- Discoverability: How many times have you opened glossary of a book just to explore and discover what else is in this book? Or open up a telephone directory with no specific person or business in mind, but a general category - &quot;Shoe repair&quot;? I think when things are organized by category, it allows for discoverability which would be difficult in a flat-searchable structure. Search works great when you know what you&#x27;re looking for.<p>This can be half-solved by listing all items in a tag. Just that they&#x27;d appear in multiple tag archives as duplicates.')
