You look at the edges of a road cut through a forest and you get an idea of the phases of regrowth for a forest. &quot;Weeds&quot;, ie. smaller grasses and annuals, are the first pioneers. They then give way to bushes, and then later, trees, as the soil&#x27;s capacity grows.<p>There&#x27;s still so much we don&#x27;t know about living soil, but most of what we do know points to soil health being the key ingredient to healthy ecosystems. How much we can accelerate that through tree planting and what not is likely very dependent on local environment.')
