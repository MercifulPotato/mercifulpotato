This is currently the dominant attitude in the field.<p>As others have stated, misfoldings do occur, and the protein is trying to achieve its lowest energy conformation, but the simplest answer is that we don&#x27;t have a complete answer, hence the desire to come up with a reliable computational solution. We know how certain residues affect tertiary structure, and we know the measurements of secondary structures with a surprising degree of accuracy, but for a protein with potentially hundreds of residues, there are simply too many degrees of freedom to simply tack on amino acids and come up with a structure (although this is essentially the approach that markov chain, monte carlo solutions use).<p>[This article gives a pretty good synopsis of where computational approaches to the protein folding problem stand.](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moalquraishi.wordpress.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;12&#x2F;09&#x2F;alphafold-casp13-what-just-happened&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;moalquraishi.wordpress.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;12&#x2F;09&#x2F;alphafold-casp...</a>)')
