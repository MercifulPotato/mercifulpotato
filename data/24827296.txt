Even if that wasn&#x27;t the case, employees can still save screenshots of the query results to their computer.<p>There must be companies out there approaching these issues in a far better way but we have yet to talk to somebody in that group. Everyone seems to have the exact same problems and all the solutions we&#x27;ve heard of are equally unsatisfactory - if not worse.<p>What is your satisfactory approach to analytics, compliance and data exfiltration? How do you ensure employees don&#x27;t see PII or if they see, they can&#x27;t do anything with them?<p>Do you know of any group (reddit&#x2F;discord&#x2F;mailing lists&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;anything) that addresses these topics in a serious, non-marketing way?<p>Any input is welcome.')
