Peter Drucker, well worth reading if you haven&#x27;t, said that the thing that makes a manager is <i>character</i>.  My definition of character is someone who takes action that may have serious negative personal consequences (extreme version: high-profile whistle blowing).  Character can&#x27;t be built by buying an app or taking a weekend workshop.  It&#x27;s formed early in life. It&#x27;s an extremely rare commodity. Hence, good managers are scarce on the ground and likely to remain so.')
