This was not an actual proposal, and it is not something I advocate or endorse,&quot; Jones said.<p>&gt; &quot;This was an argument that claims of trans youth’s unreadiness to give consent to puberty blockers, if followed consistently, lead to the conclusion that all youth are likewise not ready for the experience of puberty itself. Because that conclusion is absurd — again, this was not something that I advocated or endorsed — the argument that trans youth can’t consent to puberty blockers is faulty,&quot; Jones added.<p>With all due respect, in this situation you’re claiming that a fringe view in the US (which even the alleged proponent says was not an actual proposal) is the accepted norm, and that anyone who objects is called a transphobe. That’s not the case at all.')
