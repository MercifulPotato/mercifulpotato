Yes, neither writes code, but  the product manager focuses on which features are most important for the customer and therefore needs to know a lot about the product and what makes a good product.<p>Project managers, on the other hand, can be used even if there is no product. They require good people skills and (should) make things work, while having some knowledge about tools&#x2F;methods that could enhance the job.<p>If you think SCRUM, the project manager is closest to the scrum master (someone who cares about impediments and methodology) and the product manager is likely to be the product owner (prioritizing and describing features).<p>However, project managers can be used for all types of assignments as long as they have a start and an end ;-)')
