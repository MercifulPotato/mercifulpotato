One single DMT experience (containing about an objective hour of intensely being dragged through time) greatly minimized my ADHD symptoms for at least <i>six months</i>. There is untapped potential in psychedelics for treatment of things like this. It’s a crime against humanity that we allowed neurotypicals to decide for everyone how these neurochemistries are managed.<p>ADHD treatment is not ADHD friendly. <i>Society</i> is not ADHD friendly. Neurotypicals literally have the same scale of mental privilege as whites do in a racial context.')
