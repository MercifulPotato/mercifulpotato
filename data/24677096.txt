And how big is the contribution here? Is it worth pursuing<p>I like this question. It makes me wonder what society would look like if we had micro community councils that operated this way, where residents “donated” parts of their wealth and those donations gave them some sort of stake, naming right, or voting power in community projects.<p>I wonder if we’d get the same sort of donations we get by wealthy families to get hospital wards named after them etc.<p>I suppose it requires a shift in what we value as humans, perhaps we could work toward a society where the amount you’ve given away gives you the most social credit or prestige, rather than how much you’ve amassed. Is it too naive and childish to think this sort of society is possible and could be an improvement over the current one?')
