The Consumer Price Index (at least in the US) excludes so many things as to not be a real measure of the dollar&#x27;s buying power. If the dollar isn&#x27;t debasing, how do we explain so many sectors with rising prices? Is college education today really multiple times more valuable than 10 or 20 years ago, or have dollars lost real value?<p>Perhaps the basic consumer goods you mentioned continue to benefit from the deflationary effect of automation and technology, thus their prices fall in real terms (assuming that the dollar has lost value during the last decade, given rising prices in the sectors I mentioned).<p>I think we&#x27;re in a period of both dollar inflation (due to the Fed&#x27;s monetary policy and government&#x27;s continued debt spending) and deflation (due to technology&#x2F;automation and the Eurodollar system&#x27;s global demand for dollars), resulting in dollar debasement while many everyday consumer items retain their nominal price or even decline in dollar terms.')
