Unfortunately it&#x27;s a really poor vaccine compared to other commonly given vaccines, but it&#x27;s an exception. The calculations how much the flu shot helps aren&#x27;t pretty. You can also see this by the fact that in many european countries flu vaccination is not recommended for the whole population.<p>Most vaccines have amazing effectiveness. If you take something like measles, it&#x27;s basically &quot;take 2 shots and you have a more than 90% chance of being protected for a lifetime&quot;. This is a much easier win than &quot;you need to have a shot every year and the effectiveness is varying somewhere between 40-60%&quot;.<p>Luckily it seems Covid vaccines are more like measles vaccines than like flu vaccines - at least in terms of effectiveness.')
