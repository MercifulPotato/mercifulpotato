You click a link in Safari, which makes a fingerprint of your device from the browser (and bundles your IP) and sends a request to Branch.io, this redirects you to App Store and you install the app from the link. The app the uses Branch.io SDK to make the fingerprint again and asks the server to send the payload back to you. This way you can make deep links work even if you don&#x27;t yet have the app installed.\nTo my surprise it still works quite reliably on iOS 14. It has some issues with fingerprinting if there are multiple iPhones with similar fingerprint on same network (same IP).')
