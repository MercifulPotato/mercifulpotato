But that doesn&#x27;t mean extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence to investigate.</i><p>Even your former claim might not be necessarily true. What constitutes &quot;an extraordinary evidence&quot; exactly?<p>Example: imagine aliens are freely living among us but our eyes are blind to certain light frequencies (they are in fact blind to most wavelengths) and that&#x27;s how aliens utilize camouflage.<p>Would revealing this fact be an extraordinary evidence for aliens? It&#x27;s IMO extremely subjective. People might get very excited with such a discovery, sure, but the explanation does sound rather bland and super obvious (as all things in hindsight).<p>So this whole &quot;extraordinary&quot; stuff reads more like popular old men bickering in front of the media for the goals of PR coverage and, who knows, maybe that increases their odds for scientific funding. I&#x27;d always look for the financial incentive and potential conflict of interest first.')
