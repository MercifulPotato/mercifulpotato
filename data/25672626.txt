I&#x27;m going to tell you why.<p>I used telegram seriously, to connect to my team members, connect to friends in groups and message friends privately, before our government blocked it and people migrated to whatsapp.<p>Usability:<p>1-Whatsapp is only available on one phone (I know it&#x27;s because of e2e encryption, but we&#x27;ll get to that later) and only android&#x2F;ios. Anything else needs to use web and connect to the main device, which limits the experience, if you use it heavily.<p>2-Whatsapp does not have edit, the web version cannot set ctrl-enter to send, any mistaken enter will send an incomplete message that cannot be edited.<p>3-You lose all your chats when you change your phone. Backup is still a solution, but not if you want to migrate from iphone to android (something I did) and do not trust an app that has 100 install to migrate your data.<p>4-You cannot use multiple phone numbers by one whatsapp on one phone.<p>5-If you add a person to a group, they cannot see past messages. (I know, another side-effect of e2e)<p>6-It has many minor bugs with bluetooth headsets. If you press the answer, it just disconnects from the headset, you should answer on phone screen.<p>7-Lacks many useful features for organization, like chat folders (I know, this is also recent in Telegram)<p>On the other hand, telegram is heavily customizable, has clients for all major platforms, can connect to many accounts at once, your data is not tied to your device.<p>About E2e encryption:<p>I don&#x27;t mind that telegram does not have e2e. My private messages are not worth the effort for a large organization or government. As a citizen of a country where the government actively and strongly suppresses freedom of speech, e2e in groups is not useful. Any breached device or one informer in any group is enough for all messages to be breached. This is only needed in case the government does not have access to the (apparently infinite) list of security problems by whatsapp, which apparently they do (why they block Telegram and not whatsapp?)<p>In usability, I can go on and on with increasingly detailed differences between whatsapp and Telegram and everywhere Telegram wins hands down, except that by default, chats do not have e2e encryption and groups cannot have e2e at all.')
