I wonder how many of them visited before applying.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to knock the city, but it is a very different place, and SF residents might chafe at the lack of interesting nature in the surrounding area. Probably the closest large park-ish area would be the Ozarks over in Arkansas. It&#x27;s a lovely forest, but still about a 2.5-hour drive away. And OK&#x27;s state highways are absolutely littered with aggressive speed traps.')
