You don&#x27;t have to worry about vaccines in the downtime, you dont have to clean&#x2F;etc between tenants, you have less regulatory concerns (in theory), long term tenants have incentive to be respectful to neighbours and not destroy the place.<p>But there is just more demand for short term. Personally i would rather there was just more housing in general (maybe that&#x27;s naive).<p>There are definitely some nice things about staying in an airbnb other than costs - having a full kitchen, having a bit more &quot;room&quot; [especially if travelling in a group], usually being in an area near things like grocery stores and less near generic tourism BS.')
