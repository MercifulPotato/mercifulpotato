Firewalls can monitor existing host settings and take them into account.<p>2. The &#x27;dial-home&#x27; mentioned bypasses Windows&#x27;s firewall.<p>3. External monitoring has shown that it does bypass firewalls (however, I cannot say whether that&#x27;s all of them).  So does security software such as LoJack (but that&#x27;s somewhat unusual).<p>4. This includes ones with kernel drivers.<p>5. As the code is written to be invisible to other processes, firewall writers would either have to reverse engineer MS&#x27;s code to stop it or know certain proprietary details about it. I doubt if any legit&#x2F;reputable developer would risk using info gained from RE (certainty not to stop it functioning as MS intended). Nevertheless, some MS parteners know about it for obvious reasons.<p>6. From various news reports several weeks ago, it seems that XP&#x27;s source code has leaked. That means if you are keen enough you can find the &#x27;offending&#x27; code and verify the matter for yourself one way or the other (at least as far as XP goes).  If you don&#x27;t, then sooner or later l&#x27;m sure others will do so.<p>If I and others who share this understanding are way off beam, which I doubt having seen evidence, then please let us all know about it in a HN post.')
