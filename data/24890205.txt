Fortunately, I was at my desk at the time and couldn&#x27;t help but notice the heavy smoke boiling out of the machine. I pulled the plug pronto which halted the fire, and put the machine out on the concrete patio till it stopped smoking. Curious, I plugged it in again and the fire started again. REmoving the cover showed the graphics card and a section of the mobo was burned to a crisp.<p>I had to wash the floor, walls, everything in my office to get the stink out.<p>Replaced the mobo and graphics card and I was back in business, but this time I bought some sheet steel and set the computer on that, which hopefully would buy some time to get the fire out.<p>The machine had a metal case, which I&#x27;m sure greatly slowed down the spread of the fire. So for me from now on, it&#x27;s metal cases all the way, baby.')
