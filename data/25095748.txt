We know police don’t have the training or the tools to handle this scenario well.<p>I don’t see how brining in people with better training could be a detriment. Worse case you ended up back where you started, the “violent and irrational” person ends up dead. Best case they successfully deescalate and render appropriate treatment, saving their life.<p>Not sure where the downside is.')
