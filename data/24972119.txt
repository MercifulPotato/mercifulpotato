I think video calls are a waste of time the majority of the time but one legitimate use case is where there&#x27;s an issue which doesn&#x27;t seem to be easily resolved using written media. In this case it&#x27;s useful to have a video call where you can gauge someone&#x27;s reaction to specific things you say. That way you might be able to get to the gist of where the miscommunication is happening. A dildo in the background doesn&#x27;t add to this (although a bunch of empty vodka bottles might gives some clues), while seeing a person&#x27;s reactions to statements&#x2F;questions might.')
