Anybody that bought or mined a large amount of coins back in the day and held on to them, is now rich, so a pretty good investment. The same forces that acted on bitcoin and brought it from worthless to 19k are still acting on it now.<p>Doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s very difficult to understand why bitcoin is considered an investment vehicle.<p>There are certainly good arguments for why may or may not be a poor investment vehicle or not the right one for a particular strategy, but arguments of whether it <i>is</i> one are moot.')
