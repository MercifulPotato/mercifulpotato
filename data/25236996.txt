The display breaks down by the hierarchical organisation of the data source.<p>It might be possible to build up a list of regions as you navigate through the site, and then show only those in the bubble chart so that you can compare them. Interesting idea.<p>We wouldn&#x27;t be able to aggregate infectious or R estimates for one or more regions together as the computation for those is done during deploy and then that processed data is uploaded along with the static site (it doesn&#x27;t connect to a database to fetch data on the fly).')
