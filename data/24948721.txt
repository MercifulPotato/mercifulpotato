But just a couple of the same model houses are shown as $800 to $900! If I didn&#x27;t know this neighborhood I would jump to the conclusion that those houses have been owned for so long that their taxes are so low and curse prop13.<p>But, I&#x27;ve been in this neighborhood since it was built so I know the tax was never below 2K even on the first year of constructed.<p>So either these outliers are just errors in the published records, or is there some tax exemption program in CA for people who qualify to some criteria?<p>In any case, it does give the impression that the tax range for this model house is $800 to $8K (10x) when that is not true. It is really 5K to 8K.')
