I&#x27;m 16 and got into programming in a similar way but I can&#x27;t in good conscience say that making Minecraft mods is a good way of learning programming. It&#x27;s a pain in the ass. There&#x27;s practically no documentation and you usually find yourself scrolling through deobfuscated game code trying to make sense of the thing and figure how the game works. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good way of learning. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, getting started programming by making things that you want to make is an excellent way to make it enjoyable rather than a chore but trying to write Minecraft mods and figure out what to do is frustrating and grueling.')
