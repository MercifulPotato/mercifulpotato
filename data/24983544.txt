Additionally, at the altitudes Starlink operates at, if thereâ€™s a problem with the commanded deorbit, the satellites will naturally deorbit in a reasonable time.<p>EDIT:OneWeb operates at higher altitudes where if there&#x27;s a failure, the satellite will stay there for hundreds of years, but to try to mitigate that a bit, they added a grappling fixture&#x2F;fiducial to try to make it easier for a robotic deorbiting craft to capture it.')
