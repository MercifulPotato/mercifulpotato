Not everyone in a company can be an &quot;exceptionally&quot; strong person, otherwise it wouldn&#x27;t be exceptional any longer.<p>You&#x27;re saying the expectation was to either become L5 or get out. So now we have all these PhDs and super achievers working at Google, but only some of them can be exceptional vs. the others.<p>You were exceptional vs. regular people and made it to L5. Now comes in a super achieving PhD that&#x27;s a tad better than you and now he&#x27;s exceptional. You are no longer exceptional. You&#x27;re just an average super achiever. So get the eff off Google&#x27;s lawn. Stack ranking completed.')
