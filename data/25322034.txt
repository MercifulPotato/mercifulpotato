I <i>think</i> I like the episodes where Lex talks more, but with this I can check my idea of when Lex talks more vs what the actual screen time ratio is. (In the Anca Dragan episode (and maybe others), the colours used are very similar, makes things less clear.)<p>* I was confused about &quot;views&quot; and &quot;likes&quot; until I saw it was from YouTube (which is also a limitation, most podcasts don&#x27;t have YouTube channel or the YT channel audience is much lower). (Btw, it says &quot;I used youtube-dl to download all of the videos publicly available on the JRE channel&quot;, should be Lex Fridman&#x27;s channel for this site.)<p>* I&#x27;m confused about the second graph: how should I be using the left and right axes? Things don&#x27;t seem to be vertically distributed by views, and I find it unlikely things fall in the &quot;under 20% likes&quot; vs &quot;over 80% likes&quot; bins so sharply, so I must be misreading it.<p>* The blue banner below Screen Time looked like a footer to me, so I assumed that&#x27;s where the page ended. It took some half a page of scrolling beyond that, for the rest of the stuff to load.<p>* The &quot;Search for a different episode&quot; under Episode Similarity doesn&#x27;t seem to be working. I click it, search for Sean Carroll (and it lists a dozen things, a lot of which seem to be his own podcast episodes), I can&#x27;t click on any of the results. I can&#x27;t even get out of that Search screen, reloading seems the only way out.')
