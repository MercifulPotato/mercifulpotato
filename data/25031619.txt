Beyond that, it would be more contentious.<p>The &#x27;hard anti-abortion&#x27; camp would obviously not like that, and the &#x27;hard fetus is only a fetus&#x27; camp would be livid that there were restrictions on later abortions.<p>But the &#x27;centre ground&#x27; would hold, at least in terms of popular acceptance.<p>Of course it won&#x27;t happen because the &#x27;far sides&#x27; war with each other on it. We may, over decades, arrive at some kind of result that looks like that, we mostly already have.<p>&quot;I personally know someone who firmly believes that an immigrant overstaying their visa has committed a crime, is now a criminal, and they (and their family) need to be deported immediately.&quot;<p>Again - this kind of misses the &#x27;centre ground&#x27; argument.<p>That you know someone who thinks &#x27;any overstay should be aborted&#x27; only indicates that there are people who feel strongly about it.<p>It says nothing about the &#x27;common ground&#x27;.<p>Here is the evidence [1]. Even a <i>majority</i> of Republicans support DACA.<p>I&#x27;d encourage everyone to spend a lot of time in Pew Research, it&#x27;s amazing. There are a lot of surveys in there with respect to so many issues that one might find surprising.<p>It is frankly Pew Research that has made be understand how much common ground their is, and my OP is really based on quite some time perusing that data - I should have probably referred to it - but on every one if the issues I highlighted, there&#x27;s Pew data to support it.<p>Here&#x27;s some data on policing [2]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;17&#x2F;americans-broadly-support-legal-status-for-immigrants-brought-to-the-u-s-illegally-as-children&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;17&#x2F;americans-b...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;05&#x2F;a-month-before-george-floyds-death-black-and-white-americans-differed-sharply-in-confidence-in-the-police&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;05&#x2F;a-month-bef...</a>')
