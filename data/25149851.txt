It is a company issued one so I won&#x27;t bother too much with it. I remember when the i9 came out, Apple had some issues with it, so maybe the battery usage is still a problem?<p>But even so, 2 hours of my usage, in pretty much every mbp I owned (and I had a few) always depleted minimum 25% of battery. (maybe the websites I use are more draining that simple static ones?) And we are talking about 4% now with this one. No matter how you dice it, it is still a big difference.<p>quick edit: it has been 2.5 hours right now since I unplugged it. Browsing Reddit and Hacker News, Whatsapp and Slack applications. 5% of the battery has been used!')
