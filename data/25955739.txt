They would have to do something exaggeratedly egregious (no battery? no USB ports? That kind of thing) for me to even consider the competition.<p>It&#x27;s sad, but as bad as it is that Lenovo makes these changes, to me it&#x27;s even worse that other brands don&#x27;t even bother to offer a TrackPoint in at least some of their lineup, considering that it takes negligible space and the inconvenience for people who don&#x27;t use it is near zero.')
