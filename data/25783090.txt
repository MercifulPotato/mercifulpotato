I&#x27;d suggest that it is far more likely that they do so because they are deferential to authority by default.<p>Authorities in the US initially said <i>don&#x27;t</i> wear masks as private citizens. There was a groundswell of people saying &quot;it&#x27;s not a panacea, but it&#x27;s quite probably worth doing for everybody&quot; to get them to change their position and admit the original one was based more on trying to avoid a shortage than on anything about efficacy. That pushback seemed to come from an educated populace.')
