Item(by='telltruth', descendants=None, kids=[25292731], score=None, time=1607010134, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25285844, text='As I understand, she first sent out mass email to large group of employees that outright violated Google&#x27;s policy. This act alone was sufficient for immediate termination. However, she then tried to bargain with her manager. Her manager basically let her know that bargaining was irrelevant and her action was serious enough that she is being terminated immediately. Then she comes back and tells the story with twist that Google ignored her bargaining and terminated her even while she initiated that bargaining. She goes on to reveal a lot of things except the content of her email or even hint of exactly what was so incriminating. Now she wants to keep lid closed in the name of future lawsuit all the while launching attacks on everyone. I feel whole thing is super muddy. If she is truly ethical, she needs to come out clean on exactly what happened or just stop attacking everyone and keep playing victim.')
