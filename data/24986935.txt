That is major useful for code-reviewing so you can go back during your pair session and immediately find things.<p>My only fear is that all this data is stored somewhere outside of my realm, and if it records personally identifiable data of some sorts from my screen, I never will feel like I will be able to make sure the recordings&#x2F;transcripts are gone-gone.<p>Good job Ian!')
