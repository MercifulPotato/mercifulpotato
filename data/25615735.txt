Generally central banks focus on inflation on consumer goods because consumer goods and services pay the wages of workers. If consumer inflation is low that means there is little demand for consumer goods and by extension there is little demand for workers.<p>The point harryh was trying to make is that if consumer inflation is high then you could trivially pay off a low interest mortgage because inflation is constantly reducing the effective principal of the mortgage.<p>In reality what we see is asset inflation and asset inflation is usually a sign of mild deflation because there is an overabundance of production capacity or labor and therefore consumer goods with no takers.')
