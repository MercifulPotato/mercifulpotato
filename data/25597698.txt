Terminal log, position, monitor, tab history etc.<p>This is one of my biggest issues right now. I have so many different workspaces and I just want to be able to switch from one set of terminals to another without having to write a new terminal program. This has to be on the list of many developers out there, right?<p>Example: I have one set of terminals for programming against an enterprise product (4 terminals), another for programming a hobby project (2-3 terminals) and a benchmarking tool I work on related to both (2 terminals). All completely different projects. I&#x27;m used to saving incantations in bash scripts because of this, but I really want my separate history at the very least.')
