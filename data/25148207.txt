There&#x27;s a weird communal perception of Haskell being a near enough insurmountable challenge, so instead of people getting their hands dirty, they just flirt with it on and off for years on end.<p>In my experience, after I had written a web app or two in Haskell I wasn&#x27;t sure what all the fuss was about. It&#x27;s an excellent language to be productive in. The libraries and tooling are great. The water is warm; jump in.<p>Please don&#x27;t take the above as criticism; it isn&#x27;t intended that way. It&#x27;s great that you&#x27;re learning and sharing Haskell :) Also FYI your about page currently is a 404.')
