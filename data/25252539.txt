Matlab is for engineers, not for mathematicians. They use computer algebra systems, proof assistants, etc. Difference is that engineers (and physicists) want answers and don’t care about how they are obtained, while its the reverse for mathematicians.<p>I think APL, although it, too, is a language for computing numbers, spiritually is a bit closer to mathematics than Matlab.')
