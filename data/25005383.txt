But his hand isn&#x27;t strong enough not because he&#x27;s a leftist, but because he&#x27;s an outsider. The insider policies of the Democratic party are just as leftist; they&#x27;re just a different flavor of leftist--roughly speaking, New Left vs. Sanders-style Old Left, hardball power politics vs. &quot;softer&quot; socialism. That&#x27;s also why the Democrats now are just fine allying with Wall Street and big business: power politics needs financing, and that&#x27;s where the money is.<p><i>&gt; don&#x27;t be so hard on Hillary</i><p>You&#x27;re entitled to your opinion, but I&#x27;m also entitled to mine.')
