Not explicitly of course, because this is strictly forbidden, both ways, due to license incompatibility. For OpenStreetMap this is a very important point, because well-meaning novice mappers copying streets or points-of-interest directly from a proprietary map put the project at risk of litigation. Google will likely have such a strong rule in their own internal documentation as well.<p>OSM strongly discourages the mapping of <i>trap streets</i> — fake streets that only exist on your map for unscrupulous competition to copy so you know that they did so — but it&#x27;s possible that some mappers do put these on the map. I don&#x27;t think one of the big proprietary maps has ever been caught copying one of these though.')
