I mean, the ideal city would probably be self-driving trains, people movers, and free scooters, segways, or wheelchairs everywhere. No AI vision systems needed.<p>If you live in urban Japan, do you ever need a car?<p>To replace all 273 million vehicles in the US with self-driving EVs would cost around $10 trillion @ $50k per car. You could built a national network of self-driving lanes for a fraction of that. You could build rail lines and subways in every major metro area.<p>The major upside of a car vs train though is privacy. You may not mind taking the train in Japan, but in SF, it can be disgusting, and so private vehicles and American culture may be inseparable.<p>But that still leaves many other solutions, like we have bike lanes, and HOV lanes, we could build AV-only lanes, and prohibit AVs from working (requiring manual takeover) when you depart them.<p>On long drives to work, you&#x27;d just stay in the AV lane and chill, and when you got close to an exit, you&#x27;d have to take over. It would still be a win if on a 1hr commute you only did 15 minutes of actual driving.')
