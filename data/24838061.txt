But I thought you or Keith had done a similar out-of-core with texture caching implementation for inclusion directly into OptiX. My assumption is that once you got the texture cache full enough, stalling on a Unified Memory page fault or similar wouldn’t be super common (again, depends on the hit rate).<p>Does the new cuMemAddressReserve combined with mmap on the host side let you have a giant virtual mmap’ed host side memory region?')
