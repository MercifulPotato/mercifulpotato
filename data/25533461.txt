It&#x27;s not a question of what readers are capable of. It&#x27;s multiple universal standards that would have to change, and for what? Packaging has a bad enough time with UPS codes getting distorted to the point of being unreadable, and that would be even worse with 2D codes. Furthermore, 2D codes take longer to decode.<p>1D scanners are able to scan the entire surface of an object to find the codes quickly, or even two surfaces at the same time. Think cashiers again, quickly plowing through a cartload of merchandise. They don&#x27;t have to aim to do that. They just have to know what side the barcode is on. It&#x27;s a non-trivial engineering issue to make 2D as efficient to scan as 1D.<p>There is absolutely no reason to move to 2D codes for the majority of existing 2D applications.')
