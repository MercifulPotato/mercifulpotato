The meeting was scheduled by her manager, but later the director shows up out of blue and the manager leaves and says that &quot;it&#x27;s something very important&quot;. Thev director is the spider here: he&#x27;s a true sociopath, probably admiring the evil already, has plotted the entire thing to make sure nobody would ever believe the female employee, then got a manager to schedule a meeting without him being involved in paper and then showed up, expecting to get the coerced initiative from the employee. If it worked out, the director would later say that he&#x27;s never been to that abandoned part of the building. The director even has a personal dog with criminal background that he unleashes on the prey.<p>The best they can do in this situation is a lawsuit from multiple victims, former employees, backed by paper trail (emails, etc.).')
