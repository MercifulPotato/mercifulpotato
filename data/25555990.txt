Why not draw actual S-curves? That way you&#x27;re guaranteed an actual inflection point where curvature goes smoothly through zero, as opposed to two arcs joined. Why not explore control over tension by using curve handles greater than 1&#x2F;3 (so curvature on endpoints is less) or less than 1&#x2F;3, cranking up the tension in a way inspired by physical materials? Why not have the computer do the work of ensuring the joins are G2 continuous by construction, instead of having to eyeball it?')
