At that time, it always was a quick way to get most adults to think you&#x27;re some kind genius :).  I dropped out of college after ~2 years, in no small part because I&#x27;ve never liked being <i>told</i> what I need to learn, but because I had already taught myself programming, I was able to find work.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to keep this mentality up throughout my all my life.  It drives my wife crazy, but I&#x27;m constantly buying compsci or math books to try and learn a bit more and get just a little better at the <i>theory</i> of compsci, and hopefully becoming a better engineer in the process. I have no idea if I&#x27;m better than the &quot;average&quot; programmer, whatever that means, but I have managed to get good enough to where people ask me compsci theory questions at work, which is somewhat validating.')
