Remember back in the day when pacemakers were being hacked remotely because admin passwords weren&#x27;t even changed from the default, on top of outdated wireless protocols? Oh right that&#x27;s today!<p>Hardware makers often aren&#x27;t good at software, not to mention software updates. And even that gets wonky, like when Microsoft update got hijacked.<p>Point is, if we can&#x27;t get IoT 100% right, or even 90% right, how can we trust IoT with physical interfaces into our bodies? That&#x27;s the problem. And then what happens if the company who made your implant goes out of business? What do you do when those updates stop? Look at cellphones, supporting a cellphone for 2 years is too much for most hardware makers, they rather never update it.<p>Point is, even if the tech is 100% possible, we&#x27;re way too far from business setups that allow for this to happen.')
