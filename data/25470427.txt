A lot of new manufacturers were willing to dump costs into tooling up production if they knew there would be demand in a year or two for the product.<p>But because the government waffled so long, and kept casting doubt even on the length of the pandemic, barely anyone was willing to dump the money into production.<p>As I understand it, the current situation is that the majority of manufacturers for N95 masks today were the same ones that existed in 2019.')
