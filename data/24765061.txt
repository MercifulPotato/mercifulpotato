Also several GMO seeds like Golden rice were carefully never patented to make it  easier for poor to use them - and the poor still cannot get&#x2F;use those seeds even though they are better.<p>No sane farmer saves seeds. Hybrids seeds yield much better than saved seeds, so it is worth the cost to buy new seeds every year. Obviously this depends on the crop - not everything can be hybrid successfully.')
