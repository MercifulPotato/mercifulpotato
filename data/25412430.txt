I think installation commanders simply figure that since everyone affected has already agreed to be part of a military installation with the ups and downs that brings, it&#x27;s fine to err on the side of caution and activate security procedures for anything that comes up. It can be mildly annoying when you find out you&#x27;re locked in because someone found something suspicious somewhere, but hey, you&#x27;re working with the military. For the military, behaving as if they are under attack is part and parcel of the organization.<p>You don&#x27;t alert the press until you&#x27;re pretty damn sure, though. Military bases can already have stressed relationships with their communities and they don&#x27;t need to be starting a panic over every change in the FPCON.')
