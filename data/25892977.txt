You are repeating a lie.<p>If it were true, I and my other renter friends would at least be able to keep our rents steady. My rent went up during covid, as did others&#x27;. And we&#x27;re in perfectly generic apartments.<p>A couple of loud rich people are posting thinkpieces about leaving. A couple of folks who hate NYC and SF are aggressively retweeting those posts. And, perhaps, <i>growth</i> is slowing down. But the city is not &quot;emptying.&quot;<p>But if it helps you feel more oppressed and backs up your identity politics, believe whatever you want.')
