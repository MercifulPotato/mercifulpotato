By default, only &quot;same-origin&quot; requests are allowed and &quot;cross-origin&quot; requests are disabled. But CORS is still there none the less.<p>What GitHub has done in this case, is add support for &quot;cross-origin&quot; requests.<p>Nitpicky maybe, but thought it&#x27;d be useful to add to avoid any confusion.')
