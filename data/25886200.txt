Item(by='31cde6b92951440', descendants=None, kids=[25887320], score=None, time=1611436796, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25885744, text='rayiner implied Maryland is some kind of single-party Democratic hellscape, though I dispute his description of<p>&gt; Since 1969, we&#x27;ve had just two moderate Republican governors (who got elected to pump the breaks a bit on otherwise unbroken Democratic control).<p>because the two Republican governors have been recent: after Glendening (D) from 1995-2003 there was Ehrlich (R), then O&#x27;Malley (D), and now Hogan (R). So I&#x27;d say it rather as Maryland voters have held the governor&#x27;s party to account for over 25 years. It looks like Illinois has followed a similar pattern.<p>Anyway I finished high school in Maryland before Glendening was out and it was almost embarrassingly good, though I didn&#x27;t fully appreciate it at the time, despite my family being middle class at most. I don&#x27;t remember any particular issues with other state-level public services. Some places have real challenges like parts of Baltimore and Prince George&#x27;s County (near DC) and, I&#x27;m sure in different ways, the deeply rural areas out west and toward the Eastern Shore, but I don&#x27;t see the state as some sort of self-evident cautionary tale of Democratic rule and I&#x27;d really like to hear what rayiner is basing that on.<p>If you don&#x27;t mind, could you summarize what you&#x27;re unhappy with in Illinois? I know about Blagojevich, but other than that. Or just link to some long-form article if you have one handy.')
