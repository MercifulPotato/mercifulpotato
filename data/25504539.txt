A good argument against it is to realise that future developers (us included!) will know their requirements far better than we can guess them; if code needs writing, they should do it (as an extra bonus, we don&#x27;t waste effort on things which aren&#x27;t needed). The best way to help them is to avoid introducing unnecessary restrictions.')
