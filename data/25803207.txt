After nine million years of tweaking, most of them are not too bright but they are perfect at what they do.  Ambassador Drill is trying to prevent a newly discovered species, the Shar, from treading on the toes of humanity, because if the Shar do have even a <i>slight</i> accidental conflict as the result of human terraforming ships wiping out Shar colonies because they just didn&#x27;t <i>notice</i> them, the rather terrifyingly adapted military subspecies branches of humanity will utterly wipe out the Shar, as they have efficiently done with so many others, just as a reflex.  Ambassador Drill fears that negotations, despite his desire for peace, may not go well, because the terraforming ships will take a long time to receive information that the Shar are in fact sentient and billions of them ought not to be wiped out ...<p>Google, somehow, strikes me as this vision of humanity, but without an Ambassador Drill.  It simply lumbers forward, doing its thing.  It is to be modeled as a threat not because it is malign, but because it doesn&#x27;t notice you <i>exist</i> as it takes another step forward.  Threat modeling Lovecraft-style: entities that are alien and unlikely to single you out in particular, it&#x27;s just what they <i>do</i> is a problem.<p>Google&#x27;s desire for scale, scale, scale, meant that interactions must be handled through The Algorithms.  I can imagine it still muttering &quot;The algorithms said ...&quot; as anti-trust measures reverse-Frankenstein it into hopefully more manageable pieces.')
