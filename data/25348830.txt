Item(by='ascagnel_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607449945, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25346822, text='Apple rolled out a low-latency audio feature a few weeks ago -- if you have a HomePod&#x2F;pair of HomePods set as your primary output on your ATV4K, they&#x27;re able to stay in sync with the TV even when you&#x27;re doing something where any audio latency would be noticeable.  For example, if I&#x27;m streaming a game from my PC, video and audio are in lockstep (which you wouldn&#x27;t expect to see normally, since the audio would get 1-2s of buffer from the video) and there&#x27;s no noticeable input latency (which you&#x27;d see if the device was holding back the video to build an audio buffer).')
