Wayland relies on layers upon layers of other solutions for things like central registries, interprocess communication, and negotiating hardware access.<p>From the Wayland perspective, this is all perfectly reasonable. It’s just how software gets made.<p>From the perspective of someone who isn’t already running a Linux kernel with evdev + KMS + DRM, we aren’t able to even find common language to discuss what being “a compositor” means to Wayland.')
