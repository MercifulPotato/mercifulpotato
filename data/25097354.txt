Apple never heard the word PRISM<p>As I&#x27;ve said, that&#x27;s a detail and splitting hairs. If a sentence has multiple interpretations and one of them is true, but you phrase it in a way that most people interpret the sentence in the wrong way, you are intentionally deceiving people. They should have said &quot;we never heard the name PRISM&quot; or something like this.')
