This is why things like quantum gravity are being researched. Maybe I&#x27;m looking too deeply into this analogy, but I think it&#x27;s a really bad one.<p>&gt; In highly complex systems such as business, things like butterfly effects can cause massive distortions rendering our models flawed.<p>Most businesses fail due to a lack of product-market fit. This has nothing to do with chaos theory or initial conditions. In fact, I&#x27;d say if you have product-market fit, the market tends to be very lenient of initial conditions.<p>&gt; In order to perfectly predict the weather, you’d need incredible amounts of data and an equally overwhelming number of data points and then somehow synthesize that into an accurate prediction.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure that we&#x27;re still not sure if you can even actually predict the weather -- like, ever (we aren&#x27;t sure if Navier–Stokes is smoothly solvable in 3D). All these physics analogies are just shallow and inaccurate.<p>&gt; It’s easy for the takeaway to be human behavior is difficult, business is complex, all data is meaningless, we can’t apply a scientific process at all, let’s wing it. And while there are people who lean heavily on intuition (Gary Vaynerchuk comes to mind) I believe if that’s the takeaway, the pendulum has swung too far out of whack.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why this is &quot;out of whack&quot; -- to me, this seems like a perfectly valid strategy. As I get older, I value intuition more and more. There&#x27;s a reason Warren Buffet&#x27;s moniker is the &quot;Oracle of Omaha.&quot;')
