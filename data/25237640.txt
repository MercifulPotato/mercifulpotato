For years I had a dumb phone, but they started turning off the towers. So now I have a smartphone but I never look at it and forget to take it with me most of the time when I leave the house.<p>I&#x27;d happily downgrade back to a dumb phone if they made any in the old candy bar style. As it is, my desire to have a dumb phone is weaker than my desire not to have a flip phone.')
