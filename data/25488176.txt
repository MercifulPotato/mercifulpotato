I think it’s unnecessary to stoke another flamewar between the two. I may have some doubts with V, mostly with the fact that the language spec for managing memory isn’t clear and the compiler seems incredibly unstable right now - probably would need a few years to be usable for early testers. But I really don’t want that criticism mixed with   any mentioning of Zig since the two aim for different needs.')
