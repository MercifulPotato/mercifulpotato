The most it seems to be able to do is &quot;navigate to X&quot;. I want:<p>- &quot;Take me on the most scenic route to X.&quot; Can&#x27;t you figure that out from social media tags? Simple first order solution: routes that have more photos with more likes = more scenic. Took me 1 minute to think of that. And 1000 engineers at Google couldn&#x27;t implement that? These data crunching tasks are the kind of stuff computers are <i>supposed</i> to be good at.<p>- &quot;Navigate to X but make sure you stay on paved roads.&quot; An actual problem if you are trying to use Google Maps in the back roads of California and don&#x27;t have a 4WD vehicle. Google Maps <i>loves</i> taking you on 4WD dirt road detours. Don&#x27;t you have satellite maps and street view? Can&#x27;t you differentiate paved roads from unpaved ones? What the hell does your machine learning department do?<p>- &quot;Stop at the last grocery store before the highway 120 junction.&quot; Yeah, it doesn&#x27;t even begin to understand this type of query.<p>- &quot;OK Google zoom out the map slightly.&quot; Nope. Sorry.')
