When one needs to resort to bugging the partners phone &quot;for intel&quot; the train has left the station (probably years before).<p>The partner is like an insider-threat from a security pov. Doing OpSec against a spouse is IMO impossible because the whole point of a romantic partner is to have somebody one can trust.<p>Some people will never believe love+trust should be the pillars of a relationship because that&#x27;s not the model&#x2F;framework they learned from their own parents.<p>The expectation is that it&#x27;s only a matter of time for said partner to let them down (like they have seen it by their own parents in childhood). It&#x27;s a self-fulfilling prophecy almost.<p>My ex tried to finish me off by forging signatures on some of my cheques (an old cheque-book she knew belongs to a closed account that book actually should have been destroyed by me), lies-lies-more lies, manipulate our kids with tactics such as repeatedly mentioning events that never happened ... She also became quickly physically violent so I had to call 911 a few times because I was terrified of further escalation (she would attempt to start physical fights by running to the kitchen to grab a knife ...<p>Getting rid of this abuse has costed me the relationship to my kids (they had been told by my spouse I was too lazy to bring them to school when in fact I was having severe PTSD&#x2F;depression, and was not only unable to drive but also unable to walk from my bedroom to the kitchen to prepare a meal).<p>Another example was when I stood across the room making a cup of tea when she started screaming my son&#x27;s name asking him to come quick and help. I was so confused that I didn&#x27;t know what was happening - she literally told him I beat her and she needs his protections when I was at least 9ft away from her. I couldn&#x27;t believe what happened at the time but now many years later know the purpose was to implant false memories. I never beat a woman in my whole life because it goes against everything I stand for. ... I have dozens of little horrible anecdotes just like this ...<p>Some relationship reach a point from which they never return. Others should have never happened in the first place. Hard to tell which is which (or what is healthy or correct) when you&#x27;ve run from abusive parents yourself. The correct (positive) reference model is not missing - it&#x27;s totally incorrect.<p>India adds another twist: arranged marriages do not put value on love+romance before the wedding. It might all fall in place after a while but it&#x27;s not a precondition.')
