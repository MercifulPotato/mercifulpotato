This risk is the straw we all grab to excuse ourselves why we are not acting the way we know we should.<p>If you look at the real world these risks get even invented on the fly (e.g. if we were to accept <i>that</i> immidiately $badthing would happen), so using the terms of the author: We can invent new crony believes with the purpose of protecting other (bigger) crony believes.<p>If you think about conspiracy nuts, their drama lies exactly in the flexibility. Their core crony believe isn&#x27;t e.g. that the earth is flat or that reptilians control politics, but a deeper underlying believe that <i>something</i> is wrong. Which is why they often switch out their myths like other people change their clothes.')
