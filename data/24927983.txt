Item(by='cs02rm0', descendants=None, kids=[24928146, 24928058], score=None, time=1603954550, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24925151, text='<i>When SPA&#x27;s became the norm and even static web pages needed to be build with React</i><p>I&#x27;m in a weird situation where I&#x27;m contracting into one organisation and they&#x27;ve contracted me out to another. The first organisation know me as a senior dev&#x2F;architect with 15 years experience in a niche domain. The second organisation see me as brand new to them and despite paying an embarrassing day rate are giving me noddy UI tweaks to do. Extracting myself is proving to be slow somehow.<p>Anyway, they wanted a webapp with a couple of APIs and nothing on the page than a button, the authenticated username and a line of text. Clicking the button opts you in&#x2F;out of a service and the text changes depending on the state. The sort of thing people go to once, maybe twice.<p>I used a mustache template on the server side to populate the values and I didn&#x27;t even bother with any javascript, just did an old school form submission to the API when the button was clicked and a redirect back to the page.<p>It was <i>tiny</i> but, obviously it was decided &quot;we should be using a more modern framework&quot; - code for React. It was the <i>more</i> word that got to me, as if there was an equivalent, dated framework I&#x27;d used. I didn&#x27;t put up a fight partly because I was new to the team and figured they were hot on React and I wasn&#x27;t. Somehow, they made a complete hash of it, they couldn&#x27;t even figure out how to get all their inline styles (the only styles they used) working without help.<p>I guess it&#x27;s just those classics; people want to learn the hot new thing as they see it, their managers are happy that they&#x27;ve heard a buzzword they recognise and then everything becomes a nail for their new hammer.')
