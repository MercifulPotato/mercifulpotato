I changed jobs every 1.5 years or so, and was able to find a niche in Big Data followed by Real time bidding in ad-tech, and now ML work in one of the FANG’s as a senior engineer.<p>Not many people care about tenure at this point, and working in multiple environments has served me well.  It’s worth calling out that I usually took a pay cut when I switched in order to better align with my career objectives (although the raises always made up for the opportunity cost )<p>I found every opportunity through LinkedIn, along with many that I passed on.  I was always immediately connected with a person (recruiter) rather than a blind resume&#x2F;email response.')
