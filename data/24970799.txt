Most of these deepfakes have obvious places where you can tell they are renders. I think it&#x27;s more important to have tooling that can tell when a video has been altered.<p>I&#x27;m more concerned with the manipulation of grainy low-res video. Police body cameras are an incredibly tool for police departments to fight misinformation (well, only when people watch the whole thing).
