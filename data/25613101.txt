I like changelogs, but even for me a &#x27;we fixed an issue where if you enter a 1025 characters text into the title textbox and press back twice while rotating the phone the app closes&#x27; is probably too much, but if you added a new option to increase the text size please say it, I don&#x27;t want to check all the settings screens each time each app updates, and more often than not someone tells you &#x27;hey, aren&#x27;t you using this option?&#x27; No, no I wasn&#x27;t, because no one told me.<p>Are you a big company and you have automated updates? Why not have an automated checklist of changes too? I&#x27;m sure you have a &#x27;roadmap list&#x27;, so use it.')
