The statement you quote seems to say that Signal must be install on the phone in order to get Signal working on the desktop.  That does not, to me, imply that Signal must be up and running on your phone while you use Signal on the desktop.<p>Suppose I install and configure Signal&#x2F;Phone, then install and configure Signal&#x2F;Desktop, then turn off the phone.<p>Will Signal&#x2F;Desktop still work while the phone is turned off?<p>* If yes, then what you say appears to be wrong.<p>* If no, then that&#x27;s genuinely astonishing to me, and I&#x27;ve learning something.')
