Open a directory that loads slowly (e.g. one with thousands of files on a smb3 mount)<p>2. While the list is loading, select a file (but do not open it)<p>3. Wait for the whole list to load<p>Once the list finishes loading, the file on the very top of the list gets automatically selected (discarding your selection).<p>Thus, if you select a file and click open, in the time between you select and click open, the selection can auto-change and you&#x27;ll end up opening something else than what you&#x27;ve selected.<p>It is this bad.')
