So that when an app imports a library, it type-checks against the original source code of the library.  No need for DTS files from your dependencies!<p>I have never seen this done in practice for a large system.  It&#x27;s not as scalable as using bare-minimum type declarations that you find in DTS files.  It requires more parsing, and potentially more time to accumulate the types.  Whereas DTS emit in TypeScript can flatten the resulting type into the DTS file.<p>But if performance didn&#x27;t matter, I think this would probably work.  And it would eliminate the class of bugs where the generated DTS files are not 100% semantically identical to the original source code.  That&#x27;s another edge-case finding I omitted from the document but hope to write up another day.')
