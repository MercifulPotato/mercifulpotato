I&#x27;m still pretty early on in it, but, so far, I&#x27;ve really been having fun. If you look at it the right way, Smalltalk can almost be seen as more Clojure than Clojure. It&#x27;s even more dynamic, and the live programming environment gives even tighter, more integrated feedback loops than REPL-driven development. Smalltalkers aren&#x27;t exaggerating when they say you can literally program from inside the debugger.<p>A lot of familiar programming idioms from Clojure (and other functional languages) are present in Smalltalk, and have been for years. And, while objects in Smalltalk are nearly as dynamic as maps in Clojure, the fact that they&#x27;re discrete, named entities makes it a <i>lot</i> easier to inspect and grok someone else&#x27;s code.<p>It&#x27;s not all perfect, of course. Some of the usual criticisms of Smalltalk are legitimate (though Pharo is making progress on addressing many of them), and I would like to see more of a culture of discipline around mutability. But, all in all, it&#x27;s largely been a joy to learn.')
