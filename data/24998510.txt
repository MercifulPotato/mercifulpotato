Item(by='fizixer', descendants=None, kids=[24998647], score=None, time=1604586481, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24997000, text='&gt; YC application needs one to clearly articulate who ones target customers are, what they do today, why is it such a pain, and what one is building to solve that pain-point ...<p>Which in my opinion is the hardest part. If you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re selling or not, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re building or not. That comes later.<p>But that&#x27;s not it. How do you know what you&#x27;re doing, or going to do? It doesn&#x27;t happen by sitting down with buddies or co-founders and having a brainstorming session. This is where &#x27;you have to be at the right place and the right time&#x27; but also &#x27;you have to have spent the right amount of time thinking about it&#x27;<p>The right amount of time could be 1 week, or could be 10 years. Yes sometimes you need 10 years to get to the point where when you found a company, you start generating sales within a matter of months.')
