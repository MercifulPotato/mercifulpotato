It&#x27;s been worse. It&#x27;s been freezing cold for hundreds of millions of years. It&#x27;s been blazing hot for hundreds of millions of years. No one is claiming that this is either new or dangerous for the planet. It&#x27;s neither of that.<p>It is however potentially fatal for our global civilization. Since the early 70ies, the climate models have been pretty spot on. Especially before climate change denialism (to protect profit margins) turned climate sciences into a hot potato, mainstream predictions have been pretty good.<p>Now, its not that a few degrees warmer temperature is going to kill people. At least not many. But with rising temperatures, people will start doing what they&#x27;ve been doing since the dawn of time when things got uncomfortable in one place; they start moving and migrating. And do you know what no country with static borders is good at dealing with? Moving populations and migrations.<p>That always causes chaos and turmoil.<p>Then there&#x27;s the trouble with water; as soon as the weather patterns start changing because of anthropogenic climate change, we&#x27;ll have conflicts about water. In some parts of the world this has already started. China is currently doing a lot of projects with &quot;its&quot; streams and is redirecting a lot of water. Much to the chagrin of it&#x27;s southern neighbors.<p>Another source of troubles.<p>And then, finally, is our flailing ecosystem which has been under massive attack for the last 250 years and is -- slowly but surely -- crumbling under the weight of a sheer 8 billion people wanton for food and shelter. Not for nothing we&#x27;ve lost almost 60% of insects in the last 50 years and almost half of the animal populations; impending ecosystem collapse.<p>Fun times ahead!')
