We could make a compiler that takes something that resembles a for loop and changes it to be correct, but to do so would strip a programmer of the power to make something similar to but not quite a for loop, which would generally be undesirable in a programming language.<p>&quot;I go store&quot; is reasonably close to correct: you have a subject, predicate, and object and there is one meaning that fits far better than all others. However switch it up to &quot;I store food&quot; and now you have some ambiguity: are you saying you are storing food for later or are you saying you want to go to a grocery store or are you trying to talk about the food you purchased at the store? Again, a human being incredibly intelligent might be able to tell from context, analogous to how someone reviewing a block of code might recognize what a block of code is supposed to be doing, but in general you could expect the interpreter to raise an error, either of the form &quot;bad syntax&quot; or &quot;sorry, I&#x27;m not sure what you mean.&quot;<p>If we consider &quot;human languages&quot; like legalese or diplomatic language, where the goal as with programming languages is to limit ambiguity as much as possible while maintaining the speaker&#x27;s ability to potentially say as many things as possible, syntax becomes very important, and typically it&#x27;s preferred that the interpreter raise an error rather than try to guess at the speaker&#x27;s intentions.')
