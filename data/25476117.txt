There&#x27;s a crazy amount of side missions and all missions support different outcomes depending on how you play. Skyrim I personally find frustrating because almost all missions are just shallow fetch&#x2F;kill quests, even compared to Oblivion, Skyrim has loads of content and very little of it is interesting at all.')
