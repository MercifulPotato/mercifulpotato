And I will do it with a single question. I am so certain of the defendant&#x27;s guilt, I move that the court adjourn so that your Honor can begin deliberating on the sentence.&quot;<p>JUDGE: &quot;Mr Greenwald, we need to establish the facts of the matter first.&quot;<p>GLENN GREENWALD: &quot;That will be a breeze your Honor. A fleeting diversion from the matter at hand. I can prove the defendant&#x27;s guilt with... One. Simple. Question. Like that! <i>snaps fingers</i>. But, more importantly, I think that forty to life is commensurate with the crime.&quot;<p>JUDGE: &quot;The evidence, Mister Greenwald. I believe you said you had a question about evidence?&quot;<p>GLENN GREENWALD: &quot;Of course, your Honor. Of course. And let me just say I have the victim&#x27;s children in the court today, to see justice done. You wouldn&#x27;t want to not do justice in front of the victim&#x27;s children would you, your Honor? Look, little Timmy is waving.&quot; (Glenn waves toward the rear of the court).<p>JUDGE: &quot;That appears.. <i>Adjusts glasses and peers intently</i> That appears to be a waving tube man, similar to the one outside the Carpet Salesroom down the block...&quot;<p>GLENN GREENWALD: (Hurriedly) &quot;Be that as it may, your Honor, to the matter of sentenc-&quot;<p>JUDGE:&quot;It even says Carpet Warehouse on the sleeve.&quot;<p>GLENN GREENWALD: &quot;I... uh...&quot;<p>JUDGE:&quot;Mr Greenwald. MISTER GREENWALD! (Bangs gavel) Did you steal this homonculus from the Carpet Warehouse?&quot;<p>GLENN GREENWALD: (rushes up and snatches gavel) &quot;Bailiff, remove Timmy Victim from the court.&quot;<p>JUDGE: (Stares silently at Greenwald coldly for a heartbeat) &quot;I believe you had a question for the defendant?&quot;<p>GLENN GREENWALD: &quot;Yes, one that will-&quot;<p>JUDGE: &quot;And your entire case of guilt is based on this one question which will prove the case (He consults his notes) &#x27;Like that!&#x27;?&quot; (Snaps fingers)<p>GLENN GREENWALD: &quot;Yes, I uh-&quot;<p>JUDGE: &quot;The question, Mr Greenwald.&quot;<p>GLENN GREENWALD:&quot;I... Uh... did you-&quot;<p>JUDGE: &quot;Address the defendant, Mr Greenwald. I am not on trial here.&quot;<p>GLENN GREENWALD: &quot;Defendant. Did you... on the night in question... did you kill the victim?&quot;<p>DEFENDANT: (Leans forward, lips close to the microphone) &quot;No.&quot;<p>GLENN GREENWALD: &quot;Well fuck. I&#x27;m all outta ideas.&quot;')
