Intel relied on anti-competitive practices to lock AMD out of the desktop and server markets. They were successfully sued by AMD but the damage was done. Then Intel sat on it&#x27;s laurels and quit innovating, slowly doling out incremental improvements through their &#x27;tick-tock&#x27; release cycle. Intel dug their own hole and I have no sympathy for Intel while AMD buries them in it.')
