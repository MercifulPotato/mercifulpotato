It&#x27;s funny, when I bought it I only went with 8GB ram because I figured I would replace it in 2 years-ish. It has served me well, but, it&#x27;s struggling with only 8GB these days. Now I&#x27;m ready for 32GB, because I&#x27;m planning on keeping the next one for another 5 years. Let&#x27;s hope the 14&quot; MackBook Pro in 2021 (with mini-LED secreen) rumors have legs to it. Hoping this is only the interim state of the 13&quot; Pro and is due to really needing a different ARM cpu that is not available yet.')
