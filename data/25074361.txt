That said, I admire their honesty, and I hope these results suggest other kinds of experiments to other researchers. Maybe the study just needs to be larger, or longer.<p>Focusing on specific kinds of mortality might also give stronger results than measuring &quot;all cause&quot; mortality. I say that because it seems like cancer was the biggest killer in these groups. I am not a doctor, but I wouldn&#x27;t have thought cancer was causally related to (lack of) exercise, the way cardiovascular diseases are believed to be. I&#x27;d be interested to see larger studies with enough non-cancer deaths to say something statistically significant about the effect of exercise on those outcomes.')
