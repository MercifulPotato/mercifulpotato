It has the flavor of an inorganic smear campaign that has been absorbed repeatedly and unconsciously across social media.  It&#x27;s a common pattern for a post about an anti-establishemt figure to have some positive comments about them, but then some critique inevitably bubbles to the top of thread every time.')
