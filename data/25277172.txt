You took a ferry from Detroit or Amherstburg, Ontario to get there and back. It shut down when I was 12, so my sisters who are all younger never got the chance to experience it, which makes me feel both sad and lucky to have had the chance.<p>It&#x27;s now a private island with a few streets of residential homes. We went back to take some photos last year. It was cool but haunting to see some remnants still there just rusting away (no rides, just a dance hall and some other structures). Feels kind of like a dream at this point.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atlasobscura.com&#x2F;places&#x2F;boblo-island-abandoned-amusement-park" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atlasobscura.com&#x2F;places&#x2F;boblo-island-abandoned-a...</a>')
