Item(by='nfriedly', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609643848, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25613244, text='For LG monitors, the business version, when available, is identical hardware but with a longer warranty, often for about the same price. But, you can&#x27;t trust their listed specs if they differ from the consumer model.<p>For example, the 34BK95U-W is identical to the 34WK95U-W except for the longer warranty. However, LG&#x27;s website claimed the B varraint supported a 75hz refresh rate when I got it, but it only supports 60hz, same as the consumer model.<p>Similarly, LG&#x27;s 43MU79-B only supports 7.5W of power output on the USB-C port despite <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lg.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;business&#x2F;desktop-monitors&#x2F;lg-43MU79-B" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lg.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;business&#x2F;desktop-monitors&#x2F;lg-43MU79-B</a> <i>still</i> claiming it supports &quot;60W PD&quot;. In reality, it&#x27;s identical to the 43UD79-B. (I notified them of this over a year ago, but they don&#x27;t seem to care enough to correct it.)<p>Shit like that makes me want to avoid LG entirely.')
