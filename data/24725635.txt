In doing so, Google copied the elaborately organized taxonomy of all the names of methods, classes, interfaces, and packages — the &quot;overall system of organized names — covering 37 packages, with over six hundred classes, with over six thousand methods.&quot; Copyrightability Decision, 872 F.Supp.2d at 999. The parties and district court referred to this taxonomy of expressions as the &quot;structure, sequence, and organization&quot; or &quot;SSO&quot; of the 37 packages.</i><p>The Baker ruling is specifically addressed in that one, and they call out exactly how it is relevant to Oracle v. Google: The Baker precedent says that the parts of a design that are strictly essential to its function are not copyrightable. But the parts that involve some art - such as - according to this opinion - the taxonomy introduced in a package structure - <i>are</i> copyrightable.<p>In other words, you can think of SSO as shorthand for, &quot;The things that aren&#x27;t covered by the <i>Baker</i> precedent.&quot;<p>We also have, in the same opinion:<p><i>When assessing whether the non-literal elements of a computer program constitute protectable expression, the Ninth Circuit has endorsed an &quot;abstraction-filtration-comparison&quot; test formulated by the Second Circuit and expressly adopted by several other circuits. ... This test rejects the notion that anything that performs a function is necessarily uncopyrightable.</i><p>(Disclaimer: This is not meant to imply that I think that Judge O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s 2014 opinion is the final word on the case. I&#x27;m just picking some highlights from an opinion on this case that might shed some light on how the Courts are approaching the issue.)<p>(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.leagle.com&#x2F;decision&#x2F;infco20140509135" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.leagle.com&#x2F;decision&#x2F;infco20140509135</a>)')
