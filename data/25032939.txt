It says it in the title, that’s it. Bait.<p>What it actually says is plant breeding and other agricultural practices caused the nutritional decline.  You breed plants for storage, transport, and yield, this is what you get.  Large woody or watery plants that don’t taste as good and are diluted.  Fruits picked unripe and enormous vegetables that stay fresh for weeks means less value.<p>It doesn’t seem to have much at all to do with the soil quality going down over decades and more to do with industrial food distribution.')
