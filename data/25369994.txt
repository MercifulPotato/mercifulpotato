Not a smoking gun, of course, but anyways I think your logical fallacy here is the &quot;reasonableness&quot; heuristic, in which you base the likelihood of some incredibly unlikely event on whether you can &quot;imagine&quot; some scenario where it happened. The fact that you can come up with a story to explain... well, I don&#x27;t even know exactly what you&#x27;re explaining, because it&#x27;s really just a fragment of a chain of causation which has been mostly left unsaid. But anyways, I&#x27;m willing to wager that you know very little about disease transmission patterns so your intuition here is worse than ignorance.')
