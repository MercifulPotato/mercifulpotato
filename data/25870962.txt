More people using the open source projects works better for us as it provides free mind share, testing and feedback. For RH selling subscription for a popular&#x2F;stable open source project is a way easier problem than a project which has no mind share. That being said sometimes it is very difficult to maintain projects and branches for external contribution depending upon the scope of project and the development workflow we use for it. It is very common scene in open source projects where contributors does not maintain the documentation etc properly for easy on boarding. I can go on for long time why it is not easy to do and we should improve on it for sure.')
