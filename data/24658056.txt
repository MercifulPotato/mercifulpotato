(ie what comes next after infection). There is so little data we are flying blind (again).<p>That said, there is evidence that the other coronaviruses that caused epidemics (SARS and MERS) can cause clinically meaningful myocarditis and heart failure as a result. <i>In vitro</i> and autopsy evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects myocardial cells. So it&#x27;s plausible that there will be some cardiac sequelae of COVID, perhaps in many patients or maybe just in those at high risk. We just don&#x27;t know. Assuming that myocarditis will be a major problem because 2 uncontrolled studies said so is as silly as assuming hydroxychloroquine works because of similar strength of evidence. But dismissing it out of hand (which I&#x27;m not suggesting GP is doing) is not smart either. We should be appropriately skeptical, but need to investigate further.')
