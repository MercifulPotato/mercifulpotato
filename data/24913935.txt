The Nix language is also the higher level, though not that high level.<p>The actual &quot;meat and potatoes&quot; of Nix is the derivation graph. I think&#x2F;hope Bazel has an equivalent, but I&#x27;m not sure how exposed it is (advertise your layering, people!). This derivation graph is simple simple as hell---each derivation is a path to an exe, arvgv, environ, etc., and derivations output paths and can depend on the outputs of derivation. This is what Meson&#x2F;CMake&#x2F;etc. should learn to output.')
