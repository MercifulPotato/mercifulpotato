I don&#x27;t think this is materially different from models like Humble Bundle, which feature vastly discounted prices for games.<p>Addendum: People looking at &quot;free&quot; and thinking &quot;you don&#x27;t have to pay for them!&quot; makes me feel both old and pessimistic.<p>Is the &quot;free as in speech, not as in beer&quot; thing just a byline at this point? I remember reading about it and being pretty excited by the concept ~15 years ago, and it seems that it was pretty common in the software industry to understand the distinction; <i>especially</i> in the context of the FSF.')
