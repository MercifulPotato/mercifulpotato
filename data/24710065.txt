I have a degree and pretty much everybody I ever worked with has a degree. Looking around the entire floor there&#x27;s only one person without a degree I am aware of.<p>It&#x27;s a myth that you can work without a degree, you&#x27;d never get a job interview in the first place. Seems to be mostly a US myth by the way, makes sense because degrees are crazy expensive there.')
