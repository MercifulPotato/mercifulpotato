Item(by='jbermudes', descendants=None, kids=[25984566], score=None, time=1612141871, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25984207, text='The Japanese slang terms for the NES&#x2F;SNES are &quot;Famicom&quot; and &quot;Sufami&quot; respectively. HAL Laboratories may not have felt that those terms would make for a good protagonist name, especially since the characters are supposed to be American with American sounding names (like Jeff and Paula). But &quot;Ness&quot; is an anagram of SNES and is similar enough to other English names like Jess, Jeff, etc. But it&#x27;s important to note that in Earthbound, the name Ness is not so much the default name as it is the first of the suggested names if you &quot;Don&#x27;t Care&quot; what the protagonist&#x27;s name is. In the Japanese manual in fact, the Ness character&#x27;s title is &quot;Me&quot; and in parenthesis it says &quot;Nesu&quot; and Jeff, Paula, and Poo are named Friends 1, 2, and 3. [1]<p>So even though NES might not have been a term known to the general Japanes public, it didn&#x27;t need to be. Ness is not the intended name of the character, it is only the most common suggested name and hence more like an easter egg.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;motherforever.net&#x2F;official-artwork-of-mother-2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;motherforever.net&#x2F;official-artwork-of-mother-2&#x2F;</a>')
