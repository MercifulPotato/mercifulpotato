Drivers chose to work them in a fair economic transaction (I will trade my time for $X). They can choose to no longer work these jobs the same way that they didn&#x27;t work them when they didn&#x27;t exist. When they do this, and they eventually will, supply for these jobs will dry up and wages will naturally rise.')
