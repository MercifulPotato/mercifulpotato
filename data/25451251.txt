Item(by='ChuckMcM', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608168940, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25449122, text='Well they could buy space on Falcon9&#x27;s :-) Internet Service is a known way to generate cash.<p>But that said, BO seems to be an &quot;announcements&quot; company and not a &quot;doing things&quot; company, which is sad. The former relates to research and good ideas, the latter relates to execution of said ideas. I&#x27;ve met one engineer who used to work there and their experience was not particularly positive but it was also anecdotal so I don&#x27;t give it a lot of weight.<p>What I do give weight to are seeing results. This is something SpaceX has lately excelled at and BO has not. It seemed like they were &quot;ahead&quot; of Virgin Galactic on the &quot;Suborbital Tourists &#x2F; Minting Astronauts&quot; thing but now VG seems to be a couple of proof flights away from their first customers. Then they seemed to be ahead of SpaceX&#x27;s efforts to get the Raptor engine going but the BE-4 stalled (although it seemed to unstall[1] as well). Not that SpaceX&#x27;s time lines vs announcements are that much better but SpaceX seems to be getting over the finish line more often. As a result I wonder sometimes what is going on over at BO.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;ula-chief-says-the-be-4-rocket-engines-turbopump-issues-are-resolved&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;ula-chief-says-the-b...</a>')
