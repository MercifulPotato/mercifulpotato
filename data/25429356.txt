Item(by='mjburgess', descendants=None, kids=[25429457], score=None, time=1608032659, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25429316, text='&gt; our basic assumption is not that everything is an ape.\n&gt; great intellectual feats<p>I think it is, exactly, a feat of the imagination to arrive an an explanation which does not require this premise.<p>But it is not our <i>default</i> presumption. Hence 100,000 years of superstition, and 500 years of rare scientific moments.<p>Concepts seeming abstract, is in some sense, a bit of an illusion. Concepts are, in my view, always psychomotor. They succeed in &quot;abstracting&quot; from our bodies, sure, by metaphor. But the genealogy of that metaphor is the psychomotor system of an ape.<p>Consider your words: injection, drop, beat, oscillate... these are about how our bodies behave in (with, towards) our environment; and become &quot;abstracted&quot;.<p>I think there is something quite fundamentally apeish when we think of a song <i>dropping</i> a beat, in the sense that our relatedness to the song is actually facilitated by an apeish psychomotor state of &quot;dropping something&quot;.<p>Yes, we <i>can</i> reduce our engagement with some phenomenon to a purely cognitive model (pieces and their relations); but that is very hard, and typically is only useful is narrowly solving known problems.<p>Innovation (, creativity, etc.), including the scientific, relies quite heavily on our being able to impart to alien things some intuitive apishness which we then, at best, abstract away.<p>Many of course cannot perform this final abstraction. Which is why we speak of &quot;The Economy&quot; and other such apelike characters of the imagination.')
