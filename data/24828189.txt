(I&#x27;m part of the CS team)\nI&#x27;ll try to address some few questions.<p>1&#x2F; You don&#x27;t have to communicate. If you don&#x27;t, you get a modern, fast, decoupled fail2ban with many various remediations (instead of just drop) and observability. What you don&#x27;t get though are the IPs spotted by the crowd and curated by us. You don&#x27;t contribute, you don&#x27;t get them, fair. If you contribute, only offending IP &#x2F; timestamp &#x2F; scenario triggered are sent back to us to establish what we call a consensus (to avoid false positives and poisoning)<p>2&#x2F; We are super vigilant and sensitive about privacy. We made the architecture and many other crucial points compatible with GDPR (EU Law framework regarding private data handling)<p>3&#x2F; IP sent: We could hash it, but it&#x27;s very easy to reverse. Maybe have a public&#x2F;private key encryption, quite a good point, I&#x27;ll tell the team, thx.<p>4&#x2F; You can contribute scenario in YAML or data source connectors in Grok. We are not hardcore for or against any language, but Go allows portability (we&#x27;ll release Win &amp; Macos binaries) and is container friendly, plus super fast, easy to read and scalable. Ever since we released, tons of proposal were made to port it to a &#x27;real&#x27; language, sorry we are fine with that choice, no intent to change, no intent to convert anyone either ;)<p>5&#x2F; Herd immunity is what we want to create indeed. We tried to explain the combination of Behavior + Reputation by using an analogy with Waze. It worked but is less accurate. I prefer the one with Immune system.<p>We are available for direct dialog on gitter. allow just some delays depending on your time zone, we are based in France, so CEST.
