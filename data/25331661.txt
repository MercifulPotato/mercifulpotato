I.e. machine learning algorithms become increasingly used in a majority of industries and require well-designed infrastructure to provide fast calculation speeds. And solutions like GPU or FPGA accelerators become more and more used in resource-heavy computations.<p>I was wondering whether there are any successful startups in the field offering B2B acceleration services?')
