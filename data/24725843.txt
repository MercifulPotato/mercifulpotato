It formalizes the reason you don&#x27;t like the FB login requirement.<p>It is abuse of market power on both sides of the FB&#x2F;Oculus coin to enforce use of their ecosystem.  The market power of FB is obvious, so even if they are using it only to drive a few more ppl to create FB accts by buying Oculus, it is an abuse.  Doesn&#x27;t require Oculus to have much power.<p>Considering FB &amp; Zuckerberg&#x27;s long history of abusing privacy, predating even Facebook back to Facemash (which scraped Harvard students&#x27; photos from an online directory and set students to rank for hotness), and then Zuck either saying &quot;sorry&quot; or attempting to rewrite history, it seems the House is on the right track here.')
