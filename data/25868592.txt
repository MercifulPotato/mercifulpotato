Twitter locked out the New York Post for reporting on the Hunter Biden story before the election.<p>What this appears to be about now is that the backlash from that sort of behavior was enough to cause a right-leaning social media site to become popular, and it continuing to grow in popularity would prevent them from doing similar things going forward.')
