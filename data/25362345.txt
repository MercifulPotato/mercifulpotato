It’s especially flagrant by the constant bashing of royal era, and constant praise of the republic with important facts conveniently untold like the Vendée massacre. I like reading things about history on Wikipedia, and things are a lot more nuanced than that. And like with Santa Klaus, once you know you’ve been fooled, you wonder about what else they lied... and why.')
