Trumpism is breaking apart the Reagan coalition of economic liberalizers and social conservatives. George Soros would have been part of the Reagan coalition, but Trump feeds resentment that economic liberalizers in the 80s, 90s, and 2000s forced social conservatives to take the shorter end of the stick. A lot of people online think Soros &amp; his foundation are purely for identity politics, but he&#x27;s more of a Popper partisan than anything else.')
