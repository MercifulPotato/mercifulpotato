If you can&#x27;t apply the same empathy you have towards customers to your own people, you burn them out.<p>Strongly agree that empathy for the team is important, but I will also say that I&#x27;m increasingly seeing junior managers (product or otherwise) become so focused on pleasing their team that they lose track of shipping product that customers will pay for. The problem is compounded in over-funded startups or cash-rich companies where the financial pressure to ship and sell product has become so abstracted away that people forget what the real goal is (sell product, generate revenue).<p>It&#x27;s a balance. Managers obviously need to work with, not against, their team. However, managers also need to be able to make the tough decisions and understand how to motivate their teams to do the work that needs to be done, even if it&#x27;s not exactly the work that people most want to do.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve had to talk multiple people out of writing complex React-based SPAs for simple features that could be shipped more quickly as basic static sites. I&#x27;ve also worked at companies that suffered greatly because they chose to rewrite otherwise functional core software in new, fun languages because it&#x27;s what the developers loved doing. A large part of being a manager is focusing people on developing the right things, even if it&#x27;s not the most fun and intrinsically motivating thing that the engineers <i>want</i> to do.')
