So some of my own code is doing memory-mapped I&#x2F;O to hardware, inline microcontroller ASM, or other stuff that can&#x27;t physically happen on the system running the unit tests.  So mocks (or fakes, it doesn&#x27;t matter much here) are necessary to avoid running hardware-specific code on the wrong hardware.<p>Of course I try to make those fakes at as low a level as possible, but there&#x27;s still a substantial part of my code that can&#x27;t be unit tested, and needs test programs in the actual firmware to check it.')
