Because of course, you couldn&#x27;t have a deterrent if you weren&#x27;t able to launch during a communication blackout.   Of course that also meant that any given accident or misunderstanding could lead to a launch and full scale response.   Control of starting the war was now in the hands of folks with even less information...<p>MADD seems to guarantee a war as much as deter it.')
