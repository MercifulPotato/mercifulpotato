The patients received 11 hours of professional therapy. The psilocybin was used as an adjunct.<p>The theory is that psilocybin increases suggestibility and openness to new ideas, making the therapy easier to integrate.<p>Note that increasing suggestibility isn&#x27;t a universally positive trait, especially for people doing ad-hoc dosing alone without therapy. In fact, it&#x27;s uncommon to hear &quot;bad trip&quot; stories where people end up in prolonged depressive or anxious episodes following a trip.<p>There is no evidence here that taking psychedelics without therapy is positive for patients, so it&#x27;s extremely unlikely that dosing someone who is sedated or in a coma would have any effect.')
