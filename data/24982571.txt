IANAL(inguist), but it sort looks like this:<p>Russian has progressed&#x2F;evolved more than many of the other Slavic languages (due to more speakers, being a part of an empire etc.). So there are significant differences between Russian and most other Slavic languages (even the closest ones, Ukranian and Belorussian). These differences are everywhere: in word forms, tenses, stress, pronunciation etc.<p>Many other Slavic languages (especially Balkanian) retain a lot of forms, sounds, meanings that are archaic by Russian standards: anything from Bulgarian `ъ` sound which disappeared from Russian centuries ago, to words like `лепа` (beautiful) in Serbian which hasn&#x27;t been used in Russian for over a century, to words like Polish `uroda` (beauty) which switched its meaning to mean &quot;ugly&quot; in Russian.<p>And the list goes on: locative and vocative cases exist in Serbian, haven&#x27;t existed in Russian for a long time; definiteness of Macedonian and Bulgarian hasn&#x27;t existed in Russian for a long time, if ever; etc. etc.<p>So all in all, other Slavic speakers have a higher chance and luck understanding Russian speakers, than Russian speakers other Slavik languages.')
