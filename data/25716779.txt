I am sorry but if you really want to convince me&#x2F;someone something isn&#x27;t propaganda Adrian Zenz isn&#x27;t the person to link. He is ultra religious and wrote some questional material before he felt &quot;lead by God&quot; against China, and has had quite a few times were we spread fake news.<p>I find it weird to denounce one as propaganda but not look into who wrote this. A lot of the anti China sources are based on his or US and&#x2F;or weapon manufacturers funded sources.')
