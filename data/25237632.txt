They are a very fine gauge, done with complex colourwork and some have a short row heel, which necessitates the purl stitch. These complexities suggest that knitting is even older than the archeological record can prove.”</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knitty.com&#x2F;ISSUEspring06&#x2F;FEAThistory101.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;knitty.com&#x2F;ISSUEspring06&#x2F;FEAThistory101.html</a>:<p><i>“Linguistically, all evidence implies that knitting is a fairly recent invention. There are no ancient legends of knitting like there are legends of spinning and weaving (remember Arachne? Ixzaluoh? Nephthys? Amaterasu? Never mind... the numbers of weaving and spinning gods and mostly goddesses are legion). There are no ancient gods or goddesses who knit, no legend of how it was invented or given by the gods. That lack implies that it is a recent skill, developed after mythologies were established around the world.\n[…]\nSo what do we know? Knitting kind of appeared, poof, probably in Egypt or an adjoining land, sometime around 1000CE”</i><p>⇒ it’s not a given that knitting existed in Roman times.<p>(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Roman_dodecahedron" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Roman_dodecahedron</a> dates them to the 2nd to 4th centuries AD)')
