Yes. For example, when I first read Martin Fowler&#x27;s book Refactoring, I had been renaming variables and moving methods from one class to another for years. But he gave a new framework for thinking about something that obvious. I&#x27;ve found the idea of separating out my coding flow between adding functionality and improving code really helpful.<p>Can you get the material for free? Almost always, yes. But it takes time to find the right material, and our time is valuable. A typical industry book is $40-$50, and a typical text book is $100-$150. The authors of these books have spent time organizing the material in a helpful way that you would otherwise need to spend.<p>For some topics though, it&#x27;s not just a matter of time savings. I&#x27;m working on a topic now that doesn&#x27;t really have many useful books, so I&#x27;m having to read technical specifications produced by industry groups, which lack context and are pretty opaque. I&#x27;m missing having a book that explains these ideas in a coherent fashion.<p>I have tried a few MOOCs for professional development. I&#x27;ve found they can be helpful for a superficial understanding, but they don&#x27;t encourage the deep understanding I get from reading through a book.')
