Scheduler flow control is different from a more conventional masks approach.<p>The underlying implementation is still just lane masking and walking down separate flow control branches sequentially of course.<p>The advantage of such a model however is that the complexity of this is abstracted away from even the compiler. This makes it a change in the programming model. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not _just_ named SIMD.<p>(I fear that this discussion went too far away arguing semantics... sigh)')
