Now we have multiple free, high-quality sources of information that are far easier to access than libraries ever were, for example, Wikipedia or the many sites where people share their literary works for free.\nThis is not an attempt to belittle books or libraries - both are still important resources. They are simply not the only show in town anymore, so if they weren&#x27;t grandfathered in and someone tried to create libraries today, there would be obvious arguments against doing so, besides pure profit.')
