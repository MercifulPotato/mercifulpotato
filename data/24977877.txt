Item(by='Netcob', descendants=None, kids=[24978457, 24982887], score=None, time=1604394826, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24976314, text='I checked, and they are still selling knives. Sure, you can use a knife to cut food or walk through the woods pretending to be a &quot;survivalist&quot; (judging from my search for &quot;knives&quot;), but it can also be used to murder people.<p>But also checked &quot;TVs&quot;, and they are absolutely still selling those. TVs are like the number one item used for infringement. I am VERY confused.<p>And don&#x27;t get me started about food. Without food, it&#x27;s basically impossible to infringe, yet ebay allows all sorts of food listings.')
