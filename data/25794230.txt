I don&#x27;t envy single people...I don&#x27;t doubt they intentionally make it difficult to get a date now if you&#x27;re not paying.<p>I wonder how sustainable the boost dynamics are. It does make things a bit pay to play. You sell out the integrity of your game long-term in order for short-term gains. It might take people a while to move on to something new, but they eventually will. OkCupid eventually lost mindshare to Tinder and Bumble.<p>With pay to play is that the players who pay aren&#x27;t necessarily the best players, per s√©. They&#x27;re just the whales most financially and likely psychologically involved. The more I describe this, the more disturbed I am thinking about how the Bumble and OnlyFans attention economies really work. The whole thing just seems like a skinner box designed to psychologically and physiologically prey on humans in isolation. To harvest their sexual instincts and sell it back to them with interest. It&#x27;s cruel.<p>Nevertheless, as they say, there&#x27;s nothing novel about human nature going on here, and none of the fundamental dynamics are really changing. Maybe the most disturbing part is how little has actually changed.')
