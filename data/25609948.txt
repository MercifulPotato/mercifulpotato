Open discussion and well founded criticism is what makes me read the comments.<p>I actually was searching for a response to GP claims about prison not being a deterrent and if nobody had mentioned it would commented it myself.<p>To add to the arguments: GP even contradicts himself by stating how bad prison is and that you really don&#x27;t want to be there while claiming it&#x27;s not a deterrent.<p>Criticizing that point was absolutely fair and doesn&#x27;t mean the rest of GP&#x27;s comment is bad or untrue.')
