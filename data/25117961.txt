Sheet music is very expressive. So is MIDI. It’s kind of like asking, “What information isn’t captured in the movie but is captured in the novel?” They’re just radically different ways of expressing music, and much is lost when you translate from one to the other.<p>If you are curious, try flipping through a book on orchestration at the library sometime, or a book on music theory. Even at its most basic, a score records which notes to play, but MIDI doesn’t even do that—MIDI records the note values only, so you can’t tell the difference between G# and Ab. Then add in all the articulations, dynamics, and arbitrary instructions that a composer can put into a score.')
