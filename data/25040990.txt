The cochlea itself is a physical FT, based on resonances in the thickness at various points. That gets passed to the brain as basically sine-frequency data. The autocorrelation part comes in when the brain processes this and actually reinforces it by feeding back signals it thinks are peaking back into the inner ear.<p>(Edit) also this is a really fascinating and enlightening way of viewing it - didn’t mean to imply otherwise with this quibble :)')
