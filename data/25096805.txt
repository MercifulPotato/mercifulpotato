Among late-stage startups, it seems highly regarded and its employees&#x27; options are likely to hold real value in the not-so-distant future.<p>But generally I think the OP is correct: working for FAANG has made many, many people far more money over the past decade than they would have otherwise made on average in a startup.<p>I suspect that eventually the tide will turn, as it always does. The companies will get middle-manager bloat, MBAs and accountants start pinching pennies, systems get dragged down in technical debt, and more nimble competitors eventually outcompete. But we&#x27;re not there yet.')
