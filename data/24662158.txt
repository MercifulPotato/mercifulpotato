The speed at which we need to reduce emissions simply dwarfs anything technology has ever achieved - not to mention the fact that so far, technological progress has always had the net effect of adding to GHG emissions.<p>Let&#x27;s take the example of the digital industry. Arguably, it&#x27;s shown the most impressive trajectory of energy efficiency, with an exponential growth sustained over many decades, roughly gaining 3 orders of magnitude every 16 years (See Koomey&#x27;s law: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Koomey%27s_law#:~:text=Koomey&#x27;s%20law%20describes%20a%20trend,doubled%20about%20every%201.57%20years.&amp;text=A%20doubling%20every%20two%20and,fold%20increase%22%2C%20Koomey%20wrote" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Koomey%27s_law#:~:text=Koomey&#x27;...</a>.).<p>But overall, what&#x27;s the currently worst-offending industry in terms of GHG emissions &#x2F; energy consumption growth? The digital industry! Our unmoderated consumption grows even faster than energy efficiency gains, to the point that it&#x27;s the <i>only</i> major industry in which the energy intensity of added value is <i>increasing</i>.<p>(Many sources here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theshiftproject.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;lean-ict-2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theshiftproject.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;lean-ict-2&#x2F;</a>)<p>We do need a lot of technological investments, but the narrative that says this will be sufficient is a very dangerous mirage. Please, be responsible, do your research, and don&#x27;t spread ignorance - our children will have to bear the burden.')
