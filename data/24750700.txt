It physically and metaphorically swallowed me up.<p>To hear and see another person describe that, the feelings, the visuals of the forests of kelp. In a way I feel as though the ocean saved some part of me, but that almost seemed silly. Then suddenly no, someone to share that with. It somehow made my love and incredible experiences even more real.<p>Free diving is one of the most peaceful and fulfilling things I’ve ever experienced. It has changed so many things about myself and the way I live.<p>Someone else mentioned it was an indulgent documentary, and I agree I guess. I also think that’s kind of inevitable - the experience of immersing yourself in such an engaging, in a sense isolating, peaceful place is quite indulgent on its own. The story is largely focused on a single person doing this thing. But it’s beautiful nonetheless. I really loved it and felt it was a story well worth telling.<p>There’s something about the life in the ocean being so foreign and strange, yet so vital, familiar, and oddly comfortable to be in and around. Some dives I wish I could just stay forever - like that’s where I belong. Nothing can describe the deep realization that the earth is absolutely covered in stunning beauty, so much of it unseen. The story of this octopus to me is like a shining sliver of that. Just a brief but stunning glimpse of something incredible that you’d otherwise never have considered.')
