Maybe it was my familiarity with Chrome but overall I still think Chrome has better UX defaults.<p>Which is mostly because you&#x27;re more familiar with Chrome overall (and it&#x27;s also a matter of taste). As an example, I strongly dislike the downloads &quot;bar&quot; in chrome and the fact that bookmark&#x2F;history&#x2F;downloads pages are pages and not dialogs. Many people dislike dialogs tho, because they seem bloated and difficult to use to them.<p>One small UI gimmick I&#x27;d like to see implemented in major browsers (at least on macOS) is an option to use the fluent&#x2F;vibrant blur tab bar background instead of the default white&#x2F;gray&#x2F;black. Firefox already kinda does that (at least when using the dark theme), but I still have to write my own userchrome.css to get the full effect.')
