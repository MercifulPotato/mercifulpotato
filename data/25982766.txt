But every player in the system must choose for every action whether to do that action or not. The actions they choose will either conform to the morals or they will not, so in the end just like the individual people that comprise them, companies are (mostly) either good or bad. Thereâ€™s nothing that says a company, even a publicly-traded one, must not exist for anything but profit.')
