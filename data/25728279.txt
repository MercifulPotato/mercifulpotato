That&#x27;s what people hang up on?<p>The point for that particular gripe was this: &quot;this allows a programmer reading Haskell code to look only at type signatures when getting a sense of what a certain piece of code does.&quot;<p>Yes, IO tells that ... the function does some side effects. And that&#x27;s <i>it</i>. If your type signature is `Int -&gt; Int -&gt; IO Bool`, it&#x27;s just as useless as `Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool`, and requires you to read the function to understand what it actually does.<p>Is it helpful to see at a glance which functions produce side effects and which don&#x27;t? Yes, it is. Does it automagically &quot;allow a programmer reading Haskell code to look only at type signatures when getting a sense of what a certain piece of code does&quot;? No, no, it doesn&#x27;t. `... -&gt; IO Bool` may be launching nukes for all the information you glean from its type signature.')
