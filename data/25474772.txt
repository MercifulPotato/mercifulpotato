I don&#x27;t want to &quot;steal&quot; content, I want to restrict the number of ways I can be influenced to view it. And &quot;high quality content&quot; is often <i>not</i> the case here; I have to get through a lot of crap to get to real news in a lot of cases. There is also the problem of who gets to judge quality - often those that tell people what they want to here are judged so - Reality has a subjective bias.')
