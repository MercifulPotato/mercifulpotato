Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25394931], score=None, time=1607738926, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25394599, text='&gt; Given the large number of affidavits that their team has provided of a similar nature, it seems reasonable that the case should be allowed to be heard in a manner that takes both sides seriously.<p>Before presenting evidence, you have to present a legal argument for which the evidence would provide factual substantiation. The vast majority of the Trump- and Trump-allied-lawsuits have failed at that and been dismissed for that reason. The number of affidavits is immaterial if you don&#x27;t have a legal argument for them to support which, if the facts were on your side, would support the remedy you are asking for.')
