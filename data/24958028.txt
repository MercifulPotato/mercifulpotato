This article does an awesome job explaining what makes biomedical computer vision so hard.<p>There&#x27;s huge opportunity for automation, a wide range of vision challenges, and very cool rewards if challenges can be met. We&#x27;re working now on building 3d nanoscale structural models of COVID vs. control blood clots and modern hardware leaves tons of data on the table for better software to take advantage of. The relevant vision problems are very challenging, and even just within EM, robust computer vision that isn&#x27;t built up around individual narrow high-visibility problem domains (like neural circuit tracing) has a long way to go.')
