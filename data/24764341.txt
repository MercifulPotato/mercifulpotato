This has contributed to the hollowing out of the economy<p>Automation == &quot;hollowing out of the economy&quot; does not follow. Companies can use automation to grow their output while keeping their workforce intact by taking on new projects that were not previously possible.<p>If automation were that dangerous, then being a software developer should be the worst job because it automates itself away. But no, in reality we do more and still need even more devs.<p>On the other hand, not automating is wasteful and a future time bomb. This anti-automation rhetoric is like children hating school while their parents force them to attend - preferring short term ease that comes with a much bigger long term penalty (temporal discounting at work).')
