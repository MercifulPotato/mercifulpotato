We don&#x27;t care about making as much money as possible.<p>My wife and I have made good money and instead of investing it or keeping it in my company&#x27;s stock (AMZN, great investment right?) we&#x27;ve cashed all of it in ASAP and paid down the mortgage. Sure, some RRSPs and TFSAs (401k and roth ira equivalents), but for the most part it&#x27;s just been aggressively attacking the mortgage.<p>The bank lets us make double payments, with the extra going to the principal. It also lets us dump 10% of the total loaned amount once per year. And my wife and I have done this all aggressively. We borrowed nearly half a million CDN$ because Toronto housing is stupidly expensive, and we&#x27;ll have it paid off in the 7th year.<p>If the markets crash, we&#x27;ll be living rent&#x2F;mortgage free (or close to it), and can invest all our income at the bottom of the crash. If they don&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll still be rent free. If one of us loses our job, we can refinance the mortgage, pay the minimum, and get by on one income. We even keep a cushion in our bank account equal to 6 months bills and base mortgage payments.<p>Our goal is not to make as much money as possible. It&#x27;s to minimize the risk that we ever go broke, that we ever need to worry about money.<p>My father gave me a piece of advice once that&#x27;s stuck with me: if you earn an extra dollar, you have to pay tax on it. If you reduce your expenses by a dollar, you get to keep it all.')
