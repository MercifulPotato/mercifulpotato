At least not in a &quot;all in or all out&quot; kind of way over a large area and length of time. You can aggressively test and trace and separate just those that test positive. You can quarantine those most prone to be affected&#x2F;infected. You can quarantine specific localized areas where there is infection.<p>These all require that you actually implement these things effectively and comprehensively of course.<p>And just for the record, I think in early March we absolutely made the right decisions, and the &quot;lockdowns&quot; that are still in place are still the right way to go considering how terribly the US has managed all this. In general though, this doesn&#x27;t seem to be the only or even the best tool we have in our toolbox to fight a pandemic like this. Had the NYC area started an extensive test and trace program when we were in our lulls in August (NJ was down to under 300 cases a day across the state), and enacted forced quarantines with criminal consequences, I think we would be in a much better place now.<p>As an aside on a personal level, I am livid that I am being forced to go back in the office on Monday 5 days a week despite being able to be able to do my job 100% effectively. Its completely irresponsible and has permanently damaged my view of my employer.')
