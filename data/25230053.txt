He&#x27;s a Canadian from Vancouver who lives in Japan with his family and makes some of the best documentary style films on topics about Japan anywhere. He has quite a few videos on housing at various levels, and a great series on homelessness in Japan (including cheap housing alternatives).<p>Sharehouses are also relatively common in Tokyo and tend to attract young single people and expats. They&#x27;re basically dorms with a central kitchen and bathroom and quality varies tremendously. But you can live for hundreds of dollars per month ($500-700) pretty easily (once you learn about all the weird fees that sorta only exist in the Tokyo housing market) and be about 35 minutes from a downtown hub area.<p>Seoul also has similar cheap housing options. An entire market exists for ultra tiny &quot;study rooms&quot; (goshiwons) that are not much more than a bed, desk and bathroom and might run around $250&#x2F;mo. Seoul also has Share houses and very small single room apartments that can be amazingly cheap per month if you don&#x27;t mind paying a large (refundable) deposit up front -- for example, a $10k deposit might find you a decent sizes 2 bedroom 30 minutes from downtown on the subway for $500-600&#x2F;mo.<p>Both cities of course have Airbnbs which can be surprisingly reasonable and long-term stays are available.<p>1 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;LifeWhereImFrom&#x2F;videos" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;LifeWhereImFrom&#x2F;videos</a>')
