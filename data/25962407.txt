I was looking for a language myself for this purpose. I wrote a lot of stuff in Go and OCaml. This was some time ago, back before some changes to the Go language. I do not like Go as much anymore because of the new error checking stuff. I liked &quot;if err != nil&quot;, and I liked the now non-preferred way of checking against an error.<p>In any case, my path was Tcl -&gt; Perl (because startup time was neat) -&gt; Go -&gt; OCaml. I still do some Go and OCaml, but today I am not so sure about it anymore. Tcl and Perl were too slow, and had issues with their portability. Perl&#x27;s CPAN was difficult to set up across machines and I had some other issues with it.')
