Nor did the economists find any evidence that big corporate debt overhangs made economies more fragile, and prone to less frequent but bigger downturns.</i><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;168e908a-03a5-4a0c-b993-355e88afee41" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;168e908a-03a5-4a0c-b993-355e88afe...</a>')
