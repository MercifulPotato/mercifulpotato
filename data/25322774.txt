Meaning I bump my salary to see what the market will bear .. if i didnt go too high they will go higher and I boosted my salary by double or more.  This trick is best though when your a junior to mid level developer ... salaries do cap out Ive noticed.  But, it&#x27;s always fun to see what you might be able to get.<p>I use to see a lot of HN readers complain about recruiters.  Some are overzealous and shady like I told one recruiter i just met this girl two weeks ago at web dev Meetup who just started at same company.  He hunted her down and kept leaving voicemails on her work phone &amp; then calling the receptionist when she didnt answer him(omg lol).  Another forced me to lie to owner of company they placed me at, which I very begrudgingly did(hide recruiters shady business practice).  Though I sold her and her company out once she threaten to make up false stories so he wouldnt hire me full-time(he did hire me).  Though out of ten years and dealing with 100 to possibly 100s of recruiters those two are outliers in my experience.')
