However, if I play something like No Man&#x27;s Sky for one hour, in the normal locomotion mode, my mouth will start to water, which for me is a prelude to nausea, so I have to stop. That&#x27;s goes for other games too, even if the blank the peripheral vision(although that helps).<p>I can play for 10 hours straight (and I have) if I use the teleportation mechanism.<p>I&#x27;ll get nauseous in Subnautica.<p>A few people have tried Beat Saber, they all seem to have been ok.<p>Planes, cars, spaceships don&#x27;t bother me. My wife threw the headset away in Elite Dangerous when the ship banked. But I feel perfectly fine. Shouldn&#x27;t that make me nauseous too? After all, things are moving and the vestibular system is not registering anything.<p>Maybe that&#x27;s because we are used to cars? And could it be that the nausea can be &quot;trained&quot; away?')
