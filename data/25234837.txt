I used to be addicted to opiates for a period of 2 years (with maybe 3 years of recreational use before things got bad), ending in 2017.<p>I have had a very close friend die from a heroin&#x2F;fentanyl overdose, getting a PhD at the time. I say this to emphasize that even very smart, careful, and reasonable people can overdose and die. I&#x27;ve come close myself a couple times.<p>I would imagine accidental death from pharmaceuticals is much rarer, as the potency is consistent.<p>I&#x27;m convinced if we just completely legalized all of this stuff a better outcome would ensue. After all, there are two primary negative effects of illicit opiates in our current system: high stdev  of potency, and high cost. Under legalization, the stdev could be reduced to 0 and the cost could be brought down 10 or 100 fold.')
