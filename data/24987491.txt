The problem is that getting most things done requires enough code that it&#x27;s a lot of work to take it all in. Run all the for loops in your head. Etc. Higher level (and esp FP) languages like Haskell or Scala will be the opposite. That bunch of function compositions may take a little bit of work to digest, but once you understand it you understand a lot.<p>When people disagree on readability its often bc they mean two different things. We would benefit from different terms for readable-in-the-small and readable-in-the-large.')
