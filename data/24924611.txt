Coal is $30&#x2F;ton.<p>That&#x27;s the whole problem, the cost of coal needs to come up and that&#x27;s something that&#x27;s in policy makers hands. Stripe is trying to reduce that $775 by investing early in these projects.<p>&gt; Capture requires energy that could be used to reduce carbon emissions demand. 2nd law of thermodynamics says you canâ€™t win this game.<p>Assuming all energy comes from coal, which isn&#x27;t even remotely close to true.<p>&gt; The best carbon capture technology is plants and plankton.<p>Plants and plankton are useful for capturing carbon and storing that biomass, but that&#x27;s not a long-term storage strategy. All plants die and decay, returning carbon to the carbon cycle. If we want a long term solution, we need to put carbon back into the geosphere where we got it from.')
