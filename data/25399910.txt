Spellcheckers were standalone applications for years before word processors began integrating them. [1]<p>And second, it&#x27;s not a slippery slope fallacy, it&#x27;s an <i>actual</i> slippery slope, that&#x27;s the whole point. There isn&#x27;t a &quot;pretty clear distinction&quot; at all.<p>If I understand you correctly, you&#x27;re arguing that when spellcheckers came out, the existing products <i>should</i> have been able to legally prevent WordPerfect (and eventually Word, and Docs, etc.) from ever building their own integrated spellcheckers. To this day, you&#x27;d need to buy Word, and then buy a separate spellchecking app or extension.<p>But there&#x27;s no distinction between spellchecking and 100 other features that Word has that also used to be separate programs -- like mail merge, like drawing capabilities, like a citations manager, etc. etc. etc.<p>And you <i>really</i> think that would be a good idea?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Spell_checker#History" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Spell_checker#History</a>')
