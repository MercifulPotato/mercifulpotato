I don&#x27;t expect large-scale devastation and cities in ruins like in Syria, no.<p>But let&#x27;s do some fun math. Roughly 70 million voted for Trump. Take away the housewives, the boomers, the Latinos in Florida and the less fanatical, more old-school Republicans that delivered Texas.<p>So let&#x27;s say &quot;only&quot; a million are left out of the 70 and let&#x27;s say that &quot;only&quot; a third of those - so 300k are willing to go to war for &quot;their&quot; President.<p>That&#x27;s still huge trouble for this country. No, we won&#x27;t be a failed state but a never-ending far-right insurgency that right-wing and foreign media constantly encourage and feed while the GOP publicly disavow is not something that we know how to deal with either.<p>The Left will be on the receiving end of it all by its very nature it will be reluctant to confront it beyond &quot;let&#x27;s talk about it&quot;.')
