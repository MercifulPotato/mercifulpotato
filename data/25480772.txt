Every few months I prepare a new archive (10-100 Gb) that I want to upload and forget till something bad happens.<p>I&#x27;m thinking of using cloud providers for that.\nAssumptions:<p>- Data import&#x2F;export is completely egress (from my local PC)<p>- Data retrieval time does not matter<p>Cloud providers offer cheap cold storage:<p>- AWS S3 Glacier Deep Archive [1]<p>- GCP Archive [2]<p>- Azure Archive [3]<p>Storage seems to be ~1$&#x2F;Tb&#x2F;month everywhere.<p>Retrieval from ~20$&#x2F;Tb for AWS (not sure about that one - first restore from Glacier Deep Archive to S3 and then Download) [4].<p>Retrieval for GCP is 51,2$&#x2F;Tb [5].<p>Retrieval in Azure is 20,48$&#x2F;Tb [6].<p>Questions:<p>1. Is there a GUI or CLI tool to manage my proposed workflow (infrequent cold backup to one or several cloud providers). I don&#x27;t want to use their web portals as I&#x27;m not a frequent cloud user and all three interfaces are rather confusing and change all the time. Also uploading gigabytes from the browser seems like a bad idea.<p>2. Is there something better for secure cold backups? At 1$&#x2F;Tb&#x2F;month the storage price looks so good. Or am I barking up the wrong tree and there are dedicated backup services with similar pricing?<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;AmazonS3&#x2F;latest&#x2F;dev&#x2F;storage-class-intro.html#sc-glacier<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;storage&#x2F;docs&#x2F;storage-classes#archive<p>[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;azure.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;services&#x2F;storage&#x2F;archive&#x2F;<p>[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;s3&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;<p>[5] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;storage&#x2F;pricing#archival-pricing<p>[6] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;azure.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;details&#x2F;storage&#x2F;blobs&#x2F;')
