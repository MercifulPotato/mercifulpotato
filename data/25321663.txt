Could there be a confounder where Americans who are more likely to take LSD are more likely to be anti-war for reasons unrelated to the LSD itself?<p>I agree it&#x27;s absurd that it&#x27;s illegal (or that any drug is illegal, but it&#x27;s especially absurd that LSD is considered more dangerous than amphetamine, as you say), but I&#x27;m skeptical both of the motive you state (that the US government banned it because they feared it&#x27;d make more people opposed to the war) and that it necessarily correlates much with generating anti-war sentiment in people who otherwise didn&#x27;t have any.<p>I think the effects are highly dependent on the environment, the intentions, and existing predisposition of the user and the people around them. For example, it&#x27;s been reported that viking berserkers used to take psychedelic mushrooms before entering battle, because the mushrooms would help induce the berserk state.')
