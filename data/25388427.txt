Truth be told it&#x27;s pretty stable by now and for me, issues like that are rare.<p>Good sleep on windows has only returned recently.<p>After years of great sleep on Windows 7, there have been massive changes following the introduction of ACPI S0.<p>Case in point: I got a nice laptop for classes like 4 years ago  and it did NOT implement either S3 or S4 mode, which caused a MASSIVE problem in Linux. I found out about the issue on mailing list: the bios simply didn&#x27;t implement at all this part of ACPI, instead of exposing the hooks based on the OS detection. It was to reduce problems in theory, but it brought many more in practice.<p>Connected standby (S0idle) was very flaky on Windows 10, and very often the laptop would eat the battery overnight instead of going to sleep.')
