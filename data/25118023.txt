Item(by='baobabKoodaa', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605566557, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25117871, text='&gt; &quot;once counterparties have authenticated each other&#x27;s messages&quot; is the omission that changes the meaning of the quote.<p>No, it doesn&#x27;t. The dispute isn&#x27;t about the need for counterparties to authenticate each other. Yes, we all agree that it&#x27;s good if email receivers can validate the authenticity of the sender. That&#x27;s not at dispute. The question is, is it good if third parties also have the ability to authenticate the sender of an email at a later point in time (using DKIM specifically). tptacek claimed that there is no legitimate need for such a thing, and I provided a counter-example to that.')
