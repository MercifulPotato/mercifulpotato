Testing something in isolation is insufficient, since you need to test the downstream effects and potential complex interactions with everything else in the environment.<p>There is no testism problem; only a poor testing problem. Unless, as you say in your last sentence, one is just arguing about definition semantics - e.g. if &quot;QA&quot; falls under &quot;testing&quot;, or, here, if &quot;real-world observation&quot; falls under &quot;scientific testing&quot;. I&#x27;d argue both do. I think your concerns might be better phrased as &quot;lab model&quot; and &quot;lab-ism&quot;.')
