This isn&#x27;t consistant at all.<p>You need magic to describe shit that doesn&#x27;t exist. Otherwise, then nothing makes sense? How do you have FTL when any possible explanation of how it works might as well be words chosen at random from a textbook because none of it will be plausible.<p>&gt; If you just call it magic and define it by a set of arbitrary rules, then your fictional universe will look shallow and inconsistent.<p>Literally doesn&#x27;t make any sense. All your complaints are second order issues. Good Sci-Fi places rules around its magic and is consistent about it. What &quot;good&quot; sci fi that relies on tech that doesn&#x27;t exist is there that DOESN&#x27;T have its magic bounded by in universe rules.<p>Sci-Fi breaks down when you start to ignore or make up new rules around the magic, especially if its just &quot;stupid&quot;')
