My joy is being on a small team in a room with 6-10 other people where we collaborate with each other, calling out, asking for advice on solutions, designing together, getting lunch together, and being in each other presence.<p>Sitting an a cafe staring at a screen and ignoring all the strangers around me sounds like a dystopia from being around friends and working together.<p>I&#x27;ve worked from cafes for 3 of the last 4 years (because the last year was covid so no cafes). It&#x27;s better than being isolated at home but it was 10% of what I get from being physically with teammates.<p>If you enjoy the solitude good for you.<p>For me the difference between remote work and office work is like the difference between a real social meetup and a zoom meetup. The zoom meetup doesn&#x27;t come close the real thing. Similarly, remote working doesn&#x27;t compare to working physically together. All the things missing from the zoom meetup vs the a physical meetup are also missing from remote work.')
