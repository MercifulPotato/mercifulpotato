Reminds me of software devs who control packages. Some don&#x27;t care about users until it affects their hardware&#x2F;software conditions personally.<p>In those cases many would say &#x27;well, do it yourself and be the politician or the dev if you want change&#x27;. In social media&#x27;s case, where&#x27;s the free market people saying why not just be the change you seek, aka, use another platform or create another platform instead of blaming it on the man keeping you down? Did they stop using those terms because it&#x27;s not a convenient mantra for their party now? Maybe they should pick themselves up by their bootstraps, stop blaming others and create their own hosting platforms.<p>At least they have an option. For those censored by politicians and laws, it takes so much more to change a law than it does to create your own http server and speak freely on it.')
