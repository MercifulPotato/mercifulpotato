There will be ident wars where blocked individuals will then create new idents which have to be identified and blocked and so on, and there is little other than not inviting people to prevent this.  The basic infrastructure of forum moderation seems possible, but I think automated&#x2F;subscribeable block lists would become a standardized feature of clients.')
