Nothing rallies the group better than this initial suggestion.<p>Main takeaway -- if people don&#x27;t know the answer, say the wrong answer, and the group will eventually produce a better answer. Sounds like how the web works (best way to get the right answer is to post the wrong one). Anyway, this is a cool idea. I will try suggesting McDonald&#x27;s sometime.')
