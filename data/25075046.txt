They observed that, but were not able to safely conclude a causal relationship.<p>In particular, in the case of HIIT vs MICT they were within a percent or two of that 95% confidence. It is clear that further investigation is necessary, as it is quite a bit more likely than not that a causal relationship will be determined.<p>It is a good practice for scientists to not draw firm conclusions, nor for policy makers to adjust policy, for results that fail to meet that level of statistical significance. However, trying to shut down discussion and interpretation on that basis is neither helpful, nor productive.')
