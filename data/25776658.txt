I&#x27;m nearing middle-age and I rarely thought about gender issues and, in my twenties if I was asked to start a conversation about them, I wouldn&#x27;t have even thought to talk about gender identity.<p>But identity is fundamentally important. If someone chooses a mean-spirited nickname for you, and refuses to use your actual name, it&#x27;s not a pleasant experience. Yes, I know, &quot;man up&quot;, but if that person is in your workplace and you are there for years and years, it wears you down. If others then join in, even thinking it&#x27;s a bit of fun, then that would make me pretty miserable at work. It sure did when I was a child.<p>The reason you and I are amazed is because a swathe of the population have been forced to live as a lie, as someone they&#x27;re not and most of them for their entire lives. They&#x27;ve married and had children and died of old age and maybe one or two people really knew that it was all a lie they had to project because showing their true nature would have them stoned to death. Yes, an extreme example. But let&#x27;s say they came out in their 30s, they still lived for a substantial time as someone else, because nobody talked about gender identity, how it may change, or not be simple as &quot;her or him&quot;.<p>This is not a conversation you or I had. Not ideas we read about, were exposed to. I am going to assume, in good faith, that you did not suffer any of these issues. I didn&#x27;t.<p>It is amazing and I hope that eventually a better normal is reached, whether it&#x27;s proffering pronouns or not, where people are not abused because of who they are.<p>I would guess that you may have been amazed to see SpaceX&#x27;s kit land itself on a floating sea platform. Read that vegetables have been grown in microgravity or that we can now detect gravity waves. They&#x27;re amazing but they&#x27;re not hostile towards us, they&#x27;re just new phenomenons that weren&#x27;t around when we were kids.')
