The problem is one of simple corruption and incompetence. Nobody is willing to confront bad urban planning, out of control NIMBYism, corruption in government contracting, etc.<p>More money won’t fix a broken government any more than more revenue fixes dying companies.<p>IMHO one of the roots of all evil was proposition 13, which created a kind of property owners caste with a vested interest in actually making the housing problem worse. From that flows the homeless crisis, as housing costs <i>start</i> at upper middle class income levels anywhere in the state that also has jobs.<p>The problem is that proposition 13 is a hole from which it would be really hard to dig the state out from. Any politician who challenges it is voted out instantly by the landed caste as well as by the financially vulnerable younger folks who over-leveraged themselves into unaffordable homes and would be ruined if housing fell.<p>The infrastructure problem is also partly related to the housing problem. Nobody dares change anything because it might pop the housing bubble.<p>Prop 13 was a Republican thing, which shows that this isn’t just a Democrat or “too much liberalism” problem. It’s deeper than that.')
