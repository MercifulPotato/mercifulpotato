Item(by='godelski', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610502621, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25756669, text='&gt;  Alex Jones and brietbart are sensationalists, not extremists.<p>Can you expand on this? I understand Breitbart more since people like Milo were more clearly trolls. But Alex Jones frequently talks about conspiracy theories and is promoting the current insurrection (see below). But if many extremists frequent your sites then maybe the line is pretty blurry and you should expect others to confuse them. And to quote from an article that is on Info Wars&#x27; front page (in its entirety)[0]<p>&gt; They continue twisting the occupation of our nation’s Capitol by frustrated citizens and using it to destroy anyone that stands in their way.<p>&gt; As DC Mayor Bouser lords over her potential future state with a 15 day emergency order following the Capitol Building siege, the National Guard, including 1,000 soldiers from New York, are stationed in the nation’s Capitol to protect the illegitimate inauguration of the Manchurian Candidate Joe Biden while the old establishment propaganda ratchets into full protection mode and the defenders of the New World Order crawl out of their holes to justify the plague that is exterminating liberty.<p>How do you differentiate this from extremism? Reading words like &quot;occupation&quot;, &quot;illegitimate inauguration&quot;, &quot;New World Order&quot;, and &quot;exterminating liberty&quot; seem to me like extremist views. I&#x27;m not sure how <i>you</i> differentiate the two, but saying that a deep state rigged the election and calling those who attacked the capital &quot;frustrated citizens&quot; is in my view an extremist stance. <i>These words encourage those actions</i>. Extremists always use inflammatory language, so where is the line drawn? When does sensationalism because extremism? When you have followers that act on your words? I feel like we&#x27;re there.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infowars.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;selling-the-illusion-of-insurrection&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infowars.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;selling-the-illusion-of-insur...</a>')
