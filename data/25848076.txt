A President has stated, &quot;the election was a fraud, I should get another term&quot;. Congress has stated, &quot;the election was correct. Moreover, we may choose to prevent you from holding office ever again.&quot;  The judiciary agrees.<p>That Congress is likely to deadlock is arguably a feature, not a bug. (That voters don&#x27;t demand better from their congresspeople is, perhaps, a correctable bug.).<p>There is only one exception to the amendability of the Constitution -- states cannot be deprived of equal suffrage in the Senate. See Article V.<p>The disproportionate representation is by design. Without it, the country literally would not have formed. I am pleased to see states hacking around it without an amendment, thus, should the prior function be required, the states themselves can revert.<p>Is adding states too easy? There are three million US citizens in Puerto Rico without representation in Congress.<p>I am hopeful that we will find ways forward on gerrymandering. The only true beneficiaries of the existing system are the political parties.<p>Impeachment is not just hypothetical. Though it was not fully realized against Nixon, it would have been had he not resigned.<p>Regarding the endless accretion of laws: we get the government for which we vote. Speaking up, as you have done here, is the first step toward making it better.')
