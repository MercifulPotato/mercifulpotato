When Trump wins, the true believers will say &quot;We gave him a 9.684% chance of winning! It&#x27;s only your ignorance that makes you think we were wrong&quot; and they go back to poring over their race tables.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s an orgy of false precision.<p>The false precision is pretty obviously coming from <i>you</i>, not the FiveThirtyEight pages that never show more than two (or rarely three) significant figures, and emphasize in every other way they can that the numbers are approximate and uncertain. Have you <i>seen</i> the width of the 80% confidence intervals on their graphs?<p>As for falsification: all of their predictions are for testable outcomes. We&#x27;ll always know soon enough who actually wins an election, and which states they won, and by what margin, and who turned out to vote. That&#x27;s all public record. The only part of the post-hoc analysis that is non-trivial is figuring out how a candidate fared with specific demographic groups. It&#x27;s imperfect, but between exit polling and precinct-level demographic information and election results, it certainly <i>is</i> possible to detect large pre-election polling errors resulting from inaccurate demographic weighting.')
