Play songs by ear?<p>How many Herbie Hancock&#x27;s have you come across after finishing a grade 1 piano book? Of course a single exercise app or book isn&#x27;t going to create the perfectly rounded musician. For a child or beginner player, this looks like a great tool.<p>Advanced musical skill is entirely composable. Having solid improvisational skill or technical ability largely depends on how much you practice those various facets of your instrument. The reality is that probably 95%+ of people who pick up an instrument in their lives never make it to that point anyway.<p>You&#x27;re trying to critique this tool with the expectation that a single learning resource should address all aspects of playing an instrument, when that&#x27;s never been true of any musical learning resource ever.')
