Item(by='atYevP', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611689753, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25919105, text='Yev from Backblaze here -&gt; rest assured that we do read what you&#x27;re writing on these posts and they&#x27;ve spurred some internal process discussions. I believe the bugs you mentioned were cleared&#x2F;fixed with version 7.0.0.439 which was released in Q1 of 2020. We did leave HackerOne and switched over to BugCrowd to handle our bug program. It&#x27;s private at the moment, but easy enough to get invited (by emailing bounty@backblaze.com). While we spin that program up (it&#x27;s a new vendor for us) we may stay private, but hopefully that&#x27;s not a permanent state.')
