I believe the bugs you mentioned were cleared&#x2F;fixed with version 7.0.0.439 which was released in Q1 of 2020. We did leave HackerOne and switched over to BugCrowd to handle our bug program. It&#x27;s private at the moment, but easy enough to get invited (by emailing bounty@backblaze.com). While we spin that program up (it&#x27;s a new vendor for us) we may stay private, but hopefully that&#x27;s not a permanent state.<p>Edit -&gt; I just noticed the Daniel Stenberg libcurl citation. Oof, yea that certainly a whiff on our end. Luckily though we were able to make up for it (he has a write-up here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daniel.haxx.se&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;14&#x2F;backblazed&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;daniel.haxx.se&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;14&#x2F;backblazed&#x2F;</a>).')
