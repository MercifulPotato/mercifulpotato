The benefit of this is you&#x27;re able to render multiple difficult templates at the same URL pattern.<p>Gatsby does, however, suffer from huge scale problems, I think mostly due to the data type inference it needs for GraphQL. Once you start ramping up the number of models and records, it will churn forever ingesting them. There are hacks and ways to particially mitigate some of this, but still Gatsby continues to have problems once you&#x27;re working with a medium amount of content.')
