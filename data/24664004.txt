All the trade surplus countries want that to continue.<p>Losing that status, or changing the institutional structure in ways that undermine it, would cause huge, wrenching changes in the US but might be for the best.  But again, the surplus countries really don&#x27;t want that.  For Germany, Japan and China these are actually the best of times - at least economically.')
