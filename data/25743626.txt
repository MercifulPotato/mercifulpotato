It&#x27;s partially the &quot;like&#x2F;dislike&quot; culture, but I think it&#x27;s mostly because it&#x27;s the opposite of upvote-when-agreeing.<p>I agree with you that downvotes are useless when one simply disagrees and don&#x27;t help the author or the reader learn.  With the &quot;flag&quot; feature though, I am not sure I see the point of downvoting at all (other than when someone repeats the same disproven argument in the thread): upvoting is there to indicate &quot;me too&quot;, but any such thing turns into a popularity context.')
