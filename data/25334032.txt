Put together a team that communicates (a rare skill nowdays) and LET THEM communicate, offer them free beer afterwork, whatever interests them. Dont use enforced meetings like scrum etc., they just show that you have failed putting together a functional team. Make developers friends instead of rivals. Then avoid JIRA overhead, avoid management visibility,... just listen what people are saying (and preferably become their friend too), surpres any outside world influeces from your team and fire anyone trying to ladder over anyone else.  Then you wont need code reviews. And you will always have a long list of improvements at any moment. Just send an email and ask.<p>Be capable of coding. Be really good at coding. Everyone will follow you after &quot;shit hit the fan&quot; and team had to work over weekend and you have stayed with them and help them fix the bugs, analyze the code. DONT be a manager, be helpful part of the team (if this would be industry standard we can just fire 99.999% of managers).')
