Item(by='jcrawfordor', descendants=None, kids=[24759757, 24757816], score=None, time=1602522810, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24753654, text='Without going into too much depth, there was considerable controversy over this planned sale because of questions about ARDC&#x27;s authority to make decisions involving this IP space (ownership of the IP block was never really <i>assigned</i> to ARDC per se but rather assumed due to lack of another clear owner), some historic bad blood between some amateur radio groups and ARDC (involving in part ARDC&#x27;s administration of this IP space), and due to a perceived conflict of interest involving the ARDC board of directors. This was a big enough and loud enough issue for a while that it&#x27;s kind of odd to see any announcement of this transaction being closed that doesn&#x27;t mention the upset when it was first proposed.<p>Overall I think the sale was the right thing to do, but it is the fruit of a poisoned tree to some extent, and there will be ongoing questions about whether or not ARDC should really be in control of these funds. I am personally most just concerned about ARDC&#x27;s ability to competently manage such a large endowment, since historically they&#x27;ve been a fairly low-activity group with some odd internal dynamics and a bit of a rift with some other amateur radio groups. On the other hand, maybe the endowment will allow them to hire a competent staff and become much more involved in promoting digital amateur radio.')
