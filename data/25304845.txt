In the mid to late 90s when I was first on the internet, the &quot;prominent search engines&quot; ranked (given to me by my ISP and some other sites) was something like AltaVista, Yahoo, InfoSeek, with Webcrawler and Hotbot down at the bottom. I believe my ISP distributed IE (3 at the time) with whatever internet software cd they included, and it was my first and default browser. Later on I tried installing Netscape Navigator, but it felt slow and clumsy compared to IE3 at the time, so I never understood why anyone used it. It&#x27;s quite interesting how our internet experiences were so different!<p>What is the same between us however is I also learned coding practically by first starting to make HTML pages, and some Javascript, and that was also my way into the technical field (decade and a half of working as a software engineer now). Like, sure, there were computer programming classes in school and every class used Pascal at the time (Quick or Turbo). It didn&#x27;t feel like creating anything useful for the real world though; whereas with the web, I was immediately creating something for the world to see. I&#x27;d say learning to make web pages on my own was 99% of the reasons I became a software engineer later. The programming classes in high school, not so much.')
