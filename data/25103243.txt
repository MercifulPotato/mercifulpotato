Anyone who maintains a large enough GitHub project can attest that there are many people who don&#x27;t grok GitHub pull requests, either.<p>If you prefer to use a web-based workflow, then you can both prepare and review patches on our web UI, and they&#x27;re automatically sent as emails. You don&#x27;t actually have to interact with email directly at all.<p>And, once you&#x27;re used to it, pretty much everyone who uses email can assure you that it&#x27;s much easier to use, much more efficient, and much more scalable than pull requests.')
