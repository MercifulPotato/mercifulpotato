I don&#x27;t see myself investing in anything else.<p><i>Right now</i> it works ok for 3D printed models. Not great but if you are aware of it&#x27;s faults you can work with it.<p><i>In future</i> it&#x27;d take a single blip of that focused developer firehose to address a whole lot of concerns for us 3D printer types.<p>But even without a big business throwing money at them for that exact purpose, I am excited by boolean modifiers and the knife intersect tool getting significant updates in this release.<p><i>Right now</i> Blender is so much more than a 3D printed object modelling tool. I like having the option to explore other fields in the 3D modelling space too.')
