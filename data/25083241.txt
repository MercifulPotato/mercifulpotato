I&#x27;m happy to pay for continued feature + new product development ...<p>... What I&#x27;m not so happy about is:\n* we have asked Stripe to sign a contract for years (something requested by our institutional investors but have always been just pointed to an online MSA URL\n* we are now being asked to sign a contract suddenly w&#x2F;new line-item charges and no ramp-up or notice period<p>Most companies (especially those that are PE backed) have already done year end planning + budgetting.<p>Happy to provide the details of our timeline but so far at a high-level:\n* contacted by a new account rep 11-days ago about signing a contract\n* still have not received the proposed rates for billing, processing, rev rec, sigma etc ...\n* ... but have been told that Billing charging needs to kick off 1&#x2F;1&#x2F;2021 (which is essentially 45-days away)<p>Thanks,\nJE')
