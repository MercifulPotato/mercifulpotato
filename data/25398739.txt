Please email me your address at esc [@] uzy.me. No need to pay, I can post them anywhere in the world I bought a lot of all kind of stamps at the same time I ordered the stickers a few years back ^^.<p>I will post them whenever I can which may be in January as I&#x27;m not spending my lockdown time at my own place where the stickers are.<p>For your off-topic question: I&#x27;ve been seen wearing a colander from time to time, but I don&#x27;t have pictures of it. I&#x27;m not a Pastafarian however, as I do not especially like religions of any kind :D.')
