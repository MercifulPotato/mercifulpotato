This one <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medrxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.08.06.20169722v1.full.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medrxiv.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;10.1101&#x2F;2020.08.06.20169722v...</a> found an IFR of 0.83% in spain, or 1.07% if counting excess deaths.

The WHO has estimated 0.6%. These studies are based on representative antibody surveys with good statistical power, they should be accurate. There are factors like demographics and comorbidities that can push the number much higher or lower in a given community, but the range does not seem that wide to me.<p>2) I haven&#x27;t been tracking hospitalization data very closely, you may be right that this has changed ... I&#x27;ve seen little discussion of it.<p>I agree that mask use in particular was controversial for a rather long time, with bodies like the CDC seemingly dragging their feet on recommending the use of masks. Still, I think that it&#x27;s been a pretty settled question since April (CDC recommended masks from April 3 <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livescience.com&#x2F;cdc-recommends-face-masks-coronavirus.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livescience.com&#x2F;cdc-recommends-face-masks-corona...</a>).')
