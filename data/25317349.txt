She even kept a vial of pure radium salts by her bedside to enjoy its “fairy-like glow.”[1]<p>Also, many think about those working directly with bomb development and cores, but those processing Uranium had their share of radiation. St. Louis even has a Uranium waste site at their airport[2] that they would just dump into a pile without any covering, letting dust go up into the air over the surrounding neighborhoods. Some of the kids played in that &quot;black dirt&quot;,  sliding down it for fun[3].<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC1087189&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC1087189&#x2F;</a><p>[2]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stlradwastelegacy.com&#x2F;st-louis-airport-site-slaps&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stlradwastelegacy.com&#x2F;st-louis-airport-site-slaps...</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firstsecretcity.com&#x2F;tag&#x2F;mallinckrodt&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firstsecretcity.com&#x2F;tag&#x2F;mallinckrodt&#x2F;</a>')
