Your authentication credentials literally can&#x27;t be stolen from GitHub because they don&#x27;t have them, so you don&#x27;t need to care about how well they try to protect them.<p>A MITM learns nothing secret. If things go wrong and you somehow allow a MITM attack to occur, the MITM doesn&#x27;t get durable credentials from you, once you are talking to GitHub not the MITM they&#x27;re locked out, even though they watched you authenticate successfully, perhaps many times, they do not learn how to forge working credentials.')
