However blockchain can make it more difficult, for  a corrupt official to change some official documents, or in some cases to make them disappear completely. The timestamp of the arrest is of the utterly most importance. When a cop that may be corrupt or not, we don&#x27;t know, upload the arrest after 10 hours, then something fishy might going on, the video might be edited. People around usually witness the arrest, and they know around what time it took place. If the data is uploaded 10 minutes after the arrest, then we are more sure of the legitimace, than after 10 hours. That&#x27;s all.')
