See at the bottom, it&#x27;s updating *indirect, so &quot;indirect&quot; points to the thing being updated. On the other hand, &quot;indirect&quot; points to the address of the thing we&#x27;ll remove. There&#x27;s a specific item being removed, and there&#x27;s a specific thing that will be updated; the thing being updated comes immediately before the thing being removed; they&#x27;re not the same thing.')
