Like all IRC channels on Freenode, it&#x27;s pretty much dead. One reason being that only a small fraction of people even are willing to use IRC, mostly because they&#x27;re old enough to know wtf it is.<p>But then the Elm creator started a Slack server. ...And it&#x27;s absolutely bustling. There&#x27;s people getting help. There&#x27;s people giving help. There&#x27;s people golfing code or discussing design ideas. There&#x27;s people sharing their projects and receiving feedback. There&#x27;s different channels. There&#x27;s people meeting people and making friends. There&#x27;s people sending messages to offline users and offline users able to read them when they come back online. And there&#x27;s even people posting multiline code snippets, something that tends to come in handy for a software project of all things.<p>There&#x27;s people who want to grow an online community, they tend to discover Discord very quickly. No brainer. And then there&#x27;s people who want to convince an increasingly empty room that the application layer protocol behind the community is what matters most.')
