When asked whether that means Dutch has 27 letters in the alphabet or the &#x27;y&#x27; is not a Dutch letter, the discussion becomes very confused. Best explanation is probably that the &#x27;ij&#x27; is a letter that&#x27;s not in the alphabet, or it is, but shares the 25th spot in the alphabet with the &#x27;y&#x27;. But it is still a different letter, because &quot;symbool&quot; and &quot;royaal&quot; are also valid Dutch words. The situation isn&#x27;t helped by the fact that some names and words that currently contain an &#x27;ij&#x27; used to contain an &#x27;y&#x27;.<p>(Personally I think it&#x27;s two letters, but there are very serious sources, including a major encyclopedia as well as primary schools, that disagree. In games and puzzles it&#x27;s also usually considered to be a single letter.)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IJ_%28digraph%29" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IJ_%28digraph%29</a>')
