I was just in Chelsea, which is pretty pricey, and it was near exclusively white outside of people who worked in the service industry. Depending where in London she went and what she did, she ran into different groups of people, much like if you went to Chicago and stayed exclusively on either its south or north sides.<p>More than likely, as a tourist, she saw mostly other tourists and the largely immigrant dominated low-paying service industry jobs. I was also recently in Iceland and while in pure &#x27;tourist mode&#x27; saw few native Icelanders due to so few working in the tourist and service industry. When we ventured out to the neighborhood store areas, boutique shops, non-tourist bars, higher-end restaurants, etc it was almost 100% white.<p>&gt;tourists.<p>You may want to remind her that when she&#x27;s in traffic, she&#x27;s also traffic. Of course its full of tourists, she&#x27;s there isn&#x27;t she? Its beautiful and historic and should be full of tourists - the same way Athens, Paris, Berlin, Madrid, etc are full of tourists. This is a feature, not a bug.')
