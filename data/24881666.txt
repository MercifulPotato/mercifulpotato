Have you ever gone to a notary to timestamp something before Bitcoin came along?<p>The options are posting it to something like Twitter, including a newspaper headline in your cryptographic signature if you want to prove an after date rather than a before date, or indeed a notary. While I agree blockchain is a more elegant solution, it&#x27;s the only solution I see in this thread so far where blockchain has an extra advantage, and I&#x27;m curious whether we need to have an extra country on this planet in terms of power consumption just to avoid going to a notary on occasion.')
