Anyone who works in American healthcare instantly knows the premise of this article is wholly absurd. Whether or not it&#x27;s strictly the best policy, HIPAA is non-negotiable and has been so for decades. And, for infection control, most COVID units didn&#x27;t even let family members in. Imagine how furious you&#x27;d be if a hospital told you a loved one couldn&#x27;t visit but some non-medical rando who wanted to photograph everybody could.<p>Michael Crichton&#x27;s point with describing &quot;Gell-Mann Amnesia&quot; is that when you see a news article on a topic you&#x27;re knowledgeable about, you quickly recognize that it&#x27;s completely wrong in almost all key aspects. Sometimes they even get things precisely backward. But when you turn the page and start reading about something you&#x27;re not an expert in--say foreign policy--you strangely forget how shoddy the journalism was just moments ago, and assume that this next article about something youâ€™re not knowledgeable about is probably roughly accurate.')
