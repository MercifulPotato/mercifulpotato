I was just speaking about incentives for a new iOS developer today. They might see the option to disable IDFA in addition to Apple&#x27;s lowering of it&#x27;s commission as a nudge towards creating a paid app over an ad-supported app in terms of choosing a business model.<p>I&#x27;m sure ad-supported apps are still going to exist, but the pros are a bit muddier now.
