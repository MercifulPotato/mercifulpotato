I&#x27;ll share why. I was excited to find docker. It was neat and could be setup to update your applications without manual interaction. So I had it run my media server apps on a seedbox I had rented. Fast forward years later got a form factor pc that came with the free version of Windows. Try as a might, I couldn&#x27;t get docker to work on it. Required the Pro version or something like that. I remember thinking, well that sure is stupid!
