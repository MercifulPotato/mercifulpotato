And then just interfaces everywhere, I can&#x27;t even jump with an IDE, I have to find where this interface magically gets injected first to find the actual logic.<p>Also I guess I don&#x27;t like massive slow IDEs and slow compilation times. I just feel so slow when working with Java as well my mind gets distracted and frustrated. Maybe it is my personality flaw to not have that type of patience.')
