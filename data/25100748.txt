Quantum field theory (QFT), especially, is essentially a way to look at the world through its Fourier transform.<p>In a nutshell Fourier transform, the derivative operator, exponential function and CAUSALITY are related at a very deep level. And that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s such an important mathematical tool. Because it is related to causality.')
