Now you have 10s or 100s of variants out there, each individually tweaked and so not readily identifiable as true copy&#x2F;paste repetition, all containing some variant of this subtle bug. You find out about for interface A, and fix interface A. Maybe <i>you</i> remember that B-C were copy&#x2F;pasted versions of A and check them out and correct it there. But D-Z were all copies made by others, following your example, and you miss them.<p>It&#x27;s not scalable, and produces severe consequences when used without care (which is most of the time, it seems).')
