There was some of the ACAB sentiment in Germany, but it quickly died down, since most people here (even left-wing people) generally trust the police - and while I&#x27;m sure there are still problems with underrepresentation, racial profiling, etc., it&#x27;s nowhere on the scale that it appears to be on the US.<p>Also most countries simply don&#x27;t have a recent history of slavery inside their own country like the US does; black people in Germany, for example, are almost all immigrants, which does create entirely different dynamics, and we have (had) a lot more immigration from different cultures, especially Turkish people. None of this means racism and xenophobia don&#x27;t exist, but the discourse and potential solutions are not the same as in the US.')
