Just because a stock can come back up doesn&#x27;t mean it didn&#x27;t lose real value even before realizing the loss.<p>Second, this is not about the individual&#x27;s risk of losing money. This is about Robinhood losing money because they lent him money.<p>And about why they didn&#x27;t give him a chance to provide further collateral is simply because there wasn&#x27;t enough time. I watched the stock drop from over $400 to $125 in just over an hour. Not sure what you could expect Robinhood to do in that situation.')
