That means, that you can not keep it a secret, that only you know, unless no one ever buys your product.<p>I am not so sure about what you say about releasing it to only paying customers. That might be true. In that case one of the original developers could buy 1 license or the community could pay for 1 license and this way get the source code. Then the developers of the modification would get some pay and the original developers would get the source code.')
