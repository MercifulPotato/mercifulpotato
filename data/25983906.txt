Now people are relying on your systems, and you can’t have any down time. All redesigns have to be able to be implemented in a way that can transition from the previous system without breaking anything. As we often say, “we are changing the tires while driving 90mph down the road”.<p>I wish we had spent more time on thinking about scale when we were smaller. Our new mantra is that everything we make now has to be designed to horizontally scale, even if it is something small right now.')
