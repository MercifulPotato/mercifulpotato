Instead of having two templating systems (server-side and client-side) there&#x27;s just one on the client side. Now I don&#x27;t have to share code between client and server, but more than that, the two are logically separated. The client can <i>just</i> be a client, rather than a strange half-extension, half-app of the server. Secondly, if you also want to expose an API, do you put it in the server that does the rendering, or do you have a third component that the server talks to? With an SPA, there&#x27;s <i>only</i> the app and <i>only</i> the API and the two are separated out by their respective duties quite cleanly.<p>Once I started building out SPAs for data-driven applications, I <i>never</i> looked back to the old model of generating HTML server-side. It seems barbaric to me. The only hesitation I would have is if the SPA needs to be SEO optimized, in which case you can go either isomorphic (again, not a fan) or scrape pages via a headless browser as .html into a directory that your webserver serves up.')
