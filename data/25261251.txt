Wider lanes seem (and are) safer than narrower lanes.<p>&gt; [Wiki] Traffic calming can include the following engineering measures ... Narrowing traffic lanes ... Converting one-way streets into two-way streets forces opposing traffic into close proximity, which requires more careful driving<p>What is happening here?  Did the engineers forget that they were supposed to optimize for safety, and instead optimized for getting people to slow down?  Does the net effect of this improve safety, or worsen it?<p>If everyone drives as fast as they can while meeting some perceived safety level, then does that mean these efforts are unlikely to affect safety and merely to slow everyone down?  Is the best set of measures the maximally deceptive set, which looks as dangerous as possible while being as safe as possible?')
