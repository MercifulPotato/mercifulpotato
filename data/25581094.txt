You mention something, they hear it from a couple of other places and they are now convinced that its a good path forward.<p>You can put your black hat and game this by making sure you suggest whatever you’re after to more people&#x2F;sources of info that your target listens to. Bonus points for going through intermediaries that obscure the source of the idea.<p>At some point, your senior decision maker has his “epiphany” as what you want is “what everybody is talking about”.<p>Interestingly this is something we talk about with my partner as a lot of times one of us would suggest something, the other might be dismissive, but then someone else would suggest, it gets done and and I&#x2F;she would get upset that “you listen to them but not to me”.<p>But in reality whats going on is that we are both waiting to accumulate enough data points to make a heuristic work.<p>Once that became apparent we’re much more understanding to each other.<p>As for managers, if they smart enough, they would notice that a lot of the things you’re suggesting ends up what being done, and at some point they would value your points a lot more. But hardly anyone would use only one source of input to make their decisions.')
