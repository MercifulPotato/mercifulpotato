My question is: <i>How easy is it to get infected with ransomware?</i><p>I like to consider my setup bolstered against ransomware and malware. I leverage all the usual security&#x2F;mitigation strategies like compartmentalization, isolation, segmentation of the network, different virtual machines for different things, different USB thumb-drives for different things, obscure (encrypted) filesystems that can&#x27;t be accessed by (Windows-based) ransomware, reducing the attack surface, and using &#x27;principle of least privilege&#x27; using Linux, not opening malicious email attachments, etc. In short, I am not immune, but I like to think I have a good degree of damage control in place.<p>But do orgs do this too? I would like to think so, but how are so many orgs getting hit now? What kind of vectors are these ransomware gangs using?')
