When the D candidate wins, we are assured that election security is airtight, there&#x27;s no evidence of significant irregularities, and &quot;the system works&quot;.<p>This has nothing to do with the factuality or legitimacy of flaws in the system -- in short, yes, I believe you that there are severe problems with the apparatus we use to conduct elections, but there is strong pressure to ignore and even deny these problems, because doing so helps solve the bigger, more important problem of getting Trump out of office. I don&#x27;t want Trump <i>in</i> office, but I cannot admit to any legitimacy to the claims of vote irregularity in the 2020 election, even theoretically based on your expertise because even if it were true, it would be a &quot;fact that gives power to the enemy&quot; and thus must be treated as a falsehood. That&#x27;s why if you post about it on Twitter, a little note will be attached to your tweet with a link that says the U.S. elections were perfectly conducted with no chance of fraud.')
