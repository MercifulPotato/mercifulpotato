But outside of work, in personal life, I really suffer from it, and the overthinking resulted from it. The situation has become much worse as a result of living alone during the pandemic.\nIs there anyway to become intellectually shallow like having an IQ&lt;100, after work?\n(Except meditation that is probably useful for overcoming overthinking)<p>P.S: Sometimes I think a CS career just reinforces this issue. Sometimes I think I should get out of CS for the sake of my own sanity.')
