Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603120079, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24825827, text='american here, $2K per month sounds like a pretty wild food budget for a family of three (one of whom is presumably a child). I spend $300-400 a month to feed myself, and I could cut that down a lot if I didn&#x27;t primarily shop at whole foods. if you aren&#x27;t focused on saving money, there are a lot of opportunities to spend extra money on stuff that isn&#x27;t healthier (eg, prime NY strip vs flank steak, fancy aged cheese, high end butter&#x2F;oils). the nicest version of something in a grocery store can be 2-3x as expensive and nutritionally equivalent.')
