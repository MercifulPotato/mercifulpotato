The winner at least can tell you how they did succeed personally, even if they have no comprehensive studies with data.<p>On the other hand, you are just a random guy from the internet, and offering advice with no data at all.<p>You might be broke and posting from your mom&#x27;s basement, or from the top of a penthouse that you bought from building successful companies&#x2F;startups.<p>We don&#x27;t know, so your advice will be treated like:  just another opinion, from a internet rando&#x2F;keyboard warrior, and everyone has opinions.<p>I listen to PG as he has been more right then wrong, also he was very successful, multiple times, and is single handedly a major contributer  to many products I use.')
