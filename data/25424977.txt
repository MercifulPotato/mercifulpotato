Lots due to decolonization in Africa. The partition of India in 1947 was huge. Lots of European changes, of course. Many small border cleanups. The changes go on for page.<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_national_border_changes_since_World_War_I" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_national_border_change...</a> (That page is since WWI, so skip to 1945.)')
