QEMU&#x27;s architecture is fairly generic and it was never built for speed in the first place. Improving the speed of emulation is more about getting better than the current baseline of &quot;10x or worse slower than native, and continuing to gradually get slower if we add features and don&#x27;t actively try to work on performance&quot;. If we got to &quot;3x slower than native&quot; I would be really surprised.<p>Which isn&#x27;t to say that you can&#x27;t do better than 3x-slower under any circumstances, just that if you wanted performance you&#x27;d probably be better off starting from scratch with an emulator design that cared about performance and which was really clear about its use-cases -- eg &quot;this is user-space only, not system emulation&quot; and &quot;this is only this very small set of host and guest architectures&quot;. QEMU does a lot of different things in one codebase, which makes it cumbersome to change anything and hard to put in optimisations or simplifications which might be valid for a specific host&#x2F;target combination but not more widely.')
