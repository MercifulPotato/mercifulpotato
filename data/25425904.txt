Item(by='bgorman', descendants=None, kids=[25426178, 25425994], score=None, time=1607995592, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25424034, text='I&#x27;m pretty disappointed with the way this has unfolded.<p>For those now familiar with ReScript, ReScript started as &quot;reason&quot; an alternative syntax for Ocaml. Recently ReScript was created with a sytnax more similar to TypeScript than &quot;Reason&quot;. In addition, there is a fork of OCaml for compiling to javascript that used to be branded as &quot;Bucklescript&quot;, but now it is called &quot;ReScript&quot; as well.<p>So now as of 12&#x2F;14&#x2F;2020 there are three Ocaml syntax versions in use:<p>Ocaml,\nReason (Reason 3.6, last version available for native code)\nReScript, (~Reason 4, only available for javascript compiler fork, some sytax present in Ocaml&#x2F;Reason has actually been removed with no equivilant in the grammar)<p>I am not sure who benefits from this, Ocaml is a serious language that will never be as simple as a dynamically typed language. I am not sure who this is supposed to be helping. It seems to me that things were more clear a year ago when there were just two syntaxes available. In addition, it now takes a relative subject matter expert to disipher what is going on, which i think is the exact outcome ReScript was trying to avoid.')
