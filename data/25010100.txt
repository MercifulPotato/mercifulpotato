This kind of technology has gargantuan inertia. The entire hardware ecosystem is strongly interconnected between different firms, and each firm&#x27;s future technology depends strongly on its past execution. Failure to deliver on 10nm not only jeopardized the smooth rollout of the subsequent process node, it also hurt Intel&#x27;s ability to deliver large quantities of full-featured chips to customers.<p>I don&#x27;t personally believe that Apple would be going to in-house silicon instead of Intel for its flagship laptops if there were a viable way to avoid doing so. Intel is so hurt right now that I surmise it&#x27;d be willing to negotiate a fat discount for a flag-carrying customer, and the loss of Windows functionality is kind of disappointing at the upper end of the market (where some tools are clearly better supported by windows or at least x86).')
