Teaching my 9 year old son Lua has been kind of painful, in large part because of language decisions that make learning things harder for beginners.<p>For example, did you know that if you pass in a variable to a function, when that variable doesn&#x27;t actually exist, Lua won&#x27;t complain? I don&#x27;t just mean that there&#x27;s no compiler, but even the runtime is fine with it. It&#x27;ll just silently assign the argument value to be nil.<p>This resulted in my son being very confused, after having a typo in the variable name he was using there. Why is the value nil? He was sure he gave it a value earlier, before passing it into the function (and he was correct, to an extent).<p>I have a laundry list of complaints about the language, things that make it harder to teach beginners. Sure, there&#x27;s less &#x27;setup&#x27; than, say, Java, and that&#x27;s nice. And the 1-indexing is fine, really.<p>But there&#x27;s other language decisions that are just <i>weird</i>, man. Why would you make this &#x27;table&#x27; structure so flexible and important, and then completely neglect to provide a built-in function create copies of said table? How is that non-programmer-friendly? How is providing no ++ or += increment operators better for beginners?')
