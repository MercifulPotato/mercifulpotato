I was being completely serious, but the &quot;copious amounts&quot; humor might&#x27;ve been a bit much for some of HN :P<p>Propranolol is just about the safest option out there, is what I had in mind in saying it, and is the go to for just about everybody who is prescribed it for positions (such as being in some sort of performative entertainment) to defeat anxiety. I believe I read the account of a violinist from the New York Philharmonic in which the actual jist was, for them and everybody else they knew in the ensemble prescribed it, &quot;literally makes you give zero fucks about anybody out there and lets you zone in on exactly what you need to focus on&quot;<p>So, if you&#x27;ve never had any heart issues or other health problems, I&#x27;d seriously recommend just discussing it with a GP. If they for some reason really give you a hard no - as somebody who&#x27;s struggled through the shitty medical system that is the U.S. and now receives care from Cedars-Sinai in LA, Stanford, and Cleveland Clinic - fuck that doctor, get a new one.<p>If you do however have any fears of your heart health, just go to a cardiologist and get a standard cardiac workup along with a stress test and such. It&#x27;s your life, don&#x27;t let it be hindered by not trying something a simple contextually completely safe substance may be able to instantly fix. I say this as somebody who lost the entirety of their teenage years and is still fighting to have an attempt at recovery into my young 20&#x27;s from lack of care for a more serious health issue that &quot;I just couldn&#x27;t have had because I was just so young and it&#x27;s such a rare condition&quot;<p>Absolute chickenfuckin peabrains some docs are. Sorry if I started to ramble too much haha. Go look into your stuff with a doc, and if you need - I&#x27;m aware of quite a few other relatively simple legal (US) drug solutions for such issues of anxiety, having a pretty deep into the field pharmacist brother.')
