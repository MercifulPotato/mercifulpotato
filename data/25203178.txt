I liked the idea of entity based systems.<p>Discovered that Apache Tapestry, which I used a decade ago, was inspired by WebObjects. It was a very interesting fairly seamless backend centric web development experience, worked quite well, &amp; I say this as someone who loves JS, thick client architectures, client side architecture. I didn&#x27;t see a ton of objects seeming like generic web objects like ideas though. In WebObjects it seems primarily like there were objects, then different bindings to re-expose and&#x2F;or convey updates between the object &amp; the various front ends it might show up on. I&#x27;m probably over glamorizing how shared, how web, objects in WebObjects really were.')
