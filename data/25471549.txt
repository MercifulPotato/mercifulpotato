Item(by='superfrank', descendants=None, kids=[25472884], score=None, time=1608323443, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25471460, text='&gt; May I ask if you were on desktop or mobile?<p>I was on desktop.<p>&gt; maybe either shrink them slightly or a more muted blue?<p>Yeah, I think either or those (or both) could work. Looking at it again, a lot of the issue I&#x27;m seeing is that the URL and the title are equally prominent and fighting for my attention. I&#x27;d take the one you think is less important (probably the URL, imo) and  visually make it clear that it&#x27;s less important, similar to what you did with the user and time it was posted.')
