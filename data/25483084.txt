If you don’t recognize the benefits of serverless of the capabilities of this you shouldn’t be writing about it. Go back to retirement if you remember the 70s. Maybe you would have laughed people out the door in 2000 but that doesn’t mean you by any means are right. Serverless doesn’t add complexity but provides a service that manages everything for you without having to manage scaling manually. This provides ease of use across teams and also consistency which is not found in self managed servers across any size of organization.')
