I spent a good amount of time searching for what the restrictions were in my city. I found news articles describing restrictions, but I wasn&#x27;t able to locate primary sources or a way to keep updated.<p>Even with the link you sent me, that site gives no indication that it&#x27;s a way to get updates on pandemic-related news and restrictions.
