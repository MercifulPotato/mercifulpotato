I think just following my nose and doing what felt good in the moment was a big help. I guess it helped that I&#x27;d been trained as a youth counsellor early in my career, and I&#x27;ve been helping people my whole life as a by-product of who I am. A lot of people over the years have told me I should be a counsellor because apparently I&#x27;m really good at sucking the drama out of situations, calming people, soothing their nerves and helping them to get to a point that they can solve their own problems.<p>Like I say though, often you won&#x27;t really know if what you are doing is a good thing until you look back on it and you see that the person you helped has moved forward. Some people just don&#x27;t want to be helped and no matter how much effort you put it, you&#x27;re not helping. But it&#x27;s really difficult to see that while you&#x27;re in the midst of it.<p>Just keep doing what you&#x27;re doing while you have the motivation to do something. Get what you can out of the experience - the energy I got from helping other people even just to find their smile in the midst of something they felt they couldn&#x27;t get out from under was enough to say that today I did good.<p>And take it day by day.')
