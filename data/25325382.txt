That means &quot;in the end&quot;. At the last. Ultimately, we all die and there&#x27;s nothing anyone can do about it.<p>None of us chose when or where to be born. None of chose how rich the family we were born into would be (the number one indicator of success in life).<p>People might have chosen to move into Grenfell Tower but they didn&#x27;t know they were choosing to die horribly in a fire, and making choices without knowledge carries as much responsibility as saying that a lottery winner was responsible for their winnings - not untrue but hardly a maxim for life.<p>To say that there is a reality that ultimately we are responsible for our own fate just seems to disagree with reality.')
