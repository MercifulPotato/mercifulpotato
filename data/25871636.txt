We already have a loneliness epidemic among the population. We already are shirking our responsibility by building robots to talk to our elders and we already spend too much time looking at screens. It would be better to go and befriend an older person, give them real face to face time with a person and a new friendship, than to talk to an AI replay of something that once was. I think it will lead to more turning inward, more isolation, and less human contact. None of those things are healthy or good. Sure it might help a few people, but I think it will hurt far more;  including the young people who miss out on the stories &amp; friendship of those who&#x27;ve lived through so much.')
