Burnout can be draining and not having someone that understands&#x2F;doesn&#x27;t judge makes the experience harder to deal. There are different types of burnout which can affect everyone differently. Slow down and start making changes in small increments to improve your mental health.  \nA few changes that helped me (that are more generally applicable for you&#x2F;others)...<p>- Make friends with yourself and then support yourself - I mean, wouldn&#x27;t you cut your friend some slack and offer this kind of advice if they were in a similar situation? Forgive yourself for feeling scared. It&#x27;s OK. Be kind to yourself. Forgive yourself when you indulge (no matter if it is procrastination, retail therapy, ice cream, media consumption, or whatever).  \n- Remember that not every day needs to be &#x27;productive&#x27;. So, slow down and take some pressure off. This can take a bit getting used to because you may feel you&#x27;re cheating yourself or your client&#x2F;employer. Break work into smaller chunks. Remember, not everything needs to be done right away, in one fell swoop, or at all.   \n- Segregate work and play, times and places. Try to set some office hours for your support work. Might be easier to physically step away from the B&amp;B during those hours, if explaining your need for private time is difficult.  \n- Sleep, wake, eat, and exercise at regular times everyday. Don&#x27;t surf&#x2F;watch&#x2F;read in bed and screens off ~30 minutes before lights out. Follow a healthy and balanced diet (more fruits and greens, less meat). Introduce a schedule slowly.  \n- Add an exercise regimen. Even light exercise such as a daily 45 min stroll will help (and Maui should have some beautiful views). Cycle, run, hike, or swim if you can.   \n- Develop some regular social interactions and find a supportive community&#x2F;group&#x2F;individual. Talk to a therapist&#x2F;counseller and&#x2F;or a supportive partner&#x2F;friend. Talking, letting it out, helps.  \n- Do more things that do not involve computing&#x2F;screens. Fulfill a new creative urge or rekindle and old, long cast-aside interest. Read a book; volunteer - even a little helps others and helps you; meditate - I found guided gratitude-focused meditation was helpful. I still watch plenty of stuff, but I&#x27;m now more aware when I&#x27;m doomscrolling or experiencing video fatigue+mesmerism.  \n- If you have interests in cycling, dancing, painting, writing, board games, wood working, etc., now is a good time to seek out groups or places that organise casual events without major commitment. They will afford you conversations and social interaction that is helpful.  \n- I found fulfilling non-computing interests made a positive impact and helped me deal with exhaustion, anxiety, and depression. Don&#x27;t worry about being good at these other interests. Start small, at whatever level you are comfortable with.  \n- If you feel good&#x2F;bad on a particular day, consider your activities, food consumption, media consumption, for the last 48 hours.<p>Recovering from burnout takes time - I have been making changes in the last 18 months, and it has not been easy. That spark is relatable, and it will come back (perhaps in a different form).<p>OK. That was quite a bit more than I expected to write. I hope some of it is helpful and I haven&#x27;t come off as soapboxing.')
