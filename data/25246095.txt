I worked on a query engine once, written in Scala and Java, where weâ€™d generate Java from a query and then compile and load the bytecode into a single flat function. I wonder how that would compare with your solution. I suppose it could even be called quite nicely from Java. This thing was working on memory mapped data after all (using sun.misc.Unsafe). The idea was to avoid the indirection caused by lambdas for the separate query operations.')
