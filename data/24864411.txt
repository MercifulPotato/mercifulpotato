After all this was hubris and arrogance all the way down. Founders failed to perform any kind of validation - after all you can&#x27;t find a problem if you don&#x27;t look after one, innit? - and the list of &quot;investors&quot; is rather a list of self sufficient rich boys with more money than sense.<p>PG is dishonest: these guys took no risk; their product did not have a hair of innovation on it; they had a $2Bn safety net.<p>This summer they had 72k paying users [1]; mix in the $2Bn investment; they could have distributed $27k to each of these paying users and would have still had some money in the bank. But no, they managed to burn their resources and the product with it. No pivot, no sign of adaptability whatsoever.<p>Let&#x27;s be honest - it was just an expensive project that failed despite having the best resources at hand.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;7&#x2F;8&#x2F;21318060&#x2F;quibi-subscriber-count-free-trial-paying-users-conversion-rate" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;7&#x2F;8&#x2F;21318060&#x2F;quibi-subscriber-...</a>')
