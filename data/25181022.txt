They don&#x27;t help nearly as much in an open environment where there are many code owners and not all code is visible to you. When you publish a library, a refactoring tool isn&#x27;t going to tell you everyone who uses your library, and you don&#x27;t have permission to change the call sites anyway.<p>The only thing for it is to push a new, incompatible version and other people will have to migrate. So you&#x27;re pushing off the work onto them.<p>I don&#x27;t see how an effects system helps with this much? It might help you better understand how you painted yourself in a corner, but I don&#x27;t see how it helps you get out of it.')
