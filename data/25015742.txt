For example, &quot;every single environmental feature, including power grids, locked doors and even huge enemy spawning machines are all powered by intricate, interconnected logic gate circuitry.&quot; does that mean the game will implicitly teach the player about basic rules of logic? Demorgan&#x27;s and so forth?<p>Another bit that caught my interest was &quot;the gameâ€™s entire narrative takes place within 1 second of real time.&quot; Is there user &#x2F; system time as well? Or is this just a plot point?')
