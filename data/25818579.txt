You get the approval from them on doing something one way, then plow a bunch of time into developing it, and then when it&#x27;s time to deliver things, that same person gets in the way and stops the whole affair.<p>Every meeting should have a note taker who takes complete, accurate notes listing at a bare minimum every major decision, who decided it, and every action item including who it’s assigned to. Send it out to everyone involved with the discussion. Do it for every meeting so it’s not seen as some special event.<p>Every face to face conversation where a decision is made should be followed up with a written email basically saying “Per our chat on 3&#x2F;5, you decided [very specific description of what was decided]. Please let me know if my understanding is incomplete.”<p>You need the paper trail!')
