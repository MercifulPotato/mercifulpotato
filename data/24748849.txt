No, what happens is, of course, that you get a lot of harassment if you don&#x27;t use it. Imagine that you drive a car on a road that you like, then they build another road and people get mad at you because you don&#x27;t use the new one. That makes no sense right? That&#x27;s what happens with bike infrastructure, of course it happens because they don&#x27;t want you to use the regular roads, the motorists want to keep them all for themselves.  And obviously, when this happens, security, comfort and convenience are less than an afterthought, in fact they are not thought at all. So, no I do not want special infrastructure when I ride my bike, because then you immediately become a second class citizen. I actively avoid it when I ride.')
