So their cognition prioritizes following same-coloured shapes. So what? Why is that the right thing to do?<p>The important point is that a newly-born duckling can pick up the notion of &quot;similar shapes&quot; vs &quot;different shapes&quot; and show a measurable preference for one or the other, after seeing 1 example (of course, that must somehow be hard-coded in its brain, so it has probably been learned through evolution).<p>In contrast, a neural net is very hard to train to achieve a similar feat. Whether the feat itself is desirable or not is not relevant. It&#x27;s just a measure of how different our current training methods are from the ones employed in animal brains - even relatively dumb ones like newly-born ducklings.')
