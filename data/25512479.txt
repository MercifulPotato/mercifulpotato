This isnâ€™t an attack of you, what would be good is if you could explain your view a bit more than just an opinionated dismissal of the book. Is it the writing that sucks? Is it factually incorrect (And how is it?)? Some of us are interested in reading more about the history of information theory and it helps to have considered dissenting opinions to decide what to read and what to trust :)')
