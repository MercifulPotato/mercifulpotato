If it&#x27;s not vendored, you release the new build and be done. But if it&#x27;s been vendored into 20 packages, you just need to bump the vendored version &amp; rebuild those packages.<p>The languages we are discussing where vendoring is common have simple build processes, and well defined dependency management mechanisms (go.mod, package.json). So it&#x27;s not difficult to bump the version of a dependency and rebuild a package in those languages. A large part of the work here should even be able to be automated.')
