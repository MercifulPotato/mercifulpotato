People died at strikes for those protections.<p>Just a personal anecdote, my biological grandfathers trunk was firebombed by the Philly Roofers Union (UURWAW) due to a dispute with them. The K&amp;A gang in that area is well known to be tied into the union[0] and was known to fairly regularly engage in violence like that to prevent &quot;scabs&quot;. My point being, the violence was omni-directional and this fact is often omitted by those in favor of unions.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;K%26A_Gang#Roofers&#x27;_Union_corruption" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;K%26A_Gang#Roofers&#x27;_Union_corr...</a>')
