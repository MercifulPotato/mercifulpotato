Should that flag be named &quot;continue&quot; or &quot;shouldContinue&quot;? Or maybe the i variable should be renamed to index. Or maybe &quot;row&quot; and &quot;column&quot; should be renamed to &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;. Sometimes &quot;buffer&quot; should be renamed to &quot;data&quot; and sometimes &quot;data&quot; should be renamed to &quot;buffer&quot;.<p>It does not make sense to say that variable names don&#x27;t matter just because there&#x27;s no way to automate a style guide on the semantic content of variable names. Sometimes variable names matter quite a lot.<p>So interpret that particular part of their code review guide as being less about the value of automation, and more about how to guard against some of these social headaches. A culture of breaking ties toward the requester discourages nitpicking. A culture of breaking ties toward the reviewer encourages it. Even in the presence of linters.')
