The goal of my proposal was that someone who was wrongly flagged (a false positive) could identify themselves as such by being willing to put up a (cash) bounty, or identify themselves with a financial&#x2F;government institution that is set to handle such things at scale. Someone who is committing fraud, or trying to steal anonymously, or is involved in other criminal activities, is <i>extremely</i> unlikely to do such things. Legitimate people, however would have a route out of this kafkaesque maze. That system could even be automated, and it would work better than what&#x27;s going on now.
