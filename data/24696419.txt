For example, it&#x27;s quite likely that we&#x27;re all descendants of the original high priest Aaron, whose descendants and no-one else are allowed by God to perform certain actions (caveat: the ancient texts are ambiguous about whether &quot;descendant&quot; means &quot;descendant along both maternal and paternal lines&quot; or whether it&#x27;s more restrictive, and in certain circles this could be a sensitive  question). Similar thing for religious prophecies about peoples&#x27; descendants (e.g. that the Messiah is a descendant of Judah---it&#x27;s probable that we are all descendants of Judah by now).')
