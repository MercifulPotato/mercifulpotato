With darcs, I have a collection of patches available from developments&#x2F;contributions, and a release is a set I&#x27;m happy with on top of the previous release tag.  If one of them causes trouble during testing, it can typically just be removed from the set.  (Obviously it doesn&#x27;t always work that cleanly, but it typically does.)  When happy, tag and release. It&#x27;s a pleasant model that&#x27;s straightforward enough for someone who&#x27;s only been maintaining large projects since the early days of networked CVS.')
