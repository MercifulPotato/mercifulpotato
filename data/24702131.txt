AI that&#x27;s just not good enough, e.g. it requires 100% confidence not to be problematic (Detecting whether it&#x27;s a person or a gorilla. Autonomous driving)<p>- 2. AI that&#x27;s correctly trained but discovers problematic trends and attempts to do prediction based on these trends (Train on poverty + race correlations)<p>- 3. AI that&#x27;s incorrectly trained on inherently biased data and just reaffirms the problematic trend (Train only on male CVs for hiring prediction.)<p>- 4. Buggy code that spits out bad data.')
