Chinese people suffered the first remember and get it in control. they are well deserved for whatever vacation they want to have. The second half of your comment looks like provocation.<p>As for the “worst” neighbor part, you can’t just focus on one side of the story.

Ask if they want to be given a “better” neighbor while cut their revenue in half.
