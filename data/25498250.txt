Item(by='LocalH', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608577803, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25489071, text='VHS has a similar horizontal resolution to VCD (VHS has 240 lines per picture height, or about 320 lines across the whole width, while VCD has 352 pixels across the whole width) but has double the vertical resolution (and since it&#x27;s an interlaced format, that also means it has double the <i>temporal</i> resolution). Take some interlaced 60Hz sports footage and convert it to VCD, and if you can tell me with a straight face that the VCD looks better, then I&#x27;ll tell you that you&#x27;re blind.')
