This leads to the &quot;You can&#x27;t plug a computer into a socket if you aren&#x27;t in the electrician union&quot; problem, the reason they say that is they think the company could oust the union by hiring people to do that work without properly labeling them.<p>EU unions are bigger and more general but aren&#x27;t allowed to force workers to join, ie EU is a &quot;right to work&quot; area. This avoids most of the problems with US style unions and also gives workers more political power since EU style unions are bigger and can therefore more easily influence national politics.')
