At a couple points in my life I&#x27;ve decided to take dieting very seriously. &quot;ZERO cheating&quot; works when you are serious. Other times I&#x27;ve started &quot;seriously&quot; and the eventual work party, birthday, vacation, etc throws me off and I lose motivation.<p>I wish I could tell someone what I did to make the mindset change necessary to diet seriously, but I can&#x27;t figure it out myself.')
