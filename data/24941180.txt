You&#x27;ll even get good results on simple csv files that leave you encouraged to go further. Don&#x27;t.<p>Csv is not standardized and the quoting rules are weird (and not standardized).<p>If you can live with a certain amount of loss of fidelity in your output, you can get away with using awk. If you want a coarse prototype, use awk.<p>If you need robust, production-grade handling of csv files, use (or write) something else.<p>Csv files are a little bit like like dates: superficially simple, with lots of corner cases. Largely for the same reason: lack of standardization.<p>That said, awk is awesome. It&#x27;s small enough to fit in your brain, unlike Perl (maybe yours is larger than mine?). It&#x27;s also pretty universally available, with few massive incompatibilities between versions, unlike shell (provided you avoid the gawk-specific features). I love it.')
