I like that my mom can install apps and not worry about them spying on her.<p>This is super ironic given how extensively Apple is spying on their customers. I guess you consider it OK too since it&#x27;s Apple?<p>And btw, Apple&#x27;s policy absolutely doesn&#x27;t prevent spying: Google Chrome is still spying her your browsing habits, Gmail is reading her emails, Whatsapp has all her contact information (including identity and phone numbers of non-consenting friends of her), etc.<p>Apple policy is about malware, not user privacy.')
