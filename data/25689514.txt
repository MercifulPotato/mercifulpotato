Many people were armed and prepared for violence: multiple IEDs were found, multiple people had body armor, multiple people had loaded firearms &amp; extra ammunition, people brought a guillitine, people were shouting chants about killing senators &amp; reps, multiple people had zip-ties or handcuffs. That is sedition.<p>Unlike BLM protestors, the terrorist&#x27;s intent was a coup: they wanted to undermine a democracy&#x27;s most important legal process. BLM wants to use legal means to revolutionize the country&#x27;s public safety, primarily via re-allocating city and state police budgets to programs that have effective track records of increasing public safety and not ending in the murder of Black people.')
