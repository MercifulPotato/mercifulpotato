Otherwise, it does cost energy to maintain a system running and, at the very least, tracking time for 10000 years.<p>It&#x27;s not even obvious that it is theoretically possible with current circuit technologies. Pieces would fuse together, moving parts would erode, all sorts of organic materials might deteriorate, everything would be affected by the huge amount of time. And you would almost certainly need energy to actively fight this entropy so that you would have an active machine when you reach your destination.')
