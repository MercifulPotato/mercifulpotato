Or are you just caring about remote freelancing?<p>Not to mention considerations of family, friends you want to be nearby. And the culture of the place you live.<p>If your only consideration is a place to claim residence with a low tax burden and cost of living as a remote freelancer, it’s easy to list those options. If you expect good public services like education and public transportation that’s going to look quite different. If you want to support non profits or work in defense contracting, that’s also very different.')
