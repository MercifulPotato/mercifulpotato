What I&#x27;m describing is a redesign. There&#x27;s no point in submitting a patch for that. It&#x27;d be much more effort than a few lines of code, and it wouldn&#x27;t be accepted. Open source means that anyone can fork. It doesn&#x27;t mean that maintainers will automatically merge patches replacing their software with completely different software. The only way that will happen is if the maintainers decide for themselves it needs to be redesigned, and that starts with discussion rather than a patch. It&#x27;s also a long shot compared to just finding different software that already has the design I prefer.<p>If I want replicated SQLite, I&#x27;ll look at dqlite or litestream instead, which sound more compatible with my design sensibilities.
