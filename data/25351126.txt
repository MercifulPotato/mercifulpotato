The kind of audio sharing you describe is really nice and is legitimately something Apple built (as far as I know). I think Apple often prices their devices on the high end, but that&#x27;s fine.<p>That said, I think your description of other bluetooth devices is overly pessimistic. I&#x27;ve had no problems finding bluetooth devices that do basic bluetooth things (connecting, xmitting audio, swapping devices) well. For that reason I basically never <i>recommend</i> Apple products as if they are the only ones to &quot;get it right.&quot;<p>Apple is a premium brand. Folks should consider them if they want a premium product, but it&#x27;s silly to act as if their competition doesn&#x27;t offer the same basic functionality for much better prices.')
