I know I have never been able to see the benefits of vim. Part of me wants to give a try for 3-6 months just to prove to myself that it&#x27;s all bullshit and that vim is just another editor.<p>In any case. For a long time I was a fan of my editor of choice, slickedit. It definitely has a few features I use for which I don&#x27;t know the analogs in most other editors. Features like versions backups. Undo of multi-file search and replace.<p>Also once had someone show me IntelliJ for C++ and was fairly impressed with its refactoring features. Enough that I thought I should look more into it.<p>I have yet to see a feature for vim that makes it clear win over any other major editor. I have read articles that make me understand why others might like it but seriously. I think you&#x27;re all deluding yourselves.<p>Just as an example, lately I mostly do JavaScript and a little typescript. I&#x27;m 100% sure that the VSCode experience there out of the box is superior to vim for the same purpose. VSCode is node aware, browser aware, npm aware, eslint aware, typescript aware out of the box. I have no idea how much configuration I&#x27;d have to do in vim to get it to match and I find all of that invaluable. I&#x27;m not saying vim can&#x27;t do it but I am saying if I tried to start using vim today on the projects I&#x27;m working on the experience would be seriously inferior. I don&#x27;t know what language I&#x27;d have to be using to change that.')
