First he says it isn&#x27;t helpful if foreigners criticize Russia, because Russians need to learn to criticize themselves. But later he says that his work aimed to lead the Jews to examine themselves, even though he is an outsider to that people and, by his own declared standards, it is none of his business.<p>This only follows if we accept the axiom &quot;Jews aren&#x27;t Russian&quot;.  I&#x27;m not convinced that he thinks that (and I certainly don&#x27;t).<p>&gt; Also, after the Holocaust it is extremely inappropriate for any non-Jew to suggest that the Jews as a people have done anything bad or negative. The sole appropriate thing Solzhenitsyn could have done with regard to the Jews is either say something nice or not say anything at all.<p>To me, this is intellectual cowardice.<p>As far as I know, Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s controversial view about Jews in the USSR is that they were viewed as less likely to be counterrevolutionary, and therefore quickly climbed the party hierarchy...at least initially.  Stalin eventually adopted various anti-semitic measures (and Solzhenitsyn mentions this in The First Circle).')
