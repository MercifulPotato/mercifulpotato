I quoted the man directly. Words that he uttered in a call to a Republican Secretary of State, in the middle of an audit of signatures that the Secretary of State had ordered at Trump&#x27;s request.<p>What quote? I listened to the same call you posted. So which quote did I make up?<p>&gt; In an amazing coincidence, 11,780 votes just happened to be the number of he needed to win the election. I&#x27;m sure you can come up with an explanation of how he just happened to randomly choose that number out of all the other ones.<p>OK, but the actual number of votes is irrelevant. It&#x27;s still a felony requesting any fraud, not an amount over a certain threshold. So the actual number listed doesn&#x27;t particularly matter, just the interpretation of the statements.<p>&gt; They moved on from Fox news to an even more extreme platform in OAN...<p>Don&#x27;t group the extremists and republicans together. Every single republican I know reads almost every news source. Most sticking to whatever news app is on their phone. So no, not OAN. Any source playing on your emotions for views should be called into question, regardless of which end of the spectrum your on. Both sides do this, the left and the right. But when it&#x27;s pointed out on the left, nothing is done to stop the sensationalism.<p>&gt; The left did not cause Trump to reject the results of the election, whip his base into a frenzy and send them to the capitol. Aren&#x27;t you supposed to be the party of personal responsibility? &quot;You made me do this&quot; also hasn&#x27;t been considered a very good excuse since domestic abuse went out of fashion in the 60s.<p>Actually this recently started with the lack of voter ID laws or enforcement, some years ago. This started the mistrust in elections, which is dangerous (and you see why now). If secure voting disenfranchises voters, then lets figure out how not to. Requiring you prove you can vote should be possible for the US given the resources we have.<p>&gt; I absolutely agree with you that gay conversion therapy is horrendous and should be outlawed.<p>Sure! But not what I&#x27;m talking about. This type of forced conversion is the ones leaving moderates out of the discussion for fear of being canceled by the left. That&#x27;s the forced conversion I&#x27;m talking about, become one of us or find a new life.<p>&gt; Right now Parler is the kid in the sandbox that threw sand in everyone&#x27;s eyes and then got upset that no one wanted to play with them.<p>How so? Have you been on Parler? Do you believe there are not examples of extremism on all platforms? Perhaps the discussion should be around some sort of regulated speech flagging engine so this sort of moderation isn&#x27;t difficult? They do have a moderation team, and perhaps it&#x27;s lacking. But in my brief experience with it, it&#x27;s not the hate bed the left is painting it as.<p>&gt; Your lack of introspection is getting absurd at this point. The right made concerted attempts to portray Obama as a Muslim anti-christ who wasn&#x27;t even a US citizen. One of the people attempting to throw doubt on Obama&#x27;s citizenship was Trump himself. What you&#x27;re annoyed about is the fact you and your friends are no longer getting away with dog-whistling in an attempt to escaping the consequences of your actions:<p>Where exactly is my introspection lacking? Or what have I failed to introspect about? Are you assuming that I am a republican and applying other assumptions about my beliefs? I don&#x27;t agree with that violence on Jan 6, and I don&#x27;t agree that attacking where someone came from is right either. I also don&#x27;t agree with the BLM &#x2F; Antifa violence, which just happened again last weekend. If you want to &quot;attack&quot; someone, &quot;attack&quot; them in a formal debate. Stop the underhanded politics. Protest peacefully. Both sides.')
