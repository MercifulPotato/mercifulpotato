They did have a tendency to fall apart â€” they were probably cut from a sheet rather than injection moulded.  The small improvement to make them &quot;click&quot; together seems fine, but it&#x27;s a bit rich to then rant about others selling similar toys.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worthpoint.com&#x2F;worthopedia&#x2F;vintage-1950s-toy-set-dis-kit-542193834" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worthpoint.com&#x2F;worthopedia&#x2F;vintage-1950s-toy-set...</a>')
