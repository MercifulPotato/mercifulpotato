It&#x27;s not the job of the people who assemble my phone to decide the content on the device. Their job is to shut up and move the bits through the pipes, not to have political opinions.<p>People adopted app stores for security and stability- not political content moderation. The fact that they&#x27;ve decided to reinvent themselves as editorialists is as outrageous as if my mailman decided to tear out pages from my magazine subscriptions, if my cable company decided to black out specific television shows, or if the carmaker decided to censor radio stations it didn&#x27;t like.')
