To my knowledge, though, this is just a theoretical construct, not a legal one, yet in this thread it&#x27;s seems to be taken for granted that treating Twitter as a utility is just another tool in the (U.S.) government&#x27;s toolbox. Is there any reason to think it actually is? Seems offhand like a stretch, but I&#x27;m no legal scholar.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Social_media_as_a_public_utility" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Social_media_as_a_public_utili...</a>')
