They either make 1-1 call with the clients pushing &quot;informal&quot; training or prepare text content that they forward by mail to the clients; they also did webinars. Still, they were more familiar to made calls. I know they have a common phrase to start, something like: &quot;Did you know you could do X &quot;faster&#x2F;better&quot; by using Y from software,&quot; all of this to make sure the customers receive constant training into using our software. I understand that principle or the intention here is that when the customer is well trained and uses the software at his full potential, it&#x27;s better retained and more valuable.<p>Your friend looks like it will be great in a Customer Success role; you could even open it up to pre and post-sale functions.
