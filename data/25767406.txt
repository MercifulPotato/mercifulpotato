Pat Califia makes this argument explicitly.<p>They believe that &quot;normal&quot; sexual ethic is imposed on children by oppressive power structures (enforced by parents). So they believe that they&#x27;re liberating children by exposing them to queerness. They don&#x27;t see it as peer pressure or coercion because they see sex as something similar to choosing between ice cream or cookies, which a child is capable of.<p>Gayle Rubin also defended NAMBLA quite clearly.<p>Many examples of this stuff.')
