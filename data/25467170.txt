NMS was the most recent game I was immersed in, before Cyberpunk&#x27;s release, and thoroughly enjoyed.<p>The thought that it was buggy as hell on release, and for some time after, seemed far-fetched during play through. There are bugs here and there, but nothing to pay much mind to.<p>While playing Cyberpunk, there were quite a few bugs on release for PC (crashing, catching enemies in t-pose, randomly dying, and some others), but I&#x27;m noticing them less and less. Idk if whether it&#x27;s them updating or just my mind, but definitely encountering fewer and fewer bugs.<p>Only personal complaints I have are not related to performance (not a big fan of Johnny Silverhand&#x27;s character&#x2F;writing and wasn&#x27;t a fan of the Panam quests&#x2F;story, but that&#x27;s insignificant).<p>Enjoying it quite a bit now, but could totally see, and look forward to, this being even better with updates. It&#x27;s just a shame that the devs had to deal with crunch :&#x2F;')
