And if you only care short-term, because you are a politician with a short term, then fine (for you).<p>But that&#x27;s a different plan from &quot;the government&quot; in general.<p>&gt; a more efficient system would have ‘welfare’ programs for people in crisis that lead into a series of help up services that eventually lead to full independence.<p>You are describing &quot;safety-net&quot; welfare, but how do you ensure any form of welfare remains a safety-net, and doesn&#x27;t become a norm? welfare for those <i>not</i> in poverty is much more likely to work this way. If you specifically set out to tackle poverty, the most important thing are educational programs, and <i>limited</i> welfare programs.<p>I&#x27;m not against welfare in any case, but I see it as a double-edged sword that is too often seen as a &quot;throw money at the problem&quot; solution.<p>&gt; Also, fuck no<p>It&#x27;s a metaphor, the difference between men and children aren&#x27;t relevant. The abstract meaning is dependence vs self-dependence. Giving a child food solves their food, but not their poverty.<p>The way it was originally stated:<p><pre><code>  what if instead of spending so much time wondering why ‘Johnny’ can’t add, we spent that money and effort on making sure that Johnny was fed properly\n</code></pre>\nI could just as well say &quot;what if instead of spending so much time wondering why a man can&#x27;t fish, we spent that money and effort on making sure that man is fed properly&quot;, and the answer is the same: because then they will be dependant on us (the government) to provide food. This doesn&#x27;t mean we shouldn&#x27;t provide food, but that <i>both</i> are required, since the original post post specifically proposed providing food should <i>displace</i> education i.e. we spend money elsewhere. In fact, what we spend on food is a problem in itself, but unrelated to what we spend on education, we should not cannibalise one in favour of the other as if they are competing solutions - they <i>are</i> both solutions to the same problem, but do <i>not</i> compete because they have different scope: one long term (poverty) the other short (hunger).')
