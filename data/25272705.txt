Then I started watching all the videos of people running games on the Air (Air!) - and even Windows games - many of which I play - under Crossover (commercial version of WINE from CodeWeavers - more than worth the $60 for the integration work they have done) I&#x27;m starting to realize that I may not care about keeping a Windows gaming machine any more.  My only problem is I&#x27;m addicted to way to many assets in Cities:Skylines to get by with 16GB of RAM, so now I&#x27;m seriously thinking about waiting for round 2 for something that can get to at least 32GB of RAM.<p>And by the time those machines are out I suspect a few of the games I care about that don&#x27;t run on the M1 may have a solution of some sort.  It&#x27;s nuts, and not a path I thought I might go down - but the performance I&#x27;m seeing from <i>non-native</i> code already simply blows me away.<p>It&#x27;s only going to get better from here.  This is the _ground floor_.  I have to keep reminding myself that this is the <i>start</i>')
