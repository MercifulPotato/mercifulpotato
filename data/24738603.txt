Rust is supposed to be a systems language from what I heard, so if you are going to write something larger, and&#x2F;or complicated, and&#x2F;or low-level, you will have to resort to unsafe blocks, <i>I think</i>.<p>Hyper requires 52 packages:<p>autocfg, bitflags, bytes, cfg-if, fnv, fuchsia-zircon, fuchsia-zircon-sys, futures-channel, futures-core, futures-sink, futures-task, futures-util, h2, hashbrown, http, http-body, httparse, httpdate, indexmap, iovec, itoa, kernel32-sys, lazy_static, libc, log, memchr, mio, miow, net2, pin-project, pin-project-internal, pin-project-lite, pin-utils, proc-macro2, quote, redox_syscall, slab, socket2, syn, tokio, tokio-util, tower-service, tracing, tracing-core, try-lock, unicode-xid, want, winapi, winapi-build, winapi-i686-pc-windows-gnu, winapi-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu, ws2_32-sys<p>Without rust&#x2F;library&#x2F;:<p><pre><code>    $ grep -irn &#x27;unsafe&#x27; | wc -l\n    3077\n</code></pre>\nWith rust&#x2F;library&#x2F;:<p><pre><code>    $ grep -irn &#x27;unsafe&#x27; | wc -l\n    7854\n</code></pre>\nYep, there are indeed loads of them. Feel free to clone all of those repositories and look for those unsafe blocks. You could even get it per-crate.<p>Of course there are some false positives in there, and yes, some crates may not have unsafe blocks (so not all crates have them, you got me), but still... It is a bit too many unsafe blocks.<p>Or I do not know, maybe they just have a thing for unsafe blocks, for example in the standard library (std) you can find 2267 unsafe blocks.')
