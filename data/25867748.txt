Very good battery life, quite fast and long-lived. Makes it even less understandable in my mind how so many people all over the world think they absolutely have to have the newest and most expensive Apple thing every year or few months, spending multiples each year on phones&#x2F;tablets of what I spend every few years (in the past the phone was either defective or gotten so slow daily use was like trying to walk through mud).<p>The G1 and the G4 after 2+ years of use and a whole bunch of updates (multiple! major Android versions) got really slow and one of them I dropped so the display had a crack horizontally right across the middle, it still worked for MONTHS like that until I decided to get a new phone.<p>All in all, reasonable price for a good long-lived product without all the clutter some phone suppliers bog down their Android versions with, i.e. nearly stock Android with some minor unintrusive additions (from what I can see in my apps list right now: an equalizer app with different automatically activated profiles, an optional Motorola product newsletter app and a diagnostics app to help with troubleshooting and hardware tests).')
