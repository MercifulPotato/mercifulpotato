That&#x27;s not even remotely twice the range of a Tesla.  Heck, it&#x27;s not even that much more than my Chevrolet Bolt gets.<p>Everything else about this sounds great, especially the charge times.  That takes a lot out of the hassles of a long distance trip in an electric car. ~250 miles is a fine point for getting out, taking a restroom break, stretching legs etc.  Get back and the car is all topped up?  Sounds perfect.<p>The main problem here is that it&#x27;s still dependent on Lithium, and we&#x27;ve really got to get off that.')
