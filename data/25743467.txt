Canadian culture traditionally focuses less on making a lot of noise, standing out from the crowd, etc. Canadians are almost infamous for politeness, especially compared to Americans.<p>Now, couple this with the ease at which Canadian engineers can get jobs in the US and the picture emerges, bright and clear. Any Canadian with a lot of ambition may be alienated by the relaxed culture in Canada and subsequently move to the US, further reinforcing the cultural divide.<p>On the other hand, Canadians (and even Americans) who are disillusioned with what they may see as an excessive ambition and a relentless focus on &quot;growth hacking&quot; might opt to live in Canada, also reinforcing the cultural divide.')
