I&#x27;m a big fan of Ardour and have been using it in my amateurish ways on and off since 200...7?<p>I wasn&#x27;t aware of the Calf plugins being a source of crashes.  Recent versions of Ardour have <i>never</i> crashed on me (different story for earlier versions).  &quot;Basic DSP mistakes&quot; also sounds alarming.  I&#x27;ll take note of that for future projects.<p>Perhaps the pretty UI could be adapted for suggested alternatives.  It would help all those superficial people like me to migrate :)<p>On a more serious note I like how <i>intuitive</i> the Calf UI is; almost every plugin lays out its primary parameters in a way that is very compatible with how I approach my work.  I&#x27;m a command line person, so I certainly could make do with automatically generated interfaces from the LV2 manifests, but ... I try to shed my developer persona when having fun with audio, so anything pretty that keeps me from thinking too much helps to keep me in the zone.')
