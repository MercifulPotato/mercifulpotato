The reality people need to wake up to is that when a business is at FB scale, people who fall through the cracks due to a broken algorithm simply don&#x27;t matter. Google doesn&#x27;t care if you get locked out of your Gmail, in the same way FB doesn&#x27;t care if you get spuriously banned.<p>When users place more value on a service than the service places on them as a customer, it feels like a market failure scenario that leads to these kinds of outcomes. When the go-to price is $0 though, it isn&#x27;t clear how you resolve this.')
