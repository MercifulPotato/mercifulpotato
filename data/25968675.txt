VS Intellisense has served me very well for known tech (ASP.NET etc); for new tech I rely on official docs or nutshell style books to be with me. I&#x27;ve created ASPSecurityKit.net [0], that sets up a new web app [1] (API&#x2F;MVC) with user account related workflows; adding the business features then is easy for me.<p>In my initial days of programming in school&#x2F;college, I relied almost entirely on local MSDN library installation (during VB6 days, it used to come in three CDs), to learn VB6 and build apps. With that, I built a multi-lingual word processor, a screen reader and some other nice tools that got me hooked with coding.\nIt was around 2003-2006 and I used to only search on internet whenever I needed to add something not supported out-of-the-box in VB6 like Win32 APIs etc.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ASPSecurityKit.net" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ASPSecurityKit.net</a>\n1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TmUO90JNlvs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TmUO90JNlvs</a>')
