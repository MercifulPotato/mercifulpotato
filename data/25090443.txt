GP&#x27;s answer was also on my mind given how timely and relevant to the question it is.<p>Sometimes reality does make people look bad.  That doesn&#x27;t make that reality &quot;garden-variety political flamewar.&quot;  The results of the election have been universally reported and it&#x27;s ridiculous to pretend that they haven&#x27;t just because it offends the political sensibilities of some.<p>Political discussions on HN are already pretty questionable, but killing discussion because it might upset a certain crowd biases what we&#x27;re allowed to talk about away from reality.  That&#x27;s never a good thing.  This shouldn&#x27;t be a bubble where we can&#x27;t say something as simple and inoffensive as the statement that Donald Trump lost the election, has (along with some Republican colleagues) refused to concede, and that it epitomizes the way that norms have been eroded in our government over the past four years.')
