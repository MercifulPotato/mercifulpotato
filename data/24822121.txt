And the common language would make the world even more connected.<p>If Esperanto would come into common use tomorrow, Hollywood would start producing movies in Esperanto, and people around the world would be watching them. That would already be a force acting against local drift. If people around you decide to replace X by Y, but 9 out of 10 movies keep using X, the change is less likely to stick.<p>Neologisms and idioms, I agree, but there is a chance they would spread to other countries.')
