You can&#x27;t even customize anything past the creation screen, no car paint jobs no hair cuts and no body modification, no transmog system..<p>They tried to hide the console issues while reaffirming time and time again that current-gen console will be a first class citizen, that&#x27;s an EA tactic not something  that CDPR I thought I knew would do...<p>Moreover CDPR was given a $7 million grant to develop the artificial intelligence. This game has one of the worst open-world AI I have ever seen.<p>Cops spawn on you, the drivers and pedestrians AI is almost non existing. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas from 2004 is miles ahead of this game.<p>They even announced that they are &quot;very sorry&quot; and that people can get a refund only that Sony won&#x27;t refund if you played or even downloaded the game not to mention this game is very badly optimized on AMD systems the current gaming king.')
