I got it mostly for the included decoders, i have a Lecroy with decoding options which is much more practical as it can decode in real time but in the dsview you can create stacks for decoders like for example I2C stacked with a 24cxx so you can view the comands (read&#x2F;write, address) and the data, in that case it is pretty simple but some devices have more complex control commands.')
