Item(by='hombre_fatal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603158598, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24830442, text='I think Discord (and Slack and similar) is best understood as a community platform rather than the things we are tempted to compare it to, because it&#x27;s not just chat (IRC), it&#x27;s not just voice chat (Ventrilo, Mumble, Skype), it&#x27;s a fuller community building experience that helps you meet and stay in touch with other people inside the same org&#x2F;interest. And I think this is something HN commentary consistently misses.<p>As an example, IRC isn&#x27;t a community building tool. It doesn&#x27;t have offline async notifications&#x2F;messaging, for one. It misses these tools that helps you develop relationships. It&#x27;s just ephemeral chat (for better or worse).<p>That&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t matter if Discord isn&#x27;t perfect. People want to form relationships, not just chat, not just post.')
