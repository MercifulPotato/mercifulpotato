Item(by='kortilla', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608713839, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25513828, text='&gt; Our WireGuard mesh sees IPv6 addresses that look like fdaa:host:host::&#x2F;48 but the rest of our system sees fdaa:net:net::48.<p>Is it not feasible to make wireguard more flexible with a bit mask? The annoying thing with having to use 1:1 NAT in a packet pipeline (which is what you’ve done here) is that logs, metrics, etc get all screwed up for correlation because wireguard doesn’t see the same things everyone else does.<p>I guess putting wireguard in the kernel wasn’t such a hot idea after all?')
