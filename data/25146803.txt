While there are many things that are literally impossible with HTML+CSS+JS at-present (such as &quot;splitting&quot; a rendered UI, like how iOS 5 did with its notification banners and home-screen folders), but besides certain flashy effects everything is doable quickly. Whereas building a custom UI in any other platform would take days or weeks just to get a prototype done if you couldn&#x27;t hack-on additions to an existing &quot;UI component&quot;.<p>So your line of reason would be improved by saying:<p>&quot;Lackluster performance with no other benefits means low adoption&quot;, the rest then follows.')
