But the Zeta function is only defined to equal the sum of inverse powers for Re(z) &gt; 1. And under a specific definition of summation (Ramanujan summation) you can say that &quot;the sum is equal to -1&#x2F;12&quot; but that isn&#x27;t the same as normal summation.<p>Mathologer did a fairly in-depth video[1] into why this proof is wrong and what the actual link is between the infinite series and -1&#x2F;12. The upshot is that even if you use more complicated definitions of summation, you cannot define sums of the kind 1+2+3+... to equal a finite number.<p>If you assume the infinite sum of 1+2+3+... converges to a finite number you can easily prove a contradictory statement using the same summation properties assumed by that proof. Namely:<p><pre><code>  S  = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... = -1&#x2F;12\n  S2 = S-S = 0\n     = 1 + 2 + 3 + ...\n     - 1 - 2 - 3 - ... = 0\n     = 1 + 2 + 3 + ...\n         - 1 - 2 - ... = 0\n  S2 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + ... = 0\n  S3 = S2-S2 = 0\n     = (1-1) + (1-1) + ...\n     = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + ... = 0\n</code></pre>\nBut we &quot;derived&quot; in the original proof that S3 is equal to 1&#x2F;2, which is a contradiction. (You could derive S3 is 1&#x2F;2 from S but that&#x27;s what the article does in reverse.)<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;YuIIjLr6vUA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;YuIIjLr6vUA</a>')
