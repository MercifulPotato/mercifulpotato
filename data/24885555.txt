Not that advanced, I know.<p>In HFT firms you need to know some calculus as some of your data are going to be mathematical objects that are squarely in the field of calculus.<p>Game devs need to know about matrices and quaternions. Mostly on how to use it, no proofs necessary.<p>There are some fields and exploit chains where knowing some math to advanced math is necessary for hacking. For example checkout Triton and PIN from Intel and SMT solvers. I needed to instrument a binary program in class and use Triton to make an SMT equation, solve it and crack a password that way.<p>Data scientists need to know statistics but you could argue they aren’t software devs but I bet some of them are both while having data scientist as a title.<p>When performing speed optimization experiments, it is necessary in some cases to know statistics as you’re really finetuning things. Simply hitting run for a few times and observing a 5x to 10x speedup doesn’t fall into this category, as the speedup is obviously visible. I am talking about stuff that you can’t distinguish that easily.<p>In general life, I would say strong knowledge about statistics is helpful. It helped me accurately assess the covid threat where I live. It also taught me to take every small chance out there. If I take enough chances then the likelihood of me hitting one of them becomes very very likely. I played poker as a teenager and have used statistical&#x2F;chance-based thinking ever since and it helped me to experience more certainty in uncertain situations. I have played enough hands to know what a 1% chance of losing feels like (it feels like paying a fee to win the other 99 times, on average. Except if you’re not paying attention. Then it feels like you shouldn’t have lost and you’re probably going on tilt.).<p>That’s what I know so far.')
