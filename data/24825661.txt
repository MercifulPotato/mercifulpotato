You can, for example, build symbolic models by capturing human knowledge and use the symbolic models to guide and constrain the neural ones.<p>As an example from work I&#x27;m doing now, you might have a sample that the neural model recognizes as A, and causally-connected sample that it recognizes as B, and a symbolic model that says that a change from A to B implies C.')
