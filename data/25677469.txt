Here’s a good example, from AG of PA Josh Shapiro;<p>&gt; <i>@RepFredKeller LIE: PA officials violated the law in regards to signature verification on mail-in ballots.<p>FACT: Our Election Code-which a Republican-controlled state legislature revised in 2019-does not provide for rejecting mail-in ballots based on signature verification.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;joshshapiropa&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347063329404178432?s=21" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;joshshapiropa&#x2F;status&#x2F;1347063329404178432...</a><p>I don’t see how this is supposed to build trust that the election was run fairly and securely, in fact quite the opposite.<p>My point is not to debate specific failures. My point is it’s the responsibility of the systems and processes in place in the electoral system to instill trust in the populace that there is no fraud in the voting or the counting.<p>Instead, people were lied to about how votes would be cast, lied to about how votes would be counted, and the rules were changed arbitrarily in many places up to the final days and even hours of actual voting.<p>Again, my point is not how much fraud was actually present. But you can have a system people mostly trust even if they don’t like the outcome, or you can do things like not even checking the signature on millions of mail-in ballots.')
