Well, because of the convenience factor primarily. Buying from a store (or online service) requires driving, and&#x2F;or waiting for the mail to arrive.<p>When scrapbooking, or doing other projects with photos, its far more convenient to know that you have a printer that can instantly make a copy of any photo in your entire digital library. You don&#x27;t necessarily know what photo you want yet, you may need to lay out a few pages in the scrap book before you know what you want.<p>--------<p>In any case, a &quot;community printer&quot;, ie: the local library, is probably best for people who only need a few documents a year.<p>I think leveraging your local library resources is a skill that any adult should know how to do as well. When your documents grow beyond the ability for your local library, that&#x27;s when you get your own printer.')
