Even with the six years or so of support, our customers would piss and moan every time we&#x27;d tell them that RHEL&#x2F;Centos5 was hitting EOL and they&#x27;d need to upgrade their servers to Centos 6 or 7 to stay supported. Most of them wouldn&#x27;t even entertain the idea of &quot;upgrading&quot;: for them, business as usual was holding on to the existing OS as long as possible, then buying an entirely new server with the latest-greatest CentOS release freshly installed on it, and doing a data migration.<p>I can&#x27;t even imagine the amount of headache we would have gotten if they needed to upgrade every two years.')
