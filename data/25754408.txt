If so, your finances are probably not complicated, and you could probably do your own taxes in 1-4 hours. Of course, how much that is worth to you is up to you.<p>If you&#x27;re paying an accountant only for taxes, and not general finances, chances are your financial life and investments are very simple. Either that or you&#x27;re not managing them well :-)<p>Some people have multiple investments - some liquid (stocks), some illiquid (properties). They have side businesses (e.g. rental income). They have to allocate money for repairs on their rental properties. They have to set money aside for vacancies and property taxes, etc. You&#x27;re likely not going to find an accountant who&#x27;ll do this for a mere $400&#x2F;yr.<p>If you have rental income and are <i>not</i> managing this, sooner or later you&#x27;ll lose a lot of money. I guarantee it. Also, most people who have properties do not make that much net profit (typical is $100-200&#x2F;month per unit), so paying, say, $2000 to an accountant could wipe away the net profit from one unit for a whole year.<p>No one is trying to tell you that you  <i>should</i> use these tools. Many high income folks do fine without them. But if you have side businesses, you either need to spend a lot more on an accountant or get more disciplined. Most people will choose the former if they can afford it (which is probably a good idea).')
