The fact that programmers are feeling the need to externalise their business logic into &quot;config&quot; files is a sign that the language has failed. In a decent language you would write logic or &quot;config&quot; in the language itself, because the language would be a comfortable medium for expressing things (this is the norm in Python for example - while a few overengineered pieces insist on using TOML or something, most Python libraries don&#x27;t require any separate config, you just &quot;configure&quot; them the same way you do the rest of your programming, in Python).')
