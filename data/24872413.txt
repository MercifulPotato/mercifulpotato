Indeed, they typically bring technical hurdles: distributed systems are <i>hard</i> to reason through and IPC over the network introduces latency.  And you need a very strong ops team to implement them without major headaches.<p>But where they really start to shine is when regression testing takes ~days and your development cycles are screeching to a halt because you&#x27;ve got too many in flight features and not enough runway to land them.<p>What takes real skill is recognizing which of your monoliths should be grown and which ones need to be sliced down the middle.')
