Far from the claim of 10X. But none the less such individuals eventually garnered the title. Why? Because the impact of their invention were attributed to them far later than their original timing and more works by the normal human beings were simply ignored. We see this everyday, like Elon was touted as the real world iron man, where at the same time, he didn&#x27;t even founded Tesla. How about the original Tesla founders? Even the original founders were exaggerated far beyond their own contribution anyway...')
