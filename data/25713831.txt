Then you end up with an echo chamber formed partially around the dislike of an outgroup... Radicalization inevitably follows.<p>If people and institutions had just been more tolerant about allowing conservatives to make themselves heard the polarization and alternative reality could have been avoided (as conservatives would have been much more exposed to non-conservative ideas and counterarguments rather than entering a purity spiral. The opposite direction purity spirals of the american right and left are scary).<p>Banning Parler is just a bandaid, the end of this route is the banning of uncensored and unmonitored communication between people.')
