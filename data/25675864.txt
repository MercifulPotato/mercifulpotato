Unlike a monarchy or an oligarchic republic, the US a system comprised of free market systems and government institutions. Someone in the market can have more say than the government. Then either they or an opposing faction gets in the government and alters the policy. You can&#x27;t do that in a kingdom where your leading hegemon is the defacto law that is only inherited. The US is as much of an oligarchy as much as there is a shadow government of CEOs controlling the puppet strings of politicians. It just doesn&#x27;t work like that. Free market forces and the flow of money has more to do with US policy than 1 set of individuals does.')
