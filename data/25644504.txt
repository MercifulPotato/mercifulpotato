LDIR could copy a block of memory up to 64 KBytes (which would take nearly 1.4 million cycles), but even though it looked and behaved like a single instruction to the programmer it was actually looping over itself until the transfer has completed by simply not incrementing the program counter until register BC (used as byte counter) is zero. The downside is that each copied byte required to fetch and decode the whole 2-byte instruction again (costing 21 cycles per copied byte), but the upside is that those increment-and-repeat instructions are interruptible, since they are actually a regular loop of the same 21-cycle instruction over and over again.')
