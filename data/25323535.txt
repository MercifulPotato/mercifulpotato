If you&#x27;re blocking them, you&#x27;re getting whatever you want from the website without the downside of the ads. If you&#x27;re putting up with the ads, that&#x27;s a bit closer to a hostage situation. Same with LinkedIn - as long as you&#x27;re using it in a way that&#x27;s okay with you, I don&#x27;t see a problem.')
