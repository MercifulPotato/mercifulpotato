I will say though, that I personally experienced a long period of weird fatigue just prior to lockdown. I’d had weird not quite flu symptoms that didn’t quite fit the covid symptom list at the time. But due to timing of dinner with someone who later tested positive for covid, I have reason to think I may have actually had covid.<p>The fatigue was really stange, like pushing my kids on the swing made me pause for strength. And chasing my kids for more than a few steps made me wheeze and gasp for breath.<p>The fatigue lasted at least a month. And was definitely different than the effects of anxiety that happened later. Especially since exercise tends to be invigorating for me in the face of anxiety.<p>This isn’t to say that there aren’t also lockdown related health problems conflating the issue, but I have personal reasons to think long covid is a thing, especially when looking at all the system the virus seems to ravage.')
