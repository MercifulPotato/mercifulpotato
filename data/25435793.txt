Why?~~ (struck through in original)<p>I&#x27;ve done this to make little bash utilities, and while it&#x27;s cool when it works, it really doesn&#x27;t work.<p>Never try to guess the script&#x27;s location. You&#x27;re adding very weird, broken, magical behavior with no way to test it. So keep it simple and write these scripts to expect help from the user.<p>If you need resources for a bash script, expect them to be in the working directory, or a standard directory, or have the user pass paths in through environment variables or other means.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s gross and inelegant. It also won&#x27;t break mysteriously.')
