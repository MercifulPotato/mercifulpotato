Will chess and its nature of honing concentration force me to enhance that?<p>I listened to this article on the drive to work this morning, and I found it very interesting, and yet a bit hard to relate to. For neurotypical players, maybe it&#x27;s a lot more rewarding to sit down and concentrate on chess. When I play, I have some good streaks and then streaks where I get tilted out of my flow, and I try and force myself to stay in the chess box, and I burn up and find something else to do. I used to be 1600-1700 in high school, and now I&#x27;m barely treading water at 1250-1350 on lichess.<p>I&#x27;m hoping there&#x27;s someone with a brain like mine who has more experience to share.<p>Great link. Best I&#x27;ve seen in the front page in quite some time, imo.')
