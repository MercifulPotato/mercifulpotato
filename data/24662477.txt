It&#x27;s possible to live without buying a house or even renting by yourself (you can live with parents or rent a shared house with other young people). People in that situation would still have (and be recorded as having) a disposable income even though accomodation is an essential expense because owning your own personal house is not technically an essential expense.<p>Therefore, if wages are decent but housing is extremely expensive (which I believe is the case here in the UK, especially city suburbs) then median disposable income would continue to increase while the ability of young people to buy their own homes would continue to decrease.')
