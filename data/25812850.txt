However, when you&#x27;re dealing with enterprise that are <i>directly competing</i> with the main cloud providers on other verticals, they are not being lazy or annoying, they are being careful, and not without a reason, and avoid using their competitor&#x27;s cloud infrastructure.<p>Some of our clients have no problems using these cloud providers. Others wouldn&#x27;t go through them because that would leak information.<p>If I&#x27;m not mistaken, Google used to buy datacenters in stealth mode, under different companies created for that purpose, to avoid getting on Microsoft&#x27;s radar and keeping how successful search was from them.<p>We use GCP, for context.')
