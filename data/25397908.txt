What&#x27;s the next step?<p>What am I missing? Perhaps document management is not a thing at all nowadays? I can imagine that employee contracts are kept in HR system, IT contracts tracked in asset management system, client contracts at CRM, etc but this looks messy and there&#x27;s no central place at all. But someone&#x2F;somewhere still needs to keep an eye on expirations and in case of physical documents, where they are exactly.<p>So, how is it organised in your organisation?')
