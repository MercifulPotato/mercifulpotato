Usually I&#x27;m doing menial tasks or simple coding.<p>If I&#x27;m having a hard time focusing and need a distraction for some parts of my brain but not all of it, I have a &quot;deathcore&quot; (really more like melodic (tech) death metal) playlist where most of the songs sound very similar and you can&#x27;t understand a thing the vox are saying.<p>Typically if I&#x27;m super tired AND need to block out the outside world but even hard to understand screaming won&#x27;t cut it, I have to resort to either instrumental metal or LoFi hip hop beats to study to.<p>If I&#x27;m currently listening to music, I really only do a full stop&#x2F;pause to focus if I notice I&#x27;ve run a breakpoint three times and have no idea what I&#x27;ve been stepping thru, or if I&#x27;m trying to refactor or write a fresh, new logic flow and just can&#x27;t get my brain focused enough to &quot;check it&quot; for all possible paths. That&#x27;s when I cut the feed, double-time my focus, and once I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s &quot;safe&quot; I can hit play again.<p>Brains are weird and finicky I tell ya.')
