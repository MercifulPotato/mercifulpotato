Not all racist bigots are conservative. The vast majority of racist bigots are conservative and conservatives haven no problem supporting racist bigots. I&#x27;m struggling to understand what about the above statements you&#x27;d actually disagree with. It all follows logically.<p><pre><code>  * Conservatives are mostly from rural areas\n  * Rural areas are 90% white\n  * In group &#x2F; out group dynamics are determined largely by upbringing\n  * Rural white folk have far less opportunity to have PoC in their in-groups\n  * Out-group vs in-group is a major factor in discrimination and bias\n</code></pre>\nI didn&#x27;t have a PoC friend, coworker or classmate until I moved away from my family to California for work. There wasn&#x27;t a single black person in my high school. Why is it so hard for you to accept that people who spend the first 18 years of their life surrounded by other white Christians are more likely harbor racist beliefs than someone who grows up surrounded by people of many different colors and religions? From my &quot;outside&quot; perspective, you&#x27;re obviously stuck in a bubble in which people must go out of their way to pretend both sides of every issue are equally valid.')
