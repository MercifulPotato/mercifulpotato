Someone who uses LaTeX is likely to have a STEM background, so they&#x27;re more likely to to contribute to its ecosystem. On the other hand, a Libre Office user could be pretty much anyone, someone with no CS knowledge, who doesn&#x27;t approach using it in the same way a Libre Office dev might. Designers are the people who bridge this gap, and I&#x27;d love to see it done.<p>(This isn&#x27;t meant as a criticism of Libre Office. That&#x27;s just what first came to mind when I thought of a piece of open source software intended for a general audience.)')
