You don&#x27;t learn much in it at all. You learn more in what you&#x27;re willing to do on your own to build a portfolio on github. That&#x27;s one reason why I liked CS was because I could at least do that. Unlike Art though, it&#x27;s a corporate job that usually pays the bills.</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure (since I don&#x27;t have a degree myself), but focusing entirely on the degree and not at all on taking the opportunity to actually learn the material doesn&#x27;t seem to be a good strategy for getting a job at a tech company.<p>I mean, sure, take the curriculum as outlined with a huge grain of salt, practicality often trumps theory, and by all means demonstrate your abilities through a portfolio of open-source contributions, but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say that the certificate is the only thing that matters.<p>Frankly, students that more-or-less major in test-taking is the reason degrees aren&#x27;t valued very highly by many folks in the industry. Encouraging this attitude is only going to devalue degrees further seems contrary to the interests of anyone who actually has one, but isn&#x27;t any skin off my nose.<p>Job-seekers that specialize in interview-passing pose a similar challenge.')
