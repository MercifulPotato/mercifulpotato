In some cases we&#x27;ve decided as a society to protect people who might get a lot of anger directed at them through no fault of their own, like because of their race or sexuality. I doubt we&#x27;re going to extend those protections to include people who incite violence, but maybe we can extend them in other ways as appropriate to make sure people aren&#x27;t undeservedly deplatformed.')
