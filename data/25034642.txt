Of course the market is exited at the long term prospects of that.<p>IMHO this supports the OPs point, which is that the stock market in its current incarnation does not care about the lives of human beings.<p>Which is unacceptable. We collectively have enough creativity and intelligence figure out how to have a stock  which can not only reflect corporate profit but also human well-being.<p>I think it begins by acknowledging market externalities - pollution being one of them - which allow for activities which are profitable within the shared fiction of the market, but which are, in our broader shared reality, ultimately destructive.<p>The Happinese&#x2F;Well-being GDP also seems like an interesting idea.')
