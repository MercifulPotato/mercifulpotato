Library code (most library code anyway) should have unit tests covering the public api at minimum. Unit tests might also be a good idea for interpreted&#x2F;highly dynamic languages like Python, if only because you need to implement something like a compiler’s checks on signatures and arguments by hand in order to keep non trivial applications sane.<p>But generally I’m with you. Unit testing is overused and often makes code harder to read maintain and build on. That’s aside from it not providing information most unit test advocates think it provides.')
