I doubt I&#x27;d want to change pieces more than once a day.<p>I&#x27;m probably an outlier, but I&#x27;m an all digital person and my walls are bare due to the size, backlighting and power cables of the recent art frame fad products.  I&#x27;ve been waiting with bated breath for consumer ACeP screens.  I have a lot of artwork that I don&#x27;t think needs smooth gradients, even just a bit of color would be wonderful.<p>Anyways I just wanted to drop in and say I&#x27;d definitely buy something (and probably for a multiple of what current digital art frames go for).<p>On that note though, all I&#x27;ve seen of ACeP are promo photos and I don&#x27;t quite trust promo photos.  If you&#x27;ve any experience with them, is there anything you can say regarding how they actually perform visually?')
