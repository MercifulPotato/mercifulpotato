But I have no good suggestions for how to implement that. However, I have some bad suggestions just to illustrate what I mean:<p>INV(*) x, instead of 1&#x2F;x<p>INV(+) x, instead of -x<p>INV(f) x, instead of f^{-1}(x)<p>The last one should really be (INV(°) f) x = f^{-1}(x), where ° denotes function composition as the group operator. But involving this operator in the notation would probably be overkill in most circumstances.')
