But I leverage Messenger for a few contacts that prefer it, and that Messenger use seems to be sufficient to ward off the inactivity trigger.<p>I&#x27;m surprised they don&#x27;t just treat the Oculus usage similarly, and count that usage as &quot;activity&quot; in the context of considering an account active&#x2F;inactive.')
