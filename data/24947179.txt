Force the states to nominate electors by some other process?<p>Yes, with:<p>&gt; Toss out the states votes?<p>...as a fallback.<p>That&#x27;s actually how the norm of &quot;have a vote of the people in your state with the actual voting on, or completed by, the standard &#x27;election day&#x27;, and assign electors by a procedure that exists in law prior to that election&quot; rule works.
