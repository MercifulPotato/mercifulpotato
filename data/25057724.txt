Try using the wayback machine to see CNN from 2000.<p>You will see instantly how opinion&#x2F;intersectionalist&#x2F;narrative it is now relative to then.<p>It used to be Cable News, now it&#x27;s Cable Opinion.<p>The article points to this: there is an ideological war in the NYT that speaks to their bottom line:<p>&quot;Thereâ€™s still this huge gap between what the staff and audience and management want. The audience is Resistance Moms.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s also a huge gap between editorial and news at the NYT, apparently, they don&#x27;t like each other.<p>There are also different editors for each side - there is effectively 2 &#x27;Top Editors&#x27; so it&#x27;s a weird dynamic.<p>To be fair though - historically, papers were always very biased, usually in the names of their owners. Rich dudes would buy papers to slander their political opponents. So a mix of crude facts and the polity stabbing each other in the back.')
