We don&#x27;t squash every bug, we fix the most important ones. Otherwise, we&#x27;d be swatting bugs all day.<p>If there is a bug in the woods, and the bug takes a shit, but no one is around to hear it...<p>Now, is it going to kill a startup? Hardly. At that point, an MVP, it&#x27;s probably still small enough that the better decision is to rewrite it altogether. If you split the server and the UI to begin with, you can re-design the front-end and make a party out of it, try to make it pretty this time.<p>If you&#x27;re at the point where you need more than 1 person to handle the whole app, then you&#x27;re not a startup anymore, imo. You have a proven small business.')
