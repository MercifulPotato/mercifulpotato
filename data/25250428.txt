Imagine paying 30% more for software on your computer.<p>Thankfully nobody buys games on Steam to encourage such awful behavior.<p>I too long for the low markup over wholesale that we used to enjoy on boxed software before the advent of these predatory app stores.<p>&gt; At least on Google phones you&#x27;re allowed to jailbreak it and install whatever you want if you&#x27;re a power user, but you can&#x27;t do this on Apple&#x27;s phones.<p>It is undoubtely very true that you are allowed to jailbreak Google phones but Apple phones are forbidden. Chalk it up to Apple&#x27;s absolutely unbreakable security and bug-free OS and the DMCA.<p>It would be very nice if we could get a DMCA exception to explicitly legalize jailbreaking, like this one from 2018:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.copyright.gov&#x2F;1201&#x2F;2018&#x2F;faqs.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.copyright.gov&#x2F;1201&#x2F;2018&#x2F;faqs.html</a>')
