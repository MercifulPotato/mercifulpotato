There isn&#x27;t much stickiness there. It will be a disruptive S-curve, as soon as an upstart starts gaining traction.<p>Given how much of a cash cow that is for Google, I think when that happens, things will spiral. I&#x27;m not sure what this spiral will look like -- it&#x27;s different for each company -- but an example:<p>* Revenue goes down.<p>* Beancounters at Google can&#x27;t continue to offer $500k compensation, especially when so much of that are RSUs.<p>* A lot of top engineers company-wide leave for greener pastures. Worse decisions get made company-wide.<p>* Google finds it needs more money, and starts milking its customers more effectively. Data privacy goes down. Pricing goes up. Etc.<p>* Customers start to leave for free offerings from vendors with leaner cost structures.<p>... and so on.<p>I think a little bit of this kicked off when the qualified executives left. Schmidt&#x2F;Larry&#x2F;Sergey were quite good.<p>Fundamentally, though, Google seems brittle right now. It has a massive cost structure, which leaves them vulnerable (the problem isn&#x27;t salaries; it&#x27;s headcount). It&#x27;s too big to be nimble. And it&#x27;s not nearly as competent as it used to be. Or as it&#x27;s competitors. Amazon and Apple are both more competent and more nimble.')
