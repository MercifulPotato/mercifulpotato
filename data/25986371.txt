I was actually being literal there.<p>Moonje in 1931 went to Italy to learn from Mussolini about fascist organization and ideology, to use it for shaping RSS.<p>Here is a quote;\n&quot;“The Balilla institutions and the conception of the whole organisation have appealed to me most, though there is still not discipline and organisation of high order. The whole idea is conceived by Mussolini for the military regeneration of Italy. Italians, by nature, appear ease-loving and non-martial like the Indians generally. They have cultivated, like Indians, the work of peace and neglected the cultivation of the art of war. Mussolini saw the essential weakness of his country and conceived the idea of the Balilla organisation.... Nothing better could have been conceived for the military organisation of Italy.... The idea of fascism vividly brings out the conception of unity amongst people.... India and particularly Hindu India need some such institution for the military regeneration of the Hindus: so that the artificial distinction so much emphasised by the British of martial and non-martial classes amongst the Hindus may disappear. Our institution of Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh of Nagpur under Dr Hedgewar is of this kind, though quite independently conceived. I will spend the rest of my life in developing and extending this Institution of Dr Hedgewar all throughout the Maharashtra and other provinces.”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;frontline.thehindu.com&#x2F;cover-story&#x2F;moonje-amp-mussolini&#x2F;article6756630.ece" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;frontline.thehindu.com&#x2F;cover-story&#x2F;moonje-amp-mussol...</a>')
