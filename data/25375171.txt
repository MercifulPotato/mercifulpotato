As a purchaser of <i>any</i> product, I should not need to create an Internet account with the manufacturer, in order to use or continue to use a product. Once I buy it, it should be mine. I don&#x27;t want to have this ongoing relationship with your company. This trend of companies making you tether yourselves to them in order to use a product you paid for has to end. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of regulating tech, but need some kind of &quot;Right To Use&quot; law that says once you buy something, it&#x27;s yours and you don&#x27;t need to connect to the manufacturer to use it, and the manufacturer can&#x27;t revoke your right to use it.')
