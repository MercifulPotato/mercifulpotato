Does it allow directly returning the page cache memory without kernel copying also? I expect so (since it&#x27;s a modern, performance-oriented interface) but don&#x27;t know the details of how the buffer management worksâ€”seems like the kernel would have to supply the buffer then, it&#x27;d have to be at least page size, etc.<p>If so, it should have a similar benefit as what this article describes for mmap: either your program can completely avoid copying or it can do so in userspace with SIMD instructions.')
