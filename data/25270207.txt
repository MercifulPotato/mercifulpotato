Mike Echo<p>I&#x27;m very much enjoying optical flow research. If I could freely choose, my goal would be to create algorithmic features with known and well-behaved likelihood distributions by training AI components and then analyzing, understanding, and re-implementing them using explicit functions.<p>Earlier this year, I was leading Sintel Clean EPE matched with my H-v3 attempt - which sadly still included lots of black box AI for ambiguity resolution, but at least it was based on handcrafted linear filters to create the feature space. I&#x27;m hoping to release my next attempt in January, but as a hobby, competing alone against FAANG teams is kind of unwieldy ;)<p>I&#x27;m fortunate to be remote CTO for a US company, so there&#x27;s no hurry. But I&#x27;d be very curious to look into selfie drones or self-driving cars :) And I would be willing to free up 2-3 days per week to explore job opportunities there. So I guess I&#x27;m looking for a remote &amp; senior &amp; part-time AI&#x2F;ML research position, if such a thing exists.<p>In case that&#x27;s useful, I also have experience in related areas like Unreal Engine &#x2F; Houdini for data set generation or 3D printing &#x2F; SfM &#x2F; Photogrammetry &#x2F; Satellite processing for measuring things.')
