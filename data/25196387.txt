It seems almost entirely fixed on describing Engels as a rich womanizer who secretly adored Christianity. It has a section about his life in Manchester that doesn&#x27;t mention his life changing experience observing the slums and factories, and contains lines like<p>&gt; “The middle orders must increasingly disappear until the world is divided into millionaires and paupers, into large landowners and poor farm labourers,” Engels wrote, in terms that might well have been appropriated by a Democratic presidential hopeful in 2020.<p><i>edit</i> I looked up the quote, and it is Engels describing what he sees as the natural conclusion of the Industrial Revolution unless a total change of societal conditions occurred. Not something he was hoping happened or criticism of Britain enriching merchants as the article suggests.')
