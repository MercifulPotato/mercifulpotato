Nobody cares, ...<p>...because their &quot;volunteering culture&quot; comes off as too little too late.<p>It was <i>insane</i> for Twitter to open their HQ in the middle of SF&#x27;s skid row.<p>Let me point out one aspect that seems lost on a lot of downtown techies: They see you.  The bums and druggies and wastoids see the kids with wealth and success and not-fucked-up-ness of life and they resent it and them.  Right or wrong, it&#x27;s human nature.  So yeah, Twitter was never about solving Civic Center&#x27;s outdoor Bedlam, so they&#x27;re never going to get credit for saving the world when they are squatting in hell clearly not saving shit.  Eh?<p>&gt; Being a good neighbor in SF (or any other city in the inner Bay) is next to impossible.<p>Ask Rainbow Grocery.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rainbow.coop&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rainbow.coop&#x2F;</a>  No one blames them for anything.<p>&gt; Anything that happens becomes your fault no matter how unrelated you are, even if it&#x27;s fully self-inflicted. Like the tower, MUNIserable buses, or the housing shortage. Or SF General&#x27;s billing practices, blamed on Zuckerberg after he gave... I don&#x27;t even remember how many millions.<p>It&#x27;s not impossible, but what you&#x27;re talking about isn&#x27;t &quot;being a good neighbor&quot; you&#x27;re just complaining that people are blaming tech for their problems (whether it&#x27;s true or not.)<p>(And don&#x27;t get me started on Zuckerberg&#x27;s gross purchased virtue signalling.  He paid for a hospital, put his name on it so everyone would know, and now I can&#x27;t talk shit about him and the problems his massive wealth and bewheemoth company are causing, because it makes me look like an ingrate!?  Bullshit.  Bull.  Shit.)<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve struggled to care about being kind to, and contributing to, a community that seems to not want me. There is, as far as I can tell, nothing I can do to gain welcome.<p>Have you asked, &quot;What can do to gain welcome?&quot;<p>Before ~2001 or so SF was one of the most welcoming places in the whole of this planet of Earth.<p>&gt; The best I can hope for is a grudging sufferance, so long as I hate myself enough for being the wrong kind of different.<p>Okay if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re getting from SFians you are hanging out with the WRONG SFians.  This is a city of love, not self-hate.  (Insert off-color joke about Castro, gay culture, learning to overcome hate and self-hate to love yourself and others freely, etc. just as a reminder that this city has been so many things to so many people in it&#x27;s brief and drama-filled life.)<p>&gt; And why should I care about a community that refuses to grant me membership? Whose life will be improved by my misery?<p>Again, no one worth respecting wants you to be miserable or to hate yourself.<p>I don&#x27;t know you or what you&#x27;ve personally experienced here, so I can&#x27;t speak to that (I can&#x27;t even figure out why most people don&#x27;t like me.)  If you came here since ~2001 you&#x27;re already too late, the culture of welcoming was already thrashed by then.  (&quot;Dot-Com Boom&quot;, yeah?)<p>A lot of the community has been pushed out, and most of us who remain are wary of the new wave of techie folks, or yes, outright hostile.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve struggled to care about being kind to, and contributing to, a community that seems to not want me. There is, as far as I can tell, nothing I can do to gain welcome.<p>So go somewhere else?  I don&#x27;t mean that in a mean or disrespectful way.  I&#x27;m a proponent of the idea that just moving somewhere else can be an excellent way to solve problems.  It&#x27;s not a panacea, of course, but it often does the trick.<p>Maybe you&#x27;re not weird enough to hang with the old skool SF crowd.  It&#x27;s not a reflection on you.  SF has long been the city of crazies.  This whole tech-Mecca thing is hella recent.  Less than a generation.<p>The old joke: &quot;All the crazy people in America move to California, and all the crazy people in California move to SF.  (And if you&#x27;re too crazy for SF you move to Berkeley.)&quot;<p>- - - -<p>Benioff gets a pass because he supported Proposition C.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abc7news.com&#x2F;marc-benioff-salesforce-prop-c-homeless-proposition&#x2F;4586423&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abc7news.com&#x2F;marc-benioff-salesforce-prop-c-homeless...</a>')
