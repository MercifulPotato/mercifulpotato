If I wish to watch a video that I downloaded to my phone, I can do that without having connection to the internet. If I wish to edit a photo with an application on my phone, all the processing of that file can be done locally on the device. Having a cloud backup of a device does not mean that there&#x27;s no value in having a device with its own capabilities outside of the cloud.<p>&gt; If the answer is: you&#x27;re screwed, then maybe storing all your stuff on a device small enough to be easily stolen&#x2F;broken was a bad idea.<p>For any valuable data you should have more than one backup solution, including data you store on your phone. Just because there&#x27;s more risk of losing your phone than your desktop pc in your home doesn&#x27;t mean that you take less measures to mitigate the chance of data loss on your desktop pc.')
