The &quot;Mishima VI, Closing&quot; piece is some of his best work.<p>The author&#x27;s final observation, &quot;Perhaps we need a Mishima to shock us out of our complacency.&quot; is something he should be careful about wishing for. (Though the idea of Ian McEwan storming a military base was very funny, I thought Stephen Fry would be even better equipped. &quot;...ah, well, right then, moving along...&quot; )<p>What makes Mishima so dangerous today is that he produced beautiful art and culture from which the downstream political conclusions were unavoidable. This is one side effect of good art. Political theory itself is a kind of vulgar pseudo intellectual haggling compared to aesthetic truths and their self evidence that great art demonstrates. As an example from another of today&#x27;s threads, a Chopin mazurka does more for Polish national identity than any explanation could do. Writing itself is an inferior (but necessary) form because it only describes in a narrow dimension instead of demonstrates over multiple senses. This is what I think Misihma also understood. I only read the Sea of Fertility books (in English some years ago) and they&#x27;re demanding, but this muscular and humane expression of aesthetic truth and even divine power is the seed for the survival of the human spirit. A revolt against becoming the bland, homogenized &quot;last man,&quot; may very well originate from the sentiments Mishima was able to bring words and life to.')
