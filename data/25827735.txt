It treats all arrays as row-major, while Julia arrays are column major. That is pretty unfair.\n2. It creates lots of unnecessary copies, as slices in Julia does not return views (but you can easily make them do that.)\n3. It creates an output array with an abstract element type, `zeros(Complex, pols, L)`, which can seriously hurt performance.\n4. Benchmarking should preferably be done with BenchmarkTools.jl, though I&#x27;m not sure it that makes a big difference here.<p>It&#x27;s ok to be a novice user of a new language, but when comparing and publishing benchmarks like this, I really think the author should solicit some feedback to avoid obvious rookie mistakes. I found no way of offering any feedback on that blog, however.')
