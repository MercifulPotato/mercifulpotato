Some people got a one-time $1200 check. What could they have done with $1200 that made you lose faith in UBI?<p>Or are you referring to the $600 that supplemented the unemployment insurance? But those went to people who were just recently working and had their livelihoods wrecked by government action and&#x2F;or inaction. I&#x27;m pretty sure you would agree they deserve that money and it&#x27;s okay for them to do what they damn please with it. Even if that means them not going back to work for some time because they have the freedom to. Imagine how less fucked we would be if we just paid the majority of non-essential workers to stay the hell home. Less competition for the essential jobs, so people who do really want to work can work and the essential jobs will be filled.')
