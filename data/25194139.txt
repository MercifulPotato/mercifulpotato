For example it&#x27;s far better for the program to crash immediately on an unexpected null than to pass through a bunch of functions that never expected to receive null but &quot;defensively&quot; bail out in that case, and then you eventually get an error miles away from the original problem. Erlang achieves extremely high reliability through its explicit &quot;let it crash&quot; philosophy: as soon as any component gets into an unexpected state it should abort, and rely on higher-level error handling, rather than try to continue.')
