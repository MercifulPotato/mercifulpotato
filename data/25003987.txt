Item(by='kmtrowbr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604626350, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25002260, text='&gt; the kind of problem that multitudes of cities and regions in the world are desperately trying to recreate<p>I always tell people that, &quot;it is a nice problem to have.&quot; Totally agree with you.<p>But it is still a problem nonetheless. It&#x27;s fair enough to raise taxes to try to solve some of the problems which hugely successful businesses have created by displacing people.<p>Building more housing: YES, more dense housing: YES, programs for homeless people: YES -- on the back of such success, we should have all the money we need to maintain San Francisco.<p>YES my presence is symptomatic of the problem but, being self-aware, I try to address that by genuinely loving San Francisco, paying more taxes myself when I am asked to do so, participating in local art and culture, and not treating it like a transient place but rather my home and a treasure.<p>Regarding your statement that I&#x27;m trying to block others&#x27; advancement: proposition L is about taxing companies whose CEOs make 100-600x more than the median at their company. I am not hurting other regular folks by supporting this, furthermore I&#x27;m not even hurting the CEOs (they make 100x more than normal folks).  If you benefit from society to the point where you&#x27;re the leader of such a company, for goodness sake, give a little back gracefully, that&#x27;s progressive taxation and it has been one of the foundations of our society since 1862.<p>SF is a liberal, expensive place, because supporting such population density and giving everyone a high quality of life is hard and requires work and money.  If we categorically define all taxation as bad, we lose all basis for collective action.  America is getting lost in the labyrinth of its own arguments.')
