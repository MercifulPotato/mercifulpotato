They cost between 2000 to 3000 dollars. While there are some trade offs (consumer 4k projectors aren&#x27;t real 4k but rather display 4 1080p images... it&#x27;s weird), but I haven&#x27;t run into any of them that come with &#x27;smart&#x27; features. The other trade off is that projectors are designed to be for &gt;=100&quot; setups so it&#x27;s only available as a premium product.<p>Personally, the introduction of micro LED TVs in the next few years may make 100&quot; TVs an affordable reality so I am a bit bearish on jumping into consumer projector market if you haven&#x27;t already.<p>Best bit is to just not connect the TV to the internet. I have not come across a model that requires an internet connection to work.')
