Proton &amp; wine makes gaming on linux genuinely surprisingly performant: I have enjoyed several AAA games (and am continuing to do so). I really don&#x27;t know why they do not like Vulkan or don&#x27;t want to provide a compatibility layer for it. One of the games mentioned is Fallout New Vegas, which apparently gets 15 FPS outdoors, at the lowest graphics quality settings, in a game &gt;10 years old. I&#x27;ve literally just finished that on my linux box, under proton, with the gog copy installing brilliantly under lutris and with a 3rd party higher-resolution texture pack. Apple are really shooting themselves in the foot.<p>Also, from the article on a call of duty online game:<p>&gt; Everything felt smooth, works flawlessly in highest settings available, but only few minutes until your account get banned :( SoC power consumption is around 3.5W<p>I&#x27;m not surprised that perhaps many devs na√Øvely assumed that if you&#x27;re not running x64, you&#x27;re a &quot;cheater&quot; [or in a VM, which apparently is often also &quot;cheating&quot;...sigh]. I&#x27;d be interested to know how many of the god-awful DRM schemes that BigGames like to run (like Denuvo) take to being emulated in crossover-or-wine-running-under-rosetta. I bet they don&#x27;t like it!')
