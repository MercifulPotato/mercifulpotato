Having CNNs and RNNs separately was relatively hard to work with (especially RNNs). It would be bad if we would need different hardware accelerator architectures for the two most important &#x2F; different fields of AI. Also having a unified architecture will help with mixed tasks.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lucidrains&#x2F;lambda-networks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lucidrains&#x2F;lambda-networks</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3qxJ2WD8p4w" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3qxJ2WD8p4w</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openreview.net&#x2F;pdf?id=xTJEN-ggl1b" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openreview.net&#x2F;pdf?id=xTJEN-ggl1b</a>')
