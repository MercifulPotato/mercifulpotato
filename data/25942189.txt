Push changes from primary repo to Github mirror<p>3. archive Github mirror repo<p>There&#x27;s a race condition where someone might see the unarchived repo and start a pull request during the brief period where the sync is taking place, but the possibility that they&#x27;d both start and then fisish a pull request during sync periods seems remote.')
