It&#x27;s much easier and more productive to not do proofs and rely on runtime architecture for reliability, it adds relatively little complexity and asks very little from developers, it stays almost the same as regular software development. And it&#x27;s still necessary to do regardless whether you have proofs or not.<p>And types like machine types are of course irrelevant for BEAM, well, maybe they&#x27;ll start to matter a bit with JIT, but probably still not, BEAM with JIT is still not going to be a performance miracle.')
