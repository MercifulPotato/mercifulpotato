Item(by='ArnoVW', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610102911, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25680954, text='I only learned a couple of months ago that Christiaan&#x27;s dad was a famous ambassador of Willam III of Orange, during the  Glorious Revolution. The book is &quot;Oranje tegen de Zonnekoning&quot;, which describes the epic rivalry between William and the &quot;roi soleil&quot;. Amazing read (unfortunately only in Dutch I think)<p>If you want to read more about the Huygenses, I (also accidentally) got &quot;Dutch Light: Christiaan Huygens and the Making of Science in Europe&quot; for Christmas, and it seems pretty well written too.<p>I&#x27;m always amazed by how much we know about the inner thoughts of people that lived 400 years ago, simply because their most private conversations were all by mail.<p>Geert Mak traces the 20th century, by using a narrative focused on his father (&quot;My fatherâ€™s century&quot;, good read too). He says that as of the 70&#x27;s it is hard to get an idea of what was happening in his family, simply because the phone entered the household. No more long letters to the rest of the family.<p>I wonder sometimes the challenges that will face historians in 100 years, when they will analyse our culture.')
