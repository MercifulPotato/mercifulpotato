Give me one single solitary shred of evidence that they have the money they claim to have. The burden of proof is on them and I’m sure as confident as you are you’ve seen some?<p>For instance if I told you I had a trillion dollars in an offshore bank account, and that if you gave me $1 I’d give you a funbuck and throw it on the pile with no obligation to redeem it, would you up and believe me right away? If so I may just get into this crypto business after all.')
