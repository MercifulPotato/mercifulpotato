Then read Jacques Pepin&#x27;s <i>La Technique</i>. Then watch Jacques&#x27; old tv show <i>Fast Food My Way</i>. You will become a decent cook just from these 3 sources. It covers all the basics you need to know, and the rest comes from experience. (Jacques also put a 3 hour video of techniques on YouTube recently, go find and watch it. And check the JP Foundation website for more recipes and videos)<p>All recipes are just patterns and methods applied to ingredients. Often there is a vast range of tolerance in each, and you learn the tolerances mainly by exceeding them. So experiment with recipes and you will learn what doesn&#x27;t work, which leaves only what does.')
