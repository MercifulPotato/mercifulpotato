Sure, I agree that The Open Source Definition doesn&#x27;t encompass something like the Elastic License, but :shrug:<p>Well, they explicitly promised that they would stay Apache 2.0 licensed, which was a lie. And they&#x27;re no longer open source software. So yeah that&#x27;s a big deal in my book.<p>&gt; Who exactly is having the rug pulled out from under them? AWS? As they very clearly state in the article: &quot;When AWS decides to offer a service based on an open source project, we ensure that we are equipped and prepared to maintain it ourselves if necessary&quot; (presumably because they understand that the license could change, or the maintainers could just stop maintaining).<p>I wasn&#x27;t referring to Amazon, I was referring to the community overall. And don&#x27;t get me wrong, the community will be fine because we&#x27;ll have high-quality forks. I&#x27;m just pointing out the scumminess of what Elastic did for the company that claims to be the little guy getting exploited.<p>But they absolutely did pull the rug. Or as a better analogy, they shut the door behind themselves.')
