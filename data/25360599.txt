I&#x27;m neither against Oracle nor Oracle&#x27;s development of Java or Java&#x27;s development in the interest of Oracle mainly.<p>I&#x27;m only against Oracle&#x27;s motives about making Java a walled garden and usage of this programming language to extort license money from others.<p>On the other hand, I personally use OpenJDK runtime countless times every day, knowingly or unknowingly. I&#x27;m written Java in the past and have no reservations or bad things to say about it. Contrary to your view about other programming languages, I&#x27;m pretty neutral against every other programming language.<p>&gt; C and C++ development is sponsored by the corporations of Apple, Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, Google.... PHP was mostly driven by Facebook needs.<p>There are no news for me here either. Development of a programming language or any tool with input from its users is a non-issue. Also, every user has needs from the products they use, so they will provide feedback and communicate their needs.<p>The difference, I want to highlight and highlight again, none of these corporations can use C++ or PHP or Python to extort license money from their customers. PHP is owned by Zend, so they may try. C++ is almost public domain now. LLVM is under apache license. Either way I use GCC which is GPL. Python is 20+ years old and is also almost public domain.<p>Contributing to a tool to get what you want is different from <i>owning</i> a tool and to use it to extort licensing money is different.<p>Either way, as aforementioned, I have nothing against Java, contrary to your views against other programming languages.')
