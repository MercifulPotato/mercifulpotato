I&#x27;ve never been much of a wine person. It&#x27;s not without trying. I&#x27;ve had everything from cheap boxed Franzia to a several hundred dollar bordeaux (that was totally wasted on me). I took a wine class where I was given samples and explicitly told &quot;this is what good wine tastes like&quot;. I don&#x27;t dislike wine and I don&#x27;t think wine is bad, but the 10% of wine that is good doesn&#x27;t appeal to me that much.')
