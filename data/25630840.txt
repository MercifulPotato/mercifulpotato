This could be done with political will or reproduction of their capacity.<p>Personally, I wonder whether a UBI in a developed country could work to essentially lower their external &#x27;trading costs&#x27;. Try to change their thought processes at the margin. i.e. Make the local goods and services out compete the foreign goods&#x2F;services through moving local costs not observed in foreign goods&#x2F;services to localized costs. i.e. Maybe a person making a UBI would be willing to do a job for (X+U) - where (X+U) is their reservation price, X is the foreign price, and U the UBI.<p>Edit-flipped signs')
