I still remember the shock of so many people there, including EU citizens who didn&#x27;t know where they&#x27;d live or work when it was all over. I often wonder what happened to some of those people.<p>As I recall, nobody who actually lived in London wanted Brexit to happen - the only person I met who did was a cabbie who lived outside of the city. He told us we were his last ride. He had to get home to vote. I hope at least he got what he wanted.<p>From my perspective, Brexit has always seemed like an absolutely massive economic, political, and cultural self-own. It seems like it was born from a sense of self-importance that was based in a kind of Britain that just doesn&#x27;t exist anymore - one that is the head of an empire, not just a piece of one. I understand why the arguments for it worked, but I wish they hadn&#x27;t, because this nonsense (and much worse!) was always where it was going to end up.<p>But I&#x27;m not British, so what do I know? My country hasn&#x27;t done much better in terms of political decision making. For those who supported it here, I sincerely hope it&#x27;s been worth it.')
