Item(by='derriz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603749780, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24901853, text='It&#x27;s fairly straightforward to offer some functionality in this area with hand-written recursive descent parsers.<p>For example, a language with a C-like syntax, you&#x27;ll often be parsing a sequence of statements separated by semi-colons (a block).  If a statement fails to parse, you can just consume tokens until you hit the next semi-colon and then try to continue to parse statements from there.<p>Fairly crude approaches like this are easy to implement (at least with recursive-descent) but can be surprisingly effective.  It&#x27;s easy to construct counter examples where an approach like this will get it wrong but in practice it&#x27;s hugely more useful to the poor user than just abandoning the parse completely.')
