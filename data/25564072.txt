What&#x27;s at the surface is not representative of its average composition, or of the average composition of the material it was formed from.<p>In particular, the Earth&#x27;s surface is highly depleted in platinum group elements compared to carbonaceous chondrites.  That&#x27;s because those elements strongly segregated into the molten metal that flowed into the Earth&#x27;s core when the planet was very hot.   Ditto for gold.   The Earth&#x27;s surface is also depleted in tellurium; this is thought to be due to the volatility of TeH2.  On the other hand, the earth&#x27;s continental crust has three orders of magnitude higher concentration of uranium than the chondritic average; the Earth is likely the best place in the solar system to mine that element.')
