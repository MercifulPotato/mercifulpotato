The article only cites download numbers declining in the various app stores.<p>Lots of people seem to have downloaded Signal or Telegram, but how many deleted WhatsApp? I don&#x27;t plan on deleting it and I&#x27;m going to approve the new T&amp;C or whatever it is, but I&#x27;m quite happy to migrate to Signal for my contacts who use both.<p>Presumably losing x% of conversations is just as bad as losing x% of monthly users for Facebook, so maybe this is moot, but it&#x27;s still lazy journalism.')
