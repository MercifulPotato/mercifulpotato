In many ways the core system of Windows is <i>much</i> better than Linux. Largely because you just don&#x27;t have the pointless fights about systemd vs. not, or X vs. Wayland, or foo vs. bar - you have a cohesively designed, unified base platform instead. Lots of very fantastic edge-case scenarios that are so trivial &amp; seamless, and with functional GUIs &amp; tooling so you can discover on your own more easily. Run out of disk space? Pop in another drive and just say &quot;extend&quot; and your existing partition is instantly expanded across both drives - no reconfiguration, no broken fstabs, no &quot;well since you didn&#x27;t anticipate this originally you now just can&#x27;t do that&quot;, etc... Hell, Window&#x27;s can handle a GPU driver crashing so quickly &amp; seamlessly that you wouldn&#x27;t even realize it happened if it didn&#x27;t give you a little notification saying &quot;hey something might be wrong with your GPU since it just crashed, take a look maybe?&quot; It won&#x27;t even kick you out of a game when it happens. Similarly you typically don&#x27;t need to reboot to update drivers. Heck, converting from a &quot;bare metal&quot; install to a hypervisor is a matter of checking a box &amp; rebooting.<p>But Microsoft then throws a bunch of stupid crap on top of it like Candy Crush ads for a piece of software that costs $200 and kinda ruins it. Or with all the deep hooks for Windows Defender &amp; friends that just cripple process launching &amp; file creation performance.')
