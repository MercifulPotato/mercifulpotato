I don&#x27;t know what the state-of-the-art is in synthetic fuels.<p>Another option would be to find a way to transfer electricity to a moving aircraft so it could recharge in the air, but I have difficulty imagining how that could be made to work (microwaves?  high-power lasers and solar panels?  wires held aloft by zeppelins?), especially within the constraints of modern technology.')
