It also made it impossible to only share a subset of the music.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.funkwhale.audio&#x2F;users&#x2F;upload.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.funkwhale.audio&#x2F;users&#x2F;upload.html</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.funkwhale.audio&#x2F;admin&#x2F;0.17.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.funkwhale.audio&#x2F;admin&#x2F;0.17.html</a>')
