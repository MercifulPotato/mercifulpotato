So that everyday, I have a set number of questions to try, and I don&#x27;t have to make that decision. And if I don&#x27;t get it the first time, no problem, I know it&#x27;ll come up again. And if I do get it, the goal is to get faster.<p>Anyone else study this way, like an Anki for interview questions? If not, how do you pick what questions to practice and what order do them in when studying for interviews?')
