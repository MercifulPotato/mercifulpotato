I am so glad Apple is still pushing the envelope.<p>Back in the old days we used to get a doubling of performance every year or two. Then Intel got into trouble and has been producing the same chips for what 4-5 years? Essentially just minor changes.<p>It’s not really Apple’s fault that the rest of the industry is lagging so badly on performance. My Nokia was fast enough, of course no one “needs” a faster phone. But it only appears so much faster because the rest of the industry has stagnated.<p>Had Intel kept their tick-tock cadence then these new &quot;faster” phones would hardly be considered fast.')
