It&#x27;s not &#x27;one user&#x27; that audits your Linux distribution. Can something be snuck in that nobody notices into the source? Of course. But it&#x27;s <i>incredibly</i> disingenuous to claim that because one user cannot audit all the software running on their machine that we should abandon the concept of auditable software in general and accept corporate lockdown. There&#x27;s a massive difference between &#x27;my operating system&#x27;s code is open and many people have at least glanced at it&#x27; and &#x27;this is a total secret beholden only to one corporate identity and nobody can have a look even if they had all the technical knowledge in the world&#x27;.')
