Every single thing I&#x27;ve used that is an Atlassian product drives me nuts. I really don&#x27;t understand how anyone at any point looked at Jira or Confluence or anything Atlassian puts out and said &quot;yep, this is the best version of this thing I&#x27;ve seen, sign me up&quot;. I&#x27;ve been using JIRA for years now, and it never gets any easier or better. I can never find what I want, I can never remember how to do things. I have to assume it&#x27;s just me since everyone uses these things though.')
