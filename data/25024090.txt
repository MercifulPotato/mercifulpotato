If one side will help you and one side wont, you&#x27;re going to have a tough time holding on to your rights regardless of one election win.<p>A more unified America with a strong middle class wouldn&#x27;t need to undermine one group to bolster another, and you would have more moderate political candidates rather than having to choose between two distant evils every election.<p>I get to not care because years of moderate politics in my country has seen a general trend toward humanitarianism regardless of which &quot;side&quot; wins. Recently the &quot;right-wing&quot; political group of my country protected same-sex marriage, even though it doesn&#x27;t align with their ideology, because they&#x27;re only moderate-right, and so their priorities still lie in pleasing the majority and not extreme political interests.<p>Obviously the US would have a long way to go before it could ever take any of this advice seriously, I was just trying to point out that the divided nature of your population drives the politics too.')
