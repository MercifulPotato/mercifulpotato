Item(by='tpoacher', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606737422, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25252794, text='My biomedical engineering thesis was entirely coded on octave, and I still use it daily even though my current employment does not directly relate to it code-wise.<p>Also, while perhaps this example is overplayed, Andrew Ng&#x27;s hugely successful coursera nanodegree on Machine Learning is taught on octave. Andrew Ng explains the reasons for this beautifully in his course, and I agree.<p>As for &quot;I thought it would be a valuable skill; I could not have been more wrong&quot;, it depends. To remove the obvious comment, there is octave, matlab, and octave&#x2F;matlab. Matlab is still 100% huge in the industry, and getting into this path through octave is at least equivalent, if not better (given you also have to learn more under-the-hood concepts than you might have to in matlab).<p>However, I will assume here that you are referring specifically to the whole &quot;investing in the octave ecosystem on top of already knowing the matlab language&quot; issue. I would argue that octave tends to be more used in teaching and academia, so you&#x27;re partly right. But at the same time, I would argue that as an open source project, the opportunities for participation and the transferable skills you can get from that are extremely relevant in any resume.')
