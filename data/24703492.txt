I didn&#x27;t want to make any claim as to the validity of the arguments beyond the fact that I think they&#x27;re convincing, and in general, a large portion of professional philosophers consider them to be too. That doesn&#x27;t mean they are correct of course (in part or entirely), only that they have some serious weight in the development of moral philosophy.<p>I find it pretty easy to accept some of the arguments within a certain framework, even if I don&#x27;t subscribe to the framework itself. For instance, I might think that God may have or not have certain qualities or attributes, according to a theological framework, even though I am an atheist, and the question of God is not at all relevant to me. I operate the same way about many moral questions.<p>On the other hand, I also realize I should spend some time backing up and at least thinking about my alternatives, even if they are &#x27;null&#x27; alternatives where I believe the burden of proof is on someone else. With regard to moral nihilism and the burden of proof, for instance, the moral skeptic may need to explain why moral intuitions are not a good starting point (or dismiss the role of intuition entirely, but she still needs an argument). A moral non-cognitivist needs to get around the embedding problem, for instance too.')
