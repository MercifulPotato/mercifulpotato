Most companies do not care. If you can do the job and pass their interview process they will make you an offer. I very rarely had anyone look down on &quot;job hoppers&quot; and if they did it would be when someone had 4-7 six month stints in a row. Normally those people would just say those were contract gigs and then the company wouldnt care.')
