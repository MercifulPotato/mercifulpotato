If people unionize and it has a positive outcome, great! If not, that sucks! It, like many professional moves, boils down to choice and I&#x27;m not here to give career advice, especially not to an industry as a whole.<p>If you don&#x27;t mind, could you elaborate on what parts of your statement are explicitly classist in your estimation? I genuinely don&#x27;t understand your point.<p>Which jobs would you suggest every person could eventually excel at equally because of the tools that have been invented? What about those jobs is so universally accomplishable that all humans are made truly equal less experience?<p>I agree that businesses should have the ability to promote based on seniority or skill! Limiting that wouldn&#x27;t be efficient!<p>Do all unions preclude that flexibility by the very concept of their existence? I could imagine that in some cases it could be possible to create an agreement that serves all parties as best as possible.<p>&gt;Yes, many more people COULD if given the opportunity, and education, and investment. But not EVERYONE can. And not everyone learns at the same pace.<p>Sorry. I genuinely do not understand this statement.<p>It&#x27;s a statistical fact that not every person can develop the same skillset and inhabit the same role at the same time, yes. I&#x27;m not really clear about what that has to do with anything, considering that most large and valuable projects require multiple people with multiple skillsets to realize their potential.<p>Sorry, I&#x27;m a bit baffled by this. Could you elaborate a bit on your &quot;classist&quot; idea for software development a little further as far as how the entire profession should not take part in unionizing &quot;100%&quot; which I take to mean across all businesses and projects?')
