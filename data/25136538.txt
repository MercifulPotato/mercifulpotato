Biden and Trump both sounded so much more intelligent in their younger days; I don&#x27;t understand why we insist on only allowing people to lead our country when they&#x27;re at their worst.<p>And despite billing himself as the alternate to the dynastical system, Trump quickly used the presidency as a vehicle for advancing his family&#x27;s careers.  Biden did the exact same thing as vice president - you can tell me what Hunter Biden did was &quot;legal&quot; till the cows come home, he obviously profited immensely from foreign business opportunities that existed solely because his dad was VP.<p>It&#x27;s a problem that so-called liberal people love claiming that a scandal has been &quot;debunked&quot; because it was, in fact, legal to engage in extreme corruption.  Do we really accept that this system is legitimate, much less superior to those horrible Russians and Chinese?  As if they don&#x27;t call their corruption legal, too?')
