Even if the CCP is beloved, you can’t really believe a poll result like this when a social credit system is in place.  That turns<p>a closed loop system of strong state control with honest feedback from the people<p>into<p>an open loop system where authoritarian leaders live in their own little world and make decisions likewise.<p>That’s a fragile strategy moving forward, as the Mao era has taught.<p>US hegemony?  What actions by China on the world stage in the last 100 years should lead any country to trust China over the US?<p>WWI and WWII bought the US a lot of good faith, the world economic system has stumbled but led to unprecedented prosperity, including in China, there has been no World War in the last 75 years under Pax Americana (USSR&#x2F;Russia gets a lot of credit there too, and the EU).  Real leadership in the nuclear age.
