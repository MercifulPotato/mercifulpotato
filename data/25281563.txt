I recall reading a year or so ago that Bitcoin was using the same amount of electricity as a small developer nation.  I expect the other financial systems use more than that in total, but consider that these other financial systems handle orders of magnitude more transaction volume, and include a lot more services than Bitcoin does.<p>&gt; <i>We can just use renewable energy sources long term.</i><p>Renewables aren&#x27;t free.  It costs time, effort, and energy to build the infrastructure (solar panels, windmills, etc.), not to mention caustic chemicals for some of these, which <i>do</i> have negative environmental effects.  Maintenance has costs, as does eventual replacement.  The land required to house these production farms also is not free.<p>Yes, the energy produced by renewables is obviously much much cleaner than that produced by other means, but they still have costs.')
