That should honestly be most jobs, and almost all white collar jobs.<p>Time theft is an interesting concept to me because it implies you&#x27;re being paid for the time rather than for the utility of your labor. Why do you think time theft is important in your job?<p>&gt;But even some of my direct reports will slack significantly more if they think I’m not online. Responses that are normally in minutes take hours etc.I have to now probe for updates etc. Much less time is spent on projects of interest (that also benefit the business) during periods of less “fires”. Instead it’s more bare minimum. I know many try to be understanding (myself included) because many have more than just work to deal with but it would need to be addressed if it’s becomes a norm.<p>Are you saying people are less productive generally? If I noticed the same I&#x27;d look into a few things: Are you sure that your KPI&#x27;s focus on productivity properly? If people are performing at the minimum, are you setting the correct goals?')
