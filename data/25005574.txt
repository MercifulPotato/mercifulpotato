End of story. There&#x27;s actually nothing else to it.<p>There&#x27;s actually another solution, but people don&#x27;t talk about it: reduce demand. Break some windows. Have a few organized robbery parties. Hold monthly &quot;Stabby Sundays&quot; where you just stab people randomly. That&#x27;ll drive down demand, and prices will drop like a rock.<p>Obviously, I&#x27;m joking. Building more houses is the only solution to the problem of &quot;a lot of people want to live here&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s almost impossible to build new houses.&quot;')
