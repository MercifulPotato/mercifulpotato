Either a sentence is true or it is not (or it is non-deducible).<p>The sentence `some people who live in Brooklyn do speak with a Brooklyn accent` is not coercible to `People who live in Brooklyn speak with a Brooklyn accent`.<p>I follow his argument that a syllogistic world view is not practical in a distributed, collaborative semantic web sense. But this is kind of far away from his statement: &quot;Syllogisms are Not Very Useful&quot;.')
