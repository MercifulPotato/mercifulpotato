The opinion provided by &#x2F;u&#x2F;Shacklz is unfortunately rather widespread in Switzerland and mostly based on some outdated views on the role of the army (&quot;plausible during the height of the cold war&quot;).<p>As Switzerland&#x27;s strategic reserve, the army has a broad array of tasks, ranging from support in low threat levels (current example: preparing for the storage and distribution of Covid vaccines), supporting the police (example: World Economic Forum) to high threat levels (where tanks and artillery are needed, so this is also being trained for).<p>In the end, the Swiss Army is the Swiss Army knife for Switzerland&#x27;s national security. Articles like this one that talk about defunct bunkers that were built for a very specific cold war scenario (but again: are now decommissioned) naturally don&#x27;t really help.<p>Furthermore, the &#x27;bottomless barrel&#x27; also completely misses the mark, as Switzerland&#x27;s military expenditure is very low (around 0.7% of the GDP, NATO benchmark is around 2% for comparison).')
