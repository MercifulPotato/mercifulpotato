Item(by='WoodenChair', descendants=None, kids=[25312743], score=None, time=1607151825, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25311287, text='I feel this way too, but I often find those circulating articles are in mainstream media by people who don&#x27;t understand what they&#x27;re reporting on or in &quot;science will cure everything&quot; blogs. However, this is a summary posted on one of the most respected journals in the world&#x27;s website. The article&#x2F;study it is summarizing was peer reviewed and developed by scientists at some of the world&#x27;s top institutions. Sure, we shouldn&#x27;t get caught up in reputation as a marker of quality, but at the same time it does count for something... this is not the same as most of the breathless articles that I see circulate on social media.')
