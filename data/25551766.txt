Item(by='Arch-TK', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609084059, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25547205, text='I get that doing APIs right is hard and that when you&#x27;re trying to release a proprietary product having to worry about what libraries every system comes with may be a struggle and that if you&#x27;re developing a webapp you may want everyone to have a consistent test environment regardless of what flavour of archlinux they&#x27;re running but I really do NOT want to have to spend 2 hours downloading 300GiB of software updates when OpenSSL wets the bed and has a critical vulnerability. The nice thing about libraries and shared objects is that when I get an email saying: &quot;Critical CVE found in something important that may actually affect you&quot; I want to be able to run an update command which fetches a few libraries including the vulnerable one, reboot and be back in business.<p>I also don&#x27;t really care for the &quot;we have so much space now&quot; argument. I certainly don&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t put in expensive 2TB SSDs in my laptop because I don&#x27;t need them, and I don&#x27;t want half of my 500GiB disk to be taken up by giant blobs of unoptimized docker images for the same reason that I don&#x27;t want to run 10 copies of chrome at the same time to use a text editor, an email client, a web browser, a media player, a debugger, the thing I&#x27;m writing, three chat clients, and a partridge in a pear tree. I have extra space and extra processing power on my computer so that a: I can use it for the things I actually want to use it for and b: so that I have a snappy machine which can take an unexpected load (be it disk load or processing load) without problems.')
