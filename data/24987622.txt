Bookshop is a great way to support your local book shops during lockdown - they need that now more than ever! They really are doing right by everyone.<p>If you’re interested, that’s our book there on the left (next to Obama!) - Gender Swapped Fairy Tales. I created an algorithm to swap the gender of any text and we applied it to all the most famous fairy tales - without rewriting anything. It’s then been really beautifully illustrated. It seems like such a simple change but that’s what makes it work - it really lays all the gender stereotypes bare. Some quite obvious but others are more subtle. You end up noticing a lot of stuff you didn’t with the gender the other way around. Interested in your thoughts if they read it!')
