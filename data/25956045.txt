In the linked CVE, OpenBSD was unaffected because &quot;[it] didn&#x27;t chase the fad of using every Intel cpu feature.&quot; The feature in question was user-space hardware debug register access. Without such access, watch-points are borderline unusable[0].<p>Perhaps prohibiting access to user-space <i>except</i> GDB would be a reasonable compromise. Also, debug registers are not unique to x86: most (all?) CPU architectures have them. So calling it a &quot;fad [...] Intel cpu feature&quot; is a bit unfair.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marc.info&#x2F;?l=openbsd-misc&amp;m=152609160230624&amp;w=2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marc.info&#x2F;?l=openbsd-misc&amp;m=152609160230624&amp;w=2</a>')
