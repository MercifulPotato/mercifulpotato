Are you implying you <i>never</i> make _big_ blunders (but make plenty of non-huge ones)? Also suspicious.<p>In general, there are many signals you can collect. If other users are complaining about a player <i>then</i> you analyze them, and if your signals say &quot;suspicious&quot; then... you caught a cheater. If nobody complains about a particular user you don&#x27;t do anything because it just doesn&#x27;t matter.')
