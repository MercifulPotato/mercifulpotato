The most efficient M.2 NVMe SSDs are also at least competitive with M.2 SATA SSDs in terms of absolute power consumption, despite outperforming the SATA SSDs by at least a factor of 2-3x. Power consumption from a M.2 NVMe SSD will also drop slightly when only one or two of its four PCIe lanes are used, which is the case when the drive is behind a USB to NVMe bridge.<p>For example, comparing a SK hynix NVMe drive against of dozens of other M.2 NVMe and 2.5&quot; SATA drives: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.anandtech.com&#x2F;doci&#x2F;16012&#x2F;rr-all.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.anandtech.com&#x2F;doci&#x2F;16012&#x2F;rr-all.png</a> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think there are any M.2 SATA results in there, and those are often a little bit more efficient than their 2.5&quot; counterparts (running off 3.3V rather than 5V, but stepping it down to at least one or two lower voltages on the drive in either case).')
