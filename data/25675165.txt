In fact, one of the sources said this:<p>&gt; Media and observers left as employees packed up. But Fulton’s election director called a supervisor at State Farm a few minutes later, telling them to keep counting after the Secretary of State’s office called and said they shouldn’t stop counting for the night so early.<p>So the sources you listed literally confirm that they kept counting after they sent observers home. You seriously don&#x27;t see that as a problem? I do. There are tons of volunteers who would gladly stay up all night to help observe. Over and over and over again, observers were sent home and counting continued.<p>All these articles that start with &quot;debunked&quot; go on to say this exact same thing happened, and then dismiss it as normal counting behavior. Do you understand why myself, and millions of Americans, have trouble with these stories? The headline frames the article, and then the article contracts the headline.<p>Did you ... did you actually read the stories, or just past random links based on the headlines?')
