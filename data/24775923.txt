Surely something most devs wish to have from time to time. Though, it&#x27;s also dangerous and can lead to even more unreadable code. Linter will probably also have &quot;fun&quot; adapting to this. And debugging this..<p>Well, anyway, personally I don&#x27;t like the syntax. Putting a sign at words end feels just not pythonic. The Idea itself I favor more than I dislike it, as the advantages seems to outweight the disadvantages. As this is a PEP, I assume this will come in any case?')
