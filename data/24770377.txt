They try to make 5G look like it&#x27;s invented by Apple by labeling it &quot;innovation&quot;. No, Tim Apple, it&#x27;s Qualcomm who made that chip. You just had your hardware team build it inside the phone.<p>The screen, same deal. A fancy name for technology that&#x27;s been around for a while. Nobody will really see the difference between the screen on an iPhone X and iPhone 12, but hey, it&#x27;s a sales-talk.<p>Speaking of 5G, they&#x27;re trying to sell us onto the idea that we need it. We are still dealing with relatively low bandwidth caps from our providers, and nobody in their right mind is going to use 4GB&#x2F;s to do... anything. Do they expect us to willy-nilly download games of 4GB on the go or something?<p>5G is technology for the providers and their benefactors, not for us the comsumers.<p>On to the CPU. It&#x27;s faster. Great. It was already industry-leading fast. I respect processing power as something amazing and I&#x27;ll respect this improvement for what it is. Great job. Not too impressed because I wouldn&#x27;t use it myself, but it&#x27;s nice.<p>Then Touch ID, wow I&#x27;m so happy they reintroduced it last-minute during this pandemic where we all wear masks when out and about. What&#x27;s that? They didn&#x27;t include Touch ID? You mean their superior technology that is pretty damn amazing and convenient to serve NEXT TO Face ID isn&#x27;t there even though they could have?<p>Yikes.<p>Well, at least the announced 120Hz for the Pro Max and 90Hz for the smaller Pro model was nice. Hm? They didn&#x27;t do that either? Oh. They&#x27;re still stuck on 60Hz while the competition is delivering phones for half the money doing all of the above since about a year ago?<p>Yikes.<p>MagSafe, though. Now that is quite nice! Not even kidding. They invented magnets at Apple, like, whoa  I&#x27;m going to assume that the magnetic connection will allow you to charge the phone and ALSO transfer data! Wild assumption, huh?<p>The case with a spare pocket for the Apple Pencil was a nice touch, though, especially now the iPhone 12 supports it. That&#x27;s also a lie. I&#x27;m lying. They did not do that.<p>At the very least they&#x27;re good for nature and such. No more charger and earphones! As a result the price has gone down a whopping $300 across the field, with a respectful nod to the people who are struggling in these dire times.<p>That, too, was a lie. They did no such thing.<p>It&#x27;s another iPhone X. Nothing new here.')
