You can&#x27;t introduce a new superior tech unless the huge amounts of existing tech and tools can first be made compatible with it. And that&#x27;s harder to do because of all the degrees of freedom available in software rather than the relatively few in physics.<p>And even if a method could be discovered to make them compatible there is no way for anyone to snap their finger and update them all - it takes tons of work. And who is going to convince all of these other people to stop what their doing to invest in supporting this better tech? Even if this better tech is there, how long will it take them to really understand the correct mental model to apply it to their tool. Functional programming is now still slowly gaining adoption because it&#x27;s a different way to think. It takes us forever to learn and adopt a better method.<p>And even if people could be made willing to adopt a better tech and do all of the above, how can we show a tech is better? We don&#x27;t even have an objective method of evaluating what better is. It&#x27;s all hearsay and opinion. So everyone needs to evaluate it on their own. But even if people were willing to do that, we don&#x27;t even have an objective definition of what &quot;better&quot; is in software tooling!<p>The problem is, in evaluating software, we are pre-scientific method.<p>The single largest break through any one person could have, the only &quot;singularity tech&quot; in software development would be for someone to design a model to represent an objective human evaluation of software language tool, method or tool. Something that allows us to objective compare languages and automate the search space of fixing better tooling. Without that it will continue to take 40 years to adopt clearly better ideas.<p>Until we can even say the equivalent of basic physical comparisons of &quot;objective x is heavier than object y&quot;, or &quot;object a is faster&#x2F;stronger than object b&quot; using an agreed upon standard progress will be fits and spurts.<p>Imagine Civil engineering over the centuries and people can look at two bridges and be unable to tell which is stronger or wider or longer or costs more to build. Think how worse off our tech would be.')
