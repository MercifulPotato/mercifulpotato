The fact that classical first order logic assumes the rules are perfect does not invalidate all symbolic approaches. There are several types of modal logic that can be used to manage the idea of imperfect rules and imperfect, or subjective, knowledge about the world, even before starting with fuzzy or probabilistic logic.<p>In general, everything that can be talked about by humans, in principle, should be considered at the reach of symbolic approaches. That’s tautological, I know, but people seemingly have difficulties seeing the forest for the trees, as they restrict their mental model of symbolic logic to a 70s brand of prolog &#x2F; Horn clause based predicate logic.')
