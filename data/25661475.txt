I am very aware of what my views are, whereas you imply I may be unaware. I find it useful to not waste too much time worrying about challenges and instead focus on solutions and opportunity. This has allowed me to come from childhood poverty into an adulthood that successfully provides me the life I want, without hangups or emotional baggage. If other people find success through different strategies, that&#x27;s great. But as I said, I can&#x27;t help but think that many people are only holding themselves back by focusing on things that are out of their control')
