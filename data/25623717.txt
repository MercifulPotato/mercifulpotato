The rust community is fairly active, or at least it was back when there was just an IRC channel, I don&#x27;t know as much now since I don&#x27;t get onto whatever the medium is today. Ask people if there&#x27;s an easier way to do something.<p>c) Read others code. I, for example, like to review some of my dependencies just so I understand a bit more about how they work, and I&#x27;ve picked up a lot from that. I used to get on IRC in the morning while I was kinda getting into my work-day and see if I couldn&#x27;t help others out, this really taught me a lot.')
