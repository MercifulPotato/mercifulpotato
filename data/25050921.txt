Tough hard arguing has it&#x27;s merit and value, but often it can turn into a contest who is the most stubborn, most convinced and least principled actor in the discussion. This kind of &quot;war with words&quot; scares away a whole other world of speech that could never happen in it&#x27;s wake.<p>I am not saying that we should go without one or another, but saying a space for free speech is one where you can say controversial in a rough voice is not necessarily an indicator for the value of the conversations that take place. Think about HN: how would the conversations on here work without the restraint everybody shows by staying on topic?')
