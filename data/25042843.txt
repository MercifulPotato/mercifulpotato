I can say this as somebody who has been in the Army for 23 years and deployed 5 times. The risk of traditional warfare is astonishing low because the costs are too high and the superior modern force moves too fast. You have to keep in mind 10x more people have died in the Mexican drug conflict than all the years the US had been in Afghanistan.<p>Those things said I find it strange that anytime somebody mentions investment in revision of military tactics or technology somebody cries about some unrelated moral ambiguity from some value vacuum.')
