The hospital is shutting down because of the pandemic (or at least using it as an excuse to get out of a low-value market). The area already had poor healthcare access, and it will get much worse in the near future.<p>I feel a lot of well-off people are not considering effects like these, which will likely be quite large, when they weigh the long term consequences of our disease response. And it&#x27;s weird to me that even the most progressive people in my life are happy to use grocery delivery and similar services that essentially transfer disease risk from privileged groups to poor minorities. It&#x27;s like people don&#x27;t have the emotional bandwidth to be worried about the disease and inequality at the same time.')
