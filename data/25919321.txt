Better to say Red Hat will not invest in CentOS point releases, as that is a lot less confusing.<p>But the point releases will be still there - but only for RHEL.<p>The sad thing, which makes Stream unusable is, that RHEL does rebase packages between point releases. With the old CentOS you knew, that if there are breaking changes, they would be during point release upgrade. With Stream, you will get them randomly (and they did already happen several times since announcement).')
