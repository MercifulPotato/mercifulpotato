Many youtube videos you can look at on this, but the biggest issue that comes up is how Africans in Africa share <i>little</i> of the fervent anti-colonial attitude prominent in the American Black community here.<p>There is genuine shock registered at how much many Africans are simply disinterested in explicitly raising questions around White privilege, how it even continues to be catered to in even typical hospitality settings.<p>Two articles made the frontpage of HN within the last 4 weeks whereby African writers in Britain and Africa, respectively, write to disparage the export of the Black American anti-colonial perspective, one going so far as to indicate an element of typical American cultural exceptionalism.<p>It seems the Black American community is alone both in its experience and response to the uniquely intensive and thoroughgoing racism of America, no matter how pervasive its cultural influence in the arts globally.<p>Too American to ever be (any one of the ethnicities identified as...) African, too &quot;other&quot; to ever be more than a second-class American, left alone with hundreds of years of cultural ressentiment at de facto segregation and disenfranchisement that has only recently found popular expression in the liberation of social discourse and media from establishment institutions.<p>I&#x27;m suddenly reminded of a joke a comedian whose name I can&#x27;t recall told about how a white person is more comfortable with Africans from Africa than they are with the Black Americans that&#x27;ve been here for over 300 year, something like, to paraphrase, &quot;You tell em your name is DeShawn, that&#x27;s a wrap, but if you&#x27;re &#x27;Oluwafemi&#x27; they love you&quot;.<p>The Cameroonian Joel Embiid, the famous NBA player for the Philadelphia 76ers, famously recalls being able to convince students at the University of Kansas, where he played college basketball, that in Cameroon he lived near lions and had to fight with them constantly. Joel Embiid grew up in an upper middle-class suburb in his home country.')
