That&#x27;s so small you can literally order a prefab off the internet here in Australia, installed and delivered for $10k.<p>Extrapolated, that would represent $0.01&#x2F;kWh in capital costs, or a complete rounding error of costs over the lifetime of the plant. You could even truck it in from a thousand miles away without really impacting the cost very much.<p>To explore the problem a different way, here in Australia, 8 million megaliters of water was used in farming in the last year. Total energy consumption (not just electricity) in the same period was 1714 TWh.<p>Storing 3 weeks of our energy needs would require 26,700 megaliters of water be converted to hydrogen, or 0.3% of the amount yearly used in farming, already distributed in regional areas.')
