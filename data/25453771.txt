To the point that in later seasons the characters become more and more self-aware that they are stuck in a situation that is ridiculous and increasingly express frustration that they can&#x27;t understand why. This especially comes to the fore after Charlie exits, when it seems the writers realised the situation was now so crazy they had little choice but to just play into it.<p>Alan in particular is also a great example of being flanderized from a down on his luck but somewhat normal person to a mooch prepared to do <i>anything</i> to stay in the house at even the cost of good own happiness, while giving up any pretense of wanting to work his way out of it.<p>Jake as well - in fact in the final episode they flat out state it in dialogue: Alan points out that Jake wasn&#x27;t really dumb at first, but he was funnier dumb. (The final episode breaks the fourth wall a lot to point out many of these things)')
