If US people move to such countries, they can also be covered by such laws, or may also be subjected to double taxation which will affect their pay too.<p>I know people in Europe who&#x27;ve been &quot;employed&quot; by US companies as contractors to avoid having these local legal obligations, and that would certainly open up the option of global pay levels, but I know there are legal and regulatory issues around this approach too.')
