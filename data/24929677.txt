On HN it&#x27;s a toss-up between whether you complain about the wall street bankers or the urban landlords.  In other circles people complain about the government and the white collar yuppies.  The MBA types get complained about a lot but nobody complains when they&#x27;re buying a $100 window A&#x2F;C unit.<p>You can find examples of net-negative rent seeking in just about every part of the economy but to paint a whole class of economic activity as a drag is naive.')
