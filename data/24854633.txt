We don&#x27;t have to build huge railways, just remove the arbitrary barriers that make air travel suck. The biggest one being the ridiculous security theatre that is the TSA.<p>Commercial flight, even with the risk of terrorism, is far safer than land travel. If it&#x27;s acceptable to let people board the Acela without going through body scanners, then there&#x27;s no reason we can&#x27;t do the same with JetBlue.')
