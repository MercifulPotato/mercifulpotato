Debugging was mostly just writing correct code in the first place! ;) The only gripe I have is sometimes nimsuggest hanging itself at 100% cpu use, and I have to kill it manually.<p>Even with the rather oldschool approach of echo&#x2F;logging.nim usage, things tend to turn around quickly. I have not felt the need to be able to attach a debugger to the process, mostly because our architecture is very pluggable. Almost all events&#x2F;interactions are on a message bus and can be hooked&#x2F;handled individually.')
