These liberties you and others have sacrificed are exchanged for common security and self-preservation.  Whether or not your rights are limited to protect other people&#x27;s rights (or for some other purpose) is irrelevant.  You are forced to abide by these restrictions because of the social contract between yourself and the government which creates and enforces these laws.')
