Item(by='aylmao', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603854021, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24914433, text='&gt; Who said icons are supposed to be inspired?<p>haha yeah they don&#x27;t have to, but there&#x27;s just some good examples of &quot;inspired&quot; icons out there and it&#x27;s kind of sad Google didn&#x27;t take the chance to do something similar. The Microsoft office icons, for example, I&#x27;d call clear&#x2F;differentiable and inspired. You get the cool detail that the shape for each is associated with the document type they edit (tables, text, graphics, email&#x2F;calendar) subtle gradients, depth through great use of shadows, and even on apps that are technically the same color (blue is used for 3 apps) subtle yet noticeable changes in hue [1].<p>There&#x27;s also macOS icons, especially the older ones. There&#x27;s many examples icons with wonderful uses of texture, depth and detail, many of which altogether break away from the trend of &quot;one color per app&quot; but still manage to stay unique and, well, iconic [2].<p>It would&#x27;ve been great to see something with a little more effort and &quot;inspiration&quot; from google, although yeah, at least something clear and distinguishable would&#x27;ve been good.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;systechinfo.com&#x2F;microsoft-rolls-out-updated-office-icons&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;systechinfo.com&#x2F;microsoft-rolls-out-updated-office-i...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;img.utdstc.com&#x2F;screen&#x2F;3&#x2F;official-macosx-leopard-icon-pack-001.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;img.utdstc.com&#x2F;screen&#x2F;3&#x2F;official-macosx-leopard-icon...</a>')
