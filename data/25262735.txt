Item(by='labcomputer', descendants=None, kids=[25271241], score=None, time=1606801712, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25261703, text='I experienced the same thing while TAing physics for biosciences for a few semesters (which was 90% pre-meds), though I never had to call security.<p>One apparently needs close to a 4.0 GPA, plus many extracurricular volunteer hours to qualify for medical school, plus glowing letters of recommendation.  I also overheard a number of stories about pre-med students intentionally sabotaging other students by misleading them to think that private group tutoring sessions (to study for the MCAT) had been canceled.<p>That experience helped form my beliefs about the driver high cost of medical care in the US.<p>Specifically, that there is no shortage of people who are willing and qualified to be medical doctors, but that doctors and medical schools collude to artificially limit the supply of credentialed medical doctors as a means to increase doctor salaries.<p>As you alluded to, I think it also creates an adverse selection problem, where the people who become doctors are mostly not those with excellent diagnosis skills or bedside manor or ethics, but those who are the most cutthroat and desperate to get into a high-paying career.')
