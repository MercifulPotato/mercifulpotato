You can&#x27;t have a digital equivalent of a town square because whatever else you do, it&#x27;s simply not possible to create in-person pseudo-anonymous supporters.<p>But on the internet, this is easy - it&#x27;s a damn service you can buy and it scales on the orders of 1-to-1000 or (usually much more) voices.<p>CAPTCHA&#x27;s don&#x27;t solve it - because this is also a service - breaking CAPTCHA&#x27;s by the hundred and supply account keys in bulk.<p>You simply cannot have a digital space which works like a physical one, and as such you cannot meaningfully not moderate it because human participants cannot out-pace bots and sockpuppet accounts. Facebook&#x27;s entire, unearned initial trust was because notionally it solved this problem - people forget it was initially limited to student&#x27;s with student email addresses at school&#x27;s it knew. It was very much, initially, exclusive enough that it kept something of a lid on this problem.<p>The feeling about it has persisted far beyond the now non-existence of this mechanism.')
