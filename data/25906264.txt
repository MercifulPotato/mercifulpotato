As a former rower I&#x27;m biased, but also I have a C2 that sits around unused, mainly because as I&#x27;ve gotten older, I care less about the competitive&#x2F;fitness optimization aspect of working out and more about fun.<p>Having tried several of the third party apps for C2, they&#x27;ve all suffered from 2 problems: pretty sub-par development&#x2F;bugginess &amp; wrong (or bad) content for the mass market. So much training oriented content and little on the fun&#x2F;gamification side. I would pay $ for the right app, but not for a new rower. Ergatta is cool but again I wouldn&#x27;t go out and buy one.  When you think about the hundreds of thousands of C2s, it is a nice opportunity.')
