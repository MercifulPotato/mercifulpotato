There&#x27;s a worldwide shortage of high-end fab capacity. That&#x27;s not an easy business to enter. TSMC is spending US$20 billion on their newest fab. They started in 2018, and they expect to get parts out in volume in 2021 or 2022.<p>If you want to duplicate TSMC, you&#x27;d need a huge amount of money. TSMC is valued at around US$500 billion. Anyone not already a major fab operator would probably fail. They&#x27;d have to go through several generations of fabs to catch up. Meanwhile, TSMC is moving forward. China is trying to catch up.<p>There&#x27;s never been an industry like this before, where it costs half a trillion dollars to be a player. Not just to be #1, but to even be in the game.')
