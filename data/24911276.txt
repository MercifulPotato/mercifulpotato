Founders and marketing teams always ask me for the latest hacks to speed up their company growth. My answer is always: &#x27;tactics don&#x27;t matter, focus on moving fast&#x27;. Sure, but what does that really mean and how do you get there? This First Round article outlines my framework for how to fundamentally speed up marketing. It talks through how to set goals, identify hidden assumptions in your marketing ideas, how to set up dashboards that drive speed, and offers examples along the way. It&#x27;s all based on things I have learned and tried during my time scaling SaaS companies. I have talked about this topic at SaaStr and other conferences - the Q&#x2F;A is usually pretty heated. So what questions &#x2F; concerns do you have?')
