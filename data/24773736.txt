I mean, how many people are really going to need to interact by videochat?&quot;  Covid-19 arrived a few months later...<p>We&#x27;re aiming to help people looking for extra income, and at the same time help people in lock-down who can&#x27;t find the advice they need in the physical world, but could benefit from videochat assistance.<p>Videochat technology may be everywhere now, but what Thundre provides is:\n(1) the means of discovering who to videochat to\n(2) a push-button solution for selling your services via videochat<p>For &quot;Show HN&quot; we&#x27;d particularly like to see people create profiles for a range of skills&#x2F;expertise and wide array of categories.<p>You can create a presenter profile from this page:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thundre.com&#x2F;host.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thundre.com&#x2F;host.html</a><p>Note: creating a profile already will reserve your &quot;Thundre.com&#x2F;&lt;user-name&gt;&quot; URL, which could avoid disappointment later!<p>If you&#x27;re nervous about committing time, know that you don&#x27;t have to set any availability times, and can just become available to videochat on an ad-hoc basis, or simply keep us all in suspense indefinitely...<p>Please let me know if you have any questions?<p>Philip Abrahamson')
