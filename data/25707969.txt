I&#x27;m wondering if adding a test framework like kubebuilder is on the agenda. I&#x27;m not a great fan of it (kubebuilder) but the simple-to-use (in a relative term, i.e. as simple as it can get with Go) is a huge benefit. So you won&#x27;t have to deploy after every build to see how your changes look like.')
