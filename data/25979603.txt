The article highlights that it&#x27;s just not &quot;doing&quot; but doing something you are &quot;passionate&quot; about. I get a little stuck on that word because it evokes the &quot;follow your passions&quot; type of advice which can be taken the wrong way. Here I think the key is it&#x27;s not just &quot;doing&quot; <i>anything</i> but rather something you care enough about to at least try to do well. In other words, you&#x27;re putting attention and energy into it. This tends to be something others notice because it&#x27;s authentic.<p>The other thing which seems to elevate outcomes in this context is not just &quot;telling&quot; people as measured by quantity but also by quality. Just sharing with large numbers of people may work but trying to share with those who also &quot;do&quot; things will reach those most likely to care about what you&#x27;re doing, the way you&#x27;re doing it or even just that you&#x27;re &quot;doing&quot; things with genuine personal investment.
