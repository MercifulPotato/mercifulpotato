The server will be multi-tenant by default, unless you&#x27;re a celebrity of some sort. Ghost is super fast, and under load you&#x27;re mostly stressing nginx. I start with the bigger instances on AWS, and I&#x27;ve load tested them pretty heavily for multi-tenant.<p>Even with multi-tenant, each Ghost installation is its own version, own database and own settings, theme. So they&#x27;re all independently configurable. I would like to move everyone through versions in lock-step, but I have no objection to letting people trigger their own upgrades (after I have the necessary automation in place).')
