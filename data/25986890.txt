But equally there are a lot of cheap and readily available pieces which are becoming much more well-known and accessible.<p>All my watches have been bought used, and if ever I reach a point where one of them no longer makes me smile when I look at it then it will be resold.  Sometimes watches appreciate in value, but it is a gamble and I think suggesting somebody buy a watch as an investment has got to be bad advice almost 100% of the time.  If they go up, great?  If they go down?  Well if you enjoyed it for the time you owned it that shouldn&#x27;t matter so much')
