Lisp is on one extreme, where it is easy to write a new language over the top of it.<p>SQL is pretty close to the other end of the spectrum. I&#x27;ve <i>never</i> seen a DSL that can compile to the full breadth of SQL dialects out there. DSLs generally handle the trivial well then fall apart when they hit complicated SQL statements.<p>If an ORM just had to fit over the top of a relational model it would probably work fine. The problem is, in the middle of all this, something has to be constructed in performant &amp; parseable SQL.')
