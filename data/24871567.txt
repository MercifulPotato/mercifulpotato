And there is tiktok and snapchat as far as social media goes.  Companies are slowly marching to deliver AR as a product too.

Also solar is cheaper than coal now as an energy source, and complete DNA sequencing now costs $1000 vs $100â€™000.  Electric cars are now something that the upper-middle class can own practically.')
