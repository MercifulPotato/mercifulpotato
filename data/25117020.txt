But I think that the fraction of people who individually benefit from getting the vaccine is less than the 70% who need to get it, do there&#x27;s going to be a gap that will need to be filled with lies, bullying and shaming.<p>Of course this depends on the unknown factor of how bad the side effects are, if they are nonexistent then it&#x27;s a different story, but if they are on average as bad as a flu shot then it becomes tricky.<p>I suppose I&#x27;m really thinking in the context of countries like Australia which have essentially eradicated the virus. My risk of getting the virus right now is practically zero, so my only incentive to get vaccinated is that we can eventually reopen our borders once enough people are vaccinated. And personally I&#x27;m in no hurry to get flooded by foreign tourists anyway.')
