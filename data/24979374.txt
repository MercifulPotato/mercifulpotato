Maybe some type of metal became more expensive.<p>Either way, the only way that money printing can lead to inflation is if that money creates so much demand that a company needs to expand production capacity to produce more, and if that capacity has rising costs.<p>If a company expands from, let&#x27;s say 65% capacity to 75% capacity, and has constant costs, then it doesn&#x27;t matter. Then more people will be employed due to increased demand, and the economy will boom. This makes money printing a good policy.<p>If, however, the company goes from 85% to 95%, then the company might start to invest in extra capacity, which might add costs, and thereby might raise prices.<p>So, do prices rise just because a certain amount of dollars were added to an economy ? No, certainly not. Which is why the money printing should only happen when the economy is dysfunctional. Basically Keynes in a nutshell. :-)')
