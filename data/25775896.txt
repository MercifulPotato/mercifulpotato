Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25776984], score=None, time=1610629957, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25775629, text='&quot; I would say nearly all the harm comes from the fact it&#x27;s not legal&quot;<p>Wow, you&#x27;re not using your imagination well enough to recognize how ubiquitously widespread opioid addiction would be were it integrated into our coffee, soft-drinks, an aperatif with dinner etc.. It would be a massive, ongoing public health crisis.<p>Combined with the fact that the effect quickly erodes, that users want ever more aggressive substitutes like Fentanyl, it almost guarantees the inevitable OD.<p>Blaming the &#x27;harm&#x27; on systems literally trying to stop the promulgation of what arguably is actually poison ... is a leap in logic.<p>Tobacco is similarly additive, but it obviously has a completely different set of health effects.<p>Finally - if Tobacco is really in the same category of addictivity, then ironically, you&#x27;ve made an argument that we <i>really</i> should shut down the opioid industry hard, because while quitting smoking is difficult, it&#x27;s not existentially hard and the resulting withdrawal does not require medical attention or anything on the scale of &#x27;Trainspotting withdrawal&#x27;.<p>An acquaintance in Prison indicated they call the heroin addicts zombies, because they bang on the doors and yell 3 times a day as they receive their poison, which is slowly killing them. I&#x27;d argue that incarcerating people and slowly killing them is a strange punishment for those wanting to &#x27;reduce harm&#x27; whereupon the logical thing for their health would be to make sure they had absolutely no access and an opportunity to dry out. I hope that in 50 year we look back on &#x27;free heroin&#x27; like lobotomies or shock therapy.<p>Humans have some control of our faculties and must overcome impulses of all kind - facilitating the total degradation of that control system by administering poison is definitely a form of torture. I&#x27;d rather be waterboarded.')
