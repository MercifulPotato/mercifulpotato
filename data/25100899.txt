Just as an example he writes:<p>“ Unfortunately many programmers, due to their lack of experience, of some knowledge of computer architecture(s), or of an in-depth understanding of the task they are given, spend countless hours by making life harder for themselves in the name of marginal performance gains, often trading many other conveniences (such as type safety, garbage collection, etc) too.”<p>And then he himself doesn’t use type safety making the text very superfluous. As others have brought up he then uses pythonwrappers for the heavy lifting. It’s just a very shallow thought process that you are supposed to hammer out in the university.<p>Modify the README to just say: I wanted to scratch an itch so I built PoC for a Redis alternative, and it would have been an amazing achievement. Now? Not so much.')
