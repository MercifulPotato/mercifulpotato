Obama promised if you like your insurance you can keep it.  He was mostly correct (if you squint just right there are some minor changes to everyone&#x27;s plan which you can count as not keeping it), but I don&#x27;t like my health insurance - but to get a different plan means throwing away the large subsidy I get from my employer to take their plan.')
