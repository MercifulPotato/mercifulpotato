In comparison, the same setup at AWS would be $96K per month.<p>Why would you build exactly the same setup in AWS as for on-prem, unless your objective is to (dishonestly) show that on-prem is cheaper?<p>Lift-and-shift-to-the-cloud is known to be more expensive, because you aren&#x27;t taking advantage of the features available to you which would allow you to reduce your costs.')
