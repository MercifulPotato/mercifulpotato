Item(by='LeifCarrotson', descendants=None, kids=[25921892], score=None, time=1611700166, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25921516, text='I enjoyed it, so there&#x27;s at least two of us.<p>You&#x27;ve turned microhumor [1] into something akin to a spoken accent that pervades the entire blog post. I&#x27;m unsure how to handle this.<p>However, I was particularly amused by your closing sentence that mentioned how a LiPo could keep it running for &quot;hours&quot;. That sounds about right for a 20 mA OLED and an 80 mA ESP8266, but it&#x27;s remarkably shorter than an old-fashioned LCD alarm clock in which an alkaline battery could last for months.<p>By the way, I&#x27;d recommend an 18650 LiIon instead. If you want, the charge circuit can be as simple as putting the LiIon and a silicon rectifier in parallel with your 3.3V regulator output (assuming the linear regulator has an internal PNP body diode and doesn&#x27;t backfeed) and then just charge the cell outside the alarm clock in an off-the-shelf battery charger. You don&#x27;t need the current density of a LiPo, you want low current but high capacity, and cheap LiPo pouches have an annoying tendency to puff up and go bad. Going bad may result in burning down your nightstand, which is never a good way to wake up.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;20&#x2F;writing-advice&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;02&#x2F;20&#x2F;writing-advice&#x2F;</a>')
