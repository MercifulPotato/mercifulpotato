The delta compression happens when you run `git gc` (git does this automatically as well on occasion), and packfiles is how git fetches and pushes history.<p>But when you create a new commit, that commit object is stored as a loose object, with any new file blobs and tree objects. This represents a complete snapshot of your working tree.<p>But git does not need to make a complete copy of the working tree on each commit. Because objects are referred to by the hash of their contents (with a git specific header), git only needs to store each version of a file once.')
