Without the side businesses, prices would rise, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that the businesses would be non-viable without the side businesses.   Of course if you don&#x27;t have it but your competitor does, that may cause problems.<p>Doesn&#x27;t invalidate this article though, it&#x27;s more about COVID-19 adaption than side businesses.')
