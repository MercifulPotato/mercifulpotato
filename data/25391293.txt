Item(by='adnzzzzZ', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607722269, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25390117, text='&gt;People are being (unknowingly) manipulated and the sheer quantity of misinformation is being mistaken for evidence of truth.<p>This is something you said that I originally replied to. We don&#x27;t agree on what constitutes truth, so we can&#x27;t have a reasonable conversation, and we also can&#x27;t fairly judge what is and isn&#x27;t misinformation, because we don&#x27;t agree on the basics.<p>This is the point I&#x27;m making. I don&#x27;t believe that climate science is nearly as valid as everything that goes into making my computer work, because my computer works. I have evidence in the real world that my computer works, so all the physics that went into it must be pretty solid. I don&#x27;t have evidence that climate science works, because climate scientists can&#x27;t run their models 100 years into the future, see what happens, then change a variable and run it again to see what changes (with the same accuracy that you&#x27;d have if you ran the experiment in real life). Their models are fundamentally less powerful than anything that went into making my computer work by the very nature of the discipline.<p>Most of politics falls way closer to climate science in terms of its power as a science than it does to the physics that goes into a computer. This, fundamentally, is why &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;misinformation&quot; when talking about politics is generally pointless. There are very few discussions in current day politics that are about truths as solid as what makes a computer work. Most of it are around fields like climate science, economics, social science, which are all softer (and thus more corruptible) fields.<p>The reason I said we won&#x27;t be able to have a reasonable and logical discussion about this is because you probably disagree with everything I just said, and you likely won&#x27;t really change your mind about it. I certainly won&#x27;t change my mind about it, so we&#x27;re forever stuck not being able to reconcile our different views of the world in regards to the relationship between politics and science, and thus we&#x27;ll never be able to reach &#x27;ground truth&#x27; from which we could then work up towards stopping the spread of misinformation. A general notion of truth itself has to be agreed upon before we can have reasonable and logical discussions about this subject, but that likely won&#x27;t happen.')
