Not the whole job description will be generated by AI. There are certain parts that cannot be generated like:<p>- Salary.<p>- Location.<p>- Role description. For example what is the expectation of the candidate? what is the team size? ...etc.<p>- Company Bio<p>- Company perks (gym membership, private health insurance ... etc) as these will differ from one company to another.<p>The purpose of the service is to:<p>- Generate professionally looking job description where the AI will write a list of required and general skills.<p>- Speed, compare that to following a template which will always give the same content.<p>I do not have numbers to answer if a finely tuned JD will attract more candidates but personally I prefer a JD that is readable and clear.')
