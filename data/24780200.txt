Item(by='bryanrasmussen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602701745, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24777354, text='I think it depends on your personality, are you a person who likes things to hang together coherently and think that when a narrative implies something will be resolved it should be resolved (that is to say if you see Chekhov&#x27;s gun, they keep talking about it, and it never goes off - do you get really upset?) well, if you&#x27;re that kind of person you will be pissed off about Lost. You might also dislike GoT (can&#x27;t say haven&#x27;t seen, but I&#x27;m that kind of person and not going to risk it)<p>If you feel characterization is the most important thing, and the emotional connection to characters or having highly evocative emotional moments in the narrative is what makes it worthwhile then you will probably like Lost quite a bit, but you might hate GoT (given my understanding that the last season fucked up major characters for shock value - I can&#x27;t speak directly to it as I haven&#x27;t watched it)<p>So based on that my wife still talks about how great Lost was, and if it gets brought up the first words out of my mouth will not be complimentary.')
