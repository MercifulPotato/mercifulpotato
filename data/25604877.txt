It will remain restricted. European, Asian and African countries will make more use of autonomous public vehicles, in the form of trains, trams and busses, with a driver inside. The U.S. will  get there by a different route: car pooling =&gt; minivan pooling and gradually up to private buses. This won&#x27;t happen next year, or maybe not even in the next decade... but that&#x27;s the future.')
