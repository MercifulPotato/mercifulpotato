Just don&#x27;t do it, it&#x27;s super fun but it doesn&#x27;t pay off: every SoC is different and you start with every SoC from scratch and waste tons of time. Prototyping is slow, you need min 2 weeks for every iteration (for smaller endeavors) and the worst, 98% of hardware-based business models are weak and don&#x27;t provide any lock-in.')
