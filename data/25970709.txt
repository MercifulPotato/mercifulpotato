At the time, I was absolutely dead certain that Pascal would win out over C. While I understood what was happening under the hood, the business of programming by doing math on pointers seemed like such a bug factory that I dismissed it out of hand.<p>Today when I program in C (thanks to embedded work), it seems like many of the modern improvements to the language consist of making it more Pascal-like.')
