Yes.<p>If I stumble across gold in the ground, quietly buy the land and start to mine it, I don&#x27;t &#x27;deserve&#x27; that gold.  But I&#x27;ve got it, and the system of property rights is there to dissuade me from just taking it by force instead of buying the land first (or other people taking it from me once I&#x27;ve got it).')
