FDIC Insurance does not immediately apply. Coverage begins when funds arrive at a program bank. There are currently six banks available to accept these deposits, making customers eligible for up to $1,500,000 of FDIC insurance (six banks, $250,000 per bank). If the number of available banks changes, or you elect not to use, and&#x2F;or have existing assets at, one or more of the available banks, the actual amount could be lower. For more information on FDIC insurance coverage, please visit www.FDIC.gov. Customers are responsible for monitoring their total assets at each of the Program Banks to determine the extent of available FDIC insurance coverage in accordance with FDIC rules. The deposits in SoFi Money or at Program Banks are not covered by SIPC.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-sofi-bank-charter&#x2F;fintech-startup-sofi-gets-preliminary-approval-for-u-s-bank-charter-idUSKBN27D27W" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-sofi-bank-charter&#x2F;fintech...</a>')
