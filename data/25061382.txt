Item(by='chipotle_coyote', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605120120, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25061001, text='That linked article from 2016 is about Intel&#x27;s Custom Foundry program, which I&#x27;m fairly sure is for building chips under contract to other companies. It promotes that they have &quot;access to ARM Artisan IP,&quot; but doesn&#x27;t specifically mention an ARM version of MKL that I see. The list of compatible hardware Intel&#x27;s page on MKL itself lists compatible processors and ARM is conspicuously absent:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;software.intel.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;www&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;develop&#x2F;tools&#x2F;math-kernel-library.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;software.intel.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;www&#x2F;us&#x2F;en&#x2F;develop&#x2F;tools&#x2F;m...</a><p>And, this question on Intel&#x27;s own forums from 2016 at least suggests that there wasn&#x27;t an MKL version for ARM in the time frame of the article you&#x27;re linking to, either:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.intel.com&#x2F;t5&#x2F;Intel-oneAPI-Math-Kernel-Library&#x2F;MKL-gfortran-on-ARM-processors-e-g-Raspberry-Pi-3-quad-core&#x2F;td-p&#x2F;1086157" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.intel.com&#x2F;t5&#x2F;Intel-oneAPI-Math-Kernel-Libr...</a><p>So, from what I can tell, while Intel is an ARM licensee and made ARM CPUs in the past, they haven&#x27;t made their own ARM CPUs for years and there&#x27;s no sign they ever made MKL for any ARM platform. Never say never, but I think the OP is basically right -- there&#x27;s not a lot of incentive for Intel to produce one.')
