Even in domains where Christian groups have been effective in practice.<p>The same can be said about mainstream media or science.<p>In the short term, it&#x27;s practically impossible to reach such people without identifying somewhere they&#x27;re actually right in their rejection of the mainstream narrative, and gaining their trust by recognizing that.  Only with that trust do you have a shot of being listened to when you point out where they overcorrected against the mainstream narrative.<p>In the longer term, it would really help if some key mainstream narratives became more accurate.  Without that, &quot;getting out of the country&quot; may actually become the best option for an increasing number of people.')
