Either you do accept the socialization of your property, and live the life of an ordinary person, which is morally by far the best thing to do&quot;<p>Life is seldom made of binary choices like you imply.\nAnd what you think is &quot;morally by far the best thing to do&quot; really does not have to match others morals.<p>My morals are, I do not judge absolute morals, like you. I judge only concrete situations.<p>And since so far a egalitarian society is only a theory that failed multiple times in reality, I do not believe in supporting such a theory with all my energy and posession. Which would be &quot;accept the socialization of your property, and live the life of an ordinary person, which is morally by far the best thing to do&quot;.<p>In other words, if I would have to take the choice between fascism and socialism I would rather try to gather what I have and go away.')
