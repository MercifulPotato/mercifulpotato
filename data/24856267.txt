I&#x27;m not sure if they went back on that.<p>Eitherway, the problem is not that it isn&#x27;t open source per-say.<p>The problem is that it&#x27;s an incredibly closed ecosystem as it exists today, and an expensive one- maybe you&#x27;re better off looking at equivalently featured, free, and more open options... of which there are many.')
