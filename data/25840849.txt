I switched from Mac to Pop, and it’s great.<p>I had already decided that 2021 would be my year of the Linux desktop, but Apple forced my hand a bit early. My 2019 Mac’s WiFi went. Had to lose my primary dev machine for over a week as it shipped out to have a bunch of hardware replaced.<p>So, I built a PC with parts that have good Linux support. I think that’s the key. I imagine System76 machines would run smoothly. It’s definitely not as smooth a UX as Mac, but I like being in an open ecosystem on a machine I can repair. And it’s had a number of perks such Docker running efficiently for once.<p>Edit: I can now trivially repair my computer if it breaks. The entire rig cost about 1&#x2F;4 what my MacBook cost, and it is much faster.')
