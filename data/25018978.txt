Let&#x27;s take aside Civil war in Guatemala, Salvador and Nicaragua. Migrants flood because their local governments can&#x27;t produce jobs not guarantee basic safety. US trains armies and send equipment through the PPP plan which got not results. Trump idea was to stop migration and the delegation of responsability back which results in basic jobs available for americans, force those countries to develop and at the end you can help them with investment in infrastructure with private money no government tax payer money.')
