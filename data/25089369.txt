I wanted the interface to be relatively simple and focused, kind of like what you see on most mobile or tablet apps. It would have a base layer with the main functionality, and then modal popups floating above for other functions when necessary. Only one interface layer or popup would be in focus and active at any one time, and the user could click or touch the background to close it and go back to the next lowest layer.<p>The music app didn&#x27;t really go anywhere (it works as intended, but my initial assumptions were wrong), but I was able to split its UI manager off into a stand-alone library. I&#x27;ve since used it on some other small personal projects and added additional features as necessary.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how many people still develop Windows apps, but maybe this will cut out some of the ceremony and setup work that&#x27;s usually required. At least for small apps.<p>Happy to take any feedback or answer any questions.')
