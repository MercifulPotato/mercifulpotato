Of course almost all pictures are of the riots instead of some boring random street in Washington DC.<p>Even people who are not part of it will take pictures simply because it is a major event and nowadays, every time something interesting happens, there are people to take pictures. You are probably going to find similar heat maps on more mainstream social networks.')
