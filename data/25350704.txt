Just one question about the distance fog, though: as you say it does give the scene scale when you&#x27;re close to ground, but if you zoom out everything becomes foggy so it seems like it kind of gets hard to see anything. Wouldn&#x27;t it make sense to somehow reduce the fog as you zoom out so this doesn&#x27;t happen?')
