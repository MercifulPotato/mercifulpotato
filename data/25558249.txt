Item(by='KineticLensman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609153235, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25557943, text='IIRC in pre-decimal Britain we used &#x27;pence&#x27; a lot in a spoken names for the discrete sub-shilling coins but the names of the coins themselves all had distinct colloquial abbreviations for the amount, notably &#x27;tuppence&#x27;, &#x27;thruppence&#x27; and &#x27;ha&#x27;penny&#x27; for 2, 3 and half a penny respectively. &#x27;Sixpence&#x27; - the half shilling - was pronounced as you might expect. The 3 penny coin (yes!) was colloquially called a &#x27;thruppeny bit&#x27;. The pre-decimal abbreviation for a penny was &#x27;d&#x27; (denari) rather than &#x27;p&#x27; \n(pence) so you would never say &#x27;2p&#x27; or &#x27;5p&#x27; as we would today. Decimal quantities such as 5 or 10 pennies didn&#x27;t have dedicated coins and there was no special name for these amounts.<p>In 1971, a cheap paperback book was sold for two shillings and sixpence, which was said as &#x27;two-and-six&#x27;. Decimalisation [0] was my first experience of price gouging, when the same paperbacks were suddenly repriced at 15p (~three shillings) instead of the 12.5p which was the decimal equivalent of their old price.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Decimal_Day" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Decimal_Day</a>')
