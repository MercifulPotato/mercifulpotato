Things that were acceptable few years ago maybe aren&#x27;t acceptable now, and vice versa.<p>&gt;&gt;Because the smartphone gets worse. Less locked-down, less simple, more complex, more avenues of attack<p>I just don&#x27;t see that at all, sorry. The experience for 99.99% users won&#x27;t change at all. Apple could have enabled this last week and you wouldn&#x27;t have seen any difference at all.<p>&gt;&gt;We can&#x27;t make it a legally protected right to have products designed for people&#x27;s random whims.<p>Well, but it&#x27;s not just a random whim, that&#x27;s the crux of the issue.  Once the size of a company and the market it controls gets big enough, it&#x27;s only natural that they are forced to open to others. It happened to every industry before, why should apple be immune to this? It&#x27;s the whole epic vs apple discussion again - if two sides want to engage in lawful business contract(sell each other software in this case) why should apple be the arbiter of these transactions? Or rather - why should you, the owner of your smartphone, be forced to use apple as the arbiter.<p>&gt;&gt;How about we let Apple choose who to market to?<p>They still can, literally nothing changes on that front. They still market to the same people, they still curate the apps like they used to, they still have 100% control of their app store and the device. The only thing that I would like to change is that ability to say &quot;this is my device apple, I paid for it, let me install software that didn&#x27;t go through your filter&quot;. Again, entirely optional. But we looped back to the first point that we are going to disagree on again - you think that will make the experience worse, I don&#x27;t think it will.<p>I think we should agree to part ways on that - the discussion is as always enjoyable, but we might have exhausted the potential here  :-)')
