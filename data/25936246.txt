I would be <i>very</i> careful to read all the fine print though.<p>For me, the cost of routine care, spay&#x2F;neuter, and a certain amount of unforseen expenses should be part of what you plan for when you get a pet. Beyond that, it&#x27;s a judgment call as to whether the cost of some treatment is worth it. I know people who have spent thousands of dollars treating cancer in an old dog, and others who have euthanized younger pets who developed expensive but in theory treatable health problems. I don&#x27;t think either approach is wrong, it&#x27;s up to the owner.')
