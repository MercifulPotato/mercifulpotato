Instead, I will explain some of the reasons why I continue to use Java (for now) instead of Go. Go is seen as one of the best alternatives to Java, and some see it as a better Java. It has won over many shops from Java. Therefore, I think these reasons are relevant to this question, and not just me doing the usual &quot;my language of choice is better&quot;:<p>1. Tooling and library ecosystem of Java is still better. There are tools for pretty much everything, including high-quality commercial offerings. For example, IDEs, profilers, build systems, other languages that run on the same VM. Nearly every major SaaS I have ever integrated with has a Java SDK.<p>2. Weight of big players behind the ecosystem. Big companies all over the world are heavily invested in Java. Even Google is still more invested in Java than Go (internally, and in Android, especially). This makes Java an insanely safe choice for us small players.<p>3. The many, many warts and deficiencies of Java (and parts of the Java ecosystem) are well-known. Experienced developers, at least ones with good taste, know how to mitigate them without pain. For us, a language with fewer warts, like Golang, is therefore not as big of a selling point. It&#x27;s like getting your hands dirty. When your hands are clean, you are reluctant to make them dirty. When your hands are already dirty, touching dirty things is not a big deal.<p>4. Golang is not the only language evolving. Rapid improvements to the language and JVM are already here, and more, bigger changes are planned (e.g. Loom, Valhalla) that will nullify some of Go&#x27;s advantages.')
