It&#x27;s really the thing that grinds my gears when I forget myself: The duplicity and virtue signaling. The ad economy having brought back yellow journalism and endless emotional pleas. The internet being used in massive propaganda campaigns and allowing children and non-citizens a voice in forums that people perceive as our civic spaces -- even though they aren&#x27;t -- because it is actually impossible to &quot;moderate&quot; the massive social media platforms (despite their promises). I like to think that I&#x27;m up on classical Stoic philosophy, but I still struggle sometimes to divorce myself from the fervor. It&#x27;s so human.<p>My guess is that we are quickly approaching a point in time when culture will start to swing the other way, and the internet will become this thing that people don&#x27;t take seriously, haha much like it was in the 90s. That, and some combination of that and censorship. And the tech monopolies absolutely will not survive the level of influence they have now, even if they think they are playing it safe by supporting a particular political faction which happens to be popular at the moment. I think things are going to change fairly rapidly in this direction because it turns out being connected constantly is actually pretty awful in most of the ways that count. Thankfully, however, it seems most folks understand this in a kind of unspoken, visceral way. The same sort of &quot;self-policing&quot; feeling you get when you&#x27;ve wasted 12 hours straight playing Skyrim. It just feels dirty.')
