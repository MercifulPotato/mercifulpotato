Interviews for essentially the same job (e.g., building brain-inspired robots) are hilariously different depending on how the org views itself.<p>In a &quot;science&quot; organization, the interviews mostly involved talking about what I&#x27;ve done in the past and how I&#x27;d approach  new issues (technical and behavioral). There were certainly a few probing questions about things that seemed designed to check up on claims, but my experience seemed mostly taken at face value. A coding test, for example, was skipped because an interviewer had already seen some of my code and thought it was fine.<p>&quot;Tech&quot; interviewers seemed to want everything &quot;proved&quot; on-site during an all-day slog. I reversed strings and traversed graphs on a whiteboard. Someone quizzed me on facts and figures about the human eye (which they were reading out of the same book I learned them from). To me, this seems to test immediate recall and stamina&#x2F;stress tolerance more than anything actually related to my R&amp;D skills.')
