When it was introduced, it used to be the default, but apparently isn&#x27;t anymore. If you toggle it once, Google will remember your preference, so for a lot of people, when they zoom out they get a globe without manually switching over every session.<p>Of course, rendering a globe in WebGL or whatever and drawing it on a 2D screen is still a projection, and it still introduces distortions in shapes and areas, but the 3D-ness of it gives your brain the cues it needs to &quot;correct&quot; the distortions.')
