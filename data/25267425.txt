The resulting code seems to be 10-15% smaller than x86 in practice (25-30% smaller than aarch64) while not requiring the weirdness and mode-switching associated with thumb or MIPS16e.<p>Has there actually been much research into increasing instruction density without significantly complicating decode?<p>Given the move toward wide decoders, has there been any work on the idea of using fixed-size instruction blocks and huffman encoding?')
