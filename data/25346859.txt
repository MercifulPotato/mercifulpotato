Item(by='_benj', descendants=None, kids=[25356462], score=None, time=1607442784, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25346634, text='&gt; Hire someone if this will be their career-defining role â€” they are on the cusp of their career... They will do everything it takes to succeed.<p>I have mixed feelings about this. One one hand finding people that haven&#x27;t been spoiled by big tech and are still excited and enthusiastic about making a difference is huge for a company.\nBut that &quot;they will do everything it takes to succeed&quot; sound like it could be used to the detriment of the employee.')
