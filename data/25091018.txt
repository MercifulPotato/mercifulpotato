They always lag behind, exploit hidden &#x2F; unsupported features and never manage to play by the rules of the platform they are on.<p>All this is enabled by the music gear community which blindly accepts a 2k synth (e.g. Moog Matriarch or Novation Summit) to be riddled with bugs one year after release or companies like NI or Elektron to always be 6 months late with compatibility for new Mac OS releases (first Catalina, now Big Sur), shifting blame on Apple.<p>It&#x27;s Apple&#x27;s platform - they signal changes well in advance.
