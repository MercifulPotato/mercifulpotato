Item(by='slg', descendants=None, kids=[25753283], score=None, time=1610480283, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25752040, text='&gt;I think the answer is pretty simple: restore neutrality and objectivity to epistemological institutions. This doesn&#x27;t mean that empirically false right-wing viewpoints need to be presented on equal footing with empirically true left-wing viewpoints, but rather that subjective issues should be described objectively rather than in the left-wing narrative.<p>How does this actually work in practice?  What does this look like in terms of the coverage of climate change?<p>&gt;Similarly, when popular left-wing mistruths arise, these institutions should call them out as they would right-wing mistruths, however infrequently this may happen. In a word, &quot;honesty&quot;.<p>This already happens.  Look at the NYT repealing of the Caliphate stories.  How often do we get a retraction as big and public as that from the right?<p>&gt;Conservatives (like everyone) need to specifically believe there is a path forward for their legitimate viewpoints, rather than the current system which more-or-less equally discredits legitimate and illegitimate conservative viewpoints. In addition to restoring objectivity and neutrality to epistemological institutions, we could also actively encourage more conservatives to participate in these institutions (and of course, treat them fairly and respectfully as they accept the invitation) to reverse decades of driving them out of these institutions. Yes, this is basically affirmative action for conservatives, and I appreciate the irony.<p>I will repeat my question from my last comment.  Is there an example of this actually working? Is there an example of an institution that has lost the right&#x27;s trust that was able to get it back through catering to their viewpoints while also remaining loyal to the truth?  I am genuinely asking and not trying to be a jerk by just presenting rhetorical questions.')
