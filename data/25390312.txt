We shouldn&#x27;t blindly assume that it&#x27;s &quot;not that bad&quot; if it occasionally rips through the population off of some belief it&#x27;ll make us safer if we&#x27;re routinely exposed to pandemics--as follows from your brush-and-forest-fire analogy--when we don&#x27;t understand the effects of those diseases.<p>&gt; Natural selection is not a bad thing<p>I do not understand this point at all. Should we not have allergen warnings on food packaging? Or glasses for folks with bad eyesight? There are plenty of reasons we intervene in the &quot;natural course&quot; of events to make people&#x27;s lives better. Citing &quot;natural selection&quot; is not in any way a valid defense for just letting diseases meander through populations.')
