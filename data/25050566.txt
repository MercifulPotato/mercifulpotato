The AMD integrated graphics are easily 3x faster in similar product lines in many benchmarks vs the intel&#x27;s. Which means its probably roughly the same as the Amd product lines. Large parts of the presentation perf improvements are probably GPU related.<p>Course i&#x27;m viewing this with a healthy dose of skepticism, having been around in the PPC days when you would think from apple&#x27;s marketing that the PPC based macs were massively faster than your average PC. In reality they were ok, but rarely even the fastest device across a wide swath of benchmarks, mostly sort of middling.')
