If you miss this initial deadline, &quot;your proceeds will be adjusted fifteen (15) days after the end of the fiscal calendar month in which your enrollment is approved. For example, if your enrollment is approved on February 10, 2021, your proceeds are adjusted starting March 14, 2021&quot;<p>&gt; <i>Why canâ€™t they just automatically apply it to all eligible developers?</i><p>Yeah, not just enrolling everyone automatically seems stingy. I guess they&#x27;re really worried about manually checking that single organization don&#x27;t use separate accounts to get around the $1m limit.')
