I have found it quite hard to find good research tying speeding to accidents. the best you get from NHTSA is accidents where speeding &quot;was a factor&quot;. the fraction of accidents where speed was a factor is surprisingly low (around 25% IIRC), and I&#x27;m pretty sure they count speeding as a &quot;factor&quot; whenever someone happened to be speeding right before the incident.<p>I&#x27;m inclined to think speeding is enforced much more than other traffic offenses merely because it is the easiest to detect.')
