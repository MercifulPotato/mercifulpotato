It rains all winter, at least in the north part of the state, so lots of underbrush grows. It doesn&#x27;t rain at all in the summer, so all the brush dries out, providing fuel for the fires. But a bigger problem is that all the forests are wild, so over time all that underbrush grows up and then a fire starts and burns everything down. If there were regular fires than the underbrush would burn quickly leaving the trees unharmed.')
