I&#x27;ve seen this a few times in various contexts, and it has always seemed to me that if this is what&#x27;s driving some problems, one ought to be able to compare populations from different ends of an especially wide time zone, e.g. northwestern Indiana and Maine in the US, which are more than 15 degrees of longitude apart, but both in the US Eastern time zone. Surely one or the other of these groups always has at least half an hour of circadian misalignment?<p>Edit to add: On re-reading, I caught the bit at the end of the &quot;abolition&quot; question where there is a reference to what I wanted, apparently there <i>are</i> studies showing that people in the eastern side of the Central time zone get more sleep than people on the western side.
