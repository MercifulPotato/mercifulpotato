But they also fade as days pass.<p>Attempt quitting when you can afford to not be at 100% for a few days at a time.<p>Cut it out cold turkey. No waning off. Nothing. Just no more caffeine.<p>Day 1 goes alright. Day 2 is a little worse. You&#x27;ll wish you were dead on day 3-5. But day 6 feels better. Day 7 even better. And slowly, by day 30, you&#x27;re off.<p>This worked for me. YMMV. and I believe it&#x27;s because I consumed zero cups of coffee in this entire time.<p>Source: ~1 year caffeine free.')
