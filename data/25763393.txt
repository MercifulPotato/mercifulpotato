Item(by='vannevar', descendants=None, kids=[25764608, 25764543, 25766023, 25765046], score=None, time=1610552641, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25763091, text='Yes, in contrast to the upvote, the downvote button is overloaded: it can signify disagreement, or it can signify a violation of community standards. I think the former is a poor use of the downvote, as it adds little or no value. What good is it to say you disagree with something, if you offer no reasoning? The whole point of a discussion site like HN is to explore ideas and learn. Downvoting to disagree does nothing to further the goals of the site.<p>I think HN would be improved by simply eliminating the downvote entirely and rely on upvoting alone, as the parent suggests.')
