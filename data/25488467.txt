I worked with Cisco on a contract, they had about 22 folks managing the day to day operation for a specific on premise integration. Imagine if Cisco didn&#x27;t have to pay 22 folks to manage the day to day? Let&#x27;s say we cut that need in half but the licensing price remained the same or you could repurpose good engineers to deliver value elsewhere?<p>All of the elastic and horizontal stuff is great, but that&#x27;s covered under SLA.')
