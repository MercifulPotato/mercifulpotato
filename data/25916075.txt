I wanted to add my bits trying to decipher what this is. :)<p>I have implemented a custom index myself so I&#x27;m really interested in this stuff but I have to admit I don&#x27;t understand the language used to explain it. I&#x27;m not sure who the audience is. If it&#x27;s not only targeted at researchers but also random programmers out there, maybe consider adding either an ELI5 translation to things or more proof that it&#x27;s worth investing time in this (eg. learning your lingo). For example, by adding performance charts. I totally missed that.<p>Wow, looking at it again, I now see you have some charts at the bottom of your slides. I&#x27;m pretty sure 99% of your visitors did not find it. And even so, I&#x27;m not quite sure I understand those charts.<p>My 2 cents:<p>1) Simplify them. Don&#x27;t pack so much info in a single chart. This prevents me from getting to the AHA moment. Maybe show them on separate tabs.<p>2) Move this chart&#x2F;these charts to the top of your home page. I knew this is about an index before landing on your site, so when I landed, I had exactly 1 question in my mind: Should I care? Your homepages did not answer that. I found links to papers which I don&#x27;t even open as I believe they are huge time investment and I want to first figure out if I should invest more time. I was happy about the slides because slides are about selling the big ideas. It was better than the home page but in the end I left not having my only question answered. I saved the link. I will probably remember to look at it again when I have special requirements for an index. But I&#x27;m not motivated to invest more time right now, I&#x27;ll keep reading my book in the mornings instead of your paper.<p>(I&#x27;m sharing this so you can improve the site if you want.)')
