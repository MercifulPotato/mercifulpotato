The Edge PM is a former Googler, and is absolutely unable to grasp that he&#x27;s collaborating with the enemy half the time.<p>With the increased privacy features built-in, it&#x27;s definitely an improvement, and feeding Microsoft is less bad than feeding Google, but I&#x27;m not confident Edge&#x27;s current developers have the backbone to stand up to Google&#x27;s decisions.')
