That&#x27;s part of their business.<p>Personally, I own a domain. Every retailer, website, etc. I interact with gets their own email address. I have no doubt Facebook knows some of them, and can maybe even connect some of them to my profile -- but it&#x27;s not certain.<p>P.S: I don&#x27;t even use facebook myself.')
