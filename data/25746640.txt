I use it exclusively, and have advocated others to move to it. There are many sore points with Signal that are well known, but Molly has pointed out a significant one.<p>I simply do not trust the OS exclusively to keep the messages secure at rest. The fact that I could use a passphrase, swipe pattern, or other mechanism to encrypt the database separately from Android was a boon, and I&#x27;m greatly saddened that they have removed that feature.<p>Perhaps a second layer of encryption doesn&#x27;t really matter all that much. If Android&#x27;s security is as bad as I think it is, then a second layer might just amount to security by obscurity. But it&#x27;s the principle of things.<p>angry_octet raises an excellent point. I wish this would return as a mainstream feature.')
