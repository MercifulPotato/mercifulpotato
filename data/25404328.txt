Item(by='hitekker', descendants=None, kids=[25405345], score=None, time=1607833975, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25400024, text='&gt; Readers enjoy the form because it feels a bit like ski jumping-- the writer provides the momentum and the reader&#x27;s imagination leaps off the end with all the story&#x27;s implications flying past.<p>Great metaphor. The story zips you down at full-speed, and then launches you upwards into the air. If you&#x27;re comfortable feeling ungrounded, you&#x27;ll be able to look across the horizon, in awe of the sights you couldn&#x27;t see before. But if you&#x27;re a lazy or cowardly person, your overriding urge will to return to the earth, to get back down to the safety of the soft slopes. Heck, later on, you might even petition the proprietor of the ski-resort to get rid of the ramp.')
