There is plenty of space here.<p>But we <i>don&#x27;t</i> live in 7-acre communities. We live in quarter-acre communities. Transportation, power lines, etc necessitate a certain level of density. And &quot;small&quot; metros with a million people already begin to sprawl in many places. The arrangement of that density is the hard part and ultimately if you want most people to be closer to green space it means you need to densify in some places.<p>Plus complaining about the distribution of work is not really useful; you might as well protest the weather! We can&#x27;t change that in huge ways  quickly and have to work with the economy (and, for that matter, often, the infrastructure) that we have.')
