I saw a TV show where that was clearly not the case, there was a community where everybody was supposed to get married inside their own community. I don&#x27;t think that is integration.<p>Ofcourse I don&#x27;t know how big this group was, relative to all Roma people in the US. This was some reality marriage show, I think on TLC or something.
