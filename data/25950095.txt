They prefer to trade against retail traders because retail traders are typically uncorrelated, which means that vast majority of trades cancel out (but MM still collects the bid-ask spread on the trades!). When you make markets for counter-parties that include big institution there is always a risk that the &quot;small&quot; trades you&#x27;re fulfilling will be very correlated (because a big institution is actually breaking-up and feeding you a big trade). This is called adverse selection and will force MM to start buying to get to a neutral position (which means that the bid-ask spread they are collecting will have to be paid to some other seller).<p>What Citadel and others are doing is they are saying to RH &quot;your order flow is uncorrelated and we&#x27;d like to make markets for it, we will charge your users slightly lower bid-ask spread (price improvement for user) and we will also give you a slice of the bid-ask spread we do collect, in return the uncorrelated nature of the orders will ensure that we won&#x27;t have to do much trades in order to maintain a neutral position.&quot;<p>This proposition is actually good for<p>1. RH users (they get price improvement relative to NBBO)<p>2. RH (they get to make money and get a user base)<p>3. Participating market makers (they get much steadier cash flow from MM activity).<p>It is bad for<p>1. Big institutions, they get to pay larger spread than they would if the market was more diluted by retails<p>2. Non-participating MM (they increase the bid-ask spread to make sure it&#x27;s still worth their time but there is more volatility and it&#x27;s a competitive market so mis-pricing the spread is a real problem).<p>Also, current GME shenanigans are net good for MM since MM is a business that makes money on volume, not direction.')
