The book tells the story of wreck divers who find a U-boat not far from New Jersey.<p>The story echos your friend&#x27;s concern. Wreck divers will remove anything they can from these sunken vessels; placards, insignia, gauges, etc.  They will also damage the vessel in order to make room to continue exploring.<p>The German government was also not happy with the book&#x27;s protagonists because they deem sunken vessels as graves and believe they should remain undisturbed.')
