I realize it&#x27;s high severity, but can&#x27;t accurately say if I should drop everything I&#x27;m doing and upgrade all servers, or wait until this evening..<p>Seems like the most likely attack vector is having a server check a malicious certificate, which happens automatically in some cases. But not always. And it&#x27;s unclear what prompts the automatic check in the first place - perhaps the server executing a remote HTTPS request a malicious user specifies?<p>Thanks in advance!')
