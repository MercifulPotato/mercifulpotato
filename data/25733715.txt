(Over 30 customers so far)<p>My day job is at a boutique consulting company that explicitly allows side projects in our employment contract.\n The founders are very pro-entrepreneurship with employees and encourage us to find and work on side projects.<p>My schedule is usually something like:<p>4am&#x2F;5am-8am Side project work \n8am-4pm Day job work<p>I usually take one of the weekend days off. The other one I may work an hour or two before my family is awake.<p>It helps a ton if your employer allows it. Seems like it might be hard to come by employers who do this though.')
