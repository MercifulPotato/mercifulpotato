We were supposed to be able to communicate through the device but it wasn&#x27;t working well. They&#x27;d just rolled out a new network and it was spotty. I suggested at one point that we use text messages as a back up for communicating and I actually asked him if he was ok with that.<p>He says, &#x27;Yeah, no problem. My name&#x27;s on the patent.&#x27; &#x27;huh?&#x27;, &#x27;I&#x27;m on the SMS patent.&#x27;')
