Item(by='yk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602620815, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24768721, text='&gt; The largest meta-analysis ever conducted of studies published between 1966 and 2013 showed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels &lt;75 nmol&#x2F;L may be too low for safety and associated with higher all-cause mortality, demolishing the previously presumed U-shape curve of mortality associated with vitamin D levels.<p>I am very suspicious of scientific papers who make basic mistakes in the abstract, like citing a lower limit to argue against existence of a U-shaped curve, for that it would be more interesting to know &quot;safe&quot; (in the context of this paper) upper limits. I am also very suspicious of papers that use the word &quot;demolish&quot; in the abstract and aren&#x27;t about civil engineering.')
