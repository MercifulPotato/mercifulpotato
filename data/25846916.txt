For example, automatic updates with no way to downgrade save vendors from having to compete with their own older versions. This means regressions in functionality or design can be pushed out with little recourse for users other than complaining online. This is compounded by ecosystem lock-in and lack of data portability. The software industry as a whole is heading towards treating users more and more paternalistically.')
