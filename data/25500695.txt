They seem currently focused more upon the model analytics part of the pipeline than say, training data selection or ETL to ingest raw data (whether to train upon or run in production), or any number of other pieces of the pipeline.<p>Landing.ai appears to be more tightly focusing their messaging on the operational aspects of the ML pipeline, though not so much the modeling part that C3 appears to emphasize. They also seem to very tightly narrow their focus on machine vision ML.<p>I&#x27;m probably wildly off though, having had no access to the actual platforms and ever used them in anger.')
