Cheers!<p>I&#x27;m not sure it would be wise to take people&#x27;s money.  I&#x27;ve burned a lot of investor money in my career as a computer programmer and I&#x27;ve gotten to the point where I&#x27;m reluctant to do it again.  Not to mention that there&#x27;s no good reason to suspect I&#x27;ve got what it takes as a founder.  (And I&#x27;ve got no team and few connections, so...)<p>In any event, FWIW, I have a plan for bootstrapping: starting with toys and kits, then moving into certain niche applications (such as drone swarms to collect and deliver water to contain and extinguish wildfires) and finally winding up with large structures for mass shipping, human migration, launch platforms for space rockets, etc.<p>Like I said to dragosmocrii, if you really want to encourage me just join my mailing list.  :)<p>mailto:~sforman&#x2F;heliotrope.pajamas+subscribe@lists.sr.ht')
