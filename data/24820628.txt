Phillips is great for use in plastics in many cases, but they were popular long before that became an issue.<p>Personally my drive of choice is Torx - they&#x27;re six-sided so they&#x27;re easier to align the driver, they have excellent torque transfer, they&#x27;re hard to &quot;wallow out&quot;, and the drivers are relatively inexpensive to manufacture. Beyond that, hex (&quot;Allen&quot;) head are good for smaller fasteners where the &quot;wings&quot; on a Torx driver are so small they&#x27;re fragile, Phillips is good for applications where you don&#x27;t want it to be easy to over-torque, and plain old &quot;flat head&quot; is very well-suited for dirty environments where grease and debris may end up coating the head. I&#x27;d certainly not want Torx heads on the bolts under my Jeep, for instance, because they&#x27;re a pain to clean out. I can clean out a flat head with the corner of the driver and be able to use it effectively, which is practical unique to that design and very important for those applications.<p>I have nothing against Robertson. They&#x27;re as good as anything for 90%+ of applications, it&#x27;s just that they&#x27;re uncommon enough where I am that it doesn&#x27;t make sense to use them.')
