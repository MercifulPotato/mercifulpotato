Item(by='tinco', descendants=None, kids=[25277074], score=None, time=1606812522, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25262282, text='It&#x27;s not meaningless if you know the context. Achieving 100M degrees is actually a significant milestone for this type of device. The reactor in the UK has this planned for somewhere in the next year. I don&#x27;t know SPARC&#x27;s schedule, maybe it&#x27;s a bit more secretive but when they achieve 100M it will be in the news as well.<p>And even if you don&#x27;t know the context, the article says it&#x27;s the first in the world to achieve 100M <i>for 20 seconds</i>, good luck doing that in your microwave.<p>And the specific temperature of 100M degrees might seem arbitrary because it&#x27;s such a funny sounding amount, but it is actually the precise temperature at which the plasma theoretically starts becoming net positive.<p>Whether it actually was net positive will obviously be the focus of the researchers for the next weeks, and even if they find the plasma generated energy consistently (which we&#x27;d surprised about if it didn&#x27;t) it still doesn&#x27;t mean the reactor was net positive as a whole because of inefficiencies.<p>They will not have fried their expensive reactor intentionally, so if they did that will be sad news. The scale of the experiment is clearly visible from the video. It&#x27;s a room sized spherical tokamak style device. I&#x27;m pretty sure the density of the plasma inside those is a given but I&#x27;m not 100% on the physics there.')
