I think you just mean reactance at higher frequencies (since resistance is DC), and total impedance is then DCR + frequency-dependent reactance.<p>Then the ratio of impedances determines attenuation, like you say. Which I think makes sense it works against interference, because I would think that the effective source impedance of radio interference is relatively high, so a half-turn (just passing the cable through once) can provide meaningful attenuation.<p>Considering this, 3-8 dB attenuation against a low-Z (50 Î©) source with just a half-turn actually sounds good!')
