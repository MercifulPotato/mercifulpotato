Dan Walsh had not yet made the initial commit that began Podman&#x27;s life:  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;containers&#x2F;podman&#x2F;commit&#x2F;2b74391cd5281f6fdf391ff8ad50fd1490f6bf89" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;containers&#x2F;podman&#x2F;commit&#x2F;2b74391cd5281f6f...</a><p>So I think it&#x27;s safe to say that Podman was not mentioned in the article because it did not exist when the article was written.<p>These days Podman is alive and well.  I use it a lot more than Docker now.  The fact that Podman can run&#x2F;create Kubernetes Pods (without needing K8s) is a compelling feature for me.')
