You&#x27;ve mentioned you have over 10 years of experience managing rack servers. That&#x27;s super great!<p>This means a company that hires you does not need to use AWS for some of the services, because you&#x27;ve got the necessary expertise to do it yourself. Other companies buy this expertise via fully managed services, like S3 or Aurora.<p>Once you have expertise doing X, it might seem wrong paying premium to cloud providers to do the same thing for you. But other companies don&#x27;t have you on board. They save themselves time recruiting two sysops with partcular skillset, and spin up a working HA rdbms in a day.<p>Comparing ec2 and vms on xenserver doesn&#x27;t sound convincing because ec2 itself is simple. But comparing HA Aurora or Dynamo cluster to on-prem solution is a different beast. As a dev, I don&#x27;t really want to know all the gore details of managing HA rabbitmq, and might opt for SQS instead.')
