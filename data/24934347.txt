Is he not supposed to travel with his kids during that time?<p>- &quot;Air Force Two&quot; is the term used for any plane the VP is on. Anyone flying with the VP is on Air Force Two.<p>- Hunter Biden, and only Hunter Biden, met with the Chinese bankers. Joe Biden had no contact with the bankers,  involvement in the meeting, or financial involvement with the fund before or after.<p>- The emails in question were from 2017, after Joe Biden was no longer VP.<p>- While the emails may be questionable, there is no evidence of Joe Biden&#x27;s involvement in any part of the deal during or after his time as VP.')
