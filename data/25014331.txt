As such, we&#x27;d like it to be as closely integrated with Github as possible.<p>But we would like a fairly specific feature - we want the ability to automatically increase the priority based on the number of reports something has, without requiring the team do this themselves (e.g. the team should only need update a number).<p>The closest we&#x27;ve found is Monday.com. They let you create a row for your bug, and then a numeric column which you can easily increase (effectively a +1), and create a rule that says &#x27;When that column&#x27;s value &gt; 5, set [other column]&#x27;s priority to X&#x27; and so on.<p>However, Monday doesn&#x27;t really work for us because it doesn&#x27;t support Markdown in the discussion area, which we use heavily for reporting bugs, providing examples, etc etc.<p>Any ideas would be appreciated!')
