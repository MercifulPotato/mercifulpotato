I published the first edition of my book [1] through O&#x27;Reilly and had much of the same experiences. I would add, though, that their expertise in publishing was useful. They took care of copyediting, an ISBN, printing, redrawing my hand-sketched figures, etc. All stuff I could theoretically do or hire out on my own, but have zero interest in managing.<p>For the second edition, which I&#x27;m working on now, I had serious second thoughts about going with O&#x27;Reilly again. Ultimately, I decided that I would, mostly because I knew O&#x27;Reilly would be able to spread the word a <i>lot</i> further than I would. I&#x27;ve got a decent network, but not an amazing one.<p>The reasoning was that I&#x27;m a consultant, and the cachet, reach, and resulting leads I&#x27;ll get from publishing through a known publisher are much more valuable than the theoretical profits I&#x27;m missing out on. That was certainly true for the first edition.<p>Having made that decision, I&#x27;m glad that I did. O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s provided a lot more support with the second edition than they did with the first. My production editor has been fantastic; heavily involved with reviewing draft chapters and very supportive. I also managed to swing a better royalty deal (but still far less than minimum wage) and we&#x27;ve had some great conversations about co-marketing the book.<p>[1] <i>The Art of Agile Development</i> (2007).
