I used to greatly prefer python to c++ or java when I actually had to type full names and look up interfaces like a pleb.<p>Now I can&#x27;t stand untyped python. Have to actually look at documentation to see what methods a class has, who has time for that?<p>Writing golang with tabnine is otherworldly. It&#x27;s so regular, not just the syntax, but the variable naming conventions, and course structure even, that it feels like loosely nudging the autocomplete in the direction of the goal.')
