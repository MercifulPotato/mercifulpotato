Is this actually a teaching of the Law of Moses, as you call it, or just something Christians think Jews believed?<p>Well, If you are familiar with the book of James (a Jew) in the bible, he says this, &quot;For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.&quot; The law is a single unit.<p>&gt; God made a bunch of laws about how people should behave, presumably because there&#x27;s right and wrong and the particular things God cares about matter<p>Sin precedes the law and not the other way round. The law was given because of transgression. Look at the law as a guardian, a schoolmaster, to protect, and to preserve for a time, till the Saviour should come. God did not intend to relate with man through the law because by the law, is the knowledge of sin.<p>&gt;... it&#x27;s all cool. Jesus paid your debt, go sin.<p>If anyone is living in sin and claims that he or she is living under grace, let me be the first to tell you that this person is not living under grace. How can he or she be when God’s Word clearly states that “sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace” (Rom. 6:14)? Based on the authority of God’s Word, a person who is under grace will not be dominated by or want to continue living in sin.<p>He Who Is Forgiven Much, Loves Much.')
