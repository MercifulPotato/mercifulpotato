Because, for some reason, those gatekeepers weren&#x27;t entirely terrible in keeping really obvious and obnoxious assholes far away from their printing presses.<p>And let&#x27;s be clear: nobody gets &quot;literally destroyed&quot;, nor even figuratively, for publishing &quot;one wrong thought&quot;. Parler had been peddling in low-effort violence-porn for the lowlifes that make up their userbase for what.. two years? That&#x27;s hundreds of thousands of terrible... &quot;thoughts&quot;. And nothing happened, until <i>something</i> happened, which happened to be peoples&#x27; deaths and a crisis of democracy.<p>For comparison: reddit got into hot water at some point, and managed to clean up their act. The porn websites are in a similar process. It&#x27;s all just actions-have-consequences, really. And the public&#x27;s ire is actually the more nuanced, soft approach to do it, compared to the blunt tool of criminal law.')
