However, a Tesla <i>did</i> come along, and as a result, Tesla now controls an ungodly fraction of the total worldwide automaker value.<p>Basically, it was a bad strategy, as it was practically inevitable that at some point someone would &quot;defect&quot; and do BEVs. Not only did the automakers use a bad strategy, but they failed to pivot from that strategy once it was already blown to hell.  Any one of them could be worth a lot more money now if they had simply taken EVs as seriously as Tesla did a decade ago.  But none did.<p>Same problem with Kodak.  The new technology is inevitable, and while you may delay it, you&#x27;re killing your future by doing so.  It&#x27;s short term thinking.')
