It&#x27;s IoT, businesses, hospitals, government agencies, utility companies, etc.<p>We need to stop seeing us (as private end users) as the centre of the world and start to acknowledge that there&#x27;s hundreds of millions of PC devices out there that don&#x27;t serve private end users. It&#x27;s the security needs of these organisations that are addressed by this technology, not yours, not mine.<p>The unfortunate truth is that Windows is still the backbone of many government agencies, power plants, hospital IT, businesses and so on.<p>It&#x27;s also a fact that most of these machines are not well managed, lack updates , aren&#x27;t hardened or secured in any way and are targeted by cyber criminals on a daily basis; sometimes with grim consequences. It gets even worse when you look at IoT and the mess that manufacturers get us into (default passwords, unsecured data transfer, ...).<p>I see this chip in the same area as Intel&#x27;s vPro, TPM 2.0, AMDs ASP (in their Ryzen PRO line), and so on; not necessarily aimed at end users (aside from the occasional buzzword) and more aimed towards businesses and government users (as part of their Zero-Trust initiative).')
