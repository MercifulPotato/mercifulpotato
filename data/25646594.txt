Aiming to explore and advocate for short-term transportation changes like creating low-traffic neighborhoods and fleshing out bike and bus networks, and moonshot ideas like congestion charging zones in city centers, superblocks, and zoning changes. Targeting the general public, rather than planners who&#x27;ve already got tools they trust, for education, gathering feedback, and prompting citizen advocacy.<p>We&#x27;ve been growing an open source &amp; academic community fairly well, but I want to hire more full-time engineers, and money&#x27;s becoming a limiting factor. Looking for a partner on the business and PM side, so I can focus on the technical. The huge disclaimer is that I&#x27;m unwilling to compromise on the project being open source, so I have no idea how to squeeze a business model in here. I&#x27;ve also done a terrible job so far of actually getting public transit &#x2F; cycling advocacy groups on board, so the need for a PM is pretty severe to make sure we&#x27;re building the right thing.<p>Contact on github or HN.')
