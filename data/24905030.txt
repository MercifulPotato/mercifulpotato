Is it just too late for a project as mature as Postgres?<p>This is commonly done using <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pgbouncer.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pgbouncer.org&#x2F;</a><p>While it&#x27;s not built-in, it&#x27;s a really common solution and can achieve high number of connections. It comes with some issues though (no server-side prepared statements). And yes, it&#x27;s not exactly the same as pipelining on the server itself since it&#x27;s still limited by the number of bouncer connections, but there&#x27;s usually enough idle time to sacrifice some latency for throughput.<p>There&#x27;s also <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pgpool.net&#x2F;mediawiki&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Main_Page" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pgpool.net&#x2F;mediawiki&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Main_Page</a> but I&#x27;m not familiar with the details.')
