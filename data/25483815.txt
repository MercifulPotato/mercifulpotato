Item(by='nexuist', descendants=None, kids=[25486308, 25485407, 25484175, 25484340], score=None, time=1608437873, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25481256, text='Can we talk about how it&#x27;s even possible for a save file to reach 8mb? Back in the day (way before my day!) a z80 could only address 65kb of RAM total. It was still possible to load and play an entire 2D game + save file given that space constraint. Obviously I&#x27;m not going to compare a modern AAA title to Drug Wars from 1984, but I will compare strings to strings and ints to int. The basic data sizes haven&#x27;t changed.<p>Let&#x27;s be generous and assume every character in the save file is stored as 4-byte UTF-8 (the edge case - most characters are 1 or 2 bytes only). Given that 1MB is 1 million bytes, that means you can store 250,000 characters in 1 MB, or 2 million characters in 8MB.<p>What is being stored in this file to warrant space equivalent to 2 million characters?! As far as I&#x27;m aware the save file doesn&#x27;t include PNGs or video recordings that would obviously blow up the size. It onlys contain strings and numbers. How are there so many to fill up all that space?<p>Maybe someone in the game dev industry can shed some light? It seems so crazy to me, although I am admittedly approaching this from an embedded hardware background.<p>EDIT: It seems like people are saying this is caused by craftable item data. Even then, with 2 million characters to work with, you&#x27;d have to craft 200 guns assuming each item takes up 10,000 characters, and 2,000 guns assuming each item takes up 1000 characters. As far as I can see each gun only has a handful of attributes, so...what gives?')
