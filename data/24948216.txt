Item(by='salamimonger', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604105816, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24947813, text='&gt;CA is a giant state with no realistic public transport options for the vast majority of its population. Services like Uber and Lyft aren&#x27;t merely &#x27;luxuries&#x27; for its people, they provide a necessary service for many of them, without which their lives would not merely be inconvenienced but often be drastically affected.<p>Agreed. I am from LA and as a poor person, for the majority of my life (when I am on my own and without friends&#x2F;family), my only choice was to walk or take the bus to places. When Uber came along, the idea of paying less than $10 to get a ride completely changed the game for people like me. Now we can actually be on time to important appointments that are too far off to walk or take public transportation reliably. And if we are running late, that&#x27;s less than $10 to get to work on time, which is arguably worth it even if you were working the shittiest minimum wage job in CA, since minimum wage here is above $10. For us poor folk without cars and the money to pay for car insurance, the ability to call an Uber gave us freedom and choice beyond walking, cycling, and public transpo, which are a joke in a lot of situations - without having to rely on the good will of family and friends.')
