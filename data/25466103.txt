I know people individually can not boycott Chinese products, because more people, more difficult to come to consensus, there will be excuses anyway. But, western government can come to consensus and decide not to buy anything, literally anything from China, this will hurt really hard everyone (people living in China, in big economies and everyone else). If this action will take place, then history will remember it and anyone who wants to work against human rights will know there will be huge hurting actions.')
