You might be; others are not.<p>I don&#x27;t want to suggest <i>everyone</i> is happy with the status quo, but it&#x27;s at least not one of the top items on everyone&#x27;s agenda for change.<p>&gt; Unbreakable encryption should be available to everyone, and straightforward for everyone to use, and used by default rather than only for &quot;sensitive&quot; information. Unbreakable encryption should be so widely used that the thought never even occurs to anyone to associate it with wrongdoing. Communication using unbreakable encryption should simply be &quot;communication&quot;.<p>I agree with you - but I also doubt it will happen. Not because of some government conspiracy but because I don&#x27;t for a second believe that people would choose &quot;government can&#x27;t tap a criminal&#x27;s phone call or text messages even with a court order&quot; as an acceptable drawback for the benefit &quot;my own conversations are always secure&quot;. I really don&#x27;t. I&#x27;d be happy to be proven wrong though. So I  simply don&#x27;t think there is any democratic pressure for it.')
