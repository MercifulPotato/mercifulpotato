The natural wolf populations in areas surrounding the northern wilderness of WI spread into open territory. The packs in WI are only in forested areas in the north naturally. For the wolves to reach southern wilderness they need to pass through the heavily civilized river basins into new mountainous territory, then that isolated population needs to expand on it&#x27;s own, because they are not being introduced.<p>You&#x27;re right about relocations though, it&#x27;s a class issue. The wolves that predate on livestock are often relocated. Normal wolf sightings though can be reported to the state to increase their coverage: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dnr.wi.gov&#x2F;topic&#x2F;WildlifeHabitat&#x2F;MammalObsForm.asp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dnr.wi.gov&#x2F;topic&#x2F;WildlifeHabitat&#x2F;MammalObsForm.asp</a>')
