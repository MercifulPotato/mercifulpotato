Item(by='guptaneil', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604968935, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25039021, text='&gt; why are we policing this way?<p>Because we created police forces to round up slaves and then just kept adding more responsibilities to them. In fact, before we had ambulances, police officers would just throw the injured&#x2F;sick in the back of their paddy wagon and drive them to a doctor. Frustrated with the staggeringly high death rate for people in his community, a black doctor eventually created the idea of an ambulance and specialized paramedics who handle that situation instead of police. It was so effective, white neighborhoods started calling him too and we eventually adopted the idea everywhere.<p>The idea of defunding the police means to do more of that. Trained specialists for different types of calls who are dispatched based on need. Much like how police will often show up with an ambulance to make sure it’s safe but then leave pretty quickly once they confirm it is, the same could be done with other non-violent calls like the one you described.<p>This isn’t rocket science, and it’s well steeped in research. We just need to be able to get over our biases.')
