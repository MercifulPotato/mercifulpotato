I have a mail server running on my main hosting server that I have complete control over, with certificates and so forth to make it trustworthy. Then I have an in-home mail server that acts as a proxy, which pulls in all the email from the main server, so that when I type in mail.justinlloyd.domain I end up on a page that looks very much like Google&#x27;s gmail. And of course, multiple backups of the servers in multiple locations. But this isn&#x27;t for everyone.')
