None of the ideas that were reified in it&#x27;s design, types, or behaviour - not forcing rasters down unix pipes nor building widgets with X objects nor rendering networked fonts nor the general concept of immediate-mode widget rendering - are actually used today in modern X apps and have been mitigated-away with hacks and jury-rigs. But the design and the types and the protocol persists and no one wants to work on this nonsense in their free time. Unpaid programmers have voted with their commmits and Xorg has been orphaned. It&#x27;s a dirty job and for the longest time only paid programmers have maintained X. And the last company to pay programmers to work on this stuff canvassed their customers and decided that the work didn&#x27;t need to be done anymore.<p>Everyone using X today has been free-riding on RHEL customers for years and Redhat has decided not to burden them with this anymore. And nobody else is volunteering to pay for this.<p>I don&#x27;t think <i>entitled developers</i> is the right term here. As an Xorg user, how much did you pay to use Xorg?')
