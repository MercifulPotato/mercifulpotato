And he exposed the underbelly of the American pharmaceutical system. And someone had to go down for both of those things, and it sure as shit wasn&#x27;t going to the CEO of the larger, far more powerful pharmas.<p>This guy might be a dickhead, but last I checked, being a dickhead isn&#x27;t a crime; and speaking of crime, the shit they trumped up for him was shit that gets done a hundred times a year, at far larger scale, with much worse consequences than what he did. And what <i></i>was<i></i> the end result of Martin&#x27;s actions, once the dust settled? He made a profit for his investors.<p>Its a fucking disgrace, is what it is. This is why the American people have no faith left, because every goddamned institution has been co-opted by money, and where at least in the past, they had the good fucking grace to deny it and keep it hidden, now they blatantly flaunt it, because they know that not only can you not do anything about it, you&#x27;re too fat and happy to bother risking anything yourself.<p>Nothing will change until half this country is starving in the street. And even then, I doubt anything&#x27;ll change.')
