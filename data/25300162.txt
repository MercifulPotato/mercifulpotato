You don&#x27;t leave employment that you are otherwise happy with over such a thing.<p>There were clearly conflicts brewing below the lid. This was just taken as the final straw. On both sides, I&#x27;d reasonably expect. She was dissatisfied with a bunch of things that she couldn&#x27;t makr public, so she boiled over on this one. That&#x27;s why many people are surprised this is such a big deal.<p>And then she gave a ultimatum, which was great for both sides.

And for her because she can use it for maximum outrage.  It was a calculated provocation. Come on, if you really want to be part of a process of change, that&#x27;s not how to achieve that.
