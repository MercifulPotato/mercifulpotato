Without admitting or denying the SECâ€™s findings, Robinhood agreed to a cease-and-desist order prohibiting it from violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the recordkeeping provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, censuring it, and requiring it to pay a $65 million civil penalty.<p>A slight quibble, Robinhood and the SEC settled.  There was no fines issued.<p>I do think that the threat of being sent to jail would be a much better deterrent than the threat of losing 2x the money gained by doing something illegal.')
