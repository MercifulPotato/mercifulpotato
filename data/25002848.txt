Item(by='pdimitar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604615779, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24992069, text='All of that is completely fair and I am not debating your well-made points.<p>My issue are a few things in particular:<p>- Recent evidence that most AI papers are approved by underground rings of peer reviews -- either on the principle of &quot;you approve my paper, I&#x27;ll approve yours&quot; or because the authors know each other from university. That story was even posted here on HN several months ago.<p>- Any progress that the outside public sees is really small.<p>- Any non-small progress is never noticed by the general public. It&#x27;s captured by a corporation because some deluded board member who never worked an hour in their life imagines that the company&#x27;s small AI breakthrough will definitely hand them the keys to ruling the entire planet, I suppose. One example coming to mind: translation software. Why doin&#x27;t we have that yet?! There are literal decades of research and some of the FAANG corporations bragged on their blogs, several times, that they almost solved it (Microsoft I think). All of the public-facing translation software packages are rather mediocre. Also, why don&#x27;t we have publicly accessible and shareable NNs trained with millions of self-driving travels? Etc.<p>---<p>&gt; <i>I think it&#x27;s the fault of the media that &quot;AI&quot; appears as this single conceptual blur</i><p>Many here on HN -- me included -- have the confidence to think they are not influenced by mainstream media on such topics. I personally got hyped for computers at 11-12 y&#x2F;o partly due to the charmingly goofy but ambitious 90s sci-fi movies but now, almost 30 years later, I am not seeing that progress you speak about.<p>&gt; <i>The &quot;comfy well-funded bro-club corner&quot; (why so much envy in the phrasing?)</i><p>You deciphered it perfectly. It&#x27;s envy, not going to deny the obvious. I am not making half-bad money at all but I have heard some insane numbers -- like $30k+ a month for being an AI researcher! -- and I in the meantime have to prove to my team leader that I am not completely useless even though I was recruited on the clear condition that most of what the company is working with is new to me and I&#x27;ll need months to catch up. And I get times less salary. I admit I am envious of people who get to (a) do exploratory work and (b) be very handsomely rewarded for it.<p>I think even with that there&#x27;s a good feedback that AI workers can extract from my rant: you guys are extremely privileged. Even more than a lot of programmers &#x2F; sysadmins (who are already quite privileged compared to many other people).<p>&gt; <i>It is capable of a lot more than 1-2 decades ago.</i><p>There&#x27;s no ill intent behind the next phrase: I am honestly not seeing it anywhere. As a very pragmatic (and aging) programmer I&#x27;ll believe it when my dishwasher can reach for the dishes and cutlery in the sink and load them by itself. I&#x27;ll believe it when I can leave a robot at home while taking a walk with my wife and return to a spick-and-span-clean apartment.<p>Which brings me to...<p>&gt; <i>If you just read the &quot;AI&quot; comment sections on HN it may seem everybody is just training a cat&#x2F;dog classifier in Keras on ImageNet and nothing new is going on.</i><p>I am not denying that I do the same and I am likely judging this through not getting enough information. But my general intention isn&#x27;t to be extremely well informed on what&#x27;s happening in the area; it is more about asking the question &quot;okay, fine, but WHEN will what you are working on be ACTUALLY useful, even a little bit, out there?&quot;.<p>I can see how many don&#x27;t like having that question asked to them and so I guess people like me and an average AI researcher would never have a productive discussion. Damn shame. :(')
