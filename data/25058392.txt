Item(by='mumblemumble', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605102981, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25056061, text='&gt; The plan is to be entirely advertising dependent<p>As a potential consumer of said news, I can accept this as long as the advertising scrupulously follows the old-school model, with no click-tracking or impression counting.<p>If advertisers are just paying for placement, and the price of that placement is decided up-front and based on overall readership volume, then everyone&#x27;s interests are reasonably well-aligned with those of the reader: The news outlet gets sustained readership (i.e., actual subscribers) by offering a high-quality product overall, and advertisers support that sustained readership by making sure the ads are reasonably pleasant, or at least not too obtrusive. Readers, by getting a more stable and less frantic and annoying reading experience, are more incentivized to actually subscribe and become a regular reader, which in turn offers the news outlet and its advertisers a stable base.<p>If they take a single step down the path of impression or click tracking, though, I would expect that whole house of cards to come tumbling down as quickly as it always does. Even Medium, which doesn&#x27;t actually have advertising, ended up devolving into one big noisy awful doomscrolly gadfly chum bucket. It was inevitable. Their &quot;pay for reads &#x2F; pay for likes&quot; model for paying authors creates exactly the same perverse attention economy incentive structures that caused the rest of the internet to collapse into a twitching heap of listicles.')
