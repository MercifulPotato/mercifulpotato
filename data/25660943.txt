It was a disaster. I spent &gt;50% of my time on client, non-technical work. I then joined a ~20 person firm in San Francisco and worked there for a few years purely coding. It was a joy. They had great business people, designers, copy writers, and then about a dozen great engineers, and I could just focus on the code and get paid for that. My hours went down, pay went up, and got to do what I love.<p>If you are thinking of contracting&#x2F;consulting, I&#x27;d highly recommend joining a diversified team in the 10-100 range so you can do the parts of the work you love and rely on your team for the rest.')
