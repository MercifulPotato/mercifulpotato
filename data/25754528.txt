That is, be a concentrated anger-machine-echo-chamber.<p>How is&#x2F;was Parler different from Facebook in this regard?  Facebook makes money on ads, so the longer you stay on their site, the more money they make.  One way to get people to stay longer is by encouraging the sorts of posts that gets people riled up.<p>I&#x27;m not accusing Facebook of being complicit in the events of last week, but from personal observation, I see a lot more low-effort, angry posts on Facebook than I do on Twitter or Reddit.')
