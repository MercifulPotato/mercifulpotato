There is simply no good way to share a filesystem between Windows and Linux that is both 1. fast 2. fully correct - i.e doesn&#x27;t break some code.<p>SMB&#x2F;NFS just never work super well because they are slow, or programs think they are local filesystems so things break (e.g VScode won&#x27;t detect new files created on the linux side of a SMB mount without a manual refresh). Plenty of details on getting permissions right too. Not to mention extended attributes which differ slightly and break stuff. Network file systems in general are just too different to local FS&#x27;s for programs to work seamlessly.<p>The 2 non-ideal solutions I&#x27;ve found are 1. keep all files in linux + edit over network using VSCode Remote or IntelliJ Remote support or 2. keep a copy of the dev workspace in windows, and use something like unison (or manual git) to sync.')
