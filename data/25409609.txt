It wasn’t because of the dollar - it was because of the us military.  At the end of WWII, there was not real alternative except the British pound, but they couldn’t back it up with military might.<p>Adding to the leverage was the gift of a DC3 to The Saudi King, whereas the Brits gifted a Rolls Royce. The King liked to fly and could sit in either seat. In the Rolls, he wanted to ride up front, but would have to sit at the unclean hand of the driver.<p>Sorry to nitpick your nitpick, but these things were more important (and somewhat causal) to a strong dollar.')
