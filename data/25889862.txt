Have a look at past year&#x27;s increase in M2 circulating supply of the EUR or GBP. They&#x27;re very similar to the one of the USD (percentage wise). That might be the reason why the dollar didn&#x27;t collapse compared to them. The dollar (and the other currencies) collapsed though, when compared to assets that didn&#x27;t increased in quantity at the same pace: real estate, stocks, gold and bitcoin. None of which is part of the CPI, hence the low reported inflation in the developed world economies.')
