I think of the election interference hysteria, the whole &quot;enemy number one&quot; business.  US media, not Navalny.<p>I watched the video too so I am part of the 10M.  It&#x27;s very well made.  Most people don&#x27;t have a pinboard with string on it a-la Silence of the Lambs.  I got a chuckle out of the tropes.<p>Look, you and I have to work for a living.  Who pays Navalny&#x27;s bills?  And no, I don&#x27;t believe him when he says it is &quot;anonymous donors&quot;.')
