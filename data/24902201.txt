I want to self-host. TANSTAAFL and either I get used for profiling&#x2F;upselling (Feedly) or I need to pay money while I can self host (Feedbin).<p>Reeder 4 is also good, I tried it (for free) right before Reeder 5 got released. It supports a whole lot more than NetNewsWire, including self hosting services FreshRSS, Reader, and Fever (deprecated). It also has support for Pocket.<p>So I went with Reeder and got FreshRSS installed.<p>On Android I settled with FeedMe, but honestly I haven&#x27;t found a slick one which works with FreshRSS.<p>I could settle with tmux + CLI + Browsh. In that case, consider Newsboat. It supports a myriad of (self-hosted) RSS services. But not the ones Reeder supports...')
