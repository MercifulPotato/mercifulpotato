I think a mix of shoulder mobility limits and that caused the pain I get when I squat.  This has gone down though despite my squat weight going up.  When I squat I try to make more effort to squeeze my shoulders back and down and watch the angle of my arms.  Also, holding a kettlebell upside down for 1 minute on each side above my head with elbow straight has greatly reduced my elbow pain.')
