Item(by='Pinus', descendants=None, kids=[24790770, 24791153], score=None, time=1602780412, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24789491, text='I, too, have a 28S that rarely sees the light of day. Instead it is my older, and much less advanced, HP-10C that gets occasional exercise.<p>The 28 and 48 series sat in a kind of awkward spot between pocket calculators and &quot;real&quot; computers. The programming language is essentially Lisp turned backwards, but for any task where you actually need that capacity, it must have been easier, even at the time, to just use a PC (in the wider sense, not just IBM PC and clones). The 48 had better communications facilities, so I imagine it might have been useful where pocket carry was actually necessary (it seems to have been popular with surveyors, for example, and I have seen them hooked up with a cable to a total station).')
