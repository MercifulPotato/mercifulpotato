There was no specialized equipment, except for perhaps tight jeans and moustache (optional for women).<p>However, no matter go interested people are, eventually reality hits you like a truck, or car door as the case may be, and your third bike gets stolen, and you get sick of it.<p>People would definitely use the infrastructure- there&#x27;s no shortage of people who like to rides bikes, but are sick of dealing with crazy drivers and potholes and car doors and fedex&#x2F;prime trucks parked wherever in the middle of the road.')
