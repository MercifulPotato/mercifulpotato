Nobody here (at least, I hope) is getting pleasure from saying that a bunch of Indian people are spamming them with low-quality pull requests. But the fact is that this is happening, and it’s better to try to figure out what is actually happening rather than throwing up your hands and saying “these people have tarnished my ability to ever file a pull request”, it’s much more useful to try to identify what’s really happening and then see if we can fix it.<p>The fact is that DigitalOcean basically ran a lazy but well-meaning program that was promoted with a poorly-thought-out (but also well-meaning) video on YouTube to a majority Indian audience who largely had no experience with open source etiquette and thus we have the logical result. It’s not that they’re bad people or stupid or whatever, but they were just in the perfect storm of things that told them to do what they’re doing right now because they literally got no guidance at all. This is just “I accidentally sent my feature request email to the development mailing list because I’m unfamiliar with how this process works” but magnified by several orders of magnitude and also slanted towards participation by a certain group of people. The frustration is of course towards the circumstances that led to this happening but it’s often hard to express that and much easier to tweet angrily about “Indian dudes spamming me with PRs”.')
