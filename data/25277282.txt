Most of the world doesn&#x27;t really care if their meat is cruelty-free (not enough to pay extra for it), but I think they&#x27;ll move to lab grown meat if it has other benefits.  Conventional livestock farming takes a lot of work to ensure that the food supply is safe (sanitation and testing), and I assume that lab grown meat has a natural advantage in this area.  I would love if lab grown meat had a guarantee of less bacteria so I could cook my meat less.  I would also love it if lab grown meat had customizable texture and fat content.  That&#x27;s stuff I&#x27;d pay extra money to have.  Once the premium products see wide distribution I assume that a cheaper grade will become available.')
