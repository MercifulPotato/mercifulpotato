However, note how small the sample size is, which makes it extremely difficult to draw conclusions. Quote from p14:<p>&gt; Finally, we considered the possibility that seniority may be at play and that gender simply coincides with seniority. We recognized that two  of  the  three  female Justices,  Justice  Kagan  and  Justice Sotomayor,  are  more  junior  on  the  Court  and  that  each  is interrupted far more frequently than Justice Ginsburg. In addition, Table  1  provides  some  provisional  support  for  the  seniority hypothesis because of the most senior Justices - Ginsburg, Kennedy, Scalia,  and  Breyer — only  Ginsburg  and  Breyer  are  interrupted  at high  rates. In  contrast,  the  more  junior  Justices — Kagan, Sotomayor,  and  Alito — account  for  the  other  seven  high interruption rates.')
