Though you wait six months for that public MRI, but it doesn&#x27;t cost you anything! Yes, the waits suck, and they are related to having a low number of these machines in our public systems, compared to other countries. We have private imaging clinics in Canada which will serve you promptly, for something like $700 and up. Could it be that people are going to the USA simply because they are finding better deals than that? You know, get cheaper groceries and gas, and swing an MRI along the way, kind of thing.')
