Estimates I&#x27;ve seen range from &quot;climate change is not real&quot; to 600 Euros.<p>On the other hand you only have to disassemble an iPhone and check the availability of replacement parts to see whether it&#x27;s repairable or not. It&#x27;s easy to say exactly what damage can be repaired and what not. Very little room for discussion.')
