No one is able to adopt the practices of the Minoan religion. The Minoan religion is dead since their people have gone and they didn&#x27;t write much, if anything, down and no one can accurately choose to adopt their beliefs.<p>Despite the extinction of their civilization and our inability to translate their language, we do know quite a bit about minoan religion through the study of artifacts and the accounts of their neighbors. Contemporaneously the Homeric epics were carried on in oral tradition for hundreds of years before the greeks wrote them down. And yet despite ready access to greek mythology you would be hard pressed to find anyone alive today who believes it to be true. The absence of a text does not eliminate the idea it conveys, nor does conveying an idea lead automatically to its adoption.')
