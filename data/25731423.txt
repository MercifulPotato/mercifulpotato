Item(by='seanwilson', descendants=None, kids=[25731504], score=None, time=1610383265, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25725536, text='&gt; Once I reach 10K in yearly EU sales I am supposed to either register an office in each country where I do business to file and pay taxes there, which is crazy at a tiny scale like mine, or register for VAT &quot;MOSS&quot; which allows me to collect tax in the different rates depending on the countries, but still only pay the collected tax to Finland.<p>Sounds accurate to me. This only covers the EU as well and not other countries (assuming you want to sell worldwide), and the rules are always changing too (I&#x27;m in the UK and Brexit just happened!).')
