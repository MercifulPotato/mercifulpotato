I am highly considering trying again at eom when they announce the new cards but that it’s a Radeon is still a downside to me.<p>Most of the Linux community has a historical hatred of Nvidia because of the driver issue so there’s a lot of relative love out in forums, but just “stable” would be a step up for me for Radeons on windows.')
