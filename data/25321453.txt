Just meant in the context of computer collectors. A lot of apples latest computers lack the “collectibility” factor, they feel like total junk scrap in 10 years. Which is especially interesting because they usually do such a good job of making their new computers seem like holy grail immaculate gems. I distinctly remember the first intel MacBooks looking very high end and high tech, now they look like total garbage.')
