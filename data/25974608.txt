Same with SMS. All of my contact details (and photos&#x2F;etc) are synced with my phone, tablet, desktop and laptop. My logins&#x2F;passwords are synced between all devices. I can seamlessly switch devices and pick up open browser tabs. Plus I use Apple software that isn&#x27;t available on other platforms (Logic Pro specifically here).<p>Sure many of these can likely be done on other platforms too, but on macOS these things (and more) are seamless and don&#x27;t require any other software, nor configuration (beyond setting up one&#x27;s iCloud login on each device).<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong: I&#x27;m a developer, and use Linux in local VMs and on local and remote servers. But all of these Apple features targeted at &#x27;normal users&#x27; are quite nice, and one quickly gets used to them. But perhaps not everyone&#x27;s cup of tea.')
