So if inciting violence is a known element on a site, and the owners are aware, then I believe (not a lawyer) that they can&#x27;t hide behind 230.<p>Also I do not believe 230 prevents lawsuits against hosting services necessarily. It may make tech companies liable for providing a platform to a service that is behind 230 but they themselves can&#x27;t claim that.<p>With regards to Facebook and Twitter, they have significantly larger user bases and active moderation. So definitely not perfect but they can remove content that violates all the ToS they may be beholden to. Parler does not provide such a thing, and doubles down on not doing so. So a lot of content gets removed from FB&#x2F;Twitter, and if stuff doesn&#x27;t due to slipping through the cracks, they still abide when notified of transgressions.<p>Additionally, as noted elsewhere, parler does moderate by removing content that the community dissaproves of, but that is legally in the clear, white leaving up what is largely considered discussion of illegal activity. Therefore they are tacit in those conspiring events.')
