Here are some features I implemented<p>- DNS, TCP, HTTP(s), TLS healthchecks, with tons of options available for each type, including labels per healthchecks (which are added to the logs&#x2F;metrics).<p>- Fully controllable using the API (but you can still configure healthchecks using the conf file)<p>- Exposes a lot of metrics in Prometheus format<p>- Exporters to export healthchecks results to external systems (only HTTP available today)<p>- Hot Reload on SIGHUP<p>- The latest result for healthchecks are available in the API (they expire after a while), and a small frontend also shows them.<p>- &quot;One Off&quot; healthchecks to execute arbitrary healthchecks: you send an healthcheck definition to the API, Cabourotte executes it and returns the result.<p>Now my goal is to work on the ecosystem. I would really like to have a Kubernetes Operator to automatically configure Cabourotte instances everytime a new pod&#x2F;service with some annotations is deployed.<p>Don&#x27;t hesitate to give me feedbacks.')
