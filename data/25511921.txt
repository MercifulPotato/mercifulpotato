AFAIK Morocco relies largely on Russian military purchases, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be more than a diplomatic quid pro quo in effect regarding their normalization of relations.<p>The Syrian conflict seems to be completely devoid of any influence by countries in alliance. Russia is just looking to sell gear to Syria as they always have, and to poke a finger in  the eye of Turkey. They also have long craved a naval base in the Med and succeeded. Turkey has geopolitical ambitions as well, not wanting to see a Kurdish state get developed, plus wanting to flex some muscle. I don&#x27;t see any treaties or alliances having a significant role in that conflict at all.')
