Why protobuf and not Cap&#x27;n&#x27;Proto or Flatbuffers?  Last I checked, both were better at zero-copy decoding, which might be a big deal for an engine with a message-passing architecture.  Cap&#x27;n&#x27;Proto has had a lot of improvements for RPC use over the past few years.<p>2. Why HTTP&#x2F;S rather than UDP?  Both in terms of throughput and latency, UDP tends to come out ahead.  Was it just not an issue?<p>3. Why WebP for compressed textures rather than KTX2, which offers BasisU supercompression?  Doing so can get similar compression and greatly improve performance when decoding to GPU formats.<p>4. Any plans to support GLTF2?  It has potential to replace custom engine formats, at least those that don&#x27;t store data for easier GPU consumption, especially if used with meshopt.  Unless the Defold format stores data in a GPU-ready format, it might be a good future option, and doing so would simplify asset pipelines a bit.')
