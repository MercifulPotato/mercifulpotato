It is a fair discussion to have.<p>I am not okay with unqualified politicians making inaccurate claims about the virus, and prioritizing economic health in the absence of good governance.<p>I believe there are obvious risks to mental health of adults and children in being isolated from others, unable to socialize with other humans in person.
