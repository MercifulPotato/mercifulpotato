Item(by='oftenwrong', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608223010, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25456100, text='`latest` is applied to the most recent image built without an explicit tag (or one explicitly tagged as `latest`); it does not necessarily mean that image is the most &quot;up to date&quot; in any sense. For example, you could have a very old `latest` image, which was built before many explicitly tagged images.<p>Whoever came up with this heuristic probably did not really understand `latest`. To be fair, though, it is a fairly misleading and confusing &quot;feature&quot;.')
