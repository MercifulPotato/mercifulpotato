Apple is a excellent example of this being ridiculously profitable: management, finance, R&amp;D, engineering and all &quot;high value&quot; work is in the US, and the &quot;boring&quot; manufacturing stuff is handled offshore. This works very well for shareholders, management and skilled employees. The American machinists and die-makers (who don&#x27;t get a say) lose out, and over time, their skills will be lost as the experienced workers retire without passing on their knowledge - then the whole industry suffers.')
