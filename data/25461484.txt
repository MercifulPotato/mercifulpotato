AFAIK, svn doesn&#x27;t model dependencies between patches, so it doesn&#x27;t get the benefits.<p>Have you ever had to laboriously cherry-pick a series of commits solving some bug between branches (e.g., from stable to dev or vice-versa)? It&#x27;s painful, and then later on you get conflicts because when you cherry-pick, git doesn&#x27;t &quot;understand&quot; what&#x27;s happening. Pijul solves that.<p>At a fundamental level, imagine I&#x27;m editing two files A and B, that have nothing to do with each other. Because git&#x27;s level of dependency is the entire repo, if I switch back and forth between editing A and B, git inserts a series of arbitrary and not-actually-real dependencies between those edits. Then, as a consequence, there&#x27;s no easy way for me to decide, say, I would like to merge my changes to A somewhere, but not my changes to B.<p>Or how about the entire controversy(&#x2F;complexity) of whether to rebase or merge when pulling? The choice is an artifact of git&#x27;s model, really a question of &quot;in which way would we like git to represent some not-real constraints&quot;. This difficulty doesn&#x27;t exist in Pijul, where dependencies are more fine-grained and <i>real</i>.<p>Another pain point you may have hit w&#x2F; git is when you do a merge, but somehow actually the changes were not included; this usually happens as a result of confusion regarding a conflict. Then you have to do painful repo surgery to try to convince git to actually include the changes you want.<p>In general large conflicts are quite painful in git: for the duration of the conflict, you are in a special state, and cannot commit. In pijul, conflicts are a first-class state of the repo, so you can iteratively work towards resolving your conflicts, using all of the normal VC tools to checkpoint along the way.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve only played with Pijul, not used it in anger. I  definitely see a lot of potential though.')
