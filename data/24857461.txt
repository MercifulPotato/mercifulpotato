Clients would then eventually timeout, but connection pools eventually became fully drained. We had to look at tcpdump on the clients to see what was going on. It was &#x27;solved&#x27; by giving machines that made external calls their own External IP. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s still an issue.')
