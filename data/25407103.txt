There are pyramid schemes, ponzi schemes, matrix schemes, unlimited schemes and so on. Everyone uses an example of this class of scheme and then say that X is &quot;ponzi scheme like&quot; instead of saying that X is an instance of &quot;circular fraud&quot; where &quot;circular fraud&quot; is a term for this class of scheme I just made up on the spot. Just invent a word for this instead of complaining.<p>&gt;f an author isn&#x27;t trustworthy or correct on this, then why should we listen to their other information in good faith?<p>The author is correct because of the word &quot;like&quot; in the title.')
