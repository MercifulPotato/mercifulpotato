That is problematic. However, FCC regs seem to allow stations to charge different prices based on the “class” of the placement. Not sure what the right social media equivalent of “class” would be. Seems reasonable that it might include targeting and campaign objectives. Which we don’t know in this case. So seems a stretch to imply that FB is charging a higher price for equivalent ads. They may be, but IMO the authors don’t have sufficient evidence based on what they could access.<p>&gt; A candidate shall be charged no more per unit than the station charges its most favored commercial advertisers for the same classes and amounts of time for the same periods.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fcc.gov&#x2F;media&#x2F;policy&#x2F;statutes-and-rules-candidate-appearances-advertising" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fcc.gov&#x2F;media&#x2F;policy&#x2F;statutes-and-rules-candidat...</a>')
