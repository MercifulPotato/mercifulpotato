What if during those morning runs one side of the street where your left foot falls is a slightly different height than the other side where your right foot falls and that was causing the pain? What if you keep smacking your hip on the edge of the pool? What if you tread water weird?<p>That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re asking a general practitioner to do perfectly in 20 minutes, who then would also have to know every single weird possible cause of every other possible thing a human being could wander into the office complaining of, a nonzero percentage of which is totally imaginary.<p>You are far, far better at knowing every strange element of your daily routine that may be causing you bodily discomfort. No doctor can reasonably sort all of that out for every patient, let alone a GP who is supposed to know everything about everything.<p>It&#x27;s like the office HR person doing WFH asking the tech guys to diagnose their computer that is bugging out because the HR person&#x27;s cat unknowingly puked on the case and it leaked onto the motherboard the night before. All in 20 minutes. Then the HR person gets mad because the tech guys didn&#x27;t specifically ask &quot;is there any possibility that an animal may have vomited on the motherboard?&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t mean to belittle your experience in any way, I&#x27;m just trying to make my comment entertaining so you might chuckle at it, but does my point make sense?')
