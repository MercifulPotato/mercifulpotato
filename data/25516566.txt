Jeff Bezos turned 300k start to 100 billions, a 300 000 times return on investment. Do you think he could have turned 100 billion to 30 quadrillions? Obviously not, it would be something like 100 billion to 1 trillion at best.<p>Investing in yourself or projects you run is the main way to get rich, otherwise you just get average returns but if you invest in yourself you can bet on you being much better at doing things than the rest of the world expects.')
