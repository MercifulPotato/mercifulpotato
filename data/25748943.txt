The closest I can find is Barnes v. Yahoo! where the court ruled a company can&#x27;t be compelled under the CDA to ban someone.<p>In that ruling the Ninth circuit said that congress wanted to “promote the free exchange of information and ideas over the Internet and to encourage voluntary monitoring for offensive or obscene material.”.<p>I can&#x27;t find a ruling that says the intention of section 230 was to enforce unfettered free speech.')
