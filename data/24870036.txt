This reads to me like someone saying &quot;we&#x27;ll never go faster than sound&quot; because you can&#x27;t imagine it.<p>Just because you can&#x27;t see how it could work doesn&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t.  I know from experience it can.  That doesn&#x27;t mean that it will work in every situation for every person, but there is literally nothing in the world that fits those requirements.  Some things work for some people, and not for others.  EVERYTHING in life is like that.<p>Remote working is no different.')
