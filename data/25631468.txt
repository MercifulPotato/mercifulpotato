In my experience this is by far the slowest &#x2F; most complex step. And it&#x27;s much easier with SQL where you can `UPDATE WHERE` and `INSERT FROM SELECT`.<p>If you want a flexible schema then Postgres has JSONB which is just as flexible and usually performs better than firebase anyway. Plus you can use all the querying power of Postgres, JOINs, etc just like typed columns.<p>&gt; For basic data models (think mobile game leaderboards, etc) it&#x27;s just unnecessary.<p>If you&#x27;re completely sure that you won&#x27;t need powerful querying, joins, etc for <i>any</i> of the data you&#x27;ll be storing then sure. Otherwise you lose all that time and more the first time you need a JOIN or a query that firebase can&#x27;t do. And you pay that cost every time you need to implement such a feature (or you end up storing <i>that</i> data in Postgres or similar and you end up with two databases, which is much more painful than having two platforms).')
