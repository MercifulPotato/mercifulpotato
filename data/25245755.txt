It&#x27;s possible that the repo&#x27;s README doesn&#x27;t present what twtxt is as clearly as it could.<p>The value proposition of twtxt is that it&#x27;s stupid easy to &quot;add&quot; to your server while being good enough to be used for 80% of what you&#x27;d use Twitter or Mastodon for.  You can trivially host your twtxt &quot;account&quot; on pretty much any server, including the one where your current website already lives, even if that server only supports static sites.  This is because twtxt is more like RSS than like Twitter, albeit intended to be used in such a way that it&#x27;s only appropriate for the sort of dispatches you broadcast through Twitter, rather than the totality of what RSS can be&#x2F;is used for.  The format also happens to score better on the human readability scale, too.<p>Here&#x27;s an example twtxt.txt feed: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;akkartik.name&#x2F;twtxt.txt" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;akkartik.name&#x2F;twtxt.txt</a>.  That&#x27;s it; if that were your feed, then that would be all your account data right there.<p>(NB: Just so this comment isn&#x27;t taken the wrong way—imagined subtext and whatnot—this comment has been written as a twtxt outsider.  I&#x27;m not doing twtxt now, and I don&#x27;t plan to.)<p>PS: For anyone who is in the twtxt target audience, you should consider enabling CORS on your site, if possible. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;enable-cors.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;enable-cors.org&#x2F;</a>')
