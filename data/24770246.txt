I don&#x27;t have a simple answer to either, but it&#x27;s thought provoking that there isn&#x27;t an established theory that everyone can point to from which people can comfortably say what different things mean. If you had a physics debate about black holes or whatever, it would normally be quite clear if someone had misunderstood something. At least when the threads got deeper, it would become clearer and some authoritative comment would appear.<p>I have an economics degree from a well known university, and I&#x27;m still not entirely sure what to think of those threads. They are so meandering, each new commentator rectifying an old definition or seeking to add yet another concept.<p>That should say something about how confidently we can make economic decisions.')
