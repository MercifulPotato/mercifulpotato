I was surprised to learn the fitbits give you incredibly detailed data on the quality of your sleep but Apple watch doesn&#x27;t... and I was thinking huh, that&#x27;s strange, certainly the Apple Watch has the sensors to be able to produce the data and Apple has the engineering talent to make sense of the data and present it to the end-user in a meaningfully appropriate manner.<p>I can&#x27;t find the article now, but apparently it came out from Apple engineers that they ultimately chose not to disclose detailed data to the user because burdening the end-user with this information can cause a mental overload... so instead Apple opted to focus on developing habits (hence the &#x27;go to sleep&#x27; notifications and the clever sleep-hour alarms).<p>I&#x27;ve had some time to reflect on this since I was having these conversations with my acquaintances... and I&#x27;ve gotta say, I think I agree with Apple&#x27;s approach.')
