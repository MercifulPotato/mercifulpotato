At this point if you&#x27;re a &quot;non-gamer&quot; it isn&#x27;t for lack of availability.<p>You seem to be using &quot;non-gamer&quot; as a synonym for &quot;too inexperienced to use basic modern technology&quot;, which I don&#x27;t think is a widespread problem outside of age ranges that didn&#x27;t grow up with the internet. A much bigger group is surely just people that aren&#x27;t that interested in video games. (Unless you think Stadia is actually going after the geriatric market, which seems short sighted.)')
