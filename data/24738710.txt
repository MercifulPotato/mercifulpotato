You can still buy these type of plans (at least in my state, North Carolina) for under $100&#x2F;mo. There are lifetime maximums, exclusions for pre existing conditions, and high deductibles, but that’s probably the same as what you had pre-ACA as well.<p>These plans are typically referred to as “junk insurance” but if you can’t afford or just don’t want a more comprehensive plan they’re better than nothing.')
