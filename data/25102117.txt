Plato&#x27;s Republic was enmeshed with a similar logic: that there is a natural way for society to progress, that human society is interfering with this natural way and that is a problem, and that we ought to have philosopher-kings (read: techies &amp; politicians) to shape beliefs and discourse into a more natural (and thus &quot;good&quot;) direction.<p>G.A. Cohen&#x27;s writings on the history of philosophy have a scathing critique of this sort of thinking that I recommend.')
