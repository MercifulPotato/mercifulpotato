Item(by='59nadir', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603524703, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24838490, text='While I&#x27;m not usually 100% happy with the Discord server (it currently has very little moderation and has had one user behave like a piece of shit for a long time) I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding the flame war you mention. I found the discussion about utf8 decoding and it seemed cordial, with two people agreeing with you and only one saying (paraphrasing...) &quot;Fuck this, I&#x27;m leaving this community until people stop asking too much&quot; (which didn&#x27;t make much sense).<p>I usually find community overrated and I&#x27;ve made a conscious effort to separate it from technology for the most part. Zig as a language has certain values that it&#x27;s built with in mind and those values for the most part are aligned with mine, so this is basically what keeps me interested in it. I would use Rust despite its community if it aligned with my values. I despise the leadership of Elixir and Phoenix but I still use both of those when it makes sense.<p>With all this said, the IRC channel is a lot less about memery and wild discussions (but also less active) than the Discord server, so if you feel like it you can always just pop into #zig on FreeNode if you have questions and would like to talk about the language.')
