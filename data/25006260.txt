Also because it wasn&#x27;t even on the radar unless you were one of those types of persons who hung out on 4chans &#x2F;pol&#x2F; where they had daily threads about the virus since december at least.<p>My point is that governments do NOT want to address the ARDS concerns because it will mean millions of citizens will have to get early pensions, which will be a massive strain on welfare states. They&#x27;d rather not address this at all. My other point is that we have reached a point where PCR testing is utterly meaningless, it SOLELY benefits big pharma.<p>It makes no sense to keep on doing PCR testing, we should have done like china when shtf there and started doing symptom diagnostics instead since its way cheaper.<p>Also, if you need a respirator to breathe, you need it COVID or not. If you are sick, it doesn&#x27;t really matter if its SARS-2, covid-20 or the flu. Stay home!')
