I don&#x27;t know where the term originated from but generally if you&#x27;ve had some sort of stroke of good luck or unexpected fortune then it&#x27;s your shout, which is basically a free round of drinks on you.<p>When I used to go to the pub with my cricket team the person who scored the highest that day would shout the group. Or if you&#x27;d won big on the poker machines etc then it would be your shout.')
