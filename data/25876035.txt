That a townhall with one&#x27;s representative might be isomorphic with one&#x27;s &quot;neighborhood meeting&quot;?<p>In those cases things like &quot;compact&quot; serve a purpose in going back towards that &quot;neighborhood&quot; ideal (which arguably has never existed in US practice).<p>But it&#x27;s 2021 and is geography and the &quot;neighborhood&quot; ideal still useful for us in selecting representatives? When was the last time you shook hands with your representative? When was the last time you had a neighborhood meeting where the representative just swung by for an impromptu townhall?<p>Maybe we should find a better optimization for our k-means clustering that isn&#x27;t geography because gerrymandering seems to imply that we&#x27;ll never fix geographic clustering? With tools like TV and the internet, geography may not even matter like it did to 18th century Americans. A Zoom call isn&#x27;t a handshake, of course, but we have more tools for virtual shared interest groups than ever before and don&#x27;t necessarily need to remain tied to the vagaries of geography.<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily have good answers for what those metrics&#x2F;optimizations could be&#x2F;should look like beyond geography. All I know is that it would be hard to impossible to find good ones under the current two party system and as with most things, the blame for a lot of our problems continues to be directly on the two party system.')
