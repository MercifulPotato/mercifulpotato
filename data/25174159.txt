Because they want it to be ignored?<p>The people in power always use the most optimistic measures and the people who want power always use the most pessimistic measures. I&#x27;d personally argue the more pessimistic measures are closer to reality, as would many others. BLS found a way to serve us <i>and</i> the people in power, simultaneously, without getting themselves replaced. They didn&#x27;t just do an ultra-important, thankless job, they <i>also</i> found a way to square a political circle in order to do it. I have nothing but respect for them.')
