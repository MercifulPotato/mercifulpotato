In my ballot this year, I had to vote for US President, US House, US Senate, State House, State Senate, Councillor, Register of Probate, and three referendums. That&#x27;s actually a pretty light ballot; in the past, I&#x27;ve also had to vote for races such as County Auditor, Recorder of Deeds, County Clerk, Soil &amp; Water Conservation District Commissioner.<p>It obviously takes far longer to count ballots by hand when you&#x27;re dealing with a dozen races instead of one or two.')
