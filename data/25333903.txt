Seriously- a single FTE security researcher is going to be costing MS &gt;$400k a year (salary, bonus, health care, office space, etc).<p>I work at a BigCo as a recipient of some of these XSSs and I&#x27;m awed by the amount of work that goes into them. I always try to overstate the impact to boost the reward- it&#x27;s not just the bug that they found, but how much of the system they had to look at before they found this. The security folks at BigCo that I interact with are badasses, but it&#x27;s just so hard to get this level of attention.')
