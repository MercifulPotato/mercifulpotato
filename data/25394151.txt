And actually, EMA has similar information on their pages on the whole Europe level. But that is beside the point.<p>The point is not the H1N1 vaccines used in the USA in general, the point is not Arenaprix, Focetria or even Pandemrix used on populations of non-Finnish ancestry, and the point is not the use of adjuvants in general.<p>The point is the problem which GSK&#x27;s Pandemrix used specifically in Sweden and Finland created.<p>If you read that page, it refers to a paper from 2018. If you look closely, 4 authors received money from GSK, but it is not relevant. The relevant parts are that the paper:\n  1. Actually found increased rates in Sweden, &quot;Other than elevated narcolepsy IRs in the period after vaccination campaigns in Sweden, we did not find...&quot;\n  2. Did not examine Finland at all.<p>The most impacted country was skipped since it was the other signalling country. This may seem weird, but the purpose was to establish whether Pandemrix and&#x2F;or other H1N1 vaccinations were <i>generally</i> safe elsewhere.<p>And, so, yes. There is no conspiracy, in general, H1N1 vaccinations are safe, for most people.<p>However, let us now go to the specifics.<p>There were and are unfortunate Finnish and Swedish children, who have HLA DQB1*06:02 and who, together with the proteins present in GSK&#x27;s Pandemrix, possibly in combination with exposure to A(H1N1), developed narcolepsy because their orexin-producing cells in the hypothalamus were somehow damaged through an autoimmune response.<p>So, interesting fact: use of Pandemrix increased narcolepsy rates in Finland and Sweden. This connection was due to the genetic specifics of Finns and the contents of the vaccine itself.<p>My point, which I want to re-iterate, is this: these kinds of connections cannot be seen with some months of clinical testing, especially not when there is an immense pressure to succeed. Any company getting problems with their vaccine would see their stock price collapse.<p>I saw and remember what happened the last time. Now I want to see more testing before I commit.')
