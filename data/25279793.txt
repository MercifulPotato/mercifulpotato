I wanted to figure out what problems nurses face and then see if I could solve one of those problems with programming. I haven&#x27;t found that problem yet, but now I consider my &quot;research&quot; complete and I&#x27;m ready to return programming full-time.<p>While I&#x27;m open to many different jobs, I am especially interested in health or clinical applications where I can put my nursing background to good use.')
