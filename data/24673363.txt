As a maintainer of small projects with very few users I&#x27;m not offended by business-like bug reports. But it&#x27;s very nice to hear someone is actually grateful for my software. (You only need one arrogant asshole demanding support to feel like your software is shit and maintenance is a burden.) Of course you only need to make a good first impression once.<p>This approach will also help if another part of your message comes off as arrogant. That can happen when English is not your native language.')
