Nobody is saying the USA is not a republic, it&#x27;s a democratic republic.<p>This must be some kind of political talking point because I  have heard it over and over for years, but it does nothing to convince anyone of your arguments and you would be better served to argue based on policy or ideology rather than this semantic distinction which is not even correct to begin with.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth I don&#x27;t disagree with your substantive points.<p>All the best,')
