I&#x27;m sure ladies getting their hair done at midnight were the real super spreaders &#x2F;s.<p>Honestly, its not hard to see how government&#x27;s hypocrisy and inconsistency fuels conspiracy theories. Another example is the Massachusetts mask mandate that explicitly requires masks when nobody is near you. I&#x27;m willing to give the benefit of the doubt, that this is just to remove ambiguity and make enforcement easier. But its not hard to imagine the reaction of someone who is prone to tinfoil hatting when they are told they must always wear a mask outside, even if miles away from the nearest human.')
