Everybody who owns property pays property taxes including the elderly. I don’t ever hear of the elderly disproportionately losing their houses here. There is no state income tax though.<p>Property taxes are one of the greatest equalizers. Poor people don’t own property and thus do not pay that tax. Wealthy people pay far more in taxes to live in a giant mansion than they do for the mansion itself. That $15-60k per month in property taxes really adds up over time.')
