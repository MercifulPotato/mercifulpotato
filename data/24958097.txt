I would think Australia and New Zealand count, and they&#x27;ve done a pretty good job.<p>Politically, yes, but being islands with a significant distance to other countries does make them very different. It&#x27;s somewhat easy to restrict travel to NZ or AU, but it&#x27;s much harder in Europe.<p>Geographic location seems to play a role. Japan and Taiwan are islands, for all intents and purposes, so is South Korea (a mine field inhibits travel). Singapore and Malaysia have much fewer land-borders.<p>Restricting movement in Europe between countries is more comparable to restricting movement within a country. They don&#x27;t have hard borders, generally no controls etc. Probably doable, but not without very authoritarian policies which I don&#x27;t see happening (during the migrant crisis in 2015, the general narrative was that it&#x27;s literally impossible to enforce borders in Europe).')
