It&#x27;s a weird conflation of the degree of the incompetence of pollsters and the <i>degree to which opinions can be changed within a span of time</i>. And it&#x27;s completely unfalsifiable. When Trump wins, the true believers will say &quot;We gave him a 9.684% chance of winning! It&#x27;s only your ignorance that makes you think we were wrong&quot; and they go back to poring over their race tables.<p>It&#x27;s an orgy of false precision.<p>edit: the entire debate is based on the weird assumption that if a prediction about a particular state is wrong, then pollsters must have systematically gotten <i>middle-class Hispanic women over 40</i> wrong, therefore the odds of other states will change. It&#x27;s all based in the reification of particular categories that are axiomatically significant for their profession.')
