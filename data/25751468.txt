I pointed out some times Google didn&#x27;t live up to this reputation, but there are also many times Google did something contrary to their short-term interests due to ethics and&#x2F;or long-term &quot;enlightened self-interest&quot; thinking. A few examples:<p>* Google pulling out of China and ending their censorship. [1] I was proud to work there when this happened.<p>* They also generally treat their employees quite well compared to say Amazon. They treated me (a long-time SWE) personally quite well over the years, with the obvious exception of the wage-fixing that the other companies also participated in. They also do relatively well for non-SWEs, including temps and contractors. Eg, I believe they&#x27;re still paying all the food staff even when they haven&#x27;t been preparing meals on the same scale for months, which is pretty extraordinary.<p>* Their internal privacy attitude and controls are a lot better than many external people believe.<p>* They have a $10,000&#x2F;year match for charitable donations.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;googleblog.blogspot.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;01&#x2F;new-approach-to-china.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;googleblog.blogspot.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;01&#x2F;new-approach-to-chin...</a>')
