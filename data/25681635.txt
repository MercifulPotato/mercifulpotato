If there happen to be gaps, then put in at least a reasonable effort to fill them instead of shrugging and saying &quot;it&#x27;s out of our control&quot;. That, along with a per-demographic breakdown of important metrics and your point about qualifying demographics in the data (which is already done in most medical publications, including many using ML) would already be a huge improvement on what most people do now.<p>Ironically, it&#x27;s the big tech companies that have the hardest time with this because they want to make generally deployable projects, yet don&#x27;t have access to as much data as many healthcare orgs do. Frankly, I don&#x27;t have much sympathy for them: a lot of this is trust issues from self-inflicted damage.')
