I remember sitting on the train and actually thinking about killing myself. Reasons were many, but mostly I just didn&#x27;t fit in there, I think.<p>I felt like people there were also a bunch of whiny little bitches to be honest. Always having some problem with a hand or a back or some family problem or whatever which demanded that they take days off. There were a few people whom I felt were probably talking some shit behind my back, but I couldn&#x27;t really believe it until I read this story. It was just a horrible horrible place and I can also recognize that thing about having a predecessor, who was apparently a &quot;bad person&quot; and thus had to be terminated.<p>Every other day I would have people telling me how great a place it was and how lucky we were to be working in a place so big while still having that startup feeling. I have worked at startups and I always just imagined to myself that 40 year old &quot;dude&quot; who refuses to grow up. That is Apple..<p>Never again.<p>I got dragged through the whole white boarding experience also for the first time and it was fun enough, but in hindsight, they should just have asked me if I would suck Steve Jobs dick, if he came in that door. The answer to that question alone would have provided them with enough information about whether I would have been a good hire or not.<p>I am 45 and have never every experienced a work place like that. Always had positive feedback and never had any problems with colleagues.')
