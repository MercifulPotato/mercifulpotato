These downvotes come off to me as so unempathic, so cruel.<p>The promise was free unlimited storage &amp; sharing of photos. Now, years latter, you change the deal. People planned to die with this, they read the words on the tin &amp; said, yes, I wish to share photos in a way that will last. Yes, I want to give URLs to people with my photos that they will be able to use.<p>It&#x27;s so heartless, so disappointing that such cruel negative people persistenly downvote &amp; leave shitty comments like &quot;you need to pay for it.&quot; (This thread here is not popular enough to attract those comments.) This is one of the persistent indicators to me that people in this community need help, need healing, and that there&#x27;s so few around to show care &amp; concern &amp; support each other just frightens us all further. HN, you have a reputation, and this is it.<p>The god damned library of Babel is on fire people. The Library of Alexandria, a vast index of humanity, is getting torched. After years of promises that this would not happen. People&#x27;s willingness to be reasonable over this matter is ghastly, is immoral, &amp; wrong. People who are ok with, who are unsympathetic to this book burning, they scare the pants off me. There&#x27;s a lot of them out there. A lot of them in here.')
