Frequently when people speak using natural languages it is possible to interpret something in ways other than what were meant. It&#x27;s clear that the HR person meant that Google&#x27;s rootkit-enabled security software would make a good faith effort not to intrude on personal data. Then the person in the story proposed changing the contract wording to &quot;May only access Google related information and no personal information.&quot; This no doubt got forwarded on to a lawyer who said &quot;No can do, that&#x27;s a legal promise that the security software is 100% bug-free.&quot; That would also require wading into the murk of what is &quot;personal data&quot; and what is &quot;Google related information&quot;. Does putting your commute schedule on your personal calendar make your personal calendar &quot;Google related&quot;? Are chat messages in which you sexually harass your coworker &quot;personal information&quot;? No lawyer is ever going to sign off on this.')
