You can move your servers around if you have to and keep your sovereignty despite everything else changing.   It&#x27;s how the internet was designed!  Amazon, Google, Apple and most other private companies can go whistle if they want you offline.<p>Sure it takes expertise, time, expense, negotiation... but that&#x27;s the price of true freedom, internet patriots!<p>Instead they built everything on top of the conveniences and goodwill of a single US company, with no backup plan.  Hardly living in the wild west - and that&#x27;s this mob down to a tee.  Rich, well-connected dorks who desperately <i>need</i> the society they organise to tear down - why be surprised when the society hits back in such a tiny way as terminating their AWS account?<p>If this is censorship, I&#x27;m a bowl of noodle soup.')
