And didn&#x27;t even make enough from doing so to be able to afford welfare. Now they don&#x27;t have to acquire shiny metal every time things are bad, they very seldom fight wars and even relinquished control over the empires they&#x27;d built under the gold standard. If there is a causal relationship between monetary systems and empire building, it&#x27;s quite clear that it works the opposite way round and fiat money <i>reduces</i> the tendency to use military power in service of economic growth.')
