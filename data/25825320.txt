High cholesterol, for instance, doesn&#x27;t show any symptoms until one of your blood vessels is clogged, but chances are that by then is too late and you might suffer a stroke&#x2F;heart attack.<p>I don&#x27;t know how much the average treatment for those costs, but I would say way less than few tens of blood&#x2F;urine tests. Or even more &quot;stealing&quot; a good heart because you need a transplant due to a preventable condition.<p>By the way now I circumvent the Swiss reluctance to prevention by going to Italy and paying the analysis out of my pocket. It&#x27;s still very cheap (~100 Euros every 18 month on average).')
