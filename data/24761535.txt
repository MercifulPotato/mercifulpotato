Every other empire in human history has also committed huge atrocities, so much that it&#x27;s almost tautological.<p>&gt; Today in most democracy it’s a tyranny of majority and the constitutional rights granted for protection of minority are constantly diluted or completely removed. “Black lives matter” and “Minority treatment in India”<p>I agree it&#x27;s regressing right now, but the political structures still exist in democracies to fight back against the regression, at least for now. That&#x27;s more than can be said for people living under absolute monarchy or authoritarian rule today.')
