It&#x27;s also a natural pesticide &amp; insect repellant and source of saltpeter&#x2F;potassium nitrate.<p>Not just that, but smokers mostly just hurt themselves and smoke for the benefits nicotine provides them. People drink alcohol too and that&#x27;s not good for you either.<p>We will be growing and selling tobacco long after people stop smoking it.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any medicinal benefits of nuclear weapons or nerve gas. Almost nobody has any reason to produce either. \nThis is veering off into stupid territory.<p>[1]:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC1079499&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC1079499&#x2F;</a>')
