Because of how SQLite supports transactions, you can just update the database as you go; your changes will be physically written to disk, but they won&#x27;t actually replace the old version from a reader&#x27;s perspective until you explicitly commit, which is an atomic (and typically fast) operation.<p>The downside of this approach is that if the application crashes while writing to disk, the database file itself might be in an inconsistent state, accompanied by a rollback journal (or write-ahead log) that contains the necessary information to recover it. But if you manually delete the journal, or otherwise separate it from its database, you get data corruption.<p>That&#x27;s probably fine as long as the user is a sysadmin who can be trusted to Just Not Do That(tm), but it&#x27;s very user-hostile behavior for an office suite.')
