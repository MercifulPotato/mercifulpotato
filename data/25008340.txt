The prosecution has to do all the leg work. And they may literally have no other evidence.<p>- Can the prosecution show where and how Mr. X moved the funds while he was in jail?<p>- Can they show who he communicated with or ordered to abscond these funds?<p>- Can they identify who controls the funds now?<p>- Can they identify anyone else who may have had control of these funds while in their previous wallet?<p>- Can the prosecution rule with 100% certainty that this was not a hack or theft by some other party, including police?<p>The answer to those is probably no.
