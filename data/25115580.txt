(Payment card companies skim too, but there&#x27;s a lot of competition in that field so it&#x27;s under control.)<p>Yelp might argue that I, the purchaser, am not hurt by their shenanigans, so I shouldn&#x27;t worry about it. But, on the contrary, I am hurt when my local restaurants have their margins shaved. Several have had to close their doors in my neighborhood. How am I hurt? For one thing I like the restaurants that closed. For another, I have neighbors and friends among restaurant owners and workers. For a third, some of my tax and charity money goes to helping unemployed people.<p>AT THE VERY LEAST Yelp&#x27;s recorded announcement (&quot;awesomeness???&quot;) should inform me that I&#x27;m going through a third party.<p>My local telco just delivered a printed Yellow Pages book for the first time in many years. I&#x27;m going to use it. I&#x27;m going to keep the takeout menus I get.<p>I wonder if this can be called &quot;wire fraud&quot; in some new telecom regulations?')
