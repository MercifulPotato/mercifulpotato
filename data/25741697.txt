It starts with empathy, and recognizing our common humanity. These are human beings. Genetically, we are all very very similar. We all have similar drives. We need water, food, security. We desire belonging, love. We aspire to have sufficient social status within our communities.<p>I&#x27;m generalizing here, but the purveyors of a lot of this are <i>not</i> society&#x27;s winners. In mainstream society, they have low social status. They&#x27;re financially not well off. They are uneducated. They are mocked in mainstream culture, and called &#x27;trash&#x27;. They are targeted by urban&#x2F;educated&#x2F;white people as the true racists and causes of our problems in this country. Many of these people were not born with the deck in their favor, and society just keeps crapping on them.<p>The answer isn&#x27;t to accept or condone anti-social behavior from society&#x27;s losers. The answer is to empathize with their situation, and figure out how to create a more inclusive society that creates an easier path for those born in the lower classes to find purpose&#x2F;value&#x2F;love&#x2F;status within the communities. To not mock them because it&#x27;s funny&#x2F;entertaining to pick on the losers of society to make ourselves feel better.')
