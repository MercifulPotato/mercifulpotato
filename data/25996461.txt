Item(by='pron', descendants=None, kids=[25996674], score=None, time=1612229024, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25996198, text='&gt; JRE&#x2F;JDK8 had a very public, nasty license change during one of the late releases (200+ or something) that quite literally had a popup on people&#x27;s computers stating commercial use of Oracle JDK would require payment to Oracle going forward.<p>Nope. It was neither nasty nor a change. JDK 8, is out of the ~5 year free public updates period, just like all JDK versions before it. The only difference from the past is that extended support is now cheaper.<p>The reason people see the popup that they hadn&#x27;t before has nothing to do with any license change but with the mere fact that the JRE is now discontinued (and replaced with jlink runtimes). In the past, when 7 was out of public updates, people got a popup to update to 8. But 8 was the last ever JRE version, there&#x27;s nothing to upgrade to, so people just got a popup that it&#x27;s out of free public updates.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s quite an extreme change, and set off quite a panic in the Java world.<p>I don&#x27;t know who panicked and why, but all JDK versions have always been out of a free public update period after about 5 years. I wouldn&#x27;t call the drop in support prices an &quot;extreme change,&quot; but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a welcome one.<p>&gt; This is when Red Hat, AdoptOpenJDK, Azul and others stepped into the limelight with this LTS release time-sharing agreement.<p>First of all, none of those companies offer an 8 JRE, because OpenJDK was not yet open-source in version 8, and OpenJDK 8 doesn&#x27;t have the JRE (it&#x27;s missing Applets and Web Start, for example, the very things people need a JRE for).<p>Second, there is no such agreement. Oracle passes the leadership of backport projects of old releases when a new release comes out to whoever steps up. AdoptOpenJDK, by IBM, are barely involved \nwith OpenJDK at all, and aren&#x27;t in the same bucket as Azul and Red Hat, which do make significant contributions to OpenJDK.<p>&gt; The reason AdoptOpenJDK, Red Hat&#x27;s OpenJDK port, Azul and others are gaining so much ground these days is directly a result of the changes Oracle consciously made.<p>All of those are support programs for an open-source project developed, for the most part, by Oracle; they&#x27;re not ports. <i>Everyone</i> is gaining ground mostly because support prices are lower and many have yet to upgrade past 8.')
