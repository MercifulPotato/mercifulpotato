It kills lots of people every year</i><p>The worst flu killed 80k people in a year, and normally kills about 20k a year. It hasn&#x27;t even been a year and three times as many people have died compared to the worst flu season, and 1,600+ Americans die every day from COVID. This epidemic so far has been more than twelve times worse than the average flu season.<p>&gt; <i>So do car accidents - lets just ban driving</i><p>About 38k people die in car accidents in the US, and the average person <i>drives 1 million miles</i> before getting in an accident. And that&#x27;s with practically every person in the country driving that can. In contrast, only 3% of Americans have had COVID, yet 237k of them have died in less than a year. If the majority of Americans get COVID, millions of people will die.')
