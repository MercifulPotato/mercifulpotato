When are we going to acknowledge that managers only care about shipping feature fast regardless of the quality of the codebase? I work professionally with &quot;productive languages&quot; and I could claim the same thing about javascript and others.<p>On this article it is very clear that companies won&#x27;t invest in proper training, quoting: &quot;Most Java developers are web developers and are used to modelling things they can see&quot; and &quot;We began by hiring people from trading floors, but have more recently hired Masters and PhD students&quot;<p>This is a culture problem, not a language one. If anything, C++ will always perform much better than Java. Claiming the opposite because you assume your coders don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing, it&#x27;s just ridiculous.')
