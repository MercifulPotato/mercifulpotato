I do not think that the FBI, throughout its history, has earned our trust, and it has done many awful things to betray it.  I see no evidence that this entity is materially different than it was when it attempted to gaslight Dr. King into suicide.<p>I think that this does warrant an investigation.  We have the son of a powerful career politician offering to sell access to his Dad&#x27;s office.  We have a foreign corporation cutting a generous check on that basis.  We have emails outlining these details in an archive that has been verified in part by one of the people in the &quot;To&quot; field, who was indeed a business partner in an earlier venture.  We have an official decision being made during this time, by Joe, which is favorable to the corporation in question.<p>None of these facts are in dispute.<p>It seems the only dispute is whether they warrant an investigation by someone with more integrity than the FBI (ideally, a lot more).')
