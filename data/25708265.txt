It’s clear that Parler does not have an effective process to comply with the AWS terms of service,” the email reads. “[W]e cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others,” the email reads. “Because Parler cannot comply with our terms of service and poses a very real risk to public safety, we plan to suspend Parler’s account effective Sunday, January 10th, at 11:59PM PST.”</i><p>If Amazon and Parker havnt commented, how can an email be quoted?<p>Is Amazon monitoring the content of all the services on its platform?<p>While my first impression is that this looks like the US turning into China, the fact that large scale private industry is doing this in apparent coordination with political forces make it seem more fascist than commie.
