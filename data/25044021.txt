There is very little chance of fighting effectively when everyone around you is fleeing or being pressed together. And you&#x27;re being charged by a 2-ton armored war machine. Or dozens of them. I&#x27;m a reenactor. It&#x27;s even terrifying when you know it&#x27;s fake and you know you&#x27;re safe.<p>Knights did loose horses though. They all took multiple war horses with them to battle (a &quot;lance&quot; usually consisted of one knight, multiple warhorses and a regular horse for travel&#x2F;supplies and several servants). When they lost their horse, they fought their way back to their own side and got on the next horse.')
