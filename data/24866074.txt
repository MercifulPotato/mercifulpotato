Like they say, universities, especially big public ones have had their finances nuked by the pandemic and imposed hiring freezes. The other aspect isn&#x27;t mentioned but I feel has to be the case, which is that if any faculty consider their retirement portfolio hurting they won&#x27;t elect to retire. That was certainly true last Spring when they would need to initiate the process to retire and create an opening for this cycle.<p>I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m only finishing my first postdoc. It really sucks for people who are at the end of their second postdoc (year six post-PhD), which is effectively the limit for faculty hiring or additional postdocs. For them this is really the worst timing for the one critical year in their perhaps 15 year run-up from entering undergrad.')
