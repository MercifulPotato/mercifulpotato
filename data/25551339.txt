This is illustrated by a 50 year old who paid off their $500k house. They sell, keep the cash for 23 months until they move across the country to buy a new house.<p>2. They could store their $500k in USD w&#x2F;money printing and be a Keynesian. Money printing dilutes and they can buy less.<p>3. Another similar couple stores their $500k in BTC or cryptGOLD, as a non-money printing Austrian.<p>Imagine if each person in society is picking individually if they want to be an Austrian or Keynesian based on the currency they select. Costs of USD money printing will be paid by a smaller and smaller group of people as more and more move off of USD.')
