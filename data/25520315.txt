It is, however, more difficult than not interacting with them while claiming to &quot;care&quot; by selecting an approach then throwing money at projects aiming at imposing it.<p>A fair part of human misery is caused by people imposing stuff to others, I fail to see how it can be a way to &quot;care&quot;.')
