Either your program requires a library or it doesn&#x27;t.  If it requires the library, the easiest thing to do is to assume that it is already installed and just link to it.  In case it is not installed the compiler will fail with a very clear error message.<p>Say, your program is an editor of png files and it requires libpng.  Thus in your code you will have<p><pre><code>    #include &lt;libpng.h&gt;\n</code></pre>\nand in your makefile you will link your executable with -lpng.  And that is all!  This works in linux, bsd and macOS.  What the fucking else do you need?')
