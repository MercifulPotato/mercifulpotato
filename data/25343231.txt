Most places I&#x27;ve worked don&#x27;t define their bounded contexts based on separation of concerns, but rather on separation of reporting.<p>That is: team A has been given arbitrary stewardship of generic app funcitons T, U, V based on management purview. Team B has been given stewardship of generic function W, X, Y, Z. So the bounded context is along those lines. But wait, both V and W are related to billing, you say? No matter!<p>Since the clich√© is you can&#x27;t solve people problems with technology, the same applies to micro-services: it&#x27;s much harder to convince managers to shift accountability than it is to move the code from one micro-service to another. Even if you do move the code, you get to have your shit and eat it, too.')
