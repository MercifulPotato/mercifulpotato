Item(by='phendrenad2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603355636, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24855393, text='Not fined for filming, fined for making money from the videos, because they were posted to their YouTube travel vlog, without some &quot;filming in a national park for the purpose of making money from your youtube travel blog&quot; permit. Still ridiculous. Seems like whoever made the law wasn&#x27;t thinking clearly. They probably wanted to prevent people from bringing entire film crews into a national park and stopping traffic. But presumably I can bring an entire film crew in and stop traffic, as long as the videos aren&#x27;t making any money. Amazing.')
