I&#x27;m fine with moderation, and I&#x27;m fine with sites that publish user-generated content defining their own content rules.<p>What I&#x27;m not fine with - and what the parent article is mainly focused on - are rules that are unevenly enforced in order to play favorites.<p>I would reform section 230 so say that you must post the site&#x27;s user-generated content rules, and you must post a moderation log.  The moderation log would consist of the list of moderation actions taken and the accounts affected, and the time.  \nAny moderation action that appears to not align with the stated content policy should be reviewable by a third party accredited arbitrator, at the plantiff&#x27;s expense.<p>The net effect of this scenario would be to cause the sites to write down detailed rules about content, and enforce them fairly on all sides.<p>Right now there are simply too many flagrantly biased or inaccurate moderation decisions on these sites, and many of them seem to be motivated by political or economic reasons.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to ask that sites be the &quot;public square&quot; because of the huge gift of liability protection that section 230 grants.   This argument has not held up in courts.\nIt&#x27;s a totally different thing to require sites play by their own rules, and hold them accountable for each hypocritical moderation action that genuinely hurts the &quot;little guy&quot;')
