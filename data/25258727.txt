The Register article says that. The Register article says that because they&#x27;re parroting Apple&#x27;s marketing. I don&#x27;t fault The Register for copying Apple. I fault Apple for being misleading with their arguments. LPDDR4x is NOT HBM2. HBM2 is a completely different technology.<p>&quot;High Bandwidth Memory&quot;, or HBM2 (since we&#x27;re on version 2 of that tech now), HBM2 is on the order of 1024-bit lanes per chip-stack. It is extremely misleading for Apple to issue a press-release claiming they have &quot;high bandwidth memory&quot;.<p>HBM2 is the stuff of supercomputers: the Fujitsu A64FX. Ampere A100 GPUs. Etc. etc. That&#x27;s not the stuff you&#x27;d see in a phone or laptop.<p>&gt; &quot;In other words, this memory is shared between the three different compute engines and their cores. The three don&#x27;t have their own individual memory resources, which would need data moved into them.&quot;<p>It would be colossally stupid for the iGPU, CPU, and Neural Engine to communicate over RAM. I don&#x27;t even need to look at the design: they almost certainly share Last-Level Cache. LLC communications are faster than RAM communications.<p>From the perspective of the iGPU &#x2F; CPU &#x2F; Neural Engine, its all the same (because the &quot;cache&quot; pretends to be RAM anyway). But in actuality, the bandwidth and latency characteristics of that communication are almost certainly optimized to be cache-to-cache transfers, without ever leaving the chip.')
