So I apologize for that.<p>&gt; How you can claim to read someone else&#x27;s mind like this is beyond me, or even for that matter claim to know what was taught in someone&#x27;s undergrad curriculum 30 years ago or how he reacted to it at the time. If I know pg, he would have reacted exactly the same way as nowâ€”but more likely he just avoided taking such courses in the first place.<p>I studied analytical philosophy in college, like he did. I didn&#x27;t take a single class on postmodernism. I bring that up because these terms are universal and not tied specifically to PoMo (or even continental) philosophy. <i>That&#x27;s</i> where my doubt comes from: someone who studied philosophy should know these terms, <i>and</i> should know that popular awareness of them is limited to the spooky PoMo stuff.')
