If central banks get control over money flows they can do horrible stuff:<p>* set a <i>maximum limit</i> on the amount of money you are allowed to have&#x2F;save in your CBDC wallet.<p>* give you an x amount of money and <i>force you to spend</i> it (by taking the excess away at the end of the month or topping it up to a limit). This will erode all incentive to save. If forces consumption instead of preservation.<p>* work with a <i>whitelist</i> of acceptable ways to spent the money. You want to sent some money to someone who is not a legal resident&#x2F;lives abroad&#x2F;is on a black list for xyz reason? Though luck...<p>* set a &quot;transaction&quot; price &#x2F; <i>hidden tax</i> on less trustworthy or less &quot;wanted&quot; persons or company&#x27;s. Like when you want to buy liquor&#x2F;a gun&#x2F;give to a church you pay 5% transaction costs, but when you pay your rent the transaction costs are 0%.<p>* in a very real sense untraceable money is privacy and making money traceable is taking privacy away. We may not have something to hide but there is nothing I want them to see either...<p><pre><code>  Revelation 13:16,17 says &quot;It puts under compulsion all people—the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves—that these should be marked, and that nobody can buy or sell except a person having the mark&quot;</code></pre>')
