I don&#x27;t really think any of the tips and strategies in this article are helpful unless <i>both</i> (or all) parties go in to it with this same mindset. Which means that, for example, I believe it is simply <i>impossible</i> to have these kind of &quot;constructive arguments&quot; on, say, Twitter, for example. One of the things I like most about HN is the guidelines are clear about the goals of the forums, and while of course they are not always followed (I&#x27;ve certainly not always followed them), they are very helpful to help recenter debates, and I think there are a lot of helpful commenters that try to get things back on track if they go off the rails (thank you, dang).<p>2. &gt; When people feel that something so close to them is in question, they often lose sight of reason and argue instead from an emotional perspective.<p>This may sound condescending, and it&#x27;s really not meant to be as I also used to believe this, but I have come to the realization over the years that this mindset is woefully naive and immature. As someone who identifies as pretty &quot;Spock-ian&quot; in nature, it took me a long time (and years of therapy) to realize that <i>everyone</i> argues from an emotional perspective. It&#x27;s what it means to be human. The entire purpose of emotions is that they are they <i>only</i> place where human motivation comes from. Trying to separate &quot;logic&quot; vs. &quot;emotion&quot; when dealing with humans is a fools&#x27; game in my opinion.')
