There can be no guarantees about the safety of a package based only on its maintainer(s); their accounts could be taken over, or they could be paid off, and so on. I’m hopeful about initiatives like Deno that provide better security controls built-in to the language.<p>A significant hurdle to overcome is getting npm (and all open-source) developers to think about trust in the first place. The event-stream incident happened when the previous maintainer handed over control to a random stranger that showed up. We’ve seen similar things happen in other attacks. The thought at this point is that by making trust more explicit, we might start a move in the right direction.')
