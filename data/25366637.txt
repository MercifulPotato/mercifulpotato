It&#x27;s a godsend for those who need it, but for couples therapy, it&#x27;s not as straight forward.<p>I met a couple who was breaking up.  A friend of mine noticed this and mentioned how good it was.  What she said caught me off guard, but I was young and didn&#x27;t ask why.  Later on that night someone gave them mdma which turned into a kind of unofficial couples therapy.  They got back together and 10+ years later they&#x27;re still in a long loving relationship today.  Great, right?<p>Well.. it turned out he was enabling her, and she was the breadwinner, but she desperately needed some therapy, unable to keep a job due to personality reasons.  If he wasn&#x27;t around to enable her, she would have have grown, and things probably would have ended up pretty well.  Instead, for at least the last 5 years they&#x27;ve been homeless living together in a vehicle.<p>Love is a wonderful and beautiful thing, but not all relationships are good ones.  A therapist, even a professional, blindly mending a falling apart relationship should exceed caution.  Sometimes it&#x27;s better when people go their own way.')
