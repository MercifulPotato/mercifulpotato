Item(by='nlh', descendants=None, kids=[24937907, 24937880], score=None, time=1604016594, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24934581, text='&gt; Blocks are one of the most confusing, yet most powerful elements of Ruby. They allow you to group expressions, save them to a variable, and even pass them to a method. Iâ€™m still getting used to blocks and realizing their usefulness, but overall I feel that they condense a lot of code, and also make code more reusable and extensible.<p>Agreed re: confusion!  I&#x27;ve been using Ruby (and Crystal) for years and I&#x27;m only slightly ashamed to admit that while I fully understand how to _use_ blocks, I haven&#x27;t really truly grokked them.  I kinda use them and use yield and it all works.<p>But!  Something clicked recently, and I&#x27;m not sure why it took so long (maybe it was lots more experience with JavaScript lately?) and I feel kinda dumb that I just realized this:<p>Blocks are just anonymous functions.  That&#x27;s it.  Yield just means &quot;call the anonymous function that was passed in&quot;.  Yield with arguments (which always confused the hell out of me) is, again, just calling that same anonymous function with arguments.<p>(I think?)')
