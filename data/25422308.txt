Google have world class engineer, they have the ability to develop infrastructure that scales globally, yet they apparently can write desktop application.<p>A few days ago I tried to install Google Chat, for work. There&#x27;s no download buttons to be found, you&#x27;re just logged into Chat directly and greeted by a &quot;You need Chrome to download Chat&quot;. Well that just weird, but okay, I can uninstall Chrome afterwards, no problem. Imagine my surprise when launching Chat also launched Chrome. I disregard this as being something Chat just do on first launch. Existing Chrome however also closed Chat.... Okay. Uninstall Chrome then, that should teach Chat to no fool around with Chrome. Now Chat doesn&#x27;t work, because what Google doesn&#x27;t tell you is that Chat is now a progressive web app. The icon is pretty though.<p>Chat can be a web app all it want, but it doesn&#x27;t get to launch Chrome, I don&#x27;t want that abomination running all day. The current fix is apparently to install via Home Brew, that downloads a stand-alone app. Google claims the new version is stand-alone, but if it was to launch Chrome it&#x27;s not really stand-alone is it.<p>What struck me about all this is that Google doesn&#x27;t actually have the ability to develop real desktop application. That&#x27;s really weird, why wouldn&#x27;t they want to have the best performing, most powerful applications possible on the desktops? Because they can&#x27;t. Google as an organisation doesn&#x27;t have the mental capacity and patience to do real desktop programs.')
