Should they map roughly to your in-game rating? I&#x27;m pretty new to chess and still pretty bad (just under 1000 online, I make a lot of blunders and&#x2F;or fall for opponents&#x27; tactics) but my rating is 1750 on the tactics trainer.<p>I would imagine at some point the tactics are not the bottleneck and I should be working on something else instead (openings, endgames, or studying mid-game strategy?) but just wondering where that point is.')
