If your job involves contact with many people (let alone other hazards) it sounds like a very good way to get the young child and everybody else infected as they have a non-fully developed immune system.  There is a &quot;too young for daycare&quot; period for one. Cloistering the kids away (always a relative matter) may have developed as a strategy (by conscious or otherwise) to reduce infant mortality when the means were available. Farm work, hunter-gatherers and similiar could qualify as somewhat &quot;bubbled&quot; by low density.<p>Socialization wise I can see it being a win potentially for bonding and experience for the kid certainly assuming it doesn&#x27;t turn into &quot;crying baby on an airplane but everywhere&quot; situation which would hinder adoption.')
