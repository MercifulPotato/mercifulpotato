Item(by='eru', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604899078, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25008979, text='&gt; I also think low-skilled migrants are ok, to a degree. Migrants from EU can travel and work in Finland freely without visa. There are many Estonian, and some Bulgarian etc construction workers - but there also legally enforced minimum salaries for everyone. In Singapore there is no minimum salary and that is one of the causes of their extreme income distribution.<p>You are mixing up two things.  First, Singapore doesn&#x27;t have minimum wages for locals.  There are much more interventionist for foreigners: there are different visa categories, and they come with restrictions like minimum salaries and various levies etc.<p>(And that&#x27;s independent of any critique of the notion that outlawing jobs for people with low productivity does them a favour.<p>Interestingly, Finland also doesn&#x27;t have a universal minimum wage.  Just like my native Germany didn&#x27;t use to have one.)<p>But yes, you are right to remind me that the EU is rather big and has parts that are much poorer than Finland where the Fins might draw construction workers.<p>About cars: for most people they are status objects here.  There&#x27;s more of a real need for cars for people with lots of kids, but even there ride hailing has gotten much more convenient in the last decade.<p>About the costs: the well to do foreigners that can afford private schools are also exactly those that the country is most open to offering permanent residency and citizenship to.')
