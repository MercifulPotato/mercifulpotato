And in the distant future, maybe it&#x27;d make sense to moderate comments, and reply, via &#x2F;slash commands in a Matrix client?<p>* * *<p>If actually <i>storing</i> blog comments — maybe even the blog post itself?, in Matrix somehow, then, I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;d be good if the Matrix protocol &amp; storage format, worked with relpies &amp; nested replies. So there could be HackerNews like tree-style discussions<p>I wonder if it supports that already maybe<p>B.t.w. if you find time to dig into that, and if you want to &amp; remember, feel free to message me once you know how you&#x27;d do, to build something based on Matrix,<p>I&#x27;d be interested in ... in the very distant future ... two-way-sync between a Matrix &quot;database&quot; and a Talkyard database')
