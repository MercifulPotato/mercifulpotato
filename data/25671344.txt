Item(by='nickjj', descendants=None, kids=[25714819, 25672748], score=None, time=1610029578, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25670314, text='&gt; 27&quot; 4K at native resolution is far too small for me to read, but it looks great at 150% scaling, or even 200% for some things.<p>The problem is once you start scaling up you&#x27;re losing real estate. 4k at 200% scaling gives you same real estate as 1080p. Sure the picture will look better but you&#x27;re not gaining any improvements in being able to open and see more things at once. That and some apps can&#x27;t handle scaling properly.<p>Personally I find 25&quot; 1440p at native scaling to be a good balance of real estate, sharpness and ease of reading anything comfortably (even low contrast status bars).<p>With that set up you can open 4x 80 char side by side code windows in Vim, VSCode, etc.. You can also grab a really good 25&quot; 1440p IPS panel monitor for around $300.
