You know, when you could make others very sick indeed.<p>But more importantly, Covid is <i>not</i> the flu, and comparisons start failing pretty quickly. Not only do more people die of Covid, but more people have long-lasting symptoms, life-altering, after their infection.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to, don&#x27;t work for someone that requires it. It might severely limit your employment prospects, but that is your choice (obviously, exceptions should be made for those that cannot get it for medical reasons. They do not have choice).')
