I have not programmed a lot in Fortran but with my limited exposure to it I like the first class support multidimensional arrays. It has a simple and clean syntax too. Definitely wins in speed and longevity.<p>Can someone with more experience of Fortran explain if this language is still relevant today and if it makes sense to get started with it in this day and age? If so, which Fortran standard to use? Fortran 90? Which compiler implementation to use?')
