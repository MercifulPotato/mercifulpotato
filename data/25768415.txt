Almost every web dev problem you could think of is solved in Python with tons of examples, practical applications, blog posts, YouTube videos and the raw docs themselves. You&#x27;ll almost certainly find high quality code you can at least work off of.<p>Where as with Elixir I find myself hitting dead ends in a lot of places and the docs often don&#x27;t have enough details or context to understand something unless you&#x27;re already an expert in which case you wouldn&#x27;t need the docs. There&#x27;s often 1 liners that expect you to have an understanding of the language that rivals its creator.<p>At the end of the day it&#x27;s not really about the literal documentation. It&#x27;s how fast you can go from being stuck to unstuck and walking away with understanding how you got from stuck to unstuck.')
