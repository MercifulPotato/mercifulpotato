Item(by='asib', descendants=None, kids=[24973575], score=None, time=1604351503, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24963603, text='I think you&#x27;ve misunderstood my question.<p>&gt; The type of muscles in your heart are quite different from the types of muscle in your hands.<p>Yes, but cardio doesn&#x27;t solely use cardiac muscle.<p>What I was trying to get at was that when doing cardio, you are using the muscles in your legs and&#x2F;or upper body, albeit at a lower intensity than when strength training. GP seemed to be implying that because writing is a continuous, repetitive strain, that it is a purely degradative action. But my point was that cardio can be described in the same way and has clear benefits for muscle health.<p>Therefore, my question was really whether the problem is the fact that writing is done for long periods with little recovery or more to do with people holding their pens in a weird way, or something. Put more generally, an issue of form.')
