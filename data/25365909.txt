The PayPal folks are smart people, but the bay area is full to the gills of smart visionaries lacking capital to take on ambitious visions. Many have worked at Elon&#x27;s companies. To really see little trees grow people like Elon would need to change their equity structures to let the next group of innovators thrive.')
