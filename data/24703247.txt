That includes a guy you might have heard of: Les Paul.<p>Sure, he wasn&#x27;t everyone&#x27;s cup of tea.  But he was very much an artist who spent thousands of hours crafting his own sound and his own technique.<p>I think saying he was &quot;another rock-n-roller&quot; is inaccurate and extremely unfair.')
