AFAIK a single fire shouldn&#x27;t take out more than one, either.<p>If a region-wide outage is caused by any of those things, it&#x27;s because something else isn&#x27;t working as expected. And this region has had region-wide issues before.<p>Still, boiling cloud computing down to &quot;somebody else&#x27;s computer&quot; is an oversimplification I see too often from cynical techies. It&#x27;s like calling a restaurant &quot;somebody else&#x27;s kitchen.&quot; Yeah, it is. But it&#x27;s missing the point to frame it that way.')
