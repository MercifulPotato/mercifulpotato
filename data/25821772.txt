But I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s a valid excuse: not supporting immutability well is fine, pretending that you do when actually you don&#x27;t is not.<p>The kotlin defense to this surely is that immutability happily exists in val constructor args (with the usual exception: not transitive through references), but that&#x27;s purely contextual and a difference that is very hard to represent at usage site (e.g. they look exactly the same in the intellij &quot;javadoc&quot; view). If for some reason bean-style methods had to be represented through var&#x2F;val syntax, I think that it would have been much better if read-only calculated getters were represented by a var without set(), leaving val to cases where you&#x27;re guaranteed to get the same when referenced twice (value set once in constructor or some lazyness shenanigans).')
