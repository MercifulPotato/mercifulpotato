And thanks for posting.<p>&gt; &quot;In terms of naming, it&#x27;s really not hard: Matrix is the protocol...&quot;<p>First time I read that it was clarifying. Second time I read it it reminded me - naming is important. Always think about customers and don&#x27;t dismiss things that confuse customers &#x2F; end users. I 100% want to see y&#x27;all succeed. But this customer friction area and similar ones are not to be overlooked. If I were you, I&#x27;d focus 100% on the best way to surface Matrix&#x27;s value to others. That&#x27;s all we&#x27;re looking for.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;clients&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;matrix.org&#x2F;clients&#x2F;</a><p>is awesome. A CLI client that is reliable and cutting edge would be awesome (looks like some contenders - I&#x27;d love to see one in Clojure or Rust but that&#x27;s just me..). Bridges with other providers like Slack etc. would be a good way to make in-roads into the Slack user base - would get developers using it for work, and then able to switch over, etc.<p>Most users of Slack, etc., are getting a little tired of it. We&#x27;d love something new - and something we could customize more! Awesome. But you have to position yourself as: (a) a strong, stable, growing alternative with a strong customer focus and appreciation (knowing that if you want to be Linux v. Microsoft and not GNOME&#x2F;KDE v. macOS&#x2F;Windows - i.e., succeed in the Enterprise outside of Europe, you have to be a new kind of customer obsessed than what has come before)  (b) a low risk alternative to start experimenting with.<p>Biggest focus should be developers creating enterprise apps (like the German army). That&#x27;s the sweet spot it seems like to get exponential traction. If you can tap into engineers who are using Slack&#x2F;Teams&#x2F;etc. and get them to build more clients, etc... it could be really good.<p>I.e., implement the difficult parts of Slack really, really well (again be Linux OS v. Microsoft OS - and let hypervisors and whatever else innovate on top of your platform -- and not try to boil the ocean with UI features, etc. - which I feel like is just difficult to compete with - there&#x27;s a mountain of engineers in Cupertino who are going to out-innovate on a stronger platform with a lot more advantages.. but something like the Linux kernel.. is key).<p>YMMV, just one person&#x27;s thoughts.')
