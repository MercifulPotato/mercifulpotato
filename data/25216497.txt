There&#x27;s no money for anything so either you raise taxes (scary), take on more debt (also scary) or print money (scary).<p>The conservative government in the UK and liberal government in Canada have made major green announcements, a lot of this is opportunistic politiking.<p>The &#x27;Modern Monetary Theorists&#x27; (&#x27;debts don&#x27;t matter&#x27; people) are definitely pushing hard at this time.<p>Because every central bank and government is going into full on Keynsian spending, they&#x27;re likely going to want to keep on doing that, and not reverting to the &#x27;regular economy&#x27;. Power is hard to reliquish.<p>In Canada, pre-covid, we saw the <i>average house price increase in value more than the average wage</i> in the country. That is point blank crazy. That is a weird financialisation of the economy that we don&#x27;t yet understand - inflation in a fixed asset that doesn&#x27;t increase productivity.<p>Even the US Fed said just a few days ago &#x27;It&#x27;s a New World Orders&#x27;.<p>People should be spooked because with all the flux and the rules being re-written there will be power grabs, and just because people think they are benevolent, doesn&#x27;t mean they are. Surely, a common denominator in humanity is the propensity for people to make power grabs when they can.')
