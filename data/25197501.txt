I&#x27;d just like to point out a small thing, that by calling the automatic weapons ban in the 80&#x27;s the &quot;AWB&quot; you are conflating terms between the Firearms Owners Protection Act of 1986 (known as FOPA) and the Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act of 1994 (known as the AWB). People are generally confused between the legal definitions of &quot;automatic weapon&quot; and &quot;assault weapon&quot;. I find it useful to be very specific about which you are discussing to avoid confusion and petty arguments about terminology that can keep the discussion from moving forward.')
