Is it fraudulent if I don&#x27;t have the coffee right now? After all, I&#x27;ve sold you something I don&#x27;t own.<p>Of course it isn&#x27;t. What matters is that the contract is fulfilled, and for equity sales in the US, the contract states that a share will be delivered to the buyer 2 days after the transaction.')
