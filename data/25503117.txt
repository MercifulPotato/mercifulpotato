Both JSON strings and their deserialized value&#x27;s memory usage grows only linearly if you nest stuff (unless you&#x27;re doing something dumb).<p>By that logic they should also add -MaxArrayLength to make the parser stop parsing long JSON arrays, -MaxProperties to make it only parse object properties up to a limit, -MaxStringLength to only make it parser strings up to a certain length...<p>It&#x27;s completely pointless.')
