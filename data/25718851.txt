Literally immediately after the &#x27;both sides&#x27; soundbite he goes on to explicitly denounce nazis, and yet the media censored that, to make it appear as if he were defending them. It&#x27;s so blatant, it&#x27;s insane.<p>Like I&#x27;ve said before around here, in 2016, I couldn&#x27;t stand the man, but the way the media treats him, I find myself rooting for him. Every problem about Trump is their own creation.')
