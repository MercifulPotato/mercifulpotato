Just as the work ebbs and flows, a person&#x27;s energy ebbs and flows.<p>The key is to develop _habits_ which serve you well on &quot;off&quot; days.  Put forth the effort to do things like wake up at the same time, log in and do certain &quot;ceremonies&quot; of work, always do SOMEthing productive every day.<p>It&#x27;s the exact same thing as forcing yourself to go to the gym every day no matter what.  You don&#x27;t have to set new personal records every time.  But if you go and put in at least SOME level of effort, push yourself at least somewhat, then on the &quot;bad&quot; days you can just put yourself on autopilot and still put in a good (not GREAT, not superb, not fantastic, just GOOD) performance.  And that&#x27;s what matters.')
