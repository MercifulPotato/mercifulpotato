(Again.) 99% of web users <i>do not want</i> to edit HTML, because they have far better things to do with their lives. I don’t care how easy <i>you</i> find it, because you aren’t representative of any of them.<p>But since you mention it, HTML is reeking garbage. It has so many freaking rules, and special exceptions, and not-exceptions, and “&lt;&gt;”, and if you don’t get the punctuation <i>just right</i> then your actual content is going to get some degree of screwed up. Which, considering it’s the user content, not the machine markup, that is <i>supposed</i> to be the important part, is a thoroughly FUBARed set of UX priorities (or SOP for the nerdocracy).<p>But even if HTML was the very model of simplicity and clarity, very few end-users would want to type it themselves. I mean, what’s the fluency in Markdown outside of geek circles?<p>Oh, and let’s not forget that having broken the user out of her familiar web browser environment and, against all odds, somehow persuaded her to compose a correctly marked up HTML document in a text editor or something, she still has to get that document onto the web somehow, which means screwing with <i>yet another</i> obnoxious app and <i>yet another</i> arcane set of buttons and rules for using that app, all of which is almost entirely unlike their familiar web browser and how they use that.<p>--<p>TL;DR: Computer nerds who arrogantly whine “well it’s easy for meeeee” put my back up like nothing else on Earth. So if you don’t wish to be burned to a crisp then don’t <i>ever</i> talk to me about “open web” when you’re the self-serving jackasses who closed it in the first place.<p>p.s. I am also very not interested in talking about dynamic menus and stuff, because of the billions of people who post their own content online via Twitbook every day, how much of that content includes custom codes they wrote?')
