Audiovisual multimedia have far higher raw bandwidth than text. I agree with your (implied) point, though, that text remains the preferred medium for technical use cases like programming for good reason: humans can&#x27;t parse a firehose of audiovisual stimuli into precise mental constructs.<p>Text&#x27;s typically linear structure and low information density are precisely why it has yet to be superseded, I think.')
