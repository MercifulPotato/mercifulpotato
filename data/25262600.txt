You just spin them up and leave them there.  The power to keep cryogenics running is a hundred-fold less than the electrical power needed for confinement coils.<p>JET and DIII-D are the largest magnetic confinement fusion research devices made so far and they both use copper coils.  They have confining fields of 3.45 T and 2.2 T, respectively.  My machine operates at a modest 1 T (for now) and is much smaller.  I&#x27;m sure the electricity bill that the confining coils that those large machines racked up is substantial.')
