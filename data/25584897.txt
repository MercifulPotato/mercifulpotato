I&#x27;ve read that Docker support is coming along, but I haven&#x27;t bothered trying that locally (and probably hadn&#x27;t used Docker on my previous Mac in over a year).  So yeah, for me usage is generally Firefox and&#x2F;or Safari and&#x2F;or Chrome with dozens of tabs, Terminal windows, AWS Workspaces client and Messages app.  Everything flies, as you&#x27;d expect.<p>I got a cheap Choetech USB-C dock from Amazon to do HDMI, Ethernet and USB-A, and that worked for a couple of weeks until it flaked out and the dock&#x27;s USB ports stopped working.  Now I&#x27;m stuck on the laptop screen until the new Thunderbolt dock I ordered arrives tomorrow (and hopefully works more reliably).  But while I had them connected, the Mac seemed to have no problem driving my 4K monitor - my old MacBook Pro could do 4K at 30hz and it felt like it was struggling - this machine makes it feel like a breeze as I bounce between workspaces and apps.<p>In the 5 weeks I&#x27;ve been using the machine I have had 2 random-seeming hard crashes - the screen went purple for a moment and then the laptop turned off.  When it restarted, it wanted to report a kernel panic to Apple.  Not sure of the cause of the issue and haven&#x27;t been able to replicate on demand.<p>So far I like the machine and am happy with it - it makes my (admittedly pedestrian) workflow feel much snappier, although I would have also been OK waiting for something even better if I didn&#x27;t suddenly need to buy another laptop for the household.')
