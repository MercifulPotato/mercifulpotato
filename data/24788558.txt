Instead they lost seats in the senate and did not gain back all the ground they lost in the state governments.<p>For comparison, the Republicans did very well in the 2014 mid term, convincingly taking over both houses of congress.<p>The democratic party had every advantage for a convincing win in 2018 and they instead had a very poor showing. The party is not good at elections and I don&#x27;t see a reason why we expect this election to be different.')
