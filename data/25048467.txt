Apple has a bookstore, I should be able to download the whole of Apple&#x27;s Developer Documentation on my iPad.  I would prefer PDF because I cannot read a screen for hours.<p>Plus, the examples are almost always broken and don&#x27;t compile.  Broken samples and videos are horrible ways to teach anything.')
