Item(by='KirillPanov', descendants=None, kids=[25604639], score=None, time=1609476123, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25581390, text='This is all kind of moot because of how popular DocuSign has become.<p>You get no opportunity to redline anything -- unless the signature-requestor decides to grant you that permission, which they basically never do, because DocuSign has become &quot;take it or leave it as a service&quot;.  Sort of like how arbitration has become &quot;no class action as a service&quot;.  I mean sure, in theory arbitration clauses can allow for class action, but I&#x27;ve never heard of that happening.<p>You might say that people can always ask for a wording change out-of-band via email, but this neglects the subtle dynamics of contract negotiations -- not just in employment agreements, but elsewhere (my pet example: the aggressive NDAs put forth by semiconductor foundries).<p>A lot of negotiation is about who ends up looking unreasonable if talks break down, and the reputational cost of appearing unreasonable.  If you send back a signed document with a totally reasonable redline, the other side looks unreasonable for not countersigning and moving forward.  With DocuSign&#x27;s &quot;adhesion as a service&quot; the other side will just claim that their legal department doesn&#x27;t read external emails so they never got your proposal.')
