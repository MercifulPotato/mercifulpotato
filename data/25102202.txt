It&#x27;s a single link every other day to something interesting, the kind of blog posts that you come across every once in a while that really make you think. The overwhelming feedback is that being able to read the kind of non-viscerally-targeted news and analyses that aren&#x27;t easily found online is incredibly valuable.<p>I&#x27;ve been asked multiple times about starting a community with discussion, but don&#x27;t currently have the bandwidth. If someone else would like to create one I will happily support it.<p>[1] www.thinking-about-things.com<p>Some example articles are at www.twitter.com&#x2F;thinkingaboutt6.')
