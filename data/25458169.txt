You need specialized staff, which are in short supply.<p>Consider the scale as well that you&#x27;ll be working with as mayor of LA:<p>The population of the city of Los Angeles proper is 3.8 million, but the population of the greater LA area (19 million) is almost twice the population of the entire country of Sweden (10 million). Los Angeles has to make policy with limited control inside of a very complex environment.<p>The homeless population of Los Angeles is estimated to be around 66,000 people. That&#x27;s <i>twice</i> that of the entire country of Sweden.<p>The state of California, alone, has 40 million people, and open borders with Arizona, a state with nearly the population of Sweden (7 million) and zero state-level mask restrictions.<p>Los Angeles County is currently seeing 134 deaths <i>per day</i> from Coronavirus, even with California in lockdown.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;california&#x2F;story&#x2F;2020-12-16&#x2F;l-a-county-sets-staggering-new-covid-19-case-death-records" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;california&#x2F;story&#x2F;2020-12-16&#x2F;l-a-coun...</a><p>&gt; &quot;<i>The risk if the policy was wrong would be hospitals would get over-full.</i>&quot;<p>This is not the risk. The risk is that thousands of people would die, both from Corona and the fact that hospitals will be closed to all patients Corona or not.<p>&gt; &quot;<i>They&#x27;ve all been told by &quot;experts&quot; who know nothing about disease that millions will die unless everyone is locked in their homes right now</i>&quot;<p>300,000 people have died in the United States so far as a result of Coronavirus. People are projecting we might reach a million by the end of 2020. If we continued on the current trajectory that would be an almost certain bet.<p>&gt; &quot;<i>The contingency plan would be to buy capacity from hospitals in further away regions and invest in rapid buildouts of ambulances, helicopters etc to make it easy to shift capacity around and load balance between hospitals, including to neighbouring regions that disagreed.</i>&quot;<p>Who would pay for this? We have a private healthcare system, not a public one. The City of LA is not in the business of purchasing and operating helicopters for medical use. There is no budget for that. Private companies like Reach handle the overwhelming majority of medvac and transport helicopters in the U.S.. Ambulances are operated by a checkerboard of private companies and City&#x2F;County fire. We don&#x27;t have a socialized, universal healthcare system so it&#x27;s basically impossible to coordinate resources like this. How would you &#x27;buy&#x27; capacity? Billing is through private insurance. Would the city agree to pay all costs related to patients in a hospital in another county? I bet the hospitals wouldn&#x27;t agree to that since it&#x27;s almost guaranteed they wouldn&#x27;t get paid.<p>One thing that limits the ability to transpose Sweden&#x27;s policies on the United States is the sheer scale here. California is massive. The U.S. is massive. Individual states are the size of whole European countries, they effectively operate as a schengen area with no restrictions on the flow of people, and spotty mask compliance depending on where you are. And forget grand ideas of coordinating from one city or county to the next. Our system is private, and private companies get to do whatever they want. Unless they&#x27;re going to be well-paid for something, you can bet they&#x27;re not going to go along with it.<p>&gt; &quot;<i>I&#x27;m much happier in the private sector where what matters is getting results, not the perception of niceness</i>&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know that putting California, and Los Angeles in another lockdown is being interpreted as niceness here. Lots of people are pissed, people are losing their businesses, but many many people are also dying and becoming very ill. Both Newsom and Garcetti are making some very difficult choices to get results.<p>I genuinely don&#x27;t mind that you have a different take on the situation. I&#x27;m happy to just sit and discuss this stuff.')
