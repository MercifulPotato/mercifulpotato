As for a physical sound visualization, one exists already: see &quot;Numerical simulation of Faraday waves&quot; by L. Tuckerman. As usual, the dry technical paper glosses over the visual aspect of Faraday waves. Basically, if you create such a standing wave in a cup of tea (e.g. by shaking the table), you&#x27;d see its shape via reflections, similar to how we can see the surface of ocean waves via reflections of sun. However, if you could suspend the water surface, put a LED ring above (one of those used for professional photos) and take an extremely high quality photo to see all the reflections and refractions created by that LED ring, yo&#x27;d see a picture of remarkable complexity. It looks a lot like a 3D hologram. I&#x27;ve been trying to simulate this effect on GPU.')
