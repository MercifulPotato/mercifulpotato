Ask yourself why.<p>Heck, spend some time and try to make a better method your self, and patent it. Then you can hold for-fee patents needing your brilliant idea hostage, and change the playing field.<p>Or maybe you&#x27;re mistaken on how hard and non-trivial the needed components are?<p>And, if they&#x27;re so non-trivial that open source, or Google, or whomever want them to be free, then the ideas are worth patents.<p>&gt;That&#x27;s because it takes so long to get implemented,<p>You think it takes longer to implement a compression codec than to create it? That&#x27;s not true for this scale (I&#x27;ve worked on several high end compression codecs and have written probably a few dozen in my career).<p>Creating one is by far the hardest part - trying tons and tons of ideas (coding them all up for testing), looking for new ideas, working on how various ideas interact, etc.<p>By the time the spec is solidified probably a few hundred throwaways have been made. Implementation is trivial, then optimization takes some time.<p>But neither effort, by far, approach the effort it takes to design one on this scale.<p>&gt; There would be less total incentive, but there&#x27;s still the enormous incentive from everyone working with video to get better compression&#x2F;quality, and streamlining cooperation would be a big deal.<p>If that were true, you&#x27;d see all those same actors improving x264 compression and other compression, but they are not. Most all modern compression schemes only define the decoding part, allowing improvements on the encoding side to be continually worked on. The technical skill to do so is non-trivial, and a tiny, tiny fraction of as percent of &quot;everyone working with video&quot; has any idea how to improve it.<p>This is how x264 kept improving and improving over and over got H.264 compression - there was pretty much one person, Dark Shikari, that worked on it for year and years to improve it.<p>If you want to see how terribly complex this work is, read his (internet archive) blog on the work.<p>So no, the vast majority of people working with video would be useless at making anything better.')
