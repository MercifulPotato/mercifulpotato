I have a hard time remembering when exactly things happened (to figure out in what year I started school I basically have to walk backwards through my memories keeping track of some kind of time marker like seasons, like traversing a linked list). I often joke that if I ever was a suspect in a criminal investigation it would be very difficult for me to provide an alibi. It feels like a lot of day to day memories don&#x27;t get &#x27;time-stamped&#x27; at all.<p>I always thought this mainly had to do with ADD related working memory problems, but maybe it&#x27;s more of an episodic memory problem?')
