Item(by='klodolph', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607233410, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25319749, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t think that CLIs are more suited to either humans or computers. CLIs are flexible enough to be effectively used by both.<p>Either a human is sitting at a terminal typing commands, or a human is sitting at a text editor writing a shell script, or a human is writing a program which runs other commands. In all cases, it&#x27;s a bunch of strings pasted together and the computer can&#x27;t typecheck it, so we need to make sure that the strings are readable by humans.<p>&gt; Well, you&#x27;re breaking everybody&#x27;s expectations and many years of conventions by doing it. Saving one dash with every flag and losing the ability to combine short options is just not a good trade off.<p>If you&#x27;ve named your account on HN &quot;gnubison&quot;, it&#x27;s safe to say that you&#x27;ve got some biases. It might surprise you to know, then, that plenty of programs <i>already</i> don&#x27;t let you combine short options, and that not everybody uses getopt_long or something compatible.<p>Combining short flags saves you a small amount of typing sometimes, but it adds extra confusion. So in general, I would say that most commands should not allow you to combine short flags.')
