We are talking about deeply intolerant, bad faith actors, and you substitute this with &quot;censoring opinions outside the mainstream&quot;.<p>This is deeply dishonest by you. We are not talking about removing peoples right to use a platform because they are out of the mainstream and we disagree with them. That is NOT the reason. There is plenty of non-mainstream opinion around. There is plenty of things that a vast majority find disagreeable that no one is talking about removing.')
