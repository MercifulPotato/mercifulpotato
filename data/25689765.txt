You know someone passed a sensor at a certain point, someone in a command center can go &quot;that person isn&#x27;t supposed to be there, challenge them now&quot;.<p>IR says &quot;this guy I have in my scope from my perch on this nice rooftop does not appear to be a friendly&quot;, as well as via fixed camera or drone.<p>The IR Signature Control Low Emissivity Tape used by militaries says &quot;oh they&#x27;re reflecting IR in the correct pattern&quot; by someone using NODs, cameras and scopes that aren&#x27;t filtering IR, etc so when you see a bunch of people running up on you at night (or even during the day) and for whatever reason they aren&#x27;t shouting or radioing the equivalent of &quot;it&#x27;s me, don&#x27;t shoot!&quot; you don&#x27;t mow them down with a hail of bullets only to find out you just slaughtered a bunch of friendlies.')
