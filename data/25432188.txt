Item(by='jessaustin', descendants=None, kids=[25432878], score=None, time=1608051868, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25424391, text='<i>American news outlets generally don&#x27;t report on issues outside their borders unless...</i><p>...they think there&#x27;s a chance to start a war. Compare the coverage of protests in India to those in Hong Kong. In India they want the government to coddle big business and rich people less: zero coverage. In Hong Kong they wanted to embarrass Chinese communists: wall-to-wall coverage. Often we can see this phenomenon in a single nation. When a few relatively wealthy capitalists protested the duly elected government of Venezuela a couple of years ago, we heard all about it. Two <i>days</i> ago Maduro&#x27;s government won reelection in a landslide, and we haven&#x27;t heard a peep. The fact that large majorities of Venezuelans support their current government makes it more difficult for us to start the war that John Bolton wants, so that won&#x27;t be mentioned on CNN.')
