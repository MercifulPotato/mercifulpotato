But then the question is how much safety is that agency buying you? And how many people even have an option to exercise such agency? You do not have it when it comes to other drivers that may cause accidents or run you over (or your children if you wish) as pedestrian. You have far less of it for taxi, rideshare or public transport services. And how many parents will drive their children even when they&#x27;re stressed or haven&#x27;t slept because the children simply have to go somewhere and they can&#x27;t afford other options?<p>In aggregate we can probably buy more safety by having policies that encourage replacement of bad drivers with merely average autonomous vehicles rather than attempting to rely on individual behavior to improve safety.<p>If you want to still exercise personal options you could choose an autonomous car plus safety driver.')
