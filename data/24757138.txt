Death rate? They&#x27;re still arguing. Risk of serious complications by age group or complications? Still arguing. Negative impacts of social distancing&#x2F;lockdown measures? Still arguing.<p>I think it&#x27;s great that there is <i>an</i> argument about this, but it still feels disappointing that it will still clearly take a lot longer then 10 months to clarify these points to a level where no serious high level medical professional disagrees.<p>In the meantime, I&#x27;d also appreciate it if we could get back to a lot more talk of &quot;flatten the curve&quot; in our public discourse. Nobody seems to seriously doubt that at some point almost all humans will be exposed to the virus. The question is how rapidly that happens, and the concomittant impact on health care and the economy if it happens too fast.')
