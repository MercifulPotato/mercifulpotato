A BUNCH of weird things started happening actually and I kind of backed off of it because of them.  It proved to be a lot more than I really signed up for.  (Fascinating things happened though...)<p>...But I have retained the piloerection ability, which I can do on command within 2-5 seconds or so.  There&#x27;s also some weird sensations in my sinuses I can trigger... it feels like the tissues contracting or something, not sure what it actually is, but that&#x27;s what it feels like.  ...And I regularly cry now at sad things, like movies and stories and the like.  I used to never cry.  Not like I was holding it in, but like, it just didn&#x27;t happen.')
