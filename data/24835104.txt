Instead of a contact form &#x2F; abuse contact e-mail in the page footer I ended up on a FAQ page telling me to report it using their chat thing. Of course that chat was not staffed without any indication until you typed up a message (another frequent factor of annoyance for those not in US-adjacent time zones) and the keyword matcher asked me if the FAQ page I was on would be of any help. When I put the data in the thing to go on with my day it asked me for an e-mail to follow-up with me, something this interaction did not require.<p>Sure, I get when people get more customer interaction from these things but please folks, make sure it&#x27;s not replacing functionality for other parts of your (potential) customer base.')
