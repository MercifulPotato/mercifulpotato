Item(by='Steko', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608553273, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25493998, text='Apple probably audits their suppliers and contractors better than almost all of their peers but they are also culpable here for creating the ingredients for workers to be treated like shit by their pseudo-contractors. This isn&#x27;t some widget factory that Apple signed on to make iPhones for the near future, it&#x27;s a factory that only exists in the first place to make Apple iPhones and Apple fronted all the money to build it, etc.  But Apple has set it up in a way that artificially distances themselves from what should be Apple employees (or at worst employees of a joint venture where Apple execs could run the HR and avoid these shady labor violations). I&#x27;m sure there are many benefits in doing it this way and they are lauded for those every quarter so they are also going to take the lumps as well.')
