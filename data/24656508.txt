Hot air stations don&#x27;t cost more than soldering irons. I bought mine new for Â£35. I&#x27;m not saying that everyone in the world can easily afford a hot air station. But it&#x27;s wrong to characterize it as some kind of exotic, highly expensive piece of equipment just because you didn&#x27;t happen to own one.<p>You can also just use a cheap toaster oven (though that makes rework more difficult).')
