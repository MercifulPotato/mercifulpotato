Use of cell records to filter suspects has a long history.  And here we have a situation (an assault on a single building) that is almost perfectly suited to exactly this technique.<p>&gt; The particular method outlined in the article implicates a number of completely innocent protestors.<p>Again, I see little evidence for an organized protest outside the capitol.
