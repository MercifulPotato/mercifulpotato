There are two techniques that worked for me.<p>0. Be a chronic reddit user for years, with a main account that has thousands of karma and a couple of throwaway accounts that also have various content.<p>1. Write an interesting blog post with useful content that relates to your product, and post it on a relevant subreddit. Put a call to action like &quot;Buy Now&quot; at the bottom of that post. Post it a maximum of twice in any 24 hour period. If it doesn&#x27;t succeed on a given subreddit, you can try it maybe once more with a different headline before you should move on to a different subreddit. If you post it more than 4-5 times total anywhere on reddit, you&#x27;re liable to get banned.<p>2. Hang out in subreddits where people discuss products like yours. Answer questions with useful information. After providing the information, link your site as the source. Do not just link your site without also providing a useful answer on reddit.<p>Reddit does drive quite a bit of traffic, something like 60-100 hits per upvote. It&#x27;s great, but it still often doesn&#x27;t result in as many sales-per-click as facebook or instagram.')
