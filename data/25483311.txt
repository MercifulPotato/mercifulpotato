One of the biggest differences between last year&#x27;s A13 and this year&#x27;s A14 is the 5nm process (vs 7nm+). The performance increase seems to be on the order of 15% [1], and Apple was able to fit in a lot more transistors- 11.8B vs. 8.5B, though we don&#x27;t know how many of those transistors were spent on the CPU, and how many were spent in other areas like the GPU or ISP.<p>Seems like the additional transistors and lower power consuption were used to increase performance in a bunch of ways- higher clock speeds, more cache, and a bigger reorder buffer being the obvious improvements. Perhaps AMD can pull off a similar improvement when they switch processes.<p>[1] Spec2006 numbers from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16192&#x2F;the-iphone-12-review&#x2F;2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;16192&#x2F;the-iphone-12-review&#x2F;2</a>')
