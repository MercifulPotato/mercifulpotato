Just copy it as much as you can.<p>I have tried to move some of my younger friends over and they appreciated the privacy angle, but I can see unless I actively push for it, they will &quot;unknowingly&quot; revert to WhatsApp.<p>I am holding off trying to migrate my older friends and family who are less flexible with tech stuff, I know I only probably have one shot at this and as it is Signal will fail. I will wait a couple more months and see if things have improved, if not, I&#x27;ll just push for Telegram.\nTelegram is not as good as WhatsApp either UX-wise, but it&#x27;s much better than Signal.. and the fact they have some really nice apps for desktop without requiring the phone as a &quot;source of truth&quot; is actually a big usability advantage.<p>As others said, it&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m paranoid about state actors and am not adamant on perfect e2e encryption, I just don&#x27;t want Zuck to take a peak or my children&#x27;s photos to be used in some FB deep learning face recognition DB or god knows what else.')
