You should be targeting the p99 long term, but focus on the p50&#x2F;p90 for now.<p>It&#x27;s super important to target and make long term decisions around the p99 though, because, e.g., making a 100x improvement is not possible through little iterative changes over 2-3 years. You need a base to work from where that 100x is fundamentally achievable, which requires thinking from first principles and slightly getting out of the typical product mindset.<p>I also find the typical product mindset tends to result in focussing a lot on the &quot;this quarter&#x2F;next quarter&quot; goals, but neglecting the &quot;8&#x2F;12 quarters from now&quot; as a result.<p>Beyond short term&#x2F;long term goals, the choice is largely just down to what the product is&#x2F;does. Even ignoring all current architectural choices, there are some fundamentals where certain things must always be faster&#x2F;slower - e.g. sync writes will typically be a fair bit slower than reads, and typically occur much less often, complex dynamic queries which can&#x27;t be pre-optimised require DB scanning but are much less common.<p>For these kinds of tools, where most of the interaction is reads, mostly on predefined or predefined + small extra filtering, and reading&#x2F;writing on individual resources (ie tickets), you can get p99 numbers trending towards the 100ms mark eventually - there&#x27;s very little which truly can&#x27;t get to that level with clever enough engineering.<p>---<p>Of course I imagine Google tends to be looking more at their p99.9&#x2F;p99.99&#x2F;pmax&#x2F;etc(!), at least for their absolute highest volume systems.<p>None of us are going to be getting to that point, but it&#x27;s often worth thinking about engineering principles against a super high bar - it often helps people to open their minds a bit more and think more outside the box when given a really dramatic goal magnitudes beyond their existing mindset.<p>Of course you&#x27;re not expecting to really get to that level, but anchoring that way can achieve amazing things. I&#x27;ve done that with a lot of success at my company and we actually did manage to achieve a few originally thought to be totally unrealistic.')
