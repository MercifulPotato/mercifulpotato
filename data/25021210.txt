They are adding context with verifiable truths. Which, again, not editorializing because stating a truth is not an opinion.<p>I&#x27;m sure you can dream up all sorts of hypotheticals that makes this sound problematic, such as implying twitter are the ones deciding something is true or false. They don&#x27;t need to decide that, they just need to recognise a statement as false and then add clarification. If Trump&#x27;s tweets had any kind of ambiguity then maybe what you say has credence, but that isn&#x27;t the reality of the situation.')
