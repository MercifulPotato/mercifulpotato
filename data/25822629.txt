I&#x27;m 6&#x27;2&quot; and weighed 220 lbs when I was working out three hours a day 5 times a week. You&#x27;ll notice that&#x27;s considered &#x27;overweight&#x27; and nearly obese.<p>I&#x27;m about 100 lbs. heavier now. I know I&#x27;m too heavy. And I need to work on it. Incidentally, a large part of my weight problem stems from an anxiety&#x2F;PTSD problem. Sugary junk food makes me feel better when I&#x27;m not doing well mentally.<p>Yet somehow attempt to make me feel guilty is going to make me more healthy? It&#x27;s more likely to cause me to have an eating disorder and further hurt my mental health.<p>I&#x27;ve had co-workers who binge drink regularly and smoke daily try to tell me my lifestyle is unhealthy. I do neither.<p>It&#x27;s crazy how entitled people feel to be rude to overweight people.')
