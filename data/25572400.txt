The answer is two parts: salary has not increased and we get less for our money.  The salary stagnation is pretty well known, but I&#x27;ve been looking into the other side:<p>We Americans currently spend $4,000 more per person per year than other countries for healthcare, and we live 4 years shorter than them.  For a family of 5, like the Simpsons, that&#x27;s $20,000 per year.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;numbers-that-matter&#x2F;our-healthcare-system-costs-4-000-and-4-years-of-life-per-person-58417bbe6e68" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;numbers-that-matter&#x2F;our-healthcare-system...</a><p>Because of industry consolidation, over the last 20 years, we Americans are paying an extra $2,000 per person per year for higher priced goods.  And losing out on $800 per person per year on goods we don&#x27;t buy because consolidation raised the price beyond what we&#x27;d pay.  For a family of 5 like the Simpsons, that&#x27;s worth $14,000 per year.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;numbers-that-matter&#x2F;monopoly-oligopoly-cost-2-800-per-american-per-year-446c8d48a35d" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;numbers-that-matter&#x2F;monopoly-oligopoly-co...</a><p>Another major factor is housing.  More people live in cities, but housing hasn&#x27;t been created at the same pace.  It drives up rents and housing prices.  Some economists have measured the effect of housing in just San Francisco and New York and said it is worth _nationally_ on the order of $1,200 per person per year.  That&#x27;s just f<i></i>*ed up.<p>So, even as wages have stagnated, that&#x27;s not the whole story.  Lower class people are actually worse off.')
