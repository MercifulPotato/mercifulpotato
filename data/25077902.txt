I guess the rest of the story is pretty obvious; having your default dns server not being able to resolve because you&#x27;re trying to verify it – since you cannot resolve your verify hostname – is obviously Not Great. As you can imagine, there is no waiting in the world that fixes this. I couldn&#x27;t kill (-9) the process either; had to reboot into safe mode, rename the binary and switch the default dns on the network.')
