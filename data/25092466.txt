This is different. In one case you have control ( choosing not to deal with google because of their arbitrary judgments when it comes to account termination ) in the other, you really don&#x27;t. ( Random calamity that befalls your email provider ).<p>If your email provider goes away, you&#x27;re screwed. Nobody accounts for this situation. Doubly so when you used an identity provider that has gone bust. \nThe question is, how do YOU imagine imposing regulations on mail providers will change anything in a case like this?<p>Store your credentials, make backups of your emails, don&#x27;t use identity systems. If things really do go bust, you&#x27;ll retain access until you can get manual changes made to your accounts.<p>The other obvious solution is to have identity&#x2F;e-mail built-in as part of citizenship and be gauranteed by your government.')
