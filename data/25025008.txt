It becomes an extension of your brain, leaving your primary brain free to relax and focus on whatever you&#x27;re currently doing, even if -- especially if -- you&#x27;re not doing anything in the present moment. But this doesn&#x27;t happen if the system is leaky, i.e. you slip up and start tracking some TODOs in your head.')
