I get that those are hot button issues for many people but here I really think it&#x27;s just a small joke because, as you point out, obviously the distribution of fossils has very little to do with gender politics.<p>That being said if you want to take it more seriously sometime sexist bias does taint research in unexpected places, such as expecting that certain tools would&#x27;ve been used by males instead of females for no real reason for instance.
