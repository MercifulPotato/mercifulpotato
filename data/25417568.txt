Item(by='evgen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607954429, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25416993, text='Yes, whenever you see someone wax nostalgic for some golden era in the past when everything was better you can be absolutely certain that this was a period when the group they most strongly identify with was in power and able to exert undue influence over everyone else.<p>Why were they able to have those debates and then go have a beer?  I am guessing it was because the stakes were low or abstract and did not have a direct impact on their life (like when you are the mid-20s upper middle-class white male that the OP clearly was during this golden age...) or because they could afford to simply ignore the other side after the debate because there was no risk to their personal position of privilege.  What annoys this person is not the conflict, but the possibility that they might face consequences -- consequences are something for &#x27;the other&#x27; to deal with and certainly not something that they should ever need to consider.')
