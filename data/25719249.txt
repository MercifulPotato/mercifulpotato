Everything is stupidly implemented and more on ego&#x2F;click bait designs than on real engineering and study of the needs and impacts.<p>If you ask common Parisians that have to live and work there (ie not the rich ones and foreigners living in the center),they will tell you that life is hell now in Paris.<p>And that is a lot worse since a few years as Hidalgo took random political decisions without really consulting impacted people.<p>For exemple she rebuilt place de la Republique and Bastille main areas. There you don&#x27;t see greenery anymore but huge area of concrete. And that was done pretending to do a more eco friendly Paris.<p>Like this, for the champs de Mars in front of the Eiffel Tower. She planned to built an ephemeral palace to use for bullshit events related to next olympic games in Paris.\nFor building that, she took a major space of the existing park that she replaced with concrete and the situation at the place under the Eiffel Tower is not better.<p>Sadly I can only see this promotion link in english about the project:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;us.france.fr&#x2F;en&#x2F;paris&#x2F;article&#x2F;grand-palais-structure-wilmotte&#x2F;amp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;us.france.fr&#x2F;en&#x2F;paris&#x2F;article&#x2F;grand-palais-structure...</a><p>Still a link in French about the kind of horrors that they already did or are planning to do there:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fne-paris.fr&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;19&#x2F;le-champ-de-mars-et-les-pieds-de-la-tour-eiffel-engloutis-sous-le-beton&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fne-paris.fr&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;19&#x2F;le-champ-de-mars-et-les-pied...</a><p>So, make no mistake, the Champs Elys√©es and Concorde will have the same terrible futur despite what they are advertising in newspapers...')
