On one side, our free market should be able to allow any drivers to not work for any ride sharing company if they choose not to. On the other hand, the question I haven&#x27;t been able to answer is if they truly have viable options or if the workers understand they are making under minimum wage. It&#x27;s hard to balance between the freedom of choice and regulations to protect the people. At one point we (as in the US) decided child labor is unacceptable at the expense of household income dropping for the benefit of the future. Likewise, how much regulation are we willing to impose on the private market for the benefit of the workers and are there national growth consequences. I&#x27;m not sure how this will play out but it will be interesting to see.')
