HR fires them, or some other entity, whichever has the power and permission, does so.<p>In the end, no matter what example you will pick it will always have the same kind of problem, that a higher entity is needed. And in the cases where that is not true, no encapsulation is needed. For example, &quot;employee.age()&quot;. You can just do &quot;olderEmployee = copy(employee, age = employee.age + 1)&quot; (pseudocode) from the outside by having the age exposed (which is not classical OOP at all).<p>But I&#x27;m curious if you can find a counter example. Usually it stops working when global constraints come in.')
