Their comparative advantage is <i>economical</i> efficiency, which does far more damage than small scale agriculture. They are not <i>ecologically</i> efficient, which is what people mean when they talk about &quot;saving the planet.&quot; (Medium to long term they&#x27;re not economically efficient either - see the entire history of modern agriculture).<p>Trading human labor for machine labor and increasing density (land use efficiency) is what got us into this mess in the first place. With integrative pest control, crop rotation, and composting a small farm can get well within the ballpark of industrialized farming without contributing further to our planet&#x27;s decline (source: eight acres). Yes, it&#x27;s &quot;inefficient&quot; by some arbitrary measure that makes no sense now that we&#x27;re past 400 PPM.<p>If anyone thinks we can survive the coming few centuries without some significant strategic deindustrialization or that any small group of people or issues will &quot;save the planet&quot;, they&#x27;re deluding themselves. Growing your own food, when done correctly on a few acres (especially if you grow your own meat), is one of the best ways to contribute now. We just have to throw away the efficiency metrics that got us here in the first place - it&#x27;s our labor or the planet.')
