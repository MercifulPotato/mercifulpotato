It&#x27;s blunted, it&#x27;s like touching things with gloves on. So there is some sort of vividness of ideas, but it&#x27;s hard to describe.<p>I think people who claim they can visualize something don&#x27;t actually pixel for pixel visualize it. I read about some study where these people only realized this when followup questions came. I think you can excite your neurons to represent the visual concept of a house without having to expend all the effort to actually create all the parts, decide on the color of window frames, all the small details.<p>Overall I&#x27;m torn. I guess there are differences and we should listen to descriptions like these. On the other hand, I also know how unreflective and un-introspective average people can be.')
