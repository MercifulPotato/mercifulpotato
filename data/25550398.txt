Also, the Buy phase only starts after the Action phase has ended. ABC (Action, Buy, Cleanup).<p>Once you&#x27;ve drawn your entire deck and need to draw more, then the discard pile is shuffled to form a new deck. Once that&#x27;s drawn too you&#x27;ll be left with an empty deck, no discard pile, and the rest of the cards left in either your hand or playing area.')
