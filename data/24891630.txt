All of that abstract theoretical stuff is certainly fascinating but it&#x27;s never seemed worth all the bother to me.<p>On the other hand, in SML you get all the benefits of strong HM type inference&#x2F;checking, immutability by default, etc, etc.. while also still being able to just `print` something or modify arrays in place. SML&#x27;s type system isn&#x27;t higher-order like Haskell&#x27;s so its solution to the same problem Haskell solves with type classes isn&#x27;t quite as elegant but otherwise SML is the C to Haskell&#x27;s C++.')
