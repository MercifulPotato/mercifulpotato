Item(by='mthoms', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607210064, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25306784, text='Google claims to not associate the data with particular users (it&#x27;s anonymized), but there&#x27;s nothing to stop it from using the data to know how popular certain sites or pages are, what region(s) visitors are coming from, and what user agents (browsers) are being used. And so on.<p>Let me ask you a similar question. Is there any evidence whatsoever that Google built this service out of the goodness of their hearts, and have no intent of using it to gain any sort of competitive advantage?<p>And if you <i>do</i> believe that, is there any evidence that Google will continue to spend millions of dollars supporting a service that gives them zero benefit? What does their track record say about that?<p>For the record, I&#x27;m not anti-Google, nor ultra privacy focused. I just think it&#x27;s common sense that Google expects some sort of ROI here. To many, using Google fonts is considered a fair exchange (especially given that their data is anonymized) and I think that&#x27;s a perfectly reasonable position. But make no mistake, there is a clear benefit to Google here.')
