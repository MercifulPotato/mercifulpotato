Silly me, I tried to be &quot;reliable&quot; and choose a samsung - you know the largest manufacturer of Android phones, and when that didn&#x27;t work out for me I tried Google - the people who make the software. If your advice to people is to avoid all of the premier manufacturers, I think that shows that the ecosystem has major problems, no?')
