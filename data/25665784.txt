When he says something, there would be a few people commenting on it and analysing it. This someone could be someone from CNN&#x2F;FOX&#x2F;Breitbart etc, so anyone can choose their own moderator that they trust.<p>This is essentially removing the unchecked propaganda channel of a politician that is causing real life problems.')
