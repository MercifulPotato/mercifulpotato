Item(by='slevir', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607055472, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25284092, text='Well, Japan also has this thing that a written contract isn&#x27;t even needed to start employer-employee relationship, oral agreement is technically enough, difficult to prove of course so everyone does written contracts, but still.<p>Regarding details, well, there is a list of things mandated by law to be included in the offer, they include things like salary, hours, list of additional allowances (手当), though not necessarily all of them, retirement pay and such, so you should be able to receive that information without even asking. In my, albeit not very numerous, experiences in one case I&#x27;ve got something called 雇用契約書兼労働条件通知書 (&quot;Employment Contract And Notice Of Working Conditions&quot;) , which included all the details, and in the other case I&#x27;ve got a separate 雇用契約書 (Employment contract), which included generic things like &quot;you work for me, I pay you for that, don&#x27;t go spreading company secrets around&quot;, and 労働契約書 (Labor contract), which included all the details like salary and whatnot.\nI should probably note, however, that I&#x27;ve only asked for and received these things after we were finished with all the interviews and reached a 内定 (the employer making an internal decision to hire the worker. It&#x27;s nothing official, just a word to describe the state of the person(s) responsible being okay with the idea). I just politely asked for documents to review before I make my final decision, and while I&#x27;ve never received 授業規則 even after asking, they happily obliged with contracts and documents related to how the company decides on employee&#x27;s salaries. I think there&#x27;s a lot more resistance to bother with contracts and whatnot when they don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re willing to work with them in principle or not.<p>As for &quot;how stock options work&quot;, well, while it&#x27;s probably nice on the side of employer to entertain such a question and while it&#x27;s probably reasonable to give an answer along the lines of &quot;erm, these are stock options of this and that type, these additional conditions apply, google please?&quot;, ending the job application process right there is probably overreacting.<p>I also feel it&#x27;s important to note that 就業規則 is not really &quot;a detailed contract&quot;, because it&#x27;s not a contract, it&#x27;s more of a &quot;Labor rules&quot; for the company, so it does count as an internal document and not for outsiders&#x27; eyes. Obviously, the rules must conform to the law and as someone has already noted they must be easily accessible to workers, which was always the case for me. In fact I have always received a hard copy of these on my first day.')
