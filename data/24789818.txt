Your register file (really, reorder buffer) either needs to add more write ports to it, or you need a state machine to complete that clean-up over multiple cycles.<p>Without that instruction, your hardware design could have assumed that reverting state can always be done in one cycle. That makes the hardware implementation easier.')
