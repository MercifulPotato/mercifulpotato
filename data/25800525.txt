If Rust&#x27;s goal was to provide the best convenient web library, rewriting language internals would have been put on the back burner in order to focus on building the web library. However, that is not the Rust project&#x27;s goal, so it was reasonable for people to choose to focus on something else instead.<p><i>&gt; Nothing comparable occurred wrt.
