If I bought 1 stock for $100 this year I&#x27;m better off with the 20&#x2F;80 split than a trade commission.  Conversely, if I bought 10,000 shares @ $100 I would be better off paying a commission and getting a 80&#x2F;20 split.<p>It&#x27;s also not clear what&#x27;s better for the consumer.  If I&#x27;m paying a commission then I have to trade sub-optimally in order to batch trades.  Maybe I&#x27;m better off being able to make a trade for free when I need it even if it costs me more in fees.<p>(2) This seems like an odd standard.  I can take 20% as a rebate because everyone else does, but I can&#x27;t take 80% because no one else does that.  So maybe I can take 25% or maybe 30% or maybe 35% and that&#x27;s ok.  Where exactly is the line?<p>And if someone launches a competitor called Jesse James and they take 80% does that mean Robinhood is now ok?  Or is two not enough?  And if two is not enough then how many does it take?')
