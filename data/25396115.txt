All the long term studies are being skipped. So long as this vaccine is a choice, I&#x27;m okay with it. But if it becomes required for certain jobs, or to be able to enter a store or venue ... I dunno. The speed that this has been rushed through just does not feel right.<p>I would rather wait 5 years. I prefer that risk for myself over the risk of a rushed to market vaccine. The trouble is, everyone will yell that you not getting the shot can hurt everyone else.<p>This gets into the dangerous game of personal agency, liberty and autonomy vs what the State is telling you is mandatory for the safety of all. There won&#x27;t be enough doses for this to matter for a while, but when it does, we&#x27;ll see some big ethical concerns and court cases.')
