It will restore ICU capacity, and open-up hospitals again, so that those with immunocompromised conditions (alongside a hell of a lot of other conditions) will finally be able to get in to see their doctor. It will also stop <i>killing their doctors.</i><p>I assure you that your immunocompromised friends and family will benefit <i>significantly</i> from getting people vaccinated, in the same way that they currently benefit from vaccination campaigns surrounding seasonal influenza. Not only that, I&#x27;m sure your severely immunocompromised friends and family will appreciate actually being able to get their hands on N95s again.<p>If your friends and family are <i>that</i> immunocompromised, you should be wearing a mask around them anyway, because they&#x27;re very vulnerable to a hell of a lot more bugs that you could be toting around than just SARS-Cov-2 .<p>But, understand that if you live in the United States, there are thousands and thousands of people dying <i>every day</i> from a raging, uncontrolled pandemic that a significant percentage of the population has chosen to simply ignore. <i>I am not the enemy here man.</i> If you think the enemy is someone on HackerNews who actually takes the time to read the papers you cite, you need to take a trip to an Oklahoma WalMart.<p>Remember, I&#x27;m not the guy you need to convince to be cautious. I&#x27;m the guy advocating the public health benefits of vaccination, not the guy running around telling people that masks are for pussies and that vaccines will give you autism. You have to have a sense of perspective about this whole thing.<p>These vaccines are <i>awesome.</i> They are literally a wonder of modern biotechnology. This technology is pretty much completely novel! This is a net plus for the entire human species.')
