Keep in mind, Lower quality comes with a lower price, so it makes sense for some brands, and some products. The reason people dont get a positive return on low quality ad placement is that they often use the same ad, or adverse the same product as for the higher quality ad placement. These ads and product often needs to be tailored for that specific placement.')
