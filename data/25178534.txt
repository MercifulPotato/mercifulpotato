No republic can afford the luxury of not doing so. If voting is in question, the very foundation of governmental legitimacy is in question. I want everyone to be able to accept that the results were legitimate and that assertions of lack of integrity were given best effort attempts at investigation and resolution which means bringing everyone to the table, like it or not, and laying it all out for God and Everyone.<p>Further, to all those up thread who see the Electoral College as a mere formality, that Elector, unless legislation in your State of questionable Federal Constitutionality, has not one reason to abdicate their right to go Faithless. The Faithless Elector is a feature, not a bug, and was never intended by the Founders to be influenced by some external covenant with what at the end of the day is a private, national scale, highly politically motivated organiztion, that in no way whatsoever is connected or a given with regards to the United States. People need to realize how broken the Two-Party system is, and what ills that two party division creates. As long as those two parties believe their survival or continued legitimacy is free from challenge, there is no end to the issues we&#x27;ll run into.<p>Finally we are not a democracy. We&#x27;re a Union of States arranged as a group of Constitutional Republics with a Federal Constitutional Republic with a highly restricted and largely explicitly defined jurisdiction to handle issues of an interstate nature.')
