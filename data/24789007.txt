It turned out the firing pin was assembled backwards for it to be used in a play. (The police took apart the gun and put to back together to charge her; it&#x27;s in the evidence documents)<p>Along with never pointing your gun at something you don&#x27;t want to destroy, you always assume a gun is loaded.  That&#x27;s not just a gun <i>you</i> pickup, that&#x27;s any gun anywhere.  If someone else is holding it then it&#x27;s loaded too.<p>&gt;  In fact, nothing they did was criminal. They were in a gated neighborhood, people ripped the iron gate down, and I think it&#x27;s clear they were reasonably defending their homes.<p>Bullshit.  Brandishing is a crime in pretty much every US state and Canadian province.  There are affirmative defenses to Brandishing, like real physical threats to life or property, but that gate was <i>community</i> property and not theirs alone.<p>I could see them getting out of the charges and having enough reasonable doubt to do so.  Right now it&#x27;s being leveraged as a kulturekamf headline to make 2nd Amendment nuts get angry.<p>But make no mistake, if you point a real gun at people, with a finger on the trigger, you&#x27;re implying you&#x27;re going to kill someone.  You&#x27;d better have a damned good reason for it, and be ready to stand to any consequences; &quot;judged by a jury instead of by St. Peter&quot;, etc.')
