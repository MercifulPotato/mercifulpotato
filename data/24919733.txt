That&#x27;s where it has the most value for me, taking over for the long boring hauls.<p>On the freeway you minimize a lot of those wildcards like bikes and pedestrians, everyone is going about the same speed, and there are only a few places you can enter and exit.<p>We don&#x27;t need to jump all the way to self driving in SF, and have people point out all the things that can go wrong, since theres a huge gain just from being able to do it on the freeway.')
