Even if it happens that there&#x27;s an equivalence between today and 1450, a shoemaker in 2000 would be earning 8 times more.<p>EDIT: To put it another way, over the last 20 years the Dollar, Euro and Pound have all approximately averaged out to their target 2% inflation rate. Prices in gold terms have averaged to 9% deflation per year. Since 9 &gt; 2, gold is less stable than modern fiat currencies.')
