Are you claiming combating gay male promiscuity is beneficial for society?<p>&gt;Ironically SSM wasn&#x27;t something to worry about because the people who want or need it are small enough a population not to impact anything in practice; it was more of an ideological issue it seems.<p>I disagree.  Freedom, for populations small or big, for actions that have no effect on anyone else is very important to worry about it.  And I don&#x27;t see what can be wrong with that ideological issue, unless you&#x27;re anti freedom.<p>&gt;As for climate change, yeah my point is if we do identity politics now, over things which are let or let live, what is going to happen when there are things that we cannot do so? I think it will ramp up more even.<p>With any limited resource (such as the global environment and natural resources like clean water and air), the ones with power will end up with most of it, and the people alive have more power than the people that have yet to be born.<p>The only identity politics that matter in the climate change situation is those who will consume today or those who will sacrifice today.  But I predict this will be an unsolvable problem due to lack of buy in from the global population, for variety of reasons.')
