But the question of numerical stability is not solved specially for later times.<p>In physics it is natural to start from an initial state and integrate through time, starting from initial time and evolving by time-stepping.<p>Physics helps but this doesn&#x27;t prevent the emergence of numerical instabilities like a big-computer being built.<p>So if you were running a universe simulation, when a life form start to emerge and starts building a big computer you can &quot;erase&quot; them from existence by approximating them away.<p>When your simulation starts crawling to an halt, you modify locally the current phases at the time of the modification so that the alien go extinct, and you propagate backwards in time towards the origin of the universe, to find the initial parameters of the simulation that when inputted make the alien never be a problem in the first place while not modifying too much the rest of the universe at current time.<p>From the perspective of a being inside the universe, the only thing we could observe by such a parameter search on the spaces of possible universe, are being amazed at how some constants of the universe seem to be fine-tuned.')
