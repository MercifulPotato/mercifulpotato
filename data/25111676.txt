Dell and Lenovo are pretty popular choices.  Dell will pre install and I think Lenovo does now.  I think desktops are easier to do your own install.<p>I bought a system 76 which comes with Linux (Ubuntu or Popos). I’m using pop and things work (jet brains, bitwig, I compiled unreal engine..).<p>Those machines are rebranded clevos (so they say) but I know drivers will work. Build quality is decent but the machine has lasted. It’s been good and pretty much maintenance free. The os updates frequently.<p>My only complaint is the machine has 2 video cards and will only drive externals with the nvidia one. Switching requires a reboot.  The battery life isn’t great when driving the nvidia card.  Maybe the new ones fixed this (onyx pro)')
