From an outsider perceptive (European) he seems neither an extremist nor a white nationalist. He is a nationalist for sure, but I have never heard Trump talk about people grouping them by skin colour, unlike Obama. I have only heard Trump talk about &quot;Americans&quot; and he divides that into the left or right.')
