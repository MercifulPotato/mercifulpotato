Item(by='monopoledance', descendants=None, kids=[25973105], score=None, time=1612039573, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25971255, text='&gt; buy seems very sensible advice.<p>It is. However, I think the situation right now is a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma where this type of &quot;snitching&quot; means most people will lose. If nobody sells, a lot of people will win and the hedgefonds will lose.<p>The hedgefonds are very much trying to provoke &quot;sensible&quot; decisions at all costs right now. They need people to be predictable and afraid.<p>&gt; How disconnected from reality of using the stock market as money making vehicles rather than investing in the success of underlying companies is what&#x27;s on display and needs to be shaken up.<p>This. WSB isn&#x27;t the problem, they just highlight it. The naked shortselling is the malicious part. The hedgefonds weren&#x27;t just speculating against GME, they were inducing Gamespot bankruptcy. <i>That</i> is fucked up. <i>That</i> shouldn&#x27;t be allowed. Nobody should be allowed to bet on someone losing, especially if they got all-powerful money at their hands. I think most people just don&#x27;t realize how much a billion dollars really is:  More than 1,600,000 stimulus checks. And they game with it like it&#x27;s nothing.')
