I don&#x27;t have a dog, but I liked your site, story, and product. Glad to hear it&#x27;s going well.<p>By the way, one significant issue I just noticed: if I visit your site on a phone, the name of the company is not visible anywhere near the top of the page. I see the logo has the company name, but it&#x27;s tiny and not able to be read.')
