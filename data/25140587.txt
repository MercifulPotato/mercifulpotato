Also, most internet comments are objections to something, and when the thread is blank, the only thing there to object to is the article.<p>After that, other comments show up to object to the objections. These tend to get upvoted, and that explains the paradox of why so often the top comment says something like &quot;I don&#x27;t understand why everyone here is so negative&quot;.<p>The main thing to understand is that this has nothing to do with the topic! It&#x27;s a generic effect of the forum mechanism and group psychology.')
