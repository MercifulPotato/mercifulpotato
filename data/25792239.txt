My family is something like 15 generations into being Americans in the south, and if there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve learned, it&#x27;s that we don&#x27;t understand each other at all. In fact, I&#x27;m always amused at how commonly I encounter sentiment of &quot;I don&#x27;t understand the mindset of anyone who lives anywhere other than here or why they would live somewhere else&quot; (with &quot;here&quot; being a region of approximately 15 counties in western part of North Carolina). Even my younger cousins, who have traveled a bit and lived their whole life with the internet have said the same.<p>I&#x27;m the odd-duck for having lived in Seattle for 5 years. But I eventually moved back of course - because if I&#x27;m being honest with myself: <i>Even I don&#x27;t understand the mindset of anyone who lives anywhere other than here or why they would live somewhere else</i>.')
