It may be technically correct in some domain, but this isn&#x27;t it.  Healthcare systems are there to provide healthcare for people, and if they can&#x27;t do that (as in this situation) then they are incapable of handling it.  In addition (in the UK at least, can&#x27;t speak for anywhere else), this has led to not only ICU capacity being exceeded, but also routine healthcare being diminished - either because of people being unable to visit a hospital, or unwilling to do so.')
