That was the case before the internet took hold in the 90&#x27;s, during the rapid economic growth of the 50&#x27;s, in the Renaissance, the heights of the Roman Empire...<p>Yes, that does not mean we shouldn&#x27;t look back on the things in the past that were good &amp; now are not. But if a wholesale reversion to a past time was possible, we would still find the golden parts of that earlier age to be apportioned to some, but not others.<p>Another consideration is that while I don&#x27;t like life inside a panopticon, its absence in the 90&#x27;s meant those of us fortunate to be &quot;golden&quot; simply had less awareness of those who weren&#x27;t, hence the false impression that perhaps there was a lot more gold everywhere.')
