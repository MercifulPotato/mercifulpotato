You&#x27;d be supporting Apple and this means that (if lots of people have this behavior) the competition falls even more behind. There might come a day when there will be no more exploits left on Apple hardware, and then we&#x27;re stuck with the choice of going to the competition which might then be worse because of the shortsightedness in our purchasing behavior, or buying into Apple&#x27;s walled garden.<p>Making purchases based on marginally better products (following the gradient of quality) may be satisfying in the moment, but is not very wise on the long term.')
