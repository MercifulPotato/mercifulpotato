That is because competition is being prevented.<p>&gt; Other companies have a similar revenue share<p>Except for epic! They charge 12%. So that is one specific example right there, that would reduce the fee below the current fee that Apple charges.<p>All I need is a singular example to prove my point. And we have that example. Epic&#x27;s app store is being prevented, and they charge less money.<p>&gt; It will help developers but it wouldn&#x27;t necessarily reduce the prices<p>Even if you are willing to ignore basic economic theory completely by saying it would have no effect on price, giving more money to developers indirectly helps consumers even if prices stay exactly the same.<p>It helps them because more resources can be spent on the game to make it better.<p>And to go even further, even if such benefits don&#x27;t exist, it is still better to give the money to the people who made the game, who I think deserve that money more than Apple.')
