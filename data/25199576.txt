I lived in a 4 person house with a 1 TB cap and for the last 3 months we lived there, we were over the cap routinely.<p>Editing to add context:<p>This happened in 2018. The cap started a couple of years before that and 1 TB seemed reasonable but content sizes grew and grew until we had to ration Netflix usage and game downloads. We were literally making the decision, &quot;should I watch YouTube today or do I want to watch Netflix tomorrow.&quot; I don&#x27;t think Comcast needs to lower the limit. Growing content sizes will be happy to reach the limit for them.')
