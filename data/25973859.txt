However, sometimes I&#x27;d feel nappish, and just fake it.  Close your eyes, slow your breathing, focus your attention on the sound of your breath.  After 20 minutes, get up.  That never failed for me.<p>I&#x27;m a bit older now, and I can actually fall asleep in midday naps.  Sometimes.  But I still feel energized after a nap, sleep or no.<p>For nighttime, I refuse to fail to sleep.  When I start yawning, it&#x27;s my bedtime, and I&#x27;m out like a light.  If I try to sleep but I&#x27;m still bored 10 minutes in, it&#x27;s not time yet.  I&#x27;ve learned that if I try for an hour, I&#x27;ll still be trying come morning.')
