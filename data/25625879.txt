Or don&#x27;t understand the point of Coke or Mercedes Benz ads are for? Coke establishes themselves as the defacto soda. There is no other soda, or if they are, wish they were coke.<p>MB ads among other things reinforce to MB owners the wisdom and luxury of their brand. To own an MB is to be part of a club, one that is advertised across the media spectrum. If MB didn&#x27;t advertise at all, they would either become another commodity brand, or have to be so luxury that only word of mouth is necessary (Bently, etc).<p>Now, maybe that&#x27;s what cortesoft is saying &quot;get you to waste money&quot; but if it got you to waste money on their product, it worked.')
