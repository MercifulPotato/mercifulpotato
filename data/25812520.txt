Even the venerable Vim drops the ball hard here, with the various &quot;widgets&quot; it uses in its interface which have slightly different semantics and behaviours.<p>Perhaps I don&#x27;t understand emacs well enough, but I know that every file loaded in vim can be accessed via its buffer  number.  How it&#x27;s displayed depends on the window and tab layout. Quickfix, help, and terminal buffers behave differently, but the vast majority of buffers are just associated with open files.')
