It&#x27;s not; it&#x27;s only superior if you aren&#x27;t willing to maintain great history as you work on a given branch.<p>Of course there are also added benefits to a fine-grained history, as the article mentions.<p>My experience having maintained a production app with a fine-grained semantic history for 5 years is overwhelmingly positive. Understanding root causes, confidently reverting things etc becomes a much quicker job - particularly important when production is red.')
