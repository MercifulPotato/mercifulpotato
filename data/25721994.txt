Many “conspiracy” theories have proved true, e.g. the CIA’s insane antics in the 50s-80s.<p>We don’t have a Committee of Truth that determines what is true and therefore legally speakable.<p>If facts or alleged facts drive people to violence, that is the responsibility of those engaged directly in violence (or actually inciting it).<p>Incitement in America is basically: “let’s go burn down that building right now”. “As a moral matter, someone ought to burn down that building” is protected speech.')
