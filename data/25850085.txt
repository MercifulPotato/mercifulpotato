The publisher of Avalon also has a sci-fi setting with a bunch of similar traitor mechanic games in Resistance, Coup, One Night Ultimate Resistance, etc.<p>A thing to point out as mentioned way above, the issue with any traitor mechanic game is that while they can be great fun, involve a lot of exploration of social dynamics, they are also not really good at <i>team building</i> because they require at least some of you to lie&#x2F;cheat&#x2F;back-stab.<p>As a designated owner&#x2F;bringer of several traitor mechanic board games, in the before times, I&#x2F;we had a general rule that traitor mechanic were &quot;first thing in the game night&quot; games, and should if possible generally be followed by a true coop game (things like Hanabi or Pandemic) or a silly judge game (such as Apples-to-Apples or Action Cats), in order to avoid certain types of after-game drama, cleanse the palates a bit, and do a bit of a cooldown&#x2F;after-care.<p>Unfortunately, traitor mechanic games are generally very easy to do remotely in a video chat while a lot of the pure coop games are &quot;us versus the board&quot; that are tougher to do remotely. Some of them have great videogame adaptations, but in videogame form lose some of the intimacy you&#x27;d want from a good video chat, and also often give all the information to every player at all times which only encourages the types of coop players that like to run the entire game and play everyone&#x27;s turn as min-maxed as possible.')
