I think the real fight for America will be in pushing back against Wilsonianism enough to drastically shift the overton window in domestic and foreign policy, lest we suffer the consequences of not doing so. That said, to fix a lock that is broken, you have to understand how it works... so I find a lot of value in understanding exactly &quot;how&quot; Wilsonianism took hold so deeply, so quickly. The added complication is the major changes in the banking and monetary system since then also, I mean from that era we go from the creation of the fed, to the bretton woods system, to ww2 and later Nixons move towards the petrodollar. These are all major shifts in the backbone of any nation, empire or not, so a lot of my effort is trying to understand those things as well. I recently came across a particularly insightful talk by Yanis Varoufakis that really condensed a lot of these things well, you might check it out if thats the sort of thing that interests you.[1]<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gGeevtdp1WQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gGeevtdp1WQ</a>')
