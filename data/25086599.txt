When the left does it, they claim it&#x27;s to fight fascism.  I know right wing fascists.  They know exactly what they are, and will openly defend it as &quot;necessary evil.&quot;  One need only read comments on censorious sites (like this one) to see that the left wing will silence their enemies and call it freedom, strike their adversaries and call it self defense, convict on hearsay and call it justice.<p>A man who willingly turns himself into a monster because he believes he must is a scary thing, but will hardly become a full on movement.  For that, the monsters must believe they are not such.  This is why the left are the real fascist threat, but the feigned pseudo intellectual zeitgeist of this place will never see such a truth.')
