People are buying stock to profit off of a short squeeze or to hurt the short sellers. Some people believe GameStop will go up and others think it&#x27;s an opportunity to profit off of a naturally occurring short squeeze and others think it&#x27;s a way to hurt the hedge funds. None of that is manipulation.<p>By contrast preventing a million people from buying a stock at a critical moment is clearly manipulation.<p>&quot;Although some short squeezes may occur naturally in the market, a scheme to manipulate the price or availability of stock in order to cause a short squeeze is illegal.&quot;')
