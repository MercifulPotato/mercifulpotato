I had a few playlists that I grew over time, and it&#x27;s annoying to go back and see gaps of &quot;[Deleted video]&quot; where your favorites used to be. I&#x27;m curious to know if you&#x27;ve found a solution for this.<p>Personally I&#x27;ve started locally saving anything I think I would want to watch or reference again. When favoriting something or saving it to a playlist, I download it too. I started off with using youtube-dl on the command line and have experimented with the &quot;Import from YouTube&quot; function on Peertube but ended up with a tiny cobbled-together video platform, importer (youtube-dl wrapper), and Firefox extension. I think the next step will be easily saving non-video things - probably recording WARCs?')
