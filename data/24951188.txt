Item(by='tsimionescu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604150110, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24950188, text='First of all, all of your examples just show that someone living for minimum wage in the US is actually making way more than 42 USD&#x2F;day  ((7.25 USD * 40h work week) &#x2F; 7 days) by the WB standards, as all those additional protections are counted in the adjusted income. How would the poverty stats look if you took extreme poverty to be 40 USD&#x2F;day?<p>Secondly, you can live off the land and still live in a country with a functional health system. I&#x27;m not discussing nomad hunter-gatherers here, just people who don&#x27;t live off a wage, like traditional farmers and rural tribes (who still have money from trading their goods for example, and can live pretty wealthy lives, but contribute disproportionately little to GDP).<p>Overall the point was that people can and have been living outside of any standard of poverty for a long time in areas that nominally have very little GDP per capita, and are often getting counted as extreme poverty in stats older than 1981.<p>Related to medical coverage, I was thinking more along the lines of cancer or serious chronic diseases, not acute poisoning or broken limbs. The kind of diseases that not only cost serious money to overcome in a privatized health system, but also destroy your ability to work and earn money when you&#x27;re whole livelihood is dependent on a wage - even if Medicaid can cove the direct medical expenses.')
