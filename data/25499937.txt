Item(by='ryandrake', descendants=None, kids=[25500130], score=None, time=1608586882, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25499749, text='&gt; The user&#x27;s interests are frequently poorly represented.<p>The user&#x27;s interests <i>should</i> be looked after by the browser. A true &quot;user agent&quot; should act on behalf of the user&#x27;s preferences, fetching only what the user says they need, and rendering it in a manner that the user wants, not necessarily how the web developer wants. We&#x27;ve gotten far away from this ideal over the years, with browsers ceding more and more control to web developers. Users have lesser and lesser say as to how their browsers render web sites, to the point where we now just have super-blunt instruments like ad blockers and &quot;Disable javascript&quot;.<p>If a web site is too slow, or choked with ads, or doesn&#x27;t use an accessible color scheme, or uses a font too small, I want <i>my browser</i> to do something about it. I don&#x27;t want to have to rely on the web developer (or Google) to adopt my own preferences. And if my browser even allows this, the function should be easy to use, not buried deep in Settings.')
