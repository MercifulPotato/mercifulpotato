I don’t really require that particular “you should talk to people” lecture, thanks.<p>I’m nowhere remotely close to the USA.  I know very few people who are able to vote in the USA, and none of those people voted for Trump.  Asking people online, as I did, is my only real option.<p>Anyhow, thanks for the answer.  Got it;  ‘murder’ of unborn theoretical children is worse than separating and losing track of actual real objectively alive, conscious, and suffering children.  (Only as long as they’re brown, presumably?  You don’t actually say that, but I assume that’s the intent?) And also, simply voting for a Democrat is worse, too.  Got it.<p>I’ll be sure to keep those worse things in mind and not be at all insulted that you think I have a lot in common with that worldview.')
