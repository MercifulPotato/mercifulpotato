I then troll around looking for companies that make products that might fit some of the patents I just bought.<p>That fits my understanding of patent trolls&#x27; behavior. What I still don&#x27;t understand is, why is this seen as worse than e.g. a streaming service like Funimation&#x2F;Sony buying up exclusive rights to anime that other entities have created, and then Funimation&#x2F;Sony sues other website that continue to stream those videos?<p>My best guess is that because the USPTO has issued patents that seem unjustifiably broad&#x2F;vague, it&#x27;s harder to be certain that you&#x27;re not violating some patent, than to be sure that you&#x27;re not violating someone&#x27;s copyright. But if that&#x27;s really the reason, it still seems to me like the real villain here is the USPTO &#x2F; U.S. Congress. Because (to my current way of thinking), they created the business landscape that rewards this kind of behavior.')
