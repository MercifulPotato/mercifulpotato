I’ve personally never used them, so they just slipped my mind.<p>2 &amp; 3 are certainly different in their starting properties, but from a stove perspective they seem to be the same, at least today. My MSR Whisperlite Universal can consume isopro, white gas, kerosene, or in a real emergency auto gas. The only difference between the three appears to be the shape of the brass nozzle that sprays the heated &amp; pressurized fuel into the mixing chamber. Although for the reasons you listed, I obviously would prefer Naptha if I was planning ahead, since it’s easier to get going in a dire situation.')
