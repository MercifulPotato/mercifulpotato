That&#x27;s a total no-brainer.<p>That&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve been thought but it&#x27;s not a no brainer at all. Context matters, but you disregard it and only focus on the lines of code, just as the author of the comment you respond to is saying people do.<p>You&#x27;re building a marketing page that&#x27;s not gonna be updated after completed and only gonna be valid for X days? Sure, the code doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>You&#x27;re trying to build a fast and slim UI that&#x27;s gonna be deployed on routers and possibly loaded on low-power devices? You better care about every single line that gets loaded on the device.<p>I&#x27;m not saying dependencies are always wrong. I&#x27;m also not saying it&#x27;s always right. I&#x27;m saying why you need the dependency and the quality of the code it includes is important to consider, and knee-jerk reactions of &quot;of course I&#x27;d use it&quot; is hurting the profession more than the library reuse saves us currently.')
