You are putting the literal beating to death of a police officer on the same level as people taking their frustration out on an empty vehicle.  These two are in no way comparable.  That was the best you could do out of months of protests attended by millions of people in dozens of cities in which the protest was in direct opposition to police violence.  You can&#x27;t find anything approaching the violence seen on display on Wednesday.  Do you not see the difference?<p>&gt;PS. Also your video is a bit indistinct, I&#x27;m not sure it does show them beating a police officer who is on the ground<p>You can see them drag someone down the stairs in the first few seconds of the video and then you see them beating someone on the ground.  One man is literally beating an officer with an American flag if you are one for symbolism.  The next tweet in that thread shows a photo from above in which you can see the officer down on the steps and there is a reply that has video from a different angle.')
