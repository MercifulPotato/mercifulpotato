Item(by='throwaway894345', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605897527, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25163039, text='&gt; Let&#x27;s try your formulation in a different context and see if it works. Imagine someone saying this in the &#x27;50s<p>There are a number of enormous, relevant differences between these two groups, but more importantly I don&#x27;t see any good, enlightening dialog coming out of a comparison between the plights of Jim Crow era Blacks and anyone else. It&#x27;s like the converse of Godwin&#x27;s Law (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Godwin%27s_law" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Godwin%27s_law</a>).<p>&gt; I assure you, Christians are aware of how poorly they&#x27;re portrayed by the media, and aren&#x27;t happy about it. It seems to me that this is one of many factors that led many Christians to support Trump.<p>I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re &quot;happy&quot; about it, per se, but rather they&#x27;re not offended enough to object publicly to it. And to be clear, I&#x27;m <i>merely observing</i> that Christians aren&#x27;t as offended (or don&#x27;t express offense as much) as I think other groups would be. I&#x27;m leaving it up to the readers to interpret this as thick-skin or weak-will or something else (I&#x27;m certainly not intending to imply any particular interpretation).')
