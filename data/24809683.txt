At that point, the western RCT remdesivir trial added the &quot;hospital stay&quot; target, and lo-and-behold, shortly afterwards, it turned out that it does result in no less mortality but shorter hospital stay as well.<p>While it does give some credence to the &quot;shorter hospital stay&quot; result -- having reached it in to Gilead initiated RCTs -- It was statistically significant but not dramatic;<p>And now another trial says even that&#x27;s not so significant.')
