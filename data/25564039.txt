In demand people are tautologically treated well. It&#x27;s relatively easy to negotiate when you have bargaining power. A tech worker can simply tweet or post on HN and something will happen. Just look at Timnit Gebru or the poster in this very thread who petitioned a high-ranking employee at Stripe. For non-tech people this is inconceivable science-fiction. For them, regaining bargaining power implies mass unionization and social unrest. If your status is strongly diluted the response has to be proportionally strong to have any effect. It has happened before multiple times, which is the reason we can work 8 hours a day today and have some standard of rights as opposed to say the 19th century.<p>Technically you are quite correct: it&#x27;s up to non-tech people to decide to be treated better. But the reality behind that phrase hides a far more complicated reality than the mere words would imply. Just saying that you&#x27;d &quot;rather work in a field where people show basic respect&quot; completely elides the reality of the situation. It&#x27;s like telling a trucker who just got automated &quot;Well just learn some code and work harder, buddy!&quot;')
