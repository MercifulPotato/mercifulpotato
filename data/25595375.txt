I&#x27;m talking about the features for the consumer when they shop on a shopify based store.<p>Trust doesn&#x27;t scale naturally. That&#x27;s the point that the GP comment was making. What we saw with Amazon is that bundling[0] works and can scale, but once it reaches that point and trust erodes, then unbundling becomes more appealing to the consumer.<p>Shopify has struck an interesting middle ground. Lots of the features that make the bundle attractive (one login, saved CC&#x2F;details, etc.) are baked into Shopify stores. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see if Shopify rolls out some sort of &quot;Fulfilled by Shopify&quot; and then a &quot;Prime&quot; because then the consumer can ensure quick&#x2F;free delivery without dealing with the bazaar that is Amazon.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;a16z.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;08&#x2F;15&#x2F;a16z-podcast-the-topic-thats-lasted-the-entire-history-of-computing-bundling-and-unbundling&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;a16z.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;08&#x2F;15&#x2F;a16z-podcast-the-topic-thats-las...</a>')
