With measles and a r0 of 18, youd need an effectiveness of 95%. Considering not everyone can or will take a vaccine, the effectiveness needs to be higher than this.<p>Covid is apparently around 3, and if you can vaccinate 90% of the population then an effectiveness of 75% would be the minimum you could get away with.')
