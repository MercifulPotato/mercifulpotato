However, we have Trump&#x27;s own words: &quot;Russia, if you&#x27;re listening, I hope you find Hillary&#x27;s emails.&quot;<p>&gt; The Justice Dept spent millions thoroughly investigaing that claim and it turned out to be all lies.<p>The Mueller investigation paid for itself in civil forfeiture ($42-46m) after convicting Paul Manafort, Trump&#x27;s campaign manager of tax fraud, wire fraud and other financial crimes and got convictions of ten defendants. The only reason they did not indict Trump was in deference to a memo that the Justice department cannot indict a sitting president.')
