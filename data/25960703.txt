That figure is not a conspiracy theory: it is public information that the SEC releases monthly.<p>Whether hedge fund managers did make a call to their buddies is not the only thing in question here (although the SEC will surely determine the truth). Shorting a stock drives the price down and, while this is no less legal than buying a stock, the question is whether shorting 136% of the stock counts as outright manipulation. Reddit kids have done nothing but pop an artificial bubble, they did not participate in manipulation; as the hedge fund managers and their buddies claim.<p>&gt; QAnon<p>I have yet to see the baby cookbook or other evidence of their ridiculous claims.')
