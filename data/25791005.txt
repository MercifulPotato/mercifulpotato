If a newcomer created a simple but novel program and it turned out to be successful, two sure-to-follow requirements are:<p>- Now someone else wants to access and suggest changes to your project. In parallel. Without breaking anything.<p>- Now the software needs to be shared with others outside of the development environment.<p>Both create a surprising amount of complexity and require fourth- and fifth-dimensional thinking. You have to learn a version control system (probably)! You have to learn how to perform a code review! You have to do learn software design and hopefully documentation.<p>You have to learn and leverage at least one packaging ecosystem for the development approach that was chosen. Hopefully you chose one with an accessible packaging ecosystem, assuming that exists!')
