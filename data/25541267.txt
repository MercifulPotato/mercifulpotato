I have a lot of contact there, there is an outbreak of “severe pneumonia” for which no one is being tested for COVID despite being pretty obviously COVID. To make matters worse, in addition to not testing anybody with symptoms, the government hospitals have been turning people with these symptoms away so they are going to their family homes to be taken care of.<p>I would take the stories of Viet Nam’s “success” with a very large grain of salt. It should be impossible for me to know so many people with odd “severe pneumonia” there given that the entire country has nominally only had a thousand cases or so.')
