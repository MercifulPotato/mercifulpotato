My cofounder and I were once told by our patent attorney (himself a startup founder) that he views a patent application as a failure if the USPTO approves it on the first attempt, because that means he was too specific with his claims.<p>Frankly, as ugly as it sounds, I don&#x27;t blame the attorneys for working that angle. The patent system itself is structured in such a way as to reward gamesmanship.<p>Technologists are used to viewing clarity and conciseness as positive attributes for technical writing, but straightforwardness is kind of naive and undesirable in the patent world.')
