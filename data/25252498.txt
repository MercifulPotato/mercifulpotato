Yes, I get it, Apple has taken the world by storm - but let&#x27;s not forget, that Apple gets a lot of mileage from very few designs, probably  the same CPU core ends up in the iPhone, iPad, Apple TV and now the MacBook - with slight modifications.\nThis is the same, for Samsung, ARM,h Qualcomm, Intel, etc. - most of their CPU designs can be aimed at the market for servers, game consoles, smart devices, PCs, Notebooks, etc.\nIf AWS designs a server core, their entire market is AWS instances probably - not a small one by any means, but smaller than a dedicated CPU manufacturer&#x27;s, thus the sensible amount of investment they can make into CPU design is lower than that of a dedicated CPU manufacturer. I&#x27;m not saying it doesn&#x27;t make sense for them - it probably does - but it&#x27;s far too early to predict the demise of CPU companies.')
