We&#x27;re a b2b in the shipping space; our customers literally don&#x27;t care whether we&#x27;re running React or jQuery, Rails or ColdFusion, Node or old school PHP. They&#x27;ll notice if it runs slow, if things break, or if we take longer to crank out a promised feature. I love to nerd out, but I&#x27;m continually suppressing that part of my personality, because truth is, buzzword bingo isn&#x27;t my job. (At the same time, it&#x27;s not a matter of sticking to old technology, we just base our decisions on metrics other than HN posts or Github likes)')
