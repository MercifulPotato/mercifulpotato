The original post is misleading and I should have clarified this in my response above (I&#x27;m juggling a newborn ATM).<p>The Serverless Framework open-source experience does not do this.  But there are premium features, like Serverless Framework Components (which this post is actually referring to) which do this.<p>When you use these premium features you must log into the Serverless Framework SaaS offering via your CLI, accept a TOS, etc.<p>At the same time, we need to make sure our communication on these SaaS offerings and how they work is more clear.
