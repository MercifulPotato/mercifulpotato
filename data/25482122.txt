Item(by='kodt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608419050, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25479825, text='The two things you mentioned don&#x27;t really affect the gameplay at all. I guess if you were looking for a GTA style sandbox game where you could just cause chaos in the streets it does not satisfy that. But if you want to explore a huge detailed city and do quests&#x2F;mission etc.. it works really well.<p>The police spawning&#x2F;ai issue is really dumb when you encounter it, but as long as you aren&#x27;t trying to shoot random people in the street you don&#x27;t encounter it.<p>The traffic is mostly just background detail. Again if your goal is to create a big traffic jam ala GTA then it won&#x27;t be nearly as entertaining but in terms of just making it feel like you are in a living breathing city.. it gets the job done.<p>Many of the side missions are fairly detailed and interesting, it is fun just exploring the city and completing missions.')
