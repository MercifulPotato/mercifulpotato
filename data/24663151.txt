I have a &#x27;smart&#x27; TV myself and the only buttons I use on the remote are power and input select. It&#x27;s never seen the internet since I&#x27;ve had it.<p>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s only a matter of time before these TVs require &#x27;activation&#x27; and frequent &#x27;reactivation&#x27; before you can use them though. Alternatively they may perhaps start connecting to cellular networks, which would be a lot harder to evade.')
