The &quot;Feature table&quot; lists FP and SIMD as &quot;in extension&quot; but doesn&#x27;t do the same for Memory layout and protection.  It&#x27;s seems inconceivable to me that you would use paging in a WASM-replacement context.   Same for instruction length, two-byte instruction depends on the &quot;C&quot; extension.<p>- There is nothing that prevents RISC-V in the browser from denying the ability to generate code on the fly.  Just like, say iOS, it could run in a &quot;W^X&quot; model, that is, writable memory cannot be executed from.<p>- atomics, again, are part of an extension, the &quot;A&quot; extension.  They do not have to be included, and do not make sense IMO in a single-threaded WASM replacement context.<p>All that said, WASM is well designed.  The structured control flow is a bit painful for some producers and the lack of tail recursion elimination is criminal, but running running&#x2F;JITting RISC-V in the browser would almost certainly add more overhead.')
