During grad school I loved hacking my research on haskell.<p>But this doesn&#x27;t seem to be a consistent claim from the community. It&#x27;d be helpful if the core maintainers published this somewhere. Because I consistently get haskellers telling me that I&#x27;d be more productive as an engineer and my programs would have fewer errors if only I worked in Haskell.<p>Some other languages <i>do</i> have this sort of vision statement (or, at least a fairly well implied one) that makes it clear what they are offering and what they aren&#x27;t. C++ wants to give you speed and flexibility without overhead for things you aren&#x27;t using. That&#x27;s been consistent for decades.')
