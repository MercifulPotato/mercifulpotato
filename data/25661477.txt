The result is penny wise and pound foolish behavior that definitely does not correspond to the monetary or cultural success of the corporation.  People who are good at gaming the system in this can create their &quot;impact&quot;, collect the rewards, and make an internal transfer before the costs or superficiality of their &quot;impact&quot; catch up with them.')
