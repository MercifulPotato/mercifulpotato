But I still went back into OSX for Skype-for-Business calls (shudder).<p>For ages I was very happy Linux-on-MBP user.<p>And then OSX refused to upgrade to the next major version because the ssd was partitioned.<p>So I&#x27;m kinda wary of ever doing any stunt like partitioning the internal ssd again in the future.<p>But reading about dual-boot from external SSD makes me think &quot;when I get my M1, perhaps I can boot Linux from an external SSD&quot;.  That way I can still use OSX for the MS Office Suite when the web-version isn&#x27;t cutting it, kinda thing.<p>But is there any signing requirement for the external ssd boot-up?')
