If the worst penalty that can be imposed is &quot;our organization will consider you a baddy and won&#x27;t deal with you ever again&quot;, then the accused does not need as much protection as if their life or liberty was at stake.<p>However, there still has to be <i>some</i> standard of evidence and at least some reasonable due process - in this particular case it seems that the bar has been set <i>too</i> low and this might need to be changed.')
