Email from GoDaddy:<p><i>Brexit is coming, and it brings changes to .eu domains like (mydomain).eu</i><p>&quot;Now that the UK has voted to withdraw from the European Union, the registry for .eu domains (EURid) has decided to revoke domains registered to UK residents, and prevent them from purchasing new ones.<p>In light of this decision we will no longer offer .eu domains to UK residents. EURid may act as early as March 30, 2019, but the deadline might shift as Brexit negotiations continue.<p>You still have options, though. You can either update your registrant address to one outside the UK, or replace your .eu domains with another option.&quot;')
