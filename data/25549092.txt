I also think we would only be using hydrogen plants to stabalize renewables like we do now with natural gas turbines. I wonder if there is any research into the lifecycle of emitted water vapour?<p>Pipe dreaming now, but I wonder if there is a potential cycle that could help drought stricken areas, even if perhaps supplemented with renewables for desalination.<p>Desalination of coastal water &gt; hydrogen production &gt; power generation with hydrogen &gt; captured purified water.<p>Thinking about this now my state is in the perfect position and often effected by drought. We have green hydrogen production, a gas turbine supplemented solar grid, and a desalination plant the government put in to safeguard drinking water supplies. This may come about as a natural evolution of the market.')
