I can&#x27;t share those numbers of course though.<p>However, privacy reasons does prevent us from collecting too much data, so differentiating why individual users might have different experiences (even when other known factors are similar&#x2F;identical) is difficult.<p>Also I&#x27;d be happy to take any suggestions you have about what to look at back to my engineering team, if you&#x27;re willing to share other ideas.  I know we&#x27;re tracking several of the ones you mention but more options is always better.')
