You don&#x27;t <i>need</i> cryptocurrencies for that, but its a big market with standardized utility and protocols even if you are never sending anything to the blockchain. And then all the user’s clients are also wallets so you can stay in that ecosystem for more.<p>GPG&#x2F;PGP had 20 and 25 years, respectively, to proliferate but without a financial incentive it just petered along. The version for the OSX mail client is pretty bad in 2020 and just as niche as ever.<p>A lot of people undervalue this aspect of crypto-assets: Standardized signing protocols and tools, standardized large namespace with no collisions for account creation and state, the lower amount of programming needed because you aren&#x27;t making your own account creation and state framework and database since you can just differentiate users by address or signature.<p>For anyone passing by:\n<i>“But the low transactions per second are my final goto argument and I get to express my hate because of it”</i>, again these aforementioned use cases don&#x27;t send a transaction to the p2p network and are therefore not constrained by the bandwidth of the p2p network &#x2F; blockchain.
