The less an editor does automatically\nto &quot;help&quot; me the better. I agree, a shortcut to close the last\nopening syntax element would be nice, but for this to work\nproperly the editor needs to be aware of how all the syntax\nelements interact, e.g. to differentiate between &#x27;&lt;&#x27; used in a\nlogical comparison and the same symbol as start of an XML tag.\nOr to correctly close an XML tag no matter if it has attributes.<p>I have a shortcut in Vim for three different kinds of brackets\nbut it&#x27;s a bit janky. Still better than the automatic stuff the\ntypical IDE and modern editor does without asking, though.')
