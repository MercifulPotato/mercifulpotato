The jobs went away, but the desire for that dignity hasn&#x27;t. So social welfare policies remain uninteresting. In fact any top-down analysis sets off their &quot;government handout&quot; detectors, so they&#x27;re left pining for the age before the need for labor dried up.<p>IMO a lot could have been done (and perhaps could still be) by decreasing the definition of full time work. With technological progress, offshoring, and women entering the workforce, full time employment should be around 10-15 hours per week. It&#x27;s a radical departure from the status quo, but that&#x27;s due to progress being held back so long. Instead we&#x27;re stuck between a rock and a hard place with an economy tuned to force people into working 40+ hours a week, but little actual work to do.<p>(BTW the work in cities is more about communication, so the same trend manifests itself as the creation of non-producing bullshit jobs. There is less financial pain, but similar existential pain)')
