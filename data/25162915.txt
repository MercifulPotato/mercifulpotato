Is is possible that modern secular culture is simply Christianity-as-act, but with the explicit verbal affirmation of belief removed? Religions change just as much as cultures do, and I would say that modern culture is quite obsessed with &quot;verbal consent&quot; as being the ultimate decider of <i>what something is.</i><p>I&#x27;m not arguing that this is absolutely the case, but simply that it seems extremely plausible to me.')
