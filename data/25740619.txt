Today&#x27;s scapegoat is trans people, but a few decades ago it was miscegenation. People discriminated against mixed-race couples and said it was a core tenet of their religion[1]:<p>&gt; <i>Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents. And but for the interference with his arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages. The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix.</i><p>Surely if we could handle situations like the above that were leveled against mixed-race couples half of a century ago, we can handle the same being leveled at trans people today.<p>When it comes to free speech and freedom of religion, the ACLU[1] has this to say:<p>&gt; <i>Instances of institutions and individuals claiming a right to discriminate in the name of religion are not new. In the 1960s, we saw objections to laws requiring integration in restaurants because of sincerely held beliefs that God wanted the races to be separate. We saw religiously affiliated universities refuse to admit students who engaged in interracial dating. In those cases, we recognized that requiring integration was not about violating religious liberty; it was about ensuring fairness. It is no different today.</i><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ir.lawnet.fordham.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?article=5513&amp;context=flr" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ir.lawnet.fordham.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?article=55...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aclu.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;religious-liberty&#x2F;using-religion-discriminate&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aclu.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;religious-liberty&#x2F;using-religion...</a>')
