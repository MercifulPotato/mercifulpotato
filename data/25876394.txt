You can only change the membership by issuing a write. Write quorum and leadership quorum are two different things, and if I&#x27;ve got it right, they can diverge after a partition.<p>I&#x27;m also thinking of double faults, because the point of Raft is to get past single fault tolerance.<p>[edit: shortened]<p>After a permanent fault (broken hardware) in a cluster of 5, the replacement quorum member can&#x27;t vote for writes until it has caught up. It can vote for leaders, but it can&#x27;t nominate itself. Catching up leaves a window for additional faults.<p>It&#x27;s always 3&#x2F;5 for writes and elections, the difference is that the <i>ratio</i> of original machines that have to confirm a write can go to 100% of survivors, instead of the 3&#x2F;4 of reachable machines. Meaning network jitter and packet loss, slows down writes until it recovers, and an additional partition can block writes altogether, even with 3&#x2F;5 surviving the partition.')
