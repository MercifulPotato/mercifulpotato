While I agree with you that signal isn&#x27;t all that great (they do some really good stuff and then make some really weird trade-offs), I&#x27;ve recently compared Signal, Wire, Threema, Jami, Briar, Element&#x2F;Matrix, and Keybase.<p>The most mature app is Signal. It has the best usability to privacy trade-off.<p>Threema is the better choice if you don&#x27;t mind not having a usable desktop client. For me that&#x27;s a total deal breaker. It costs a one-time 5 bucks and it&#x27;s totally worth that, if only it had so much as a usable web client (you need to open your phone and navigate two menus to enable the web client every time your phone changes WiFi or anything).<p>Wire is the better choice if you can sacrifice a tiny bit of usability for better privacy. It&#x27;s sluggish is all, and (like Signal and most other services) uses AWS. Full disclosure: I was involved in a paid audit of Wire so I know more about the encryption protocol than I do about the other clients&#x27;.<p>Element&#x2F;Matrix is the better choice if you&#x27;d rather make a trade-off towards privacy. Presumably the clients will mature, and between two years ago and one year ago they&#x27;ve made good progress. It&#x27;s going less fast today but I still see things getting slowly better, and the decentralization works very well and fairly easy to setup.<p>If all you really want is a better privacy policy and want to ensure people stick around and don&#x27;t uninstall it, Telegram is by far the usability winner and has a large network effect already. But it&#x27;s a trade-off with the devil because there is zero encryption. They could ransom or sell our chat logs any time.<p>Briar and Jami have limitations that make it unusable for general purposes use with your mom. Facebook and Google&#x27;s messengers I didn&#x27;t look at for obvious reasons. Keybase was never end to end encrypted to begin with and now Zoom bought them so they&#x27;ll probably shut down soon (also, bugs).<p>Rocket.chat seems only aimed at business users.<p>You can also do OTR over any platform you like, and I still have to try this overlay encryption system on Android (I forgot its name).<p>Pick your poison...')
