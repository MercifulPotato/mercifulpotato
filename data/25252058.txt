Because I know everything about them, I can quickly change everything, adapt it as I need, fix any issues. That&#x27;s not true for other applications and might be impossible for proprietary ones.<p>I don&#x27;t think that this is the same about Ikea, though. If I bought Ikea table, I can&#x27;t really adapt it, unless I&#x27;m advanced woodsman with proper tools. If I&#x27;m just ordinary guy with screwdriver, I can just follow the script to build that table.<p>I think that Ikea analogue is someone building his vim environment from other&#x27;s plugins following guides. He does not know C, so he can&#x27;t hack vim, he does not know vim configuration language, so he can&#x27;t hack plugins.')
