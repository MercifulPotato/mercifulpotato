And then they are left with the gut-wrenching decision-making process of &quot;Should we have more kids, knowing there is a 25 percent chance they will also have this Dread Disease?&quot;<p>This is a huge hot-button topic in the CF community, or was when I used to participate in CF discussion spaces. As the saying goes, most people &quot;wouldn&#x27;t wish this on their worst enemy,&quot; much less their own child whom they have to raise.<p>(If they have any idea what is involved, most people wouldn&#x27;t wish raising such a child on <i>themselves.</i> It&#x27;s a significant burden to care for such a child. That alone is enough reason for many people to not want a child with a serious genetic disorder.)')
