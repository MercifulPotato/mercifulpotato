The only career progression I have is people management which I have no interest in and will be bad at as not my skills.<p>I don’t want to be dealing with corporates and agile nonsense in to my late 40’s.<p>The only option I’m seeing is save as much as I can while I’m getting paid well in order to have some kind of hobby business in 10-15 years time.')
