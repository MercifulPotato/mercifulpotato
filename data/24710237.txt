I&#x27;m not an avid hiker. I do casual hiking sometimes so I just wear regular shoes to those. When I do slightly more strenuous hiking, I wear a specific pair of high-cut hiking boots that I own. I get a chance to do this maybe once a year, or less.<p>I bought a pair of Denali ones from Big5 for $40 for this purpose. It has been with me for 10 years now with barely any wear. If I don&#x27;t use it often enough, it makes almost no difference to me to get a $400 &quot;more durable&quot; pair. The $40 pair is not going to get worn out in another 20-30 years at least. I probably won&#x27;t go through more than say 2 pairs of these in my lifetime.<p>Is that an uncommon example? Maybe, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s as uncommon as one would think. How about a travel backpack? I used to travel multiple times a year. Now that I have a young kid, I don&#x27;t anymore. I go with a $20 backpack that I&#x27;ve used for a number of years that is still in decent enough condition to keep using. I&#x27;m probably not going to get much use out of it for the next 10 years before my kid is old enough to travel around the world with me.<p>How about a cast iron pan? They aren&#x27;t dishwasher safe, and as a parent, I save time whenever I can. I don&#x27;t own a cast iron pan, but even if I do, 99% of the time I&#x27;ll pick up one of these non-stick sauce pans I bought from Costco as a set for a decent price of good quality that is dishwasher safe, when cooking. I&#x27;ve only owned these for a year but based on my experience with past sauce pans, one usually last me a good ~10 years, and that&#x27;s with very regular home cooking. The iron handle skillet on this site costs $180. The set I got from Costco costs about that much, for a set of 4 pots and 4 pans.<p>Overall, I&#x27;m not sure I buy this entire idea of &quot;buy expensive durable things because it&#x27;ll cost less in the long run&quot;. That just hasn&#x27;t been my experience in most cases, other than some very specific examples.')
