It&#x27;s everything else about their structure, dynamics, and in vivo function that remains very difficult.  The real promise in AlphaFold IMHO isn&#x27;t that we can magically solve protein structures without experiments (most really interesting structures are beyond what it can do anyway), but the more general application of these AI methods to human health.')
