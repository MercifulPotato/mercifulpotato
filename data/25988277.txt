A doesn’t have a share any more, they have an IOU from B for one share. B doesn’t have a share either. Only C has a share.<p>Once the IOU comes due, B will need to acquire a share from D to give back to A, at which point both A and C own a share - but D no longer does.<p>At no point are there any magic duplicated shareholding rights.')
