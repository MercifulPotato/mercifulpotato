The Developer ID code signing program is not analogous to web certs. The usage of these certs is entirely different.<p>If a web cert gets revoked a browser won&#x27;t accept it when making a connection to a domain&#x2F;server anymore even if they previously did (unless you make it). If an app signing cert gets revoked the OS won&#x27;t run a binary signed with it anymore even if it previously did (unless you make it). Sounds similar enough to me, minus expiry handling.<p>Revocation is indeed extremely destructive and should only used by Apple on their own accord against malware but I don&#x27;t see why a dev themselves shouldn&#x27;t be able to revoke their own cert without having to go back and forth with the Apple security&#x2F;support team to have to try to convince them that the issue is severe enough.<p>The main and basically almost only reason where I see developer side revocation be used is if their keys or account have been (possibly) compromised and therefore there&#x27;s a chance of it being used for malware. Time can be of big importance in a situation like that too. As a user I absolutely want Apple to revoke certs when requested by the dev themselves without triple verifying if they are really totally actually absolutely sure. I consider the upsides of that to outway the downsides.<p>While a binary from a dev that has been installed for a long time will be less likely to be malware but not enough to be exempt from that.<p>Users that dislike OSCP can disable it fully on their side if they want or locally sign anything specific they do trust. Devs didn&#x27;t ask for it but having developer IDs and application singing seems like a pretty sensible thing to me in an end user OS used by the average consumer.')
