Item(by='MisterTea', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603280955, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24843444, text='ConEd standard* service in NYC provides 120&#x2F;208 three or four wire service from a wye connected transformer bank. With the density of the city it&#x27;s easier to just run three phase all over and let homes pull alternatingly off the hots. So homes connect A-B, B-C, A-C and so on.<p>Three wire service means you get two hots and a neutral and is considered a single phase &quot;open wye&quot; service. BUT you can reconstruct the third phase from the two half vectors in each phase using transformers.<p>Four wire gives you full three phase service so you can run big motors, machinery, lots of lighting and such.<p>*Though plenty of neighborhoods are fed 120&#x2F;240 or mixed. I&#x27;m on 120&#x2F;240 yet the next block is 120&#x2F;208. Sucks because I want my three phase.')
