I remember mrkurt say fly.io evaluated gVisor but settled on Firecracker eventually, though, I must ask: can gVisor on its own achieve same level of <i>protection</i> as micro-VMs? Even if not, can the protection offered by application kernels like gVisor and Kata be considered <i>enough</i> for multi-tenant workloads (like the one fly.io runs) inside the same guest (VM)?<p>Also, if I may, in what cases would one prefer to use Firecracker managed micro-VM running gVisor sandboxed containers? I&#x27;d imagine gVisor slows things down, so it might not be for everyone, but I&#x27;m curious as to what value-add might make gVisor worth that.')
