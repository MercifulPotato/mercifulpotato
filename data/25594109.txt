Item(by='boxmonster', descendants=None, kids=[25594211, 25594271], score=None, time=1609432232, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25593718, text='the unwrap_or_else makes a lot more sense, because I could just use the ? operator, but if I don&#x27;t want to panic, then I&#x27;ll use unwrap_or_else.
