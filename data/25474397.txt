In fact, it clearly portrays that Facebook is only interested in retaining and monetizing off the user’s personal data to preserve their monopoly<p>I don&#x27;t understand naivete like this. Businesses are there to provide a product and in return, make money. They are entities that don&#x27;t &quot;care&quot; about anything -- good or bad.<p>OF COURSE they care about maintaining their competitive advantage. Which business doesn&#x27;t? Why is that cause for outrage?<p>It&#x27;s like saying: &quot;Monkeys are only interested in picking out lice and eating bananas. Shame on them.&quot;<p>The personification of companies and the outrage over that personification just seems misinformed.')
