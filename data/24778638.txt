The kid learns the wrong lesson <i>and</i> feels terrible about it.  Lazy adult &quot;solutions&quot; like that can traumatize children.<p>The proper solution is just tell the kid to take a breather without stating a reason (maybe tell them privately how to notice on their own when they are overworking themselves). The other kids won&#x27;t notice or care.<p>(And if some kid is looking for an excuse not to do the exercises... why are they even there? And who cares? It&#x27;s an extracurricular, the point is to get out of it what you put in. It&#x27;s not boot camp.)')
