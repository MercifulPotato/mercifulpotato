You forget what &quot;high earners&quot; are and aren&#x27;t. It is not the super-rich since the assets of the super-rich don&#x27;t actually amount to that much compared to the total.<p>The state taxes where the lion&#x27;s share of TOTAL wealth is (not wealth per person). That&#x27;s the income of the middle class. That&#x27;s why another new tax on income is suggested.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.nationalpriorities.org&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;revenue_pie%2C__2015_enacted.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.nationalpriorities.org&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;revenue_pie%2C_...</a><p>So middle class income represents 80% of the total tax income (and that&#x27;s ignoring that customs duties and excise taxes also mostly come from that bucket, then we&#x27;d easily get to 85%)<p>&quot;High earners&quot; are generally defined as anyone earning more than double the average income in the country. For the US that&#x27;s anyone making $62k<i>2 = $120k </i>per household*. Or for an individual that would be a chunk above that $62k, let&#x27;s say $68k. All figures before tax, of course.')
