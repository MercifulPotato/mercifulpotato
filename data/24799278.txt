I&#x27;m desperately missing the office and have experience moderate depression for the first time in my life working from home. Atm everything I read is &#x27;WFH is the new normal&#x27; or &#x27;we&#x27;ll never have an office again&#x27;. If the balance goes too far to home working then folk like me will need to start clamouring for offices.
