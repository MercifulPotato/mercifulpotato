The group that somehow didn&#x27;t put safety scanners or a cell wall with door interlocks or didn&#x27;t use safety-rated equipment.<p>There&#x27;s a big difference between &quot;guys, please get out of the way before I make the bot move&quot; and &quot;guys, I can&#x27;t make the bot move until you&#x27;re out of the way and the door is closed and latched&quot; and worst-case scenario, that difference can be any number of human lives.<p>Surely things can improve, but it&#x27;ll take time, dedication, and sucking it up and rewriting legacy code and probably being slower at pushing features out.
