It happens when someone in a discussion appeals to the <i>spirit</i> of freedom of speech, and the other guy shuts it down using the argument in the Xkcd comic.<p>I hate seeing that happen because it shows how little people value their ability to freely express their minds on a public forum. Or if they do value this, it shows how they&#x27;re willing to disconnect that notion from the one that gave rise to encoding the freedom of speech into our constitution.')
