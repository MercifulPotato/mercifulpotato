You could see it as X using the &#x27;build recipe&#x27; of A as its dependency. So, if you bump the version of A to 2.4.3, then all packages that use A as a dependency will be rebuilt (or substituted from the a binary cache if the Guix&#x2F;NixOS build infrastructure has already built the updated packages).')
