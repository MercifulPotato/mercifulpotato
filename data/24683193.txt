Unretouched selfies actually look _worse_ than what you look like to other people. That&#x27;s one big reason why mirror selfies are popular: the additional optical distance due to the mirror reduces the geometric distortion. (The other big reason is that bathrooms somehow tend to have excellent lighting.)')
