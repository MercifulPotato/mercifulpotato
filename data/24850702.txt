And after some haggling, Youtube has let the creators retain full ownership.<p>But the various de-monetization and search algorithm changes show that Youtube retains full control over distribution (and ability to make said living). The creators are totally at the mercy of Youtube and their advertising.<p>Imagine if there were Utube, Vtube, and Wtube, and a creator could shop around for the best placement and ad deal. It would not be better for the viewer (more like which network now has my favorite show, and do I have to subscribe to all 3), but it would be better for the creators.<p>Come to think of it, I&#x27;m surprised Netflix hasn&#x27;t gone after some of the big YouTube channels or that Patreon hasn&#x27;t expanded into curated video hosting.
