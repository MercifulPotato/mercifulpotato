To me it feels like the defaults are sane enough + an amazing documentation which summarizes all the CSS I use.<p>Most of the time I think:<p>&quot;I need a small margin on the right and a big one at the bottom, and let&#x27;s see a black background&quot; which is super cheap to mentally translate to &quot;mr-1 mb-10 bg-black&quot; while staying in the HTML. If I&#x27;m repeating too much I can either move that to a custom tailwind CSS component or a react component. It just feels easy working with, and it&#x27;s super flexible.')
