Item(by='belval', descendants=None, kids=[25104801], score=None, time=1605468705, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25103842, text='I am the maintainer of a library called &quot;pdf2image&quot; on GitHub, I&#x27;ve been maintaining it for well over 3 years now. At some point in the past a few other projects with the same name appeared for different languages. I didn&#x27;t go on a long rant on HN about how other people where taking my &quot;IP&quot; because it&#x27;s a generic name.<p>On top of that, GitHub Actions have been up since November 2019 and as such, OP had around 11 months to register his project. The name being generic it&#x27;s only expected that someone ended up taking it.<p>Now the only thing that makes people all up in arms is that FB is the employer of the dev that did this. Since we all hate Facebook, we support the underdog in this. Repost the exact same post while removing the name of the company and it would not even be close to trending.')
