As far as I can tell it’s <i>not</i> because it’s compatible with everything. Looks more like it’s the “Fish don’t know they’re in water” phenomenon. The author just <i>assumes</i> that the reader will assume that everything is for React only. (I might be wrong! The readme really doesn’t make it clear either way)<p>One of the nice things about Tailwind is that it’s completely portable, because it’s ”just” CSS. You can use the exact same design system regardless of how your markup ends up on the screen, as long as you can set a class attribute.')
