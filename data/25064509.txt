After toppling Jordan&#x27;s monarchy, presumably he would turn to the rest of the Levant.[1]<p>&gt; For these purposes he developed numerous contacts and affiliates in several countries. His network may have been involved in the late 1999 plot to bomb the Millennium celebrations in the United States and Jordan.[12]')
