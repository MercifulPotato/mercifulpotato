That&#x27;s the only condition.<p>The possible issue with that criteria in general is that it need not actually be the original poster who replies with the needed details. Another user with the same problem could supply the needed details as well.<p>A different user supplying the answer is especially common on widespread issues that the maintainers are having problems tracking down. For example, it might be that the problem only reproduces on a certain version of a specific distro, or only if certain kernel configuration options are used. Those sorts of issues can be hard for the maintainer to discover, but might be easier for impacted users to locate.<p>You may well have stuff in place to handle this, but thought it was worth pointing out for completeness sake.')
