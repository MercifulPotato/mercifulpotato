This is all better horse rhetoric: &quot;horses should be trained to go drink their own water and poop in designated areas just like they can be trained to seek food&quot;.<p>No. The right answer is to deregulate healthcare so that you can buy it from anywhere. You can still have your AMA-certified doctors, but if you can get other doctors as well, you&#x27;ll be better off.<p>The reason for that is that while wealthy people like the US middle class worry about the quality of care, everyone below them merely worries about access.
