Mozilla hasn&#x27;t been killed by Google or competition, it&#x27;s been kept alive in large part by Google (I think in some years as much as 90% or more of its total income coming from Google) so they get hundreds of millionsâ€”the problem at Mozilla is bad management for the last decade.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how well this vision represents reality as it already is today.')
