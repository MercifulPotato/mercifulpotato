I&#x27;ve long said things somewhat similar to my wife. I expect her and I to both not only be attracted to other people, but to form bonds that if followed could ruin our relationship.<p>It&#x27;s imo in human nature, and perfectly valid. If you are in a monogamous relationship which you wish to retain i think you need to be aware of this. To internalize ones feelings and be aware when it&#x27;s heading towards a threshold, and put in the work to prevent it from damaging your relationship if its worth fighting for.<p>I&#x27;ve long thought that modern society fails to raise our children to self analyze. Tools to develop healthy mental habits do not seem discussed, let alone taught. So in this case people naturally &quot;crush&quot; on passers-by who perhaps on paper shouldn&#x27;t ruin their primary relationship... but when left unchecked, do.<p>Relationships need care, protection even. Sometimes, perhaps often, from your own self.')
