Heck the doctor asked me to eat Turmeric pills - not even kidding. He made sure I wasn&#x27;t getting a narcotic - and I wasn&#x27;t looking for it because I am really afraid of side effects. (My wife is the same way - brave woman went without touching the narcotic meds after tooth removal.)<p>That pretty much leaves you with OTC pain meds - I know in these cases probably narcotics of the right kind in restricted doses sound much better but I am just truly afraid of side effects because of what we saw earlier in life.')
