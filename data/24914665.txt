If you want verification, by all means use something else, as discussed in the link in my original post (which also addresses your scheme point – that&#x27;s a problem common to most approaches so far!).<p>If HoTT helps you prove theorems, great. In particular I could see it being of interest to people working in higher category theory (and such people have responded in other comments here!). My remarks were meant for the other 99% of mathematicians – most of whom go their entire lives without ever writing the word &quot;category&quot; in a paper.')
