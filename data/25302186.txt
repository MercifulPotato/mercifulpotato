I might have missed something, but by default I think that takes creating the other page first, then manually copying its id -- way too much clicking, and breaks the focus on what you&#x27;re writing.<p>In the end, I ended up using Obsidian (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obsidian.md" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obsidian.md</a>). While typing (even in an outside editor), I can just go [[random reference]] -- and that will turn into a link, even if that page doesn&#x27;t exist yet. When I eventually get to creating the page, it will already have back links from all the places it is used (something else I think Joplin doesn&#x27;t have).')
