It feels strange to have it show up on the front page whenever GitHub does something bad, more than five years later.<p>Bitcoin and BitTorrent v1 were plausible substrates in 2015, but no longer. I think Radicle (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;radicle.xyz" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;radicle.xyz</a>) is the project most deserving of attention at the moment.<p>The hardest thing about such a project is economic: how do you handle issue&#x2F;comment spammers?
