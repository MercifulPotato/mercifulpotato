But without freedom to publish and speak, nothing can be done about it. This is especially true when the government is spreading the misinformation. Soviet Russia jokes aside, without freedom of speech and press, our soon to be former president would have been able to spread misinformation with impunity. It&#x27;s really remarkable that this happened.<p>The other side of this, that most people don&#x27;t like to discuss is that people are also free to believe misinformation and lies. It&#x27;s hard, but that is actually part of the human condition.')
