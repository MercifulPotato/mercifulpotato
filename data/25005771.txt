You need to figure out what your class knows.  And a fair proportion of your students won&#x27;t bother to really know stuff unless it&#x27;ll be formally assessed.  And, yes, also there&#x27;s the issue with granting credentials: you don&#x27;t want to give them to people who haven&#x27;t reached a minimum standard.<p>I&#x27;m fortunate in that the classes I teach are centered project-based learning and ... not too easy to crib on.  But if I were teaching core academic sequences, it&#x27;s a ridiculous amount of work to make problem sets and exercises of appropriate difficulty and develop rubric for them.<p>You want to be able to leverage other peoples&#x27; work, and your past work, in building assessments.  And you want to have a time advantage in grading:  a 30 minute assessment that you give to 100 students that in turn takes you 30 minutes to grade each is a recipe for no fun.<p>But all of these things-- these economies of scale in instruction-- open the door to cheating.  A well-proctored, well-designed exam can mostly patch over the vulnerability.')
