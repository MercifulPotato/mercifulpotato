It&#x27;s a great way to wake you up from your after-lunch slump. The kids aren&#x27;t around so no one&#x27;s expecting you to help take care of them. And it&#x27;s a lot easier to explain to your partner that you have to work 30min more, than it is to tell them you&#x27;re heading out on your own for a walk :)')
