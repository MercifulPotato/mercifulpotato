You have to have the right combination of lots of different things (chemicals, weather conditions, time etc) to have it happened. What’s scary (or interesting) to me is that we have access to labs and are capable of quickly iterating with lots of different combinations; yet no life arised. If it’s hard in a lab it’s probably a lot harder in nature where to get a different set of combinations you need a new planet! Hence why I think life is rare in the universe.')
