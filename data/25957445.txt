Hedge funds entered a crowded trade that has unlimited downside without an exit strategy. They are not naive and although they&#x27;re obviously upset I doubt they&#x27;re shocked about what happened. They went in with confidence thinking they knew the &#x27;market&#x27; (aka other hedge funds) and discounted the possibility of a short squeeze.<p>This type of risk taking behavior must have the associated consequences, otherwise there is no reason to stop behaving this way at larger and larger scales. Moral hazard - again a finance &#x2F; trading 101 concept - just like shorting can result in infinite loss.')
