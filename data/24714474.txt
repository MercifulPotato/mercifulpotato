I&#x27;ve never seen any information on packaging a GUI and making it presentable to a user. For example, what if I want to style&#x2F;brand it to not look like Pharo or a smalltalk VM? How limited am I with that?<p>&gt; If you mean accessing data from the filesystem, yes that can be done as well.<p>How? I&#x27;ve never seen it explained in a book, but I could easily have missed it. That&#x27;s more of what I&#x27;m talking about though. For example, how do I read &#x2F; parse a CSV for the computer? Or better yet, download a CSV from the internet and then parse it.<p>&gt; And guess what, there is even network support.<p>I&#x27;m aware of this because I know there&#x27;s a web framework. I think there&#x27;s an entire book on this for Pharo.')
