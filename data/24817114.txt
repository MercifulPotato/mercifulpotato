Tor pretends to be secure, but is dark and compromised. This project seems to understand that and wants to try again to fix via P2P in a way that has promise.<p>The simple implementation of web forms is broken in today’s web. It’s an input field or other element styled as an input field that may or may not be grouped or in a form object, possibly generated dynamically. Websockets, timers, validations, ... it’s a huge PITA.<p>The DOM is a freaking mess. It’s not there until it’s there, it’s detached, it’s shared. It’s been gangbanged so much, there’s no clear parent anymore.<p>ECMAScript- which version and which interpretation should Babel translate for you, and would you like obscufation via webpack, and how about some source maps with that, so you can unobscufate to debug it? Yarn, requireJS, npm, and you need an end script tag, should it go in the body or the head? You know the page isn’t full loaded yet, and it won’t ever be. There, it’s done, until that timer goes off. Each element generated was just regenerated and the old ones are hidden, but the new ones have the same script with different references.
