In other words, I think we have two options:<p>&gt;  1. Builtin drivers like &quot;cpp&quot; can stay minimal, only setting funcname and color-words headers that aren&#x27;t going to produce terrible results if we are wrong about detecting by extension.<p>&gt;  2. We force the user to identify file types manually, so we can&#x27;t be wrong. The &quot;cpp&quot; diff driver means &quot;you are a text C file&quot;, and if a user mis-marks a binary file with that diff driver, they are the one who is wrong.<p>&gt; So if it&#x27;s an either&#x2F;or situation, we should decide not only that extension auto-detection is a good feature, but that it trumps adding more advanced features to the builtin drivers in the future.<p>&gt; Or we could decide that the extensions really are good enough, and if you really do have binary files named &quot;foo.c&quot;, it&#x27;s your problem to override the defaults with &quot;*.c -diff&quot;.<p>There might be more recent discussion that I didn&#x27;t find.')
