I&#x27;m usually that jaded person but today&#x27;s VR tech really has me gushing. This is the first time I&#x27;ve been truly excited about video games since I was a teenager 15 years ago (despite playing a lot of games in that time).<p>The feeling of vertigo and momentum in games like Jet Island that makes you weak in the knees, looking out your cockpit and being awestruck by planets and stations in Star Wars Squadrons or Elite Dangerous, dodging bullets in Pistol Whip and Superhot. The dream of the 90&#x27;s is alive - the technology is here! It&#x27;s so good and I can&#x27;t wait until quarantine is over to share this with more people.<p>Previously I&#x27;d used a friend&#x27;s Oculus DK1 (not good) and then later a friend&#x27;s HTC Vive (getting there). The Quest 2 is a major improvement and I look forward to the next generation of headsets.')
