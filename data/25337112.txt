It won&#x27;t be due to any of the rather laughable government programs being attempted there routinely, rather, it&#x27;s going to be caused by a large influx of US venture capital that has begun and will get a lot larger across this decade. That venture capital will reshape European tech dramatically, altering how they do tech start-ups and producing the first new tech giants there. European governments however will take most of the credit for the boom, because all of their efforts have failed across decades now and they&#x27;re desperate. The primary things lacking in Europe have been enough risk capital and the shaping (how it&#x27;s done, how you rapidly scale tech giants globally), the US VCs will bring that capital and the understanding of how to build giants (which Europe entirely lacks); they have all the talent necessary. Also, tech salaries in Europe will increase dramatically as they begin building some giants that poach at ever higher salaries.')
