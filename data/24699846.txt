If the ranges don&#x27;t match TimeSpans should be mapped to something else.<p>MySQL&#x27;s BIGINTs are 64bits, so that might be a more reasonable target. Of course you lose some &quot;typing&quot; information in the schema, but it&#x27;s probably worth it.<p>But I suppose it would make sense for MySQL to provide a &quot;BIGTIME&quot; alias for this purpose, and deprecate the old one maybe.')
