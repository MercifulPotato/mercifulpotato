(e.g. Annual VC deal volume in US is typically 25x that of India).<p>I&#x27;d love to know what you think are some practical ways of going about this, any common gotchas etc.:<p>1. Opening a delaware c corp via stripe atlas, any common mistakes you&#x27;ve seen?<p>2. For a small bootstrapped business (&lt;$100K ARR), are there any realistic ways for the founder to immigrate to the US? (mainly to access a better ecosystem, community)<p>3. For setting up a remote team: Say that I keep the tech team in my home country, what&#x27;s the best way to, for example, set up a sales team in the US? (common use case for B2B SaaS)')
