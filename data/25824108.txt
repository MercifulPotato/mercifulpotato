This doesn&#x27;t mean it has low priority, just not high&#x2F;very high priority.<p>- feature requests which the author agreed to should be implemented, but neither the maintainer nor the issuer has currently time to work on.<p>- feature requests which are braking changes  and as such will only included if a new version is made<p>- bugs with low priority if there are higher priority things<p>Sure you can work around this by using many labels and making the stale bot label aware e.g.:<p>- label contains &quot;blocked&quot; =&gt; do not stale close<p>- label contains &quot;bug&quot; =&gt; do not stale close (and only assign bug if issuer provides the necessary information)<p>- label contains &quot;next-version&quot; =&gt; do not stale<p>- label contains &quot;....&quot; =&gt; do not stale<p>But that seems somewhat pointless for the large majority of crates.<p>Furthermore I believe stale bots come to some degree from the (IMHO) unrealistic idea that the amount of open issues, issue closing time and issues staleness indicate how health a project is.<p>But the moment you have feature request issues or &quot;will be fixed in next release as braking change&quot; this metrics fall apart completely.<p>Similar some software projects get a lot of spam issues (often an indication that a popular project probably needs some improvements of documentation or UX aspects). For this it can sometimes be reasonable to have stale bot <i>if</i> it doesn&#x27;t act on certain labels IMHO.')
