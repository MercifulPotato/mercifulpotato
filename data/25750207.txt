We are way too lenient on the people who are not safe enough to be in society IMO, so it&#x27;s good to have another mechanism. Recently, it&#x27;s even worse than it&#x27;s used to be... e.g. in Seattle they quickly release people back onto the streets after multiple separate violent assaults.<p>I think the incarceration for drug crimes and such should be stopped, but I am also a-ok with stigma following repeated and&#x2F;or violent crime. I personally think people who have repeatedly shown to be too dangerous to live in society should never be released into said society, but if that mechanism is broken due to &quot;compassion&quot;, at least I prefer to never interact with them.')
