We were given blocks and a &#x27;force meter&#x27; that was a bendy springy length of metal in a wooden calibrated frame. \nSo pull blocks on a surface with the meter to measure friction. Try different surface area, stack them for multiples of weight, plot on a graph.\nMine weren&#x27;t coming out on a straight line. Other people noticed theres&#x27; weren&#x27;t either, so they fudged their data points. I put down the honest ones. I got it &#x27;wrong&#x27;, they got it &#x27;right&#x27;.<p>Of course that old myth was nonsense, my experimental method was correct, and I&#x27;ve felt the injustice for decades now!')
