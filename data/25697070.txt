It&#x27;s almost as if if one steeps oneself in stereotypes - even in attempts to dismantle them - one will come out more stereotyping than if the exercise was not attempted in the first place. Things like SJW Googlers (on Twitter) accusing Jeff Dean of &quot;exercising his Whiteness&quot; when it came to the Timnit affair from a few weeks ago.
