I was surprised and also a bit proud to learn that it uses a fork of my AOO library (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.iem.at&#x2F;cm&#x2F;aoo&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.iem.at&#x2F;cm&#x2F;aoo&#x2F;</a>). I have been in touch with Jesse for the last couple of days and I&#x27;m (passively) following the development of SonoBus.<p>AOO is a C&#x2F;C++ library for flexible on-the-fly multi-channel audio streaming and OSC messaging over local networks and the internet. The repo also includes Pure Data externals and Supercollider extensions.<p>WARNING: AOO is still alpha and there are breaking changes between the pre-releases, but I hope to publish a final release soon!')
