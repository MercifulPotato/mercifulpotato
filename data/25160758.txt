The font size is defined as 3% of min(viewport width, viewport height). On my full-screen desktop browser this results in so large text it is unbearable to read. Fiddling with browser window size results in varying font sizes ranging from way too large to way too small to read.<p>Massive accessibility fail. Font size is one of the few things that usually works fine out of the box with modern browsers across devices of all sizes - unless someone decides to do crazy stuff like defining the font size in relation to the viewport size.')
