Does your system handle changing of timezones gracefully? It&#x27;s almost like my timezone changes by 1.5-2hrs every day, and sometimes stressful days will completely throw it off.<p>Figuring out how to stay in sync with a 24-hour world has been a thorn in my side for ages and I think planning like you&#x27;re doing would help me tremendously.
