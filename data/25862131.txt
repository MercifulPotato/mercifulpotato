If<p>Social media companies <i>are</i> publishers <i>except</i> for a defined subset of civil liability purposes; an exception (Section 230) which exists explicitly to avoid discouraging them from acting like publishers.<p>&gt; Read Section 230.<p>I have. And I&#x27;ve read the arguments for it at the time it was adopted (both at the time and several times since.) Section 230 supports exactly the opposite position you are making: online media companies have exactly the editorial freedom of newspapers, plus (with regard to actions concerning user-generated rather than first-party-produced content) some liability immunities designed <i>specifically</i> to encourage them to take an editorial role rather than act as neutral unmoderated platforms.<p>The argument that they <i>lose</i> editorial freedom because of Section 230 (or would lose Section 230 protection as a result of exercising editorial freedom) contravenes both the text of and the very explicit motivation for Section 230.')
