I imprecisely spoke when I used fiduciary as recent guidance says they have the lower “suitability standard”. With regard to fills they are covered by reg nms and the nbbo. All of that is a much stronger regime than Facebook is under and to my opinion Facebook uses their power much more detrimentally. Reasonable people can disagree on that.<p>All retail brokers besides vanguard and IB’s paid tier sell order flow. This enables cheap&#x2F;free trades and low spreads which I view as well worth the execution difference ymmv.<p>I’d also suggest if your mental model is that citadel is doing risk free front running you don’t understand market dynamics correctly.<p>In any case it’s cheaper for me to execute my retail trades than any time in history. I’m good with that outcome.')
