Rent&#x2F;property tax&#x2F;insurance is expensive, but everything else is cheap and there&#x27;s no VAT. Some states don&#x27;t even have income taxes. We have insanely painful income inequality, but as shameful as it is, you can usually clear the hurdle prices with a 6-figure income.<p>I&#x27;m not an aristocrat and I oscillate between working hard and going off into nature for random periods of time, so I&#x27;d sure like to live somewhere with a stable safety net. But for now, the US seems cheaper even with its ridiculous baseline CoL expenses. I can buy vehicles on a whim and mess with them and bum around for years on 5-10hr&#x2F;week gigs even after $Nk monthly expenses, which would be difficult in the EU. And if you can pay the exorbitant health insurance rates, the medical care is actually quite good.<p>I do feel bad sometimes, but it&#x27;s not exactly easy to change your citizenship, and the whole political situation sure isn&#x27;t <i>my</i> fault.')
