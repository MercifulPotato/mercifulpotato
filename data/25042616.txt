I think the point about government isn&#x27;t that I&#x27;m so worried about the government --currently--, but I know government almost never gives something back that they take away. In this case it&#x27;s privacy. Hopefully the EU government (or at least the members of the EU individually) will realize this is an autocratic power grab and doesn&#x27;t make anyone safer. You&#x27;d think they&#x27;d have had enough with dictators and autocratic governments knowing everything you do given what happened in WW1 and WW2')
