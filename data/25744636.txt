Twitter and Facebook is literally overflowing with nazis, fascist, communists openly calling for violence against ppl or a particular class. And some accounts are left unchecked for very very long time. Calling for genocide of jews, killing of cops, racist comments against black people, asians etc. And suddenly Parler is the problem? I don&#x27;t get this.<p>Twitter is full of pedos and rape videos and that&#x27;s totally ok too? This is pathetic.')
