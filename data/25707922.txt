Check out <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;Poloniex.careers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;Poloniex.careers</a><p>We are fully remote and hire people all over the world. We do not care where you live. We want talented people.<p>But even outside exchanges, looking at projects, I know people who wrote code for posted projects and were paid in tokens that became very highly valued.<p>My recommendation is to get involved in a project and see what they can pay. If you are skilled you will be rewarded. In the US itâ€™s standard rates plus token payments which are liquid much sooner than stock options.')
