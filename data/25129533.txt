The Black Plague had a 40% mortality rate, SARS about 20%, etc. A virus with a 1-2% mortality rate won&#x27;t bring society down, obviously.<p>The media machine needs nourishment and they tend to exaggerate things.<p>However Covid-19 is still a big deal. If it runs its course unchecked ~50-80 million of people could die. That&#x27;s a lot of pain and suffering, the likes of which the world hasn&#x27;t had in at least 60 years.<p>&gt; - I believe the human influence on climate change is much less than what most people tend to believe<p>This, I don&#x27;t think anyone can justify. Maybe the climate warming estimates are overblown, ok, but human influence is undeniable and worst of all, we have no control over it and little visibility. It&#x27;s like physics and closed systems, humanity is an open system and we&#x27;re leaking pollution everywhere. Any way you cut it, that can&#x27;t be good or sustainable. And there are so many of us that we definitely have an impact on the world. For example the Great Pacific Garbage Patch (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Pacific_garbage_patch" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Pacific_garbage_patch</a>). And these things will only become worse as we will have 3x - 4x as many people living in industrialized countries (4 billion people or more).')
