I’ve been working professionally on software development since 2007. The tech stacks I&#x27;ve been working the most with are Java and Python related but I&#x27;m more interested in Python nowadays. I&#x27;ve been doing lots of backend lately, in big and small companies. My frontend skills are a bit rusty but I can get up to speed quickly.<p>I&#x27;m interested in ethical job positions that help to build communities and add value to society.')
