However, 2019 was a very weak flu season, with no excess death periods in England:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.euromomo.eu&#x2F;graphs-and-maps#z-scores-by-country" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.euromomo.eu&#x2F;graphs-and-maps#z-scores-by-country</a><p>If you reduce 2020 deaths by the amount that didn&#x27;t occur in 2019 due to the weak flu season but did occur in 2018, then 2020&#x27;s deaths are only 6.8% higher than 2018. Consider also that in those two years the population of the UK aged 45 and above increased by 1.7%.<p>The question is - is COVID just shuffling fundamentally unhealthy people off their mortal coil a bit faster than would have occurred naturally? How many COVID deaths are really due to ongoing societal issues like Vitamin D deficiency, air pollution, poor diets and obesity? Or simply just old age?<p>Is shutting down and completely disrupting society for something which is about 5% worse than a regular flu season in terms of deaths really justified? Would we have noticed without the media attention?')
