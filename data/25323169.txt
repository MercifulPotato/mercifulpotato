It presents some interesting (albeit unsurprising) findings, e.g., energy use positively correlates with income, larger households generally require less energy per capita, etc., but it doesn’t make any statements as to whether dense or non-dense living is more preferable from an environmental standpoint.<p>Also, haven’t been to Australia in 15+ years but can you really make an argument either for or against dense cities by comparing different parts of Sydney? Central Tokyo is dense, NYC is dense, Singapore is dense. Sydney seemed medium density at most in comparison.')
