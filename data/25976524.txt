Clearly that doesn&#x27;t happen, and it&#x27;s because there are also <i>negative</i> feedback loops, like noticing that a stock is overvalued and refusing to buy it until the price comes down.<p>What makes the future difficult to predict is that negative feedback loops and positive feedback loops are often fighting each other and you never know early on which will ultimately dominate.')
