All eyes were on the WSB subreddit, and discord server. Now both are private or offline.<p>No one has any chance to coordinate now. Discord’s action is effectively market manipulation in a literal sense, because this is certainly going to affect the market.<p>I’m curious why the sub went private though.<p>EDIT: I regret my phrasing. I didn’t mean this was illegal market manipulation, just that discord is literally manipulating the market by cutting off one of two primary coordination channels.<p>But they’re within their legal rights to do so, of course.<p>EDIT2: WSB Subreddit is back; mods issued a statement: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l6j4r9&#x2F;where_do_we_go_from_here_and_who_is_going_to_step&#x2F;?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets&#x2F;comments&#x2F;l6j4r9&#x2F;wher...</a>')
