I don&#x27;t think many people realize that there is more to a life than achieving or being productive. It&#x27;s all good if that&#x27;s what you actually enjoy, but if it&#x27;s making you miserable you are indeed wasting your life. Knowing this should shake you awake, knowing you are miserable because of what you are currently doing should provoke a change, not seek some way to work with your misery.')
