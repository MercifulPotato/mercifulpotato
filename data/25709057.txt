However, today the positions are reversed, it is faith in unreal outcomes that is asking for credibility at the same level as facts.<p>The people who stormed America&#x27;s highest houses were there because they believed that an election <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> fair. Nothing will convince them otherwise, no matter what the evidence.<p>This is the essence of faith, and exactly why free speech exists. To allow human beings to be governed by reason over unreason or emotion.<p>Secondly - we know for a fact, that emotion is the fastest way to co-opt logic. You can take a look at politics at home or around the world for evidence - wedge issues win, logic doesn&#x27;t.<p>If you aren&#x27;t going to exert a force to counter emotional manipulation, then your people <i>will</i> be emotionally manipulated. They will be manipulated the hardest, by those who find that certain facts don&#x27;t work for them.<p>Finally - Journalism is failing because of other reasons than trust. It was an unviable market a while back. Their last source of income was the classifieds, and craigslist alone put an end to that.<p>Journalism which is beholden to advertising will always have to compete with entertainment. Meaning that if its not more entertaining than a sports channel, advertising money will simply go elsewhere.<p>I can only see independent, government or public founded journalism as the solution.')
