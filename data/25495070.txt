It should be much better organized, the points she makes should be made clearer and it shouldn&#x27;t read like the rough first draft of a rant.<p>She should also include the excerpts of the judgement since they sided with her. If she was tasked with rewriting the text announcing Stallman&#x27;s departure and she produced something this bad, it&#x27;s no wonder it wasn&#x27;t published.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that there isn&#x27;t a problem, but in a story about an employee who was fired due to discrimination instead of incompetence, competence does matter and if her job had anything to do with communication then she does fail spectacularly at this job.<p>If, however, she was a software developer, then it&#x27;s another story and her complaint has probably more merit.')
