I\ncall this sort of thing Winchester Mystery House development.  It&#x27;s\namazing what you can get away with when you&#x27;re sitting in a fire-hydrant\nof money.  Entropy, gradients, etc., like radiotrophic fungi in a cracked\nreactor this codebase has burgeoned and now they have a tiger by the\ntail, a mutant three-headed tiger with laser eyes.<p>Anyway...<p>Imagining myself coming in as CTO or whatever, with the mandate to &quot;fix&quot;\nthe situation (is Instagram in any sort of trouble?  I don&#x27;t follow such\nthings.  The point is, maybe it isn&#x27;t broken by the metrics that IG cares\nabout.) ...this is what I&#x27;d do.<p>Since I don&#x27;t have a lot of data on the details of IG&#x27;s code (and I can&#x27;t\nbring myself to reread that horror story this early in the morning) I can\nonly speak in generalities.  The most important thing would be that\nthere&#x27;s a real mandate to &quot;get &#x27;er done&quot;, with that hypothetical\npostulated, I&#x27;d issue some top-level directives:<p>#1) Reduce LoC by 10% per month.<p>#2) 1&#x2F;5 of all coders are on <i>refactoring</i> duty, not features.<p>#3) Start counting the beans.  Track the <i>cost</i> of existing features to\nbe able to <i>predict</i> the cost of proposed features.<p>Not being a particularly original thinker, I&#x27;d lean heavily on prior art\ncribbed from the movie industry.
