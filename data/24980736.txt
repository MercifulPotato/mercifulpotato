I can use my Linux distribution package manager to install different SDK versions side by side (at the moment, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1) and the CLI tools automatically picks up the correct version for each solution. I find it superior to other languages like Rust&#x2F;Erlang&#x2F;Python where you need to use a tool that manages the SDKs outside of the distro package manager.')
