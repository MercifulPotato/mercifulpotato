So much so that I feel like the art&#x2F;science of aerodynamics in modeling has fallen by the wayside.<p>Your run of the mill quadcopter is an ideal example of just throwing together motors + batteries + tech and getting a flying machine out of it. It feels inelegant to me because if any of those systems fails, the entire vehicle drops like the non-fliyng-thing that it is. Even helicopters auto-gyro for a period of time after engine failure and can firefly &quot;fly&quot; to a quick landing.<p>If there is a continuum running from &quot;flying machine&quot; (like a glider) to &quot;rock&quot;, the &quot;wing suit&quot; seems laughably close to the rock end of the spectrum. Throwing electric motors at it.... &lt;&#x2F;rant&gt;<p>To expose my hypocrisy, I&#x27;m a huge fan of the lifting body program out of Dryden Flight Research Center (now Armstrong Flight Research Center) of the 1960&#x27;s.')
