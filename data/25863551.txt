This has been a long standing problem with Twitter. They&#x27;ve improved a bit, but there&#x27;s still problems.<p>Young people approach these platforms and say &quot;here are some images of child sexual abuse that you&#x27;re hosting. I know they&#x27;re CSE because I&#x27;m the subject of the photos and I was &lt;18 at the time&quot;. The platforms sometimes ignore them. Children are then stuck, not knowing how to get this &quot;child porn&quot;[1] taken down.<p>We need to help young people understand what routes are then available to them.<p>1) Write to the legal department. Twitter does not make this easy.

IWF will generate hashes of the images and Twitter will, eventually, use those hashes to remove the images.
