I don’t know everything but I did evaluate consumer tech for Underwriters Laboratories  to IEC 60950 and 62358. I think your caution is commendable but nothing you’ve described is inherently wrong. USB is just a connector. When the product said it needs 5w (I assume you mean 1A @ 4.8-5.1Vdc) by itself means nothing without more information.<p>One really obvious point, did the instructions say it’s a) dangerous with a power supply that can’t provide 1A or b) not&#x2F;less functional without the 1a supply? If they were not specific, I’m happy to easy your mind - it was the latter.')
