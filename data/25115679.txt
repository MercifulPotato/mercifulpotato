Very few Clinton emails were ever leaked or released.  The major leak people like to talk about was of John Podesta&#x27;s emails.  Podesta was a private employee of the Clinton campaign, he never worked at the state department.  And of course being the campaign manager, having his email be provided by a government agency would have been a huge campaign finance violation to begin with.')
