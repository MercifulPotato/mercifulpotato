Recently there was a discussion about mhz vs MHz after a new user posted  short question about a transmission heard in 6mhz band. One user answered his question while the rest argued over the use of millihertz vs megahertz when clearly the context was megahertz. A quick search of the forum showed less than 6 posts in 10 years of users inquiring about millihertz. Clearly the OP quickly typed mhz instead of MHz and then was chastised for it. Not a very good way to welcome people to the field.')
