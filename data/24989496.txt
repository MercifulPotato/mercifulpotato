Item(by='motohagiography', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604501319, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24988101, text='The EFF appears to concur with a previous comment I made on this topic:<p>&quot;EFF believes that the circumvention restrictions in DMCA section 1201, which prevent people from bypassing technological restrictions, are too broad.<p>DMCA 1201 is incredibly broad, apparently allowing rightsholders to legally harass any ‘trafficker’ in code that lets users re-take control of their devices from DRM locks,” EFF wrote recently.&quot;<p>This creates an unaccountable enforcement party who can harass &quot;targets&quot; on behalf of another unaccountable party. The way it is written, reddit would have to take down a selectively unpopular subreddit for providing technology that facilitates the trafficking of copyrighted images. Whose copyright? Who cares? One could inject a bunch of copyrighted material into sites and then use a DMCA notice against their upstream provider to shut them off - a pattern I would predict is likely to materialize in coming months. Write sideloaded apps for a community because an app store uses their policy against you? &quot;Circumvention!&quot; The opportunities for abuse are endless.<p>While teleological arguments are always a bit iffy, the final objective is to ensure that there can be no information or service on the internet that is outside not only U.S. subpoena, but that there can be no communities or networks of personal relationships that are not governed by legacy institutions. It is under the auspices of people being &quot;accountable,&quot; for their thoughts and beliefs, and yet without precision about to whom one is being held to account by.<p>To every establishment growth is the greatest threat of all, and the DMCA s1201 is effectively designed to suppress it. The good news is these blunt attacks are a forcing function for developing decentralized technologies, and every one of these creates a cohort of new hackers.')
