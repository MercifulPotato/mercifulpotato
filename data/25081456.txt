People who can&#x27;t be fed (because industry has collapsed) don&#x27;t just sit and die peacefully. Foraging is unlikely to work, since our natural ecosystems are not large enough to support large-ish human populations and would soon be destroyed by overuse (damage to them from the actual nuclear war being beside the point). A huge immigration crisis in the rest of the world could have its own highly disastrous consequences.<p>Finally, I wonder how bad the effects on reproductive health would be from the various radiation effects be? Humans who had trouble reproducing, with a much degraded medical system might face further downstream problems from that. Same thing with animal species, which might cause more food troubles.<p>Point is, there is significant survival trouble just from a violent collapse of civilisation, that estimating the probability of human survival is fairly impossible. Finally, if humanity becomes so critically weakened, even (by today&#x27;s standards) minor disasters might become extinction events.')
