As in started putting new money in in at or around the low, I think plenty of that happened.<p>Frankly I&#x27;m kicking myself for <i>not</i> doing as you say. I &#x27;thought myself very smart&#x27; by being aware of it over the new year, reading how bad it will be, thinking markets will tank, and sticking to my guns because &#x27;I won&#x27;t try to time the dip&#x27;. And then of course with a modest amount of new money in March thought &#x27;if I&#x27;d sold in January I&#x27;d definitely be pound cost averaging back in now, even if not piling back in, I&#x27;m an idiot for being &#x27;sensible&#x27;&#x27;.<p>If I had though I&#x27;d probably be thinking it&#x27;s crazy at the moment (or especially a week or two ago) and piling back out... Remains to be seen how well that would&#x27;ve gone.<p>I think really it&#x27;s all a good argument for separating &#x27;boring, don&#x27;t touch it, keep buying&#x27;, and &#x27;fun, dabble, hobby speculation&#x27;. Where the latter should be funded appropriately for what it is, a hobby.')
