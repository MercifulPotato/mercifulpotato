Item(by='craftinator', descendants=None, kids=[25834113], score=None, time=1611068862, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25832750, text='I work in the non-destructive testing industry, testing aerospace parts. We build CNC testing rigs fairly regularly, with x and y axes longer than 30 feet, and carry loads of &gt;1000 lbs. These need to be able to center on holes with diameters of &lt;1 mm, because that&#x27;s what we calibrate our equipment on.<p>The most reliable build setups we have are kevlar belts coupled with 16:1 reduced stepper motors, and decoupled encoders that index using constant pressure rack and pinions. Even pre-tensioned ball screws give us enough slop to be a problem without encoders, and kevlar belts are an order of magnitude cheaper; going with a reduced stepper vs a servo takes the cost down by half.')
