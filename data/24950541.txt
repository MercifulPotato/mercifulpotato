Item(by='perlgeek', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604143389, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24949807, text='&gt; Once you have a codebase in place, things are a whole lot easier. There are far fewer decisions to be made. Really you have little choice in how to do things as the current structure dictates your options.<p>You still have the choice to extend the current code, or build more code around it.<p>For example, you have a ticket system and are now tasked to build full-text search for it. You could try to do it within the existing code base, or to add an exteral search engine, sync that data to it, and build a shallow integration between the two.<p>That said, you are right in that deviating from the current philosophy of the code base is a big risk, and so a big decision to make.')
