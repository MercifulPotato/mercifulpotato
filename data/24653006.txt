Item(by='joshstrange', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601570217, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24652175, text='+1 for the TS3 Plus. I spent A LOT of time looking around at the dock&#x2F;hub state of affairs when I got my 2018 MBP 15&quot; because I wanted to drive 3-4 external monitors and wanted as few cables as possible. The CalDigit drives my 2 2K monitors (but can drive higher, at least 4K IIRC) via DisplayPort and then I plug in 1-2 other Thunderbolt 3 -&gt; DisplayPort (or HDMI for my older monitor).<p>From the hub (read: 1 TB3 cable plugged into my MBP) I get:<p>* Gigabit ethernet\n* PD to my laptop\n* 1 DisplayPort (which I use to drive 1 monitor)\n* Digital Optical (I don&#x27;t use it)\n* 1 TB3 port (which I use to drive the other monitor with a TB3-&gt;DP cable)\n* 1 USB-C 10Gbps port\n* 1 USB-C 5Gbps port\n* 5 USB3 5Gbps ports (old square style)\n* SD card reader\n* Headphones&#x2F;Mic output&#x2F;input<p>It is wonderful to plug in 1 cable and get my power for my laptop, internet, monitors, webcam, wired mouse&#x2F;keyboard, Lightning cable for iOS development, Micro-usb for Android development, external SSD for CCC backups, and label printer (and probably something else I&#x27;m forgetting). I just want to reiterate, all of that from ONE cable. It&#x27;s pretty amazing.<p>This is, by far, the best setup I&#x27;ve ever had and I have never had a problem with it in the 2+ years that I&#x27;ve been using it. I picked mine up for $299.99 and it&#x27;s worth every penny. I see it&#x27;s $250 on Amazon right now and if this thing died today I would (after a tiny bit of research) re-buy it immediately.<p>Here is the product page: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.caldigit.com&#x2F;ts3-plus&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.caldigit.com&#x2F;ts3-plus&#x2F;</a>')
