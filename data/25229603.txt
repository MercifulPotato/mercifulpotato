Sure, it will be a painful few decades, but we&#x27;ve already seen that shift.  Toronto used to be the cluster of high prices homes, now it&#x27;s spread all the way down to Hamilton.  That process will continue - people will purchase homes in lower cost areas and businesses won&#x27;t have much choice but to hire closer to those locations as well.<p>That&#x27;s of course ignoring the potential for some major housing correction in Canada which resets the clock somewhat.  It&#x27;s not like it hasn&#x27;t before.  I had family buy a home in a Toronto suburb in the 1980&#x27;s.  They sold at the peak in 1990 and the housing market crashed hard.  Prices didn&#x27;t recover until the mid-2000&#x27;s.')
