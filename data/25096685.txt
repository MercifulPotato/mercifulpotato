America weighs the question of &quot;what force should be used, where, when and for what purpose&quot; constantly.<p>America also has a &quot;warrior class&quot; in a few different ways of looking at it.<p>A) If you look at how America is, rather than America&#x27;s goal, there is a warrior class of sorts (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;10&#x2F;us&#x2F;military-enlistment.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;10&#x2F;us&#x2F;military-enlistment.ht...</a>). 30% of recruits have parents who served, 70% have a relative who served.<p>B) While the body of America military is nominally grafted from the same stock of the rest of the populace (see above for distortion), a significant portion the leadership of the military is absolutely a distinct beast. While yes, they are nominally just another citizen, they have part of a distinct culture (how could you not if you spent 10+ years in service of an institution) with a distinct way of seeing the world.<p>In both senses, it is worthwhile to consider that something &quot;like a warrior class&quot; exists, and that we should take its presence, its way of thinking and acting, and its implications seriously.')
