Presumably as technology progresses, their transmitters and receivers improve whereas the distance over which they communicate stays relatively constant and thus their output power should decrease. It&#x27;s also possible a more advanced civilization uses other communication methods, for example optical fiber might render satellite communications totally obsolete.<p>Further the 0.16% is the fraction of the galactic disk area, not stars. Also note that the 0.16% is the region we could sweep with a theoretical telescope that we might be able to build in the near future, not the region we&#x27;ve actually surveyed thus far.')
