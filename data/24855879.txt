(in AI) or simply keep learning by doing.<p>I tend to lean towards earning a degree and I do find it useful (in terms of getting structured knowledge that you do not need to put together yourself, making connections, finding a group of people interested in the same thing as you are, having the official &quot;paper&quot; to be able to officially prove your skill and so on).<p>I realize some of these arguments stem from my own background, since I have always had to legally be able to prove I am qualified for each skill I have (language skills, technical skills etc) - not in obtaining a job offer itself, but in applying for the visas and such.<p>However, there are plenty of arguments against it and I can see some of them as well: curricula is indeed &quot;prepared&quot; for you, but it might be relatively &quot;old&quot; or rigid, time might be wasted - I could spend those hours working and getting paid for it, same skills might be learned easily online and then getting a job in the field and so on.<p>Help me, HN! What is your stance on the subject and why?')
