Woke Twitter hasn&#x27;t produced any great thinkers, because the core concept discourages it. Conservative Twitter would be the same. In fact, modern conservatism seems to mostly be paranoia.<p>If I was going to make a social media platform (I know, this is YC... it&#x27;s not my sphere of interest but maybe it should be), I&#x27;d rate limit <i>everyone</i> to one post per day. I&#x27;d also ban short (&lt;500 words) posts. Lincoln needed 250 words, MLK 400, you&#x27;re not as good an orator as either of them and you can, and therefore should, provide citations in written media. Readers can freely highlight unsupported claims, and annotate - annotations need to be accepted by the author to be visible, but highlights do not.<p>Let&#x27;s encourage thought, research and yes, silence. Listen first, then only say things if they are worth taking a long time to say.<p>Making money off this is left as exercise to the reader.')
