I actually don&#x27;t know how Mozilla can beat Chrome.<p>Google has an extremely strong incentive to capture the web client market. Whatever Mozilla can do to make Firefox more popular, Google can outspend them by a factor 10 and do more, or better, or both.<p>I want Firefox to win but unfortunately I just don&#x27;t see a path for it. My mindset at the moment is &quot;I&#x27;m going to use Firefox for as long as it&#x27;s possible, and then I&#x27;ll find the least crappy Chromium fork available&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;ll take 6 months or 6 years to get to that point but I really don&#x27;t have faith in Mozilla righting the ship.')
