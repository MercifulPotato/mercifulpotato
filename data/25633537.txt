We should be in a terrible recession right now, but of course the government stepped in to prevent that from happening (mostly).<p>A functioning economy has a healthy level of financial inputs and outputs: you go to work, you spend X amount of your dollars on entertainment, food, home improvement etc. and you save Y amount.<p>The problem is when you shutter all of the businesses that just creates a massive surplus of money. That doesn&#x27;t even get into things like stimulus checks, PPP loans, etc. People don&#x27;t necessarily need more cash, people really need to produce more and start spending money again.<p>Too much economic input without enough output.<p>Needless to say the MicroStrategy investment was really smart and the author doesn&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s talking about. 51% attack? Really? So an individual actor is going to spin up computational power eclipsing the country of Switzerland just to take down bitcoin?')
