Media may provide a channel to carry a message to many people, but that channel can be used for good or for evil.<p>I think we are talking about converting influence over masses to personal gain (don’t know if GME guy did it intentionally or not, but it benefitted him), less about media (which itself may not become richer from this) and more about how some use it.
