Don’t they realize that some huge percentage of engineers and tech workers use their macs? That’s a whole segment that quite literally builds and runs all the platforms where macs are advertised or talked about...where is the “pro” MacBook targeted at that segment? With advanced virtualization, strong dev tools, whatever. You would buy so much loyalty and word of mouth from people who set the standard for technology. Heck, who actually write the standards of technology.')
