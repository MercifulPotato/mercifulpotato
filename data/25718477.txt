I never really liked them because it always bothered me why I was expected to follow the last instruction first, regardless of what it said.  Even if it said to ignore the previous instructions, I would only be following it once I reached it, which would mean all other instructions had been followed.  Nothing in the initial rules that said to read all instructions gave any indication that one should pick and choose which instructions to follow or that you should do them in reverse order.<p>Perhaps this was the moment when I first started the path to being a programmer.')
