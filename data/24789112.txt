There wasn&#x27;t a bleach couple. That was a form of chloroquine as an ingredient in fish tank cleaner. In some media, it was equated to (hydroxy)choloroquine as a medicinal drug even though this pharmaceutical drug has a high safety rating. Also, I don&#x27;t think anyone went to prison even though it&#x27;s assumed the engineer husband would have not knowingly drank poison. The wife also ingested some, but she survived.<p>In any case, the media can&#x27;t pretend they rely on arbiters of truth because there is bias all around. Trump&#x27;s statements on disinfectants were not as incendiary as some people made them out to be. Disinfectants can sometimes be used in the lungs or body, but this is a question for the medical field. The media speculated about poison control calls surging after Trump&#x27;s statements, but any small uptick seemed to already be present since people have resorted to rigorous use of disinfectants in the home going all the way back to March. Finally, with the focus on lockdowns and isolation, we&#x27;ve actually somewhat missed the point of the DHS briefing on disinfectants and UV decontamination. We were supposed to be looking for simple innovations that made going to places like the grocery store safer and more manageable, but I haven&#x27;t seen much progress in this area.')
