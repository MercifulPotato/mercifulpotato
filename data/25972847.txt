Look me up on a map: Waitati, Otago, Aotearoa.<p>The milky way is spray painted across the sky.  I wonder what you mean?  Is the light pollution in the cities far from you bad enough to obliterate that?<p>In a 200 mile radius of me there are probably not half a million people, concentrated in one direction, and a city of 120,000 fifteen miles away across a thousand foot high mountain.  Seems odd to me I can see it and you cannot.  Is it more visible in the Southern Hemisphere?<p>I go out most ever night.  If it is clear I look at the stars, usually one, at random.')
