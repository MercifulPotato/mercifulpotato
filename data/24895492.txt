It also runs Slack and a browser for zoom meetings as access to Jira&#x2F;Bugzilla web interface.<p>Oh, and RDP into XFCE on Ubuntu on the desktop that runs as a server.<p>Plus the server is cabled up to development platforms (serial ports, remote power, GPIO, JTAG, USB). So it cannot move, and even if it were a laptop, it could not move.<p>I don&#x27;t require the laptop to be upgradeable or powerful, it is just the UI into the rest of the system.<p>It currently sits here with the lid closed cabled to a 27 inch display.')
