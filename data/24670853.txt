You only need to leave a line break to signal to the parser that this needs further processing. Like this:<p>```\n&lt;Alert level=&quot;warning&quot; title=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;<p><pre><code>    **PUT&#x2F;DELETE** methods only apply to updating&#x2F;deleting issues.</code></pre>\nEvents in sentry are immutable and can only be deleted by deleting the whole issue.<p>&lt;&#x2F;Alert&gt;\n```<p>Which I really don&#x27;t find to be a deal breaker.<p>I stopped reading after that because I was hoping for a somewhat more informed opinion.<p>From my experience, build time&#x2F;build complexity is Gatsby&#x27;s achilles heel. But I&#x27;ve built some stuff that looking back I don&#x27;t think I could have done without Gatsby, as I came yo it being new to React.<p>It&#x27;s simple enough on the surface and as you dif deeper, there&#x27;s plenty of knobs to turn.<p>My one wish is if they&#x27;d let you bypass image processing in the development environment.\nApart from that, I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.')
