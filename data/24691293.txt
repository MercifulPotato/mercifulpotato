I&#x27;m guessing those other places have the same type of thing. Even if it&#x27;s a piece of paper posted next to the printer at a public library stating &quot;By using this printer you acknowledge that you are not printing or copying any material for which you do not have the right to copy.&quot;<p>To be sure, it&#x27;s a pretty loose contract and you could probably get away with printing a small amount of copyrighted material. But it at least shifts the liability onto the customer so the retailer can always point to the agreement and say &quot;hey, they said they weren&#x27;t printing anything illegally; that&#x27;s on them for lying.&quot;')
