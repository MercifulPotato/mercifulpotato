Item(by='ksml', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603391575, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24861338, text='That&#x27;s been one of the biggest challenges of this internship, since I&#x27;m so used to assuming that any bugs are problems with my code or some library I&#x27;m using. In general, I&#x27;ll first try to debug as I would normally debug my own code, but if inexplicable behavior keeps happening, I try to strip the code down to as small of an example as possible and then look at the compiler output. In some cases (e.g. bugs with LLVM), I can just try a different compiler and see if it works (e.g. nvcc), but ptxas is the only PTX assembler out there, so confirming ptxas bugs requires much more work.<p>Edit: another indicator is if something works at -O0 but breaks at higher optimization levels. That could be undefined behavior in your code, but it could also suggest a bug in the optimizer. Sometimes it&#x27;s helpful to fiddle with the code to figure out what causes the compiler to break. For example, with the ptxas bug, our code would work fine unless we had a long chain of function calls (even if the functions in the call chain weren&#x27;t doing anything interesting). That sounds more like a compiler bug than a logic error on our part. Sometimes, you can even figure out which specific pass of the optimizer is breaking the code; LLVM has a bisect tool that allows you to run optimization passes individually until you observe the output breaking.')
