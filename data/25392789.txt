They&#x27;re less lethal. They still kill people. They still maim people.<p>But since many people share your view - that they&#x27;re non-lethal and thus morally superior - these less lethal means are used frequently, and often inappropriately, when the use of force is not justified.<p>The parallel is clear: government funded and backed forces equipped with military gear, using military-developed weapons (chemical, sound, light, physical); some of which are restricted by international convention during war.<p>And there will be no trials to hold people accountable for mis-using these weapons; as pointed out in the article, the government is actively blocking such attempts.')
