Item(by='zhaphod', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603423296, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24852833, text='&gt;&gt;the reality is that they are gone continue to increase as Tesla delivers more vehicles they actually get more credits,<p>People completely miss this point (some deliberately so). At least in Europe, as each year progresses, the number of grams&#x2F;km allowed will keep going down. It is 95g&#x2F;km for this year. Thos who miss will have to pay a fine. FCA is pooling with Tesla to avoid this. Ford will miss due to fire hazard debacle. So on. Now even if the ICE makers are able to meet 95 gms&#x2F;kms now, next year it will become harder. ICE innovation is not fast enough to keep up with regulation. Only way to avoid fines is to accelerate the EV+ICE mix. Some will do this not all. And this will hit their profitability. They have huge sunk cost on ICE side. They can&#x27;t willy nilly junk that investment and move over to EVs. This mostly implies the legacy car makers will have to keep paying fines to EU or to pool with Tesla and subisidies the competitors growth. Win win for Tesla.')
