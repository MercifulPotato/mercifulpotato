Even function names remain intact in some cases, which I assume would not happen if they had a malicious intent like embedding a backdoor.<p>&gt; We need to promote our own opensource and free tools to our friends and family, we will get the last laugh.<p>Although I agree that there should be viable alternatives to available tools for online communication without the possibility of being eavesdropped, I can see why such things do not exist. It&#x27;d be too inconvenient for the law enforcement. And if you take things from the perspective of whether that thing makes the job of the law enforcement harder, you&#x27;d notice such things tend not to exist. As a principle, popular software should not have a means to prevent data going through the software from getting inspected by the law enforcement. Does Dropbox offer end-to-end encryption? Of course not. Is there a popular easy-to-use disk encryption software? There was TrueCrypt, which is gone for an obvious reason. Does Gmail implement end-to-end encryption for emails? Of course not...')
