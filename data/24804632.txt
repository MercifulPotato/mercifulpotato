Currently it looks that she can&#x27;t ever stop taking anti-estrogen drugs ever in her life even though it has lots of side effects.<p>My question is: most of the drugs fail at one of the trials with much more than 90% probability. What is the chance you give your drug to be succeeding, and how did you get failure rate probability under that 90%? Also what&#x27;s plan B?')
