I don&#x27;t believe in dogmatism, if you want to reduce the impact social media has on you, just <i>reduce</i> your usage. You don&#x27;t have to become a recluse and you won&#x27;t become a heretic for going to social media once in a while, if you make it a conscious choice.<p>Just like that if you want to eat less meat because of the environment, just eat less meat. If you eat selected meat once in a while on selected occasions this won&#x27;t make you a heretic, because you are still reaching your goal of reducing your impact on the environment etc.<p>The people who say &quot;if you want to reduce X you are a heretic if you don&#x27;t abstain 100% from using X&quot; are projecting their own lack of dicipline onto others â€” they feel they wouldn&#x27;t have the discipline to do it, but also realise it would  be good for them to have it. So they have to invent an excuse why this is a goal that cannot be reached, not worth reaching etc.<p>Being a free thinking and acting person fundamentally means also to notice when you are manipulating yourself by making your thinking fit the image you already have of the world. I for example often fall into the trap of &quot;if I can&#x27;t do it perfectly it might not be worth doing at all&quot;, and because I know that, I try to work against it.<p>So what your comment does here is undermining another people&#x27;s effort to be in control of their social media environment. Why you deem such an act necessary should be something you should know yourself.')
