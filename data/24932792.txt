Here&#x27;s the process:<p>1. I start by reaching out to people I know - bosses or teammates I&#x27;ve enjoyed working with, recruiters that have proved trustworthy and so on. People who now me and who have worked with me before know the value I bring, even though I don&#x27;t really excel in any one area. (Early on in my career, this wasn&#x27;t literally &quot;people I know,&quot; this would be more connections through my school.)<p>2. Since a lot of interview technical questions skew towards Stuff We Learn in University, I usually skim over my college and grad school text books. That way, if someone throws something at me that I haven&#x27;t really dealt with in 12 years, I can at least have enough freshness in my mind that I can problem solve through it.<p>3. I practice problems from a &quot;programming challenges&quot; book like the one by Skiena. I do some of these at a computer. However, since many companies do coding challenges on a whiteboard and these are timed, I try to recreate this by doing some coding problems with pencil and paper while timing myself. Whether or not it is a good idea for companies to do coding problems on a whiteboard is an interesting question, but in the course of a job search, but this is the world we live in. Writing programs while timed is particularly stressful, but by practicing beforehand I find I&#x27;m able to adapt to the stress better.<p>4. A lot of the value we provide (both as experienced engineers and as jack-of-all-trades) is best demonstrated through historical examples, and many companies ask about historical examples. So I make sure that I&#x27;ve gone through the important projects I&#x27;ve worked on in my career, and can talk about the situation I was in for the project, what I did, and what the result of the project was.<p>5. It&#x27;s hard to know who looks at what in an application submission, but for any company I apply to I write a cover letter explaining why my unique set of skills makes me a good fit for the particular role I&#x27;m applying for. As a hiring manager, I saw people clearly copy and paste other cover letters (e.g., I was in advertising and I&#x27;d get cover letters ending &quot;... and that&#x27;s why I want to work in finance&quot;). As an applicant, I write each of these from scratch, going through each item in the job description and saying something very brief about how that&#x27;s a thing I&#x27;ve done before. (Earlier in my career, I would use examples from undergrad and grad school.) I&#x27;ve generally had pretty good response rates with this strategy.<p>6. Across all steps, I work in as much as I comfortably can that as a jack of all trades the value I provide is not that I can implement solutions in the area I&#x27;m hired for soon after being hired (although, I can), it&#x27;s that I can handle the uncertainty that comes in many environments, and I can talk about examples where I&#x27;ve done this in the past. Some companies appreciate the value this brings, but some do not. The ones that don&#x27;t will probably under value you.<p>I hope it helps!')
