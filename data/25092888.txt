The public interest argument is:<p>1) Companies can make a lot of money skimming $1 each off of 100 million people.<p>2) Federal enforcement agencies don&#x27;t have time or energy for that. We can outsource that to private firms<p>3) Private law firms can file class action suits, and companies are forced into agreements where they pay damages AND often need to change behavior<p>It kinda sorta works too, in that companies stop doing the bad things. Lawyers collect the lion&#x27;s share of the money, but few consumers care about a $1 payout. Judges approve deals to make sure they&#x27;re equitable to the class.<p>It sorta doesn&#x27;t work, since settlements are negotiated by lawyers who don&#x27;t really care about anything other than getting paid. Few actually care about the class they&#x27;re representing. Judges are former lawyers, and part of the corrupt culture. So in many cases, the changes in behavior are less than one might hope for.')
