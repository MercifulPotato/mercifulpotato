Samsara, karma, reincarnation, Einstein&#x27;s theory that &quot;God doesn&#x27;t play dice&quot; all seem strangely possible as our understanding of reality advances. It is weirdly mechanical in its raw form but borderline &quot;pure **ing magic&quot;.<p>(I would also point out how the Western thought rejects all forms of non-objective, impossible-to-prove-therefore-nil ideas in pursuit of its theory that all we see is all we get. We attack all ideas that remotely challenge the religion that has become Science. Seems to be built upon shaky grounds as we seem to slowly approach a convergence of religion, spiritualism, quantum theory especially at a very high elite academic level. Ironically the only people in the scientific community I can have these conversations is also quantum physicists, and some molecular biologists.)<p>Very nice discussions today I am very satisfied with HN as normally this kind of talk gets the boot and hostile reactions from co-workers.')
