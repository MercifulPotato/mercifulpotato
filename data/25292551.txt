It&#x27;s impossible.<p>Fine, but I have yet to see decriminalization policies (in the US) actually result in less usage, only less incarceration.<p>You have to actually implement policies that solve the drug problem rather than ignore it. Many drugs are understandably bad ideas to opt-in for. If people are still using them, then they don&#x27;t truly believe this. If you simply decriminalize drugs without also implementing measures to educate on this point, you&#x27;re going to have a greater number of people who believe that using these drugs are a good idea.<p>When you have a nation of junkies, there are immeasurable costs and other consequences. And these consequences have further reach than the cartels.')
