I know what Rust is, but didn’t know what Bevy is. I didn’t find any links to it or a single sentence description of what it is in the first half or more of the post. Though I searched online and found what it is, it would’ve been nicer to have the article state it explicitly (especially since Bevy seems to be relatively new with release versions in 0.3.x).<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bevyengine.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bevyengine.org&#x2F;</a>')
