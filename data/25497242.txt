Instead, a company should allocate an interest in any in-the-money exit towards a pool that is distributed to employees on a rata share depending on duration of employment and period of employment. I&#x27;ve been working on an interesting formula for this that even rewards those who have left the company.<p>Most employees don&#x27;t need or want a share of the company. They want a share of the profits or proceeds from an exit.<p>For example, a company can allocate 20% of all in-the-money proceeds from an exit to the Employee Exit Share pool. An employee&#x27;s share of that Exit pool will be based on their employee-months worked divided by the total employee-months worked in the company, with every one year of employee months worked counting an additional time for the purposes of calculation. This thus rewards early employees and those who have worked for longer durations with a larger share.')
