Conservative-minded people that are happy with what they have find this childish. Emotional people feel that conservatives have some unfair advantage and try to attack them for it. The recent election is just a good indicator of the divide, since the conservative vs. emotional groups clearly have opposing opinions about it. The corporations are simply supporting the side that costs the less to them, it&#x27;s business and nothing personal.<p>I think conservative&#x2F;liberal and emotional&#x2F;stoic are orthogonal.  I think there&#x27;s a lot of mis-identification of other people who don&#x27;t match one on one or both of the spectrums with attribution of more difference than is warranted.<p>For instance I am liberal and left-leaning but I think my best efforts are spent working hard and advocating for people less fortunate than me who haven&#x27;t had the same opportunity that I have.<p>Privilege has given me a pretty easy life and not everyone gets the same chances.  You don&#x27;t have to participate in social change if you don&#x27;t want to, but at least don&#x27;t hold it back out of fear that we&#x27;ll destroy your prosperity.  As I understand economics the only way everyone succeeds is if we grow the economy as a whole.  That means giving people meaningful, well-paying jobs especially if they don&#x27;t have the ability or desire to find a way for themselves.  We can&#x27;t let people starve or die of easily curable disease and so the cost will be there regardless of whether a person is doing low-value work or high-value work.<p>Perhaps that is in a sense a mini-death of the American Dream?  That particular dream never existed for everyone anyway; factory workers, miners, farmhands, and other laborers were never assumed to be part of it.  That nature of production efficiency and capitol allocation requires a pyramid of workers, at least until automation takes over.  This is especially true during the rapid rise of the middle class in the 40s and 50s. However, it was generally assumed that every citizen could at least have a pretty good life.  If the economy starts to squeeze laborers into poverty then it&#x27;s broken and needs to be fixed.')
