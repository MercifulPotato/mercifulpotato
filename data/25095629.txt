I just say “Alexa, microwave at power level 5 for five minutes”, and it starts right up. Of course the first time I tried saying “Alexa, microwave at 50% power for five minutes” but Alexa helpfully said “you have to select a power level between 1 and 10”, so the UX was easy to grok and I haven’t messed it up after the first try.')
