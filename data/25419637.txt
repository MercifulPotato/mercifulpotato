Item(by='throwaway894345', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607964321, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25418919, text='I think it&#x27;s helpful to talk about &quot;bias issues&quot; specifically. When we talk about them in the abstract, they always seem to carry this boogeyman-ish quality, but when we talk about them as concrete instances, we can almost always (and rather easily) come up with concrete mitigations. For example, some people have rightly expressed concern about statistical models of criminality derived from law enforcement data, so we augment and weigh that data with other sources, such as victim surveys, hospital records, and so forth. Of course, that doesn&#x27;t eliminate all bias (we can never completely eliminate bias) but it&#x27;s a significant improvement, especially when the alternative to &quot;using a formal statistical model&quot; is &quot;using law enforcement officers&#x27; personal judgment&quot;. We can also make available certain information about the training data set and the methodology to provide an audit trail. Very rarely are these ethical issues really as insurmountable as critics seem to imply when they speak about &quot;biased algorithms&quot; in the abstract.')
