Item(by='mindslight', descendants=None, kids=[25498432], score=None, time=1608577426, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25497942, text='The problem is that we&#x27;ve taken on this hidden assumption that &quot;free market&quot; somehow means that a hospital can create an arbitrary bill for urgent care, and you have no choice but to pay it. That&#x27;s not really intrinsic to the free market paradigm, but rather an orthogonal corruption pushed via the legal system.<p>In a different thread I pushed the lack of a contract argument, and got back a more fitting legal theory that hospitals are allowed to charge you under the idea that you not paying would be &quot;unjust enrichment&quot; - they treated you, incurred expenses doing so, and therefore its your responsibility to compensate them. But that still doesn&#x27;t support them charging you some arbitrarily high price, rather just expecting to be reimbursed for their costs. And so such bills should actually be constrained by the <i>lowest</i> rate they have with contracted insurances.<p>As for the analogy, I&#x27;ve been pretty hangry to the point where I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to form a contract. It was also just a more straightforward example than the overall food market still functioning even though we&#x27;re all just three weeks away from starvation.')
