There are numerous other genre-specific sites that sell music, as well as Amazon, Google and others.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for everyone, but one of the challenges of this relatively open market is managing music bought from different stores. Who wants 5 apps to stream from all these places? Funkwhale is really designed with a more libre&#x2F;open source&#x2F;communal spirit, but happens to be excellent at doing this for individuals too.')
