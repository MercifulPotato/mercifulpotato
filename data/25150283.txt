I left the screen brightness on the default setting and usage was a mix of installing software (mostly I&#x2F;O i suppose), a lot of safari, around 4 hours of Citrix remote desktop, around 90 minutes of zoom, some light gaming last night to see if it works.<p>If you do anything that&#x27;s heavy on I&#x2F;O (packaging jar files in my case), this laptop is faster than my big desktop, the I&#x2F;O is crazy fast actually.<p>Memory pressure has been low so far - my biggest fear opting for the base model but looks like i&#x27;ll be fine - i spun up bunch of dev processes and was fine.')
