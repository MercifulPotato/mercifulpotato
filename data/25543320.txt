I&#x27;m struggling to find a secure communication medium.<p>Setting up PGP is annoying and also requires recipients to have it. \nEmails are clearly not private.\nWhatsapp, Messenger, Signal and Telegram are a bit personal (most require a phone number, and companies don&#x27;t provide phone numbers to all people). SMS&#x2F; phones are also not secure.\nLinkedIn premium is expensive monthly and doesn&#x27;t provide a good messaging UI.<p>Oh, the reason why I ask B2B specifically is because consumer products can communicate through their platforms where users already have accounts. Their either enmeshed in platforms or have their own platforms.')
