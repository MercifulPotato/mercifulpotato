I liked the idea of having a configuration file that describes the packages installed in the system. The first thing I did was use the CLI to install Firefox, then I found that it didn&#x27;t update my nix config, nor did there seem to be a CLI command to say &quot;install this and add it to my config&quot;.<p>Instead, it seemed that I had to manually update the nix config. Then, I had to learn the syntax of the language. Then when I figured out the basic, I added Firefox, but it required me to add some parameters (I don&#x27;t remember the specifics) but I couldn&#x27;t find any explanation about what those should be for the Firefox package.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t have tooling (or didn&#x27;t at the time) to update your nix config for you.<p>If they want to convert people over to their way of doing things they have to lower the barriers to entry substantially.')
