I just moved to Austin, looked at the market from 2012-2020, and what do you know almost every house I look at has <i>doubled</i> in value in 8 years. That&#x27;s a 9% annual return! Shouldn&#x27;t I get the biggest house I can afford since the city is growing so fast?<p>Well not so fast. I have to subtract from that about 3% for interest, 2.5% in property tax, 1% for maintenance. Not to mention HOAs, PMI, insurance, etc. I might end up making 2% annually compared to 7% in the stock market and that&#x27;s only <i>if</i> I see the same returns as the most cherry picked period I could possibly find. Anything less and I&#x27;m absolutely losing.<p>I agree on the you have to live somewhere part, but treating it like an investment seems like a bad bet.')
