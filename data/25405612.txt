The term conjures up the idea of someone going through a web page, painstakingly adding structured data to (partially) mirror the text on the page. That was never going to happen, and I agree with you that machine learning makes it even less likely to happen.<p>In my view, the semantic web is a set of interoperabilty standards for databases. If manufacturers and merchants publish data on products and prices it would be nice if they could do that in a way that lets us easily merge, repurpose and analyse that data.<p>The data is already structured and stored in databases. So no one needs to mark up anything. What they would have to do is create a mapping from their proprietary database schemas to a set published schemas.<p>In principle this is nothing new. We had structured data exchange formats for decades before the web even existed. What the semantic web standards add is a more formal way of specifying such data exchange formats.<p>Traditionally, each data exchange format was an island with no formal connections to other data exchange formats. The semantic web standards make it easier to combine data from different sources across different schemas because they allow us to formally describe how these different schemas are related.<p>Also, we need to consider what the role of machine learning should be. We have a lot of normative data that shouldn&#x27;t need to be approximated.<p>For instance, accounting rules should not be approximated with 96% accuracy by a 175 billion parameter neural network. These rules should be specified and interpretable with 100% accuracy on a 5 year old phone.<p>Similarly, what goes into a gadget is decided by the manufacturer. It&#x27;s not desirable to learn that information by extracting text from product descriptions on the web and applying huge NLP models. Sometimes that&#x27;s the only way we have, but it&#x27;s certainly not a desirable state of affairs.')
