I said programs that <i>do not work</i> without some other program, is, in my opinion, a derivative work.  I just don&#x27;t see how the calling mechanism even plays into that judgement.<p>I do agree that there are other licenses such as the AGPL that try to cover these cases.<p>And arguably the online thing is a whole different ball of wax, because you can talk about software using a service, etc.  It really is tricky in that case.<p>But I don&#x27;t see the reason to distinguish between calling a function via the C stdcall mechanism, vs. &quot;popen&quot; and capturing stdout.  It&#x27;s exactly the same, logically, the only difference are details that imho should not matter for the legal case.<p>Right now, if I release a GPL library, what stops someone from coming along and writing a CLI program that just wraps every function with some textual interface, and including that with their closed-source program?  The GPL becomes pretty toothless if it&#x27;s bypassed so easily.')
