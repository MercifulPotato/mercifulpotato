I upgraded the Ram and Hard Drive about 5 years ago and it&#x27;s still very capable for what I do. To be fair, the DVD drive died after just a couple years on it though and I didn&#x27;t really use it much.<p>But I don&#x27;t use Photoshop or almost any Apple software anymore (outside of the OS). I write code and I don&#x27;t need much horsepower for that.')
