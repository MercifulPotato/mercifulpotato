Item(by='javajosh', descendants=None, kids=[25671433], score=None, time=1610023900, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25670296, text='I very much dislike it when people see conflict and automatically assume symmetry. If someone pries open my car, pulls me out and starts beating me, and a cop comes over and sees &quot;a fight&quot; and arrests us both, is that fair?<p>In the same way, you say that there are two &quot;radical opinions&quot; about voter fraud. This is false. There is only one radical opinion. It is similar to a flat earther claiming that schools need to &quot;teach the controversy&quot;. No. They do not.<p>Regarding the current conflict, there is deep asymmetry here. Trump has been claiming election fraud <i>prior</i> to the election since he was elected. When the election finally happened, Trump had over 60 chances to show evidence. Hefiled and lost over 60 lawsuits, including ones in front of judges <i>he</i> appointed, and in front of <i>3</i> supreme court justices he nominated. They all took his claims seriously, looked at them, and rejected them. These were his own appointees. That&#x27;s where it should end.<p>To continue to believe that &quot;the election was stolen&quot; under these circumstances is <i>the only extreme view</i>. Trump, and his GOP&#x2F;Fox enablers, have been pushing this view as fact, and his followers have acted consistently, and violence has ensued. The violence, and the treason, falls squarely with them.<p>And if you have any doubt that Trump&#x27;s motive is about anything other than Trump wanting to keep power, then listen to that phone call to Georgia&#x27;s (Republican) Secretary of State.<p>But yes, I&#x27;m tired of hearing people say, when talking about Trump, that &quot;both sides are bad&quot; and &quot;all politicians suck&quot;. No. I get the desire to avoid conflict, but those statements are simply false. Trump has broken his oath to the constitution, repeatedly and egregiously, and his misdeeds have not been matched. There is no symmetry here, there is only a traitor-in-chief and his cronies.')
