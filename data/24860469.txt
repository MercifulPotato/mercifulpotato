In the strictest sense BEAM languages are not immutable, because message-passing is not state-safe, and there&#x27;s also the Process library (and NIFs), but practically they are.  Julia is also a very powerful FP language that isn&#x27;t immutable by default, and Swift is an OO-ish? is it OO? language that is pass-by-value by default.')
