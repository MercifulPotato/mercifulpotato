So N=2 or N=3, depending on how you wish to count that.<p>While I agree with the gist of some of your points, I always cringe when people leave the kinds of comments you have left here, starting with &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about not being a doctor - that&#x27;s a good thing!&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25014092" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25014092</a><p>My statement that I&#x27;m not a doctor is a statement of fact. It&#x27;s not an apology. It&#x27;s not an expression of low self esteem.<p>I have participated on HN for more than 11 years because the standards for discourse of scientific information here are high and that fact has helped literally save my life, which has made it worth my while to put up with drama swirling around me for a long list of reasons.<p>Over the years, I&#x27;ve been fortunate to have some folks with PhDs in various fields (including chemistry and biology) answer some of my questions and explain some critical details in layman&#x27;s terms to help me better understand cell function, among other things. Some of those folks were met via HN.<p>My gut reaction to people acting like I have self esteem problems and need my ego massaged because the HN crowd is capable of dishing out criticism just makes me go &quot;Please stop helping me&quot; which is an old TV Tropes entry that has since been disambiguated into two separate categories:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tvtropes.org&#x2F;pmwiki&#x2F;pmwiki.php&#x2F;Main&#x2F;StopHelpingMe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tvtropes.org&#x2F;pmwiki&#x2F;pmwiki.php&#x2F;Main&#x2F;StopHelpingMe</a>')
