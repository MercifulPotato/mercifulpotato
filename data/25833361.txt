There was no pressure to do anything in particular, so I cruised through school doing as little work as necessary. I took exams in maths, physics and chemistry (because I found those subjects easy) and got very good grades but ended up going to design&#x2F;art school because I thought it would be &quot;fun&quot; to be a graphic designer.<p>Then I slowly discovered how awful the graphic design industry is, and made a transition into tech. I taught myself to code at a youngish age so I have no idea why I never considered it as a career.<p>With hindsight I wish I&#x27;d had some pressure from my parents and gone to a &quot;proper&quot; university, studied something like computer science and really applied myself. I visited Cambridge after graduating and was blown away, I didn&#x27;t even know what an actual university looked like.<p>In some ways doing what I wanted meant taking the path of least resistance (it&#x27;s easy to pick the fun route), but ultimately led to disappointment career wise.')
