All of the preproduction boards that ever came in straight from the factory needed reworking, and being able to change things &#x27;as needed&#x27; was super useful. Having someone sitting in the next office over with an oscilloscope to help debug strange issues on a bus was useful.<p>Embedded is one of those fields where it really is an entire team with distinct, but overlapping, skills all working together. One of the MEs can do some EE, some of the EEs can code, some of the software engineers can do EE work and assembly, a few of the UI people know how to do assembly and C++, some of the C++ people know how to work with design and marketing, and if everyone works together a product ships out the door.<p>Could it be done remotely? Sure, but productivity would take a huge drop.')
