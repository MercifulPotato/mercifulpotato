Item(by='tailspin2019', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608893049, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25535621, text='&gt; Iâ€™ve often wondered how Apple manages to keep secrets across such a big organization.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with Apple extensively over the last 10 years or so, and what I see from the outside looking in is that they are quite a bureaucratic and very siloed organisation that appears much more &quot;typical&quot; compared to other similarly large organisations than you would assume from their shiny exterior.<p>Anyone who knows anything about large organisations knows how bad communication between departments&#x2F;divisions can be <i>by default</i>.  The phrase &quot;the left hand doesn&#x27;t know what the right hand is doing&quot; often applies here.<p>So for Apple, this plays somewhat into their hands.  The various parts of the organisation are heavily siloed, with strict controls on cross-communication and even global teams involved in say the roll-out following new product launches, only get to hear many of the details (sometimes <i>any</i> of the details) on the day of launch.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like the difference between Zero-Trust computing and the castle-and-moat paradigm.  Apple operates Zero-Trust on strategic details internally.  Each department&#x2F;division is firewalled off from others and communication is heavily managed, orchestrated and most importantly carefully <i>timed</i>, much like their public communication is.<p>This leads them to being very good at keeping secrets within the org.  The downside (as you would imagine) is that working with them can be quite a challenge.  And I imagine working for them is very tough if you&#x27;re at the outer edges and in one of the teams that are always &quot;the last to know&quot;.<p>Edit: typo')
