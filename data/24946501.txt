It was a polling error, which do happen, if rarely.   It was not unforseeable, and 538 included a probability of that happening which is why they gave Trump higher chances than most others did.<p>And 538 does do backtesting on elections back to 1972.   That&#x27;s not particularly trustworthy since it invites over-fitting, but internally they do have a little bit more than N=3 to work from.')
