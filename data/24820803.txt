Most of the time they don&#x27;t actually lie to do this, but the facts they include are very selectively chosen. So for example Boris Johnson&#x27;s Covid infection got a lot of attention since he&#x27;s seen as a kind of Trump analogue, but I don&#x27;t think others did so much.<p>(There was a really... interesting progression in the NYT&#x27;s coverage of the Covid-19 outbreak in Spain where they downplayed it as obviously less severe than say Florida, omitting the already much worse trajectory it was on, then when it finally and inevitably became too bad to ignore they turned that whole thing into an allegory for Trump&#x27;s failings too.)')
