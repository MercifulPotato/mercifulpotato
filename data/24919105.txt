Certain events in the US come first to mind when you mention it, but where I live there is practically no weapons readily available, even certain air rifles being regulated. You can&#x27;t even buy ammo without approval yet people still fear of being harmed from a &quot;crazy person&quot;. People equate any issue with aggression, delusions, dark secrets while in reality in most cases it&#x27;s more likely to be things like hypochondria, insomnia, family relations, coping with loss of loved ones etc.')
