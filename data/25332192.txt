What are you goal posts though? :)<p>Here&#x27;s my (hopefully charitable) reading of your argument:<p>1. Alternative theories of history are disingenious (sic) snake oil, because they&#x27;re based on weak circumstantial evidence. They use <i>flawed reasoning</i> to support <i>strawman interpretations</i> of the data.<p>2. To support this theory, you mention a video you saw (well, maybe saw…) of one guy X (Däniken) claiming something about Y (vessel batteries?).<p>Don&#x27;t you find the irony delicious?<p><i>All</i> theories were &quot;alternative&quot; at some point. Some stood the test of time and evidence; some didn&#x27;t (Gobekli Tepe embarrassed quite a few &quot;mainstream&quot; scientists in its time); some are in the academic weighing right now (the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis).')
