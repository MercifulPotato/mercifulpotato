Not any of reasons he gave at the time.<p>This is a definition of ulterior motive.<p>I&#x27;m not making a judgement whether he was right&#x2F;wrong by giving that advice (which the WHO did as well for the same reasons). Just pointing out that he did lie.<p>I personally don&#x27;t like being lied to by people that represent a lot of power (doesn&#x27;t matter what they&#x27;re motives are. Lying is used to deceive for ulterior motives). That is just an indicator that I can&#x27;t trust public facing scientists because the truth is not a priority, rather only the outcome that they desire (whether personally or as a group.) But that&#x27;s not new.')
