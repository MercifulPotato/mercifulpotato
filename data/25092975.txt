It gets a lot harder around 150k, at which point switch to current salary + 50-60k.<p>Make sure you know your minimum number. If at any point their offer is less than your minimum, simply walk away.<p>As a rule of thumb, always ask for at least 10% more than their initial offer -- even if you are happy with it (Unless they are matching a number you gave them -- which is part of why you don&#x27;t).\nRecruiting has already accounted for and expects negotiation in their offer. It&#x27;s their job to hope some sucker accepts a low ball.\nWorst case they say no, best case they say yes... and usually it&#x27;ll fall somewhere in between. Doesn&#x27;t hurt to ask; and in most cases, you&#x27;ll come out ahead. Just do it.<p>Signing bonuses can be a useful way to squeeze an extra 10% if they absolutely refuse to budge on the base. Some signing bonuses require you to pay them back if you leave before a certain time period. Don&#x27;t let this extend beyond the first year.<p>Stock options are worthless imo. They typically vest over 4 years and you don&#x27;t get anything until you&#x27;ve been there a year. Don&#x27;t let them compromise your base. Especially if the company isn&#x27;t publicly traded. If you do get them, treat them as a nice surprise bonus.')
