It wasn&#x27;t perfect (some crashes and weird behaviour), but worked remarkably well. I imagine it&#x27;s even better today.<p>It was really useful to have easy acces to the simulation code and datastructures from the notebook where I made the plots, and use the same language for both. Glad to see the project still going strong.')
