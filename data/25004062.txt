The DCs already have electric power on every dock to hook up the trailer&#x27;s refrigerator while parked. And DCs I know of here in Australia are being covered in solar panels because of their large foot print. The suppliers who deliver to the supermarket DC from their own DCs could do the same. Long distance are usually done with road trains (3+ trailers), using much more powerful trucks, and then the trailers are split up outside of the city area and completed by towing single trailers. So again you could use the electric vehicle to complete the last leg.<p>As someone else mentioned, if they are quieter than the diesel equivalent, you may be able to start delivering to supermarkets in areas where they have curfews on deliveries after a certain time because of the noise.')
