I wanted to make something like this too after Mixer shut down and I didn&#x27;t have good options anymore to stream low latency gameplay to friends. But I was too lazy to do it properly.<p>I ended up with this hack: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;jDeMxly.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;jDeMxly.png</a><p>Redirect the &quot;Record&quot; button of obs to make ffmpeg output to an http endpoint, which is a small server that just forwards any bytes it receives to connected consumers. They can then play it back with<p><pre><code>    ffplay -fflags nobuffer -flags low_delay -framedrop -strict experimental https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stream.server&#x2F;lawl\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ve found that most of the latency is actually coming from the player. I.e. VLC has way more latency, even if you tell it to not buffer. TCP is a bit of an issue since ffplay doesn&#x27;t speed up playback when it falls behind, but it mostly works and you can just restart ffplay if you fall behind too far. When it works (good network conditions) it also achieves sub second latency.<p>Will definitely have to give this a try over my hack.')
