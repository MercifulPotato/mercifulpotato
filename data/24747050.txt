High capital costs are no barrier to private financing <i>as long as the eventual profits will accrue to the investors</i>. But in this highly-regulated industry, investors can&#x27;t put money into nuclear plants thinking that in 20 years there will be a high demand, and they&#x27;ll be able to charge a high price for power. Once the time comes, the regulators will likely decide that they can charge only a &quot;fair&quot; price. And that&#x27;s assuming that they actually get to build and operate the plant - there&#x27;s a substantial chance that political winds will change, and the plant ends up being banned or regulated to the extent that it&#x27;s effectively banned. Government financing is the only solution to this problem, which is created by the existence of government.<p>We see the same thing in Canada now with pipeline construction - only government can finance them due to the government being capable of destroying any private company that tries to build them.')
