I feel like government bodies whose job is to deal with such things never want to &quot;solve&quot; a problem completely, but would rather &quot;manage&quot; it so they can keep their job.<p>Some day these few hundred pigs will be 10&#x27;s of thousands or more and they&#x27;ll look back and wonder why they didn&#x27;t put more effort in sooner.')
