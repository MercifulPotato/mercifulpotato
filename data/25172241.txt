The cost of maintaining features and systems varies so that having great enterprise support can be a non issue or a constant headache that you have little to no control over (Eg a system that takes a dependency on external data you canâ€™t control).<p>On top of pushing features out constantly, maintaining quality and automating everything you can, a startup can easily fall into building systems their staff have trouble maintaining without impacting output significantly as well as impacting mental health of their devs. I think the problem is that it is hard to see these costs up front as you can build systems these days on cloud providers where most of the time things will come back on their own without intervention, but obviously depends what impact being offline for 5 mins vs 3 hours has on the business.')
