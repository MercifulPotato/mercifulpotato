It does not refer to victims of abuse going on to further abuse others or their abuser.<p>This is something that research also backs up: victims of abuse are no more likely to turn around abuse others than people who did not experience abuse.<p>It&#x27;s an important distinction because the popular conception of what the &quot;cycle of abuse&quot; entails matches yours. That misconception leads to outcomes where victims of abuse are painted as abusers when they stand up for themselves or attempt to escape the abuse, and some are even prosecuted for domestic abuse after doing so, or after seeking help from law enforcement.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cycle_of_abuse" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cycle_of_abuse</a>')
