A chromebook, macbook, or really anything else will be accepted as &quot;alright, I guess I&#x27;m using this&quot;.<p>The desktop metaphor is quite stable as is the software. They will be, and arguably have been for ten years, broadly interchangeable.<p>Microsoft&#x27;s current positioning is like 1980s IBM. The mainframe strategy worked so long as the people running the business thought they needed mainframes. As they retired out, IBM had to go elsewhere for profits.<p>And I&#x27;d bet the farm Microsoft knows this. They&#x27;ve diversified into video games, source code management, cloud computing, etc seeing this future ahead.<p>Also this isn&#x27;t new for them. They&#x27;re replaying their strategy from 1975-~1990. They never had the better products, they won because they had the better strategy.<p>Office was a good cash cow, but it&#x27;s increasingly becoming a harder fit')
