It is not really possible to accomplish it with a DSL.<p>Another amusing property of Prolog is that a typical Prolog program can be run forward... and backward, i.e. it is possible to «ask» a question and receive an «answer», or if the «answer» is known, the program can arrive at a set of all possible «questions». Hence heavy Prolog use to build expert systems and alike.<p>Back in the days, we used to giggle that if the 42 answer was fed into a Prolog problem solver to arrive at a full and exhaustive set of questions about the meaning of life, the universe and stuff, that would instantly create a singularity at the point in time and space where the solver was run and henceforth result in a collapse of the universe unto itself.')
