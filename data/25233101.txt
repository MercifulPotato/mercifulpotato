And I&#x27;m not usually the one complaining about subscription based things or online-only things, but when it comes to <i>all of my collective information</i> that I&#x27;ve <i>painstakingly organized</i>, I&#x27;m really not into someone locking my memories behind a paywall.<p>I used to use DayOne as a journaling program until I realized the same thing: as soon as I stop paying, all those memories are gone, lost in time like tears in rain. Sure it is really nice and convenient software and the user experience is fantastic but if I stop paying, it&#x27;s all lost. If they raise their price higher than I want to pay, it&#x27;s all lost. If they go out of business or pivot or get sold or... it&#x27;s all lost.<p>I&#x27;m willing to take that risk... but I&#x27;m not willing to pay for the pleasure of taking that risk. I ended up just writing everything in Apple Notes that&#x27;s free on all my devices. Sure it&#x27;s the same risk, but at least I&#x27;m not paying $165&#x2F;year for something that can disappear whenever the founder gets bored.')
