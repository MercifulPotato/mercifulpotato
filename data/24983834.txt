Location&#x2F;site management, aka who owns&#x2F;manages the poles.   \n2. Operating the actual Networking&#x2F;Peering equipment, networking to the site with permission of #1.\n3. Consumer&#x2F;retail such as MVNO; direct-use in the case of large businesses, or value-add aggregation&#x2F;resale for intermediates.<p>For wired the way I&#x27;d split is is:\n1. Global networking&#x2F;peering.\n2. Regional networking&#x2F;peering.\n2. Last-mile equipment&#x2F;rights, servicing.\n3. Consumer&#x2F;retail, value-add etc.<p>The goal here being to reduce the barrier to entry for small players via horizontalization which increases competition but not draw too many hard lines so that players have some flexibility in organization and so that players in one level have the opportunity of punching through to an adjacent or skip level if it is being overpriced.')
