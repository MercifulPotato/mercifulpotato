All the &quot;wrong&quot; people out there don&#x27;t enter into it when I am reading news.

You don&#x27;t have to go back far to find folks on the left excited about the prospects for Venezuela. Now, it&#x27;s possible to find scapegoats, but it does explain <i>some</i> of the right-wing perspective on fake news.
