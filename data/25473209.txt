It is, in fact, much better than I expected.<p>I expected what came out in the end. Apple would <i>never</i> put up the amount of money and the promise to ditch Intel if they were not absolutely certain that they could actually beat Intel performance-wise <i>and</i> have a working Rosetta to keep &quot;old&quot; software running.<p>The writing was on the wall for a long time, iPhone and iPad processor power has been taking decent shots at moderately powerful PC hardware for years now - the key thing why Apple didn&#x27;t do it two years ago was software support and developer tooling, they wanted to avoid cloning the Windows RT fiasco which fizzled out because no one had working software and there was no translation layer.')
