No more than anywhere else, and there is more likely to be a gas station with a restaurant (pizza&#x2F;chicken whatever) in it than a restaurant at all. Small &#x27;town&#x27; down the road has one gas station and one cafe. The cafe is only open for lunch. So a lot of the old timers gather at the gas station where they can get a coffee, a snack, or even a chicken dinner, and sit and chat with friends.')
