Hindi has nothing to do with caste system. Hindi was promoted because of the need for a common language for a nation with 300+ official languages (not counting the dialects) - as it&#x27;s the language that is most commonly spoke and understood. It&#x27;s again absolutely nonsense about BJP&#x2F;RSS. In the recent times the only party that worked for the poor&#x2F;lower castes&#x2F;class is BJP. Most regional parties works for the dominant upper castes and congress further discriminated against the dalits&#x2F;STs during UPA2 with their legislations (and always been the party of upper castes + muslims and christians).')
