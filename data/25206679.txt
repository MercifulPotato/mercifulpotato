Deer populations prosper and tick spread also prospers along with them. Ticks multiply on deer. Mice and small bird populations also prosper. They&#x27;re reservoir species for Lyme but I fail to see the connection to wolves. Most likely also a smaller predator species like weasel, polecat, stoat, ferret, mink and wild cat are also driven into extrinction along with wolves and bears because of deforestation and habitat fragmentation. It&#x27;s really a very complex issue, but it kind of boils down to huge swaths of woods getting fragmented and cut down for agriculture, forestry, entertainment (ski resorts), residential use. Residential areas are also growing into the woods, triggering more interaction with big predators and driving them into extinction where they&#x27;re not already extinct (Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe).<p>So what would you rather have? A few sheep gone missing or the lurking danger of a debilitating, potentially life threatening condition carried by an insect the size of a needle pin?')
