Making the change is usually very difficult, as companies do not see &quot;demotion by the demoted&quot; as something normal.<p>A case I witnessed was a VP of Engineering who realized (after many years at that position, performing well) that he is more an engineer than a manager. His results were good but he did not like the work he was doing because his true talents were under-utilized.<p>He wanted to move to a position where he would have a more &quot;technical&quot; role, on the official &quot;technical ladder&quot; but it was very difficult for him to make his point. He liked the company very much though (in Europe).<p>I did not know what to really tell him at the time, I wish I had some good arguments for him to help his case.<p>One of the key things is that he did not want to change the company - he loved it, he loved what they did; he just took the wrong turn at some point.')
