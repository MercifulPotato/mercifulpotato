It&#x27;s a big massive bundle of fiber carrying different circuits for different carriers different places that were run in the same trench and all got cut at once.<p>Then they get to dig it out better and someone gets to get down in the hole and figure out which piece of fiber needs to be spliced to which other one.<p>Because of DWDM, some of those individual fibers may <i>each</i> be carrying 64 channels that in turn each carry 400gbit&#x2F;sec  for different providers&#x2F;services&#x2F;etc.')
