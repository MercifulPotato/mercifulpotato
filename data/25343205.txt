For instance, I would much rather have the OP use the strategy pattern. I have used it before, I will recognize it and it will take me tons of time when trying to understand the codebase and making a change that doesn&#x27;t break things.<p>We cannot find a global optimum, we have to decide if we prefer to make it easier for experts&#x2F;experienced developers or for beginners. I prefer the former and then teach beginners to become experts&#x2F;experienced (in some area) as quickly as possible. That costs resources but pays off in the end.<p>Google went the opposite way. They created Go to be beginner&#x27;s friendly but at the same time hurting productivity of more experienced developers. Let&#x27;s see how that turns out in the end.')
