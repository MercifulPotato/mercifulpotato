Item(by='megameter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605997104, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25168549, text='I admire the adherence to principle and depth of execution, however I find something about this incoherent.<p>Shaving off some aesthetic components of violence and positioning the work as anticapitalist does not address the core issue of every game project: <i>What does the game facilitate a study of?</i> That&#x27;s not a leading question or &quot;gotcha&quot;. It&#x27;s just the thing every game player will ask at some point: What is it about? What do you do?<p>I believe the most likely answer to that is that it&#x27;s primarily a technical study, and the game part of it is not exactly the focus, which is why the content of it is  directionless &quot;filler&quot;, opting to say less of the thing it emulates, but to on some level venerate it rather than critique it: it&#x27;s still a game about shooting stuff and...that&#x27;s it, it has nothing more to say, it doesn&#x27;t &quot;go&quot; somewhere. And it will stay stuck there so long as it stays within the subset of what the original game did. Which makes it, in some sense, incomplete as a work. A tech demo with a bit of game bolted on, call it what you may.<p>If we proceed further in the direction of staying within principle and do not halt at the point where something Doom-like is possible, all these other development opportunities come up that seem more coherent with the ideology at play:<p>* Mazes&#x2F;exploration gameplay(finding one&#x27;s way home)\n* Procedural landscapes&#x2F;dream simulator\n* Sports gameplay\n* Networked virtual worlds<p>The only problem, then, is the feeling that this would break with tradition, but that&#x27;s exactly it: it would be radical from a &quot;positive&quot; standpoint rather than a &quot;negative&quot; one to develop in a new direction.')
