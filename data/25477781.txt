It was total compensation (salary, bonus, annual stock grants).  I grew from 1&#x2F;3 of this 13 years ago though I changed employers several times.  Eventually the small raises &#x2F; bonuses &#x2F; stock grants kept piling up.<p>During this period for about 2 years I was an independent contractor and was at around $250k annually (could be higher, but you donâ€™t get paid for vacation, conferences or marketing&#x2F;sales efforts).<p>Building a small lifestyle business is another pathway to making a lot of money, though it too tends to take a few years.  I have friends that have built niche industry software apps that gives them about $1m-2m a year.  Enough to hire staff to keep things running.')
