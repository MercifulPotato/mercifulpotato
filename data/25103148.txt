I regret this. Like the vast majority of men, he never had a realistic chance of passing, especially since he did not start taking hormones until his mid-twenties. It was a sad delusion, and I was one of many who enabled it. For me, it was the path of least resistance: I didn&#x27;t want to lose my friend. I wish I had just told him my true feelings, because now he&#x27;s gone anyway.<p>My friend followed the classic progression. He had childhood trauma and was never successful with girls. He was depressed and anxious and bitter. Slowly, strangers on the internet with anime avatars sold him on the fantasy that transitioning could solve his problems. He fell for the meme. And I have no doubt that it did help, for a while. It gave him a community that constantly reassured him that he was doing the right thing. Coming out as trans was scary, but it made him feel brave and unique. It made him feel like he was finally reasserting some control over his life.<p>He had a decent shot at a normal life. Over time, his dating prospects would have improved. He might have had a family. I know that he would have made a good father. Now that future is gone forever. Because after the initial euphoria fades, grim reality sets in. No one showers you with praise anymore. The honeymoon is over, and the depression and anxiety are still there. There is nothing left to do but chase the dragon: FFS, VFS, SRS...each surgery gets you some attention and support again, but eventually there are no surgeries left to perform, and you have to face the prospect of living in <i>this</i> body for the rest of your life.<p>I&#x27;m sorry to be harsh. But I swore that I would never be complicit in this process again. It is a mark of a truly sick society, and our descendants will look upon it with a mixture of disgust and disbelief. I pray that you come to see your situation clearly before it is too late.')
