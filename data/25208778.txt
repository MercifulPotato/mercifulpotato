The theory held that epidemics were caused by miasma, emanating from rotting organic matter. Though miasma theory is typically associated with the spread of contagious diseases, some academics in the early nineteenth century suggested that the theory extended to other conditions as well, e.g. one could become obese by inhaling the odor of food.”</i><p>I think that’s an educated guess in the basis that this was a wide-spread theory, and fits the experiment performed.')
