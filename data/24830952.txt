I never truly understood why some people close to me would just dump random issues at me, repeatedly, and actively refuse any attempt at guiding the conversation towards a possible solution. I knew I was supposed to handle it by emphasizing and letting them vent out, but I never could quite understand the frame of mind that goes behind this talking to vent out...<p>...until recently, during one of such conversations, hearing about the same problem for the 10th time this month, it clicked: I realized that they&#x27;re doing the exact same thing I do with &quot;brain dump&quot; text files - up to the same phrasing, and &quot;melody&quot; of speech. Those people are just unloading their train of thought to sort it out, and the listener&#x27;s role is just to be there and pay attention.<p>(I say &quot;those people&quot; not as a negative, but only because I&#x27;m not like that; I think I&#x27;ve lost the ability to use talking to think when I learned to use a text editor for that purpose.)')
