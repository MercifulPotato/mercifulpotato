It stems from the 90s where color management was seen as something only &quot;pro&quot; applications would ever need to do, so it was okay to require a lot of effort from those few application developers to implement color management in their apps. The MacOS approach where applications tag their surfaces with one of a few standard color spaces and the system does the rest is less powerful in theory but, on the other hand, means that things will actually work. Plus, I think MacOS has escape hatches so that apps can do their own color management based on output device ICC profiles if they really want to.')
