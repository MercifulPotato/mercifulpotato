(I am currently happy to get ads for condos in St. Petersburg and banks in Cyprus, as I hope it shows Google has very little idea of who I really am, or at least just that I&#x27;m an unsought demographic?)<p>2) not true at all, compared to the tracking available from broadcast and free periodical advertising, which was how local businesses used to do it: in local media.<p>3) People genuinely find products they like all the time without ads, also.<p>4) Whole categories of businesses were introduced before FB ads as well. I know someone who got rich on selling copycat Uzi sealing rings as a teen fad, and that was before AOL and Google, let alone FB.<p>You probably don&#x27;t care about convincing me, but if you wished to, you&#x27;d have to somehow demonstrate that FB provides a great deal of additional value in return for all the additional information they collect.')
