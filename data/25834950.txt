Item(by='daemoon', descendants=None, kids=[25835121], score=None, time=1611073120, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25834702, text='&gt; Its inherent fragility means that transmission boosting ‘cell’ antennae are generally required every 100–300 m—which is far more spatially dense than the transmission masts required for older 2G, 3G and 4G technology, using lower frequency waves<p>I can see that it&#x27;s necessary to place 5G masts more densely in order to deliver the promised transmission rates and coverage but it seems like a bad solution to a greater problem. Assuming the trend continues one would need even more cells to deliver 6G, 7G etc. Are there no other ways of increasing the bandwidth without placing a mast at every city corner?')
