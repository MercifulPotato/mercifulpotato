While the previous arrangement of having to be independently wealthy excluded most people from getting into politics, it did mean that it wasn&#x27;t a career choice.  It was something you did after you gained wealth and experience, at the end of a career in an actual industry and most likely running a business or being a senior manager, or you were wealthy to begin with.  While the arrangement was not perfect by any means, it did mean that the politicians of that era were men of substance with a wealth of knowledge tempered by real-world experience.  Politicians who go into it as a career straight from university lack any serious real-world experience outside politics, and I&#x27;m afraid to say they aren&#x27;t up for the job.  Their heads are full of political ideals but they mean little to the rest of us who just want competence and level-headed decision making.<p>I think there&#x27;s a relatively straightforward and fair solution to the problem, and that is to require a certain amount of experience before being permitted to stand as a political candidate.  You could do this by having a minimum age limit (e.g. 35), or by having been employed or being an employer for a certain number of years e.g. 15.  This would ensure that the people representing us have gained a little understanding and experience of the world we live in and the real needs of the people they serve.  Right now, I feel politicians of all stripes are almost completely divorced from the rest of us, and the consequences of their actions.<p>I do feel it is somewhat foolish that any job in the real world, from management through to the lowliest worker requires years of experience, multiple qualifications and certifications, training and assessment.  But politicians require no independent assessment of their capabilities.  The ballot box is not a high enough bar when all the candidates are of low quality.')
