Item(by='TheOtherHobbes', descendants=None, kids=[24807715, 24804169], score=None, time=1602874059, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24803494, text='The story is more interesting, especially in the case of Wirecard.<p>The FT started questioning Wirecard&#x27;s accounts years ago, and Wirecard <i>and the German financial services regulator, BaFin</i> responded by... launching legal attacks on the FT, accusing the paper of colluding with short sellers.<p>The FT kept finding and printing more and more evidence, EY kept giving Wirecard audit cover, and BaFin kept up an aggressive defence... of Wirecard.<p>Then finally €1.9bn was found to be missing. The various &quot;evidence&quot; provided to EY to &quot;prove&quot; the money was real shouldn&#x27;t have fooled anyone who had even the most basic grasp of professional auditing. When the shares were in freefall, BaFin finally admitted that perhaps there was a problem.<p>Then EY&#x27;s CEO sent a letter to clients in which he said “Many people believe that the fraud at Wirecard should have been detected earlier and we fully understand that. <i>Even though we were successful in uncovering the fraud</i>, we regret that it was not uncovered sooner.”<p>The part in italics is simply a lie. EY did not uncover the fraud. The FT did. And in fact what finally killed Wirecard was an independent audit by another Big 4 member - KPMG - which was supposed to vindicate Wirecard, but actually found &quot;irregularities&quot; which Wirecard couldn&#x27;t explain.<p>So - what to conclude? It&#x27;s hard to avoid a cynical interpretation - that auditing at this level is basically PR with spreadsheets, intended to reassure investors that everything is fine, and not a serious effort to reveal financial irregularities.<p>It&#x27;s not just EY. KPMG, Deloitte, and PWC have all had issues of their own. The underlying problem is that these companies are hired by their clients to provide a clean bill of health, and if they&#x27;re too thorough they&#x27;re not hired again. So the incentives are - let&#x27;s say - heavily aligned against too much stringency.<p>The FT Wirecard story is well worth a read. The FT is (expensively) paywalled, but some of the reporting is free.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;284fb1ad-ddc0-45df-a075-0709b36868db" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;284fb1ad-ddc0-45df-a075-0709b3686...</a>')
