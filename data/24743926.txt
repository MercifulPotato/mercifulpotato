Massachusetts seems especially high as a percentage re nursing homes. I believe the national average is ~40%. So, absolutely, a priority should be to focus on nursing homes.<p>And that&#x27;s also part of my point - nursing homes were known to be extremely high risk from the very beginning - remember that outbreak in Washington. Despite that early warning, we still, by and large, failed to protect these smaller, super high risk communities. If we can&#x27;t even do that well, what chance do we have in protecting the much larger &quot;high risk but not super high risk&quot; populations?')
