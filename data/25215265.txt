Sadly we have managed to make a habit of that.  For example the &quot;death of English cricket&quot; - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;newsround&#x2F;23241494" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;newsround&#x2F;23241494</a> is why the Ashes exist.<p>Soccer is not grid iron, nor is it rugby but back in the day, defence could be quite a bit more robust than it is now.  Footie players are not built like the second row and if you happen to apply six studs (cleats I think for the left pondians) at speed to the side of someone&#x27;s knee then it will not end well.<p>If you look carefully, you will notice that Maradona doesn&#x27;t simply whizz around defenders: he completely humiliates our boys by finding space and making the ball go there with him.  The bloody thing is attached to his toe when he needs it to be so and then he simply flicks it into the net, almost as an afterthought.  He barely looks at it - he know where it is because he has told it to be there.<p>Genius.')
