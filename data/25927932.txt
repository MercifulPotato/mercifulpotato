I&#x27;ve worked at a news org in the past (admittedly much larger) and the engineering&#x2F;meta blogs were entirely separated from the main news section. Obviously it doesn&#x27;t make sense to reinvent your stack, but I&#x27;m surprised the surrounding site scaffolding isn&#x27;t at least distinct to show this isn&#x27;t primary news output.')
