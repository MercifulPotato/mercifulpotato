I&#x27;ve argued from the beginning that closing our eyes and ears to the problem isn&#x27;t an effective solution. Banning them from Reddit simply whisked them away to an even stronger self-reinforcing bubble.<p>It&#x27;s a powerful bubble, too. I checked in on thedonald.win at Thanksgiving, and they had a meme aimed directly at me: &quot;So glad you could come take some time off during your busy day to come make fun of us. You must be a real piece of work&quot; or something along those lines. I burst out laughing.<p>But the other side of it is valid too: People say that there&#x27;s no point in debating with folks who are &quot;True Believers,&quot; since it merely gives them credibility and legitimacy. It&#x27;s valid; I just don&#x27;t personally buy that. The way to change someone&#x27;s mind is to try to see things from their point of view, and really walk in their shoes, i.e. allow yourself the possibility of <i>you</i> changing <i>your</i> mind. At that point, it seems like both people are in the right mental space to be willing to change.<p>Tough problem all around. I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s any effective solutions, so maybe both sides banning each other and enjoying their respective bubbles is the best we can hope for, given human nature. I just try to take a positive view.<p>The country will likely settle down in a few months, so this too shall pass. It raises question marks about the next cycle, but at least it&#x27;s four years away.')
