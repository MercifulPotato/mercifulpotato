Grants are a means to an end, not an end in themselves (administrators feel different about this I will admit).<p>It has been proven that grant reviewers can’t agree amongst themselves what are the top 5% verses the top 10%. Having personally gone through the process as a reviewer I can identify the difference between a good and a bad grant, but I can’t with any reliability determine the difference between a top 5% and a top 10% grant. Once you get into the top 25% of grants the ranking gets very arbitrary. I might like one grant more than another purely because I like the area more, but my taste should not be the criteria on which grants are chosen.<p>The crazy thing is all of this is known by everyone involved in the grant process yet everyone continues on as though the system is working.')
