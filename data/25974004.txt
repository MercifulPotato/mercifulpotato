You mention BLM riots, which affected me a great deal; tens of millions in damages to my city, destruction of local landmarks, one of the teachers in my local school district was arrested for assaulting a state politician for recording them burning a police car, and to top it off, they smashed the pharmacy where I get my wife&#x27;s medicine, so she had to go without for a few days.  This isn&#x27;t some biased false reality&#x2F;folk wisdom.  This was my experience so when people tell me they were &quot;peaceful protests&quot; or the news says &quot;statistically, they were 99.99999999% peaceful&quot; but I look at what I saw with my own eyes, and also what was on TV in other cities... I can&#x27;t be convinced that they weren&#x27;t violent, destructive, and plainly, evil, no matter how much other people tell me what to think.')
