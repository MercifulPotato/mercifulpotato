For example the app I work on uses Mapbox APIs and CloudKit to store data. Transmit needs access to the network to do it&#x27;s job, which is akin to what you suggest.<p>It would be very tricky to audit these things. However it should be pretty straight forward to audit for the presence of libraries which are widely known to collect user data which I suspect is on the horizon.')
